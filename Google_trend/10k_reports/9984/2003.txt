                                                                 EXHIBIT 4.3(ii)

                                 FIRST AMENDMENT
                           TO NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This AMENDMENT TO NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "First Amendment"), dated as of
September ____, 1999, is made by and between BARNES GROUP INC, a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), and each of CIGNA PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE
COMPANY, CONNECTICUT GENERAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, CIGNA INSURANCE COMPANY,
LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA, and THE LINCOLN NATIONAL LIFE INSURANCE
(the "Holders").

                                   BACKGROUND

     A.   Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement (the "Note Agreement"), dated
as of December 1, 1995 between the Company and certain of the Holders the
Company issued and the Holders or their predecessors in interest purchased
Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) in aggregate principal amount of the
Company's 7.13% Notes due 12/5/05 (the "Notes").

     B.   The Company has requested that the Holders amend the Note Agreement so
as to permit the issuance of additional debt by a newly formed Canadian
subsidiary to facilitate a proposed corporate acquisition.

     C.   The Company and the Holders desire to enter into this First Amendment
to effectuate the above-mentioned amendment.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in order to induce the Holders to grant the amendment
specified below and in consideration of other good and valuable consideration
(the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged) the Company and
the Holders agree as follows:

1.   DEFINITIONS.

     All capitalized terms used, but not specifically defined, in this First
     Amendment have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Note
     Agreement.

2.   EFFECTIVE DATE.

     The provisions of Section 4 shall take effect on the first date on which
     all of the following conditions precedent have been and remain satisfied:

     (a)  Consenting Parties - Holders holding not less than sixty-six and
          two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) in aggregate principal amount of the
          Notes then outstanding (exclusive of Notes then owned by any one or
          more of the Company, any Subsidiaries and any affiliates) and the
          Company shall have duly authorized, executed and delivered this First
          Amendment;

                                                                          Page 1

     (b)  No Defaults - no Default or Event of Default exists after giving
          effect to the amendments set forth in Section 4;

     (c)  Payment of Fees and Expenses - the Company shall have paid the legal
          fees and disbursements of the Holders' in-house legal department
          allocable to this First Amendment; and

3.   TERMINATION OF AMENDMENT.

     The amendment set forth in Section 4 shall terminate and shall be null and
     void and of no force and effect if any written materials furnished in
     connection with this First Amendment shall have been false or misleading in
     any material respect when made.

4.   AMENDMENTS.

     Section 7.7(i) of the Note Agreement shall be amended and restated in its
             entirety as follows:

     "(i) the total Indebtedness of the Company's Subsidiaries shall not at any
             time exceed $100 million;"

5.   EFFECT OF AGREEMENT.

     Except as expressly provided in this First Amendment, the Note Agreement
     and all documents and instruments executed in connection with, or
     contemplated by, the Note Agreement shall remain in full force and effect,
     without modification or amendment. This First Amendment shall be binding
     upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the successors and assigns of the
     parties hereto and the holders from time to time of the Notes.

6.   DUPLICATE ORIGINALS: EXECUTION IN COUNTERPART.

     Two or more duplicate originals of this First Amendment may be signed by
     the parties, each of which shall be an original but all of which together
     shall constitute one and the same instrument. This First Amendment may be
     executed in one or more counterparts and shall be effective when at least
     one counterpart shall have been executed by each party to this First
     Amendment and each set of counterparts which, collectively, show execution
     by each such party to this First Amendment shall constitute one duplicate
     original.

                                                                          Page 2

                                     ISDA(R)

                  International Swap Dealers Association, Inc.

                                MASTER AGREEMENT

                           dated as of August 19, 2002

              SUNTRUST BANK            and          BARNES GROUP INC.
                 Party A                                Party B

have entered and/or anticipate entering into one or more transactions (each a
"Transaction") that are or will be governed by this Master Agreement, which
includes the schedule (the "Schedule"), and the documents and other confirming
evidence (each a "Confirmation") exchanged between the parties confirming those
Transactions.

Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:--

1.      INTERPRETATION

(a)     Definitions. The terms defined in Section 14 and in the Schedule will
have the meanings therein specified for the purpose of this Master Agreement.

(b)     Inconsistency. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions
of the Schedule and the other provisions of this Master Agreement, the Schedule
will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of any
Confirmation and this Master Agreement (including the Schedule), such
Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant Transaction.

(c)     Single Agreement. All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the
fact that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement
between the parties (collectively referred to as this "Agreement"), and the
parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.

2.      OBLIGATIONS

(a)     General Conditions.

        (i) Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each
        Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of this
        Agreement.

        (ii) Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for
        value on that date in the place of the account specified in the relevant
        Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, in freely
        transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in the
        required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other than
        by payment), such delivery will be made for receipt on the due date in
        the manner customary for the relevant obligation unless otherwise
        specified in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.

        (iii) Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to
        (1) the condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event
        of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is
        continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date
        in respect of the relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively
        designated and (3) each other applicable condition precedent specified
        in this Agreement.

(b)     Change of Account. Either party may change its account for receiving a
payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local
Business Days prior to the scheduled date for the payment or delivery to which
such change applies unless such other party gives timely notice of a reasonable
objection to such change.

(c)     Netting. If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable:--

        (i)     in the same currency; and

        (ii)    in respect of the same Transaction,

by each party to the other, then, on such date, each party's obligation to make
payment of any such amount will be automatically satisfied and discharged and,
if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one party
exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other
party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by whom the larger aggregate
amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess of the
larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.

The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount
will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the
same currency in respect of such Transactions, regardless of whether such
amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be made
in the Schedule or a Confirmation by specifying that subparagraph (ii) above
will not apply to the Transactions identified as being subject to the election,
together with the starting date (in which case subparagraph (ii) above will not,
or will cease to, apply to such Transactions from such date). This election may
be made separately for different groups of Transactions and will apply
separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties make and receive
payments or deliveries.

(d)     Deduction or Withholding for Tax.

        (i)     Gross-Up. All payments under this Agreement will be made without
        any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such
        deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified
        by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in
        effect. If a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party
        ("X") will:--

                (1) promptly notify the other party ("Y") of such requirement;

                (2) pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to
                be deducted or withheld (including the full amount required to
                be deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to
                Y under this Section 2(d)) promptly upon the earlier of
                determining that such deduction or withholding is required or
                receiving notice that such amount has been assessed against Y;

                (3) promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a certified
                copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y,
                evidencing such payment to such authorities; and

                (4) if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition
                to the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this
                Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that
                the net amount actually received by Y (free and clear of
                Indemnifiable Taxes, whether assessed against X or Y) will equal
                the full amount Y would have received had no such deduction or
                withholding been required. However, X will not be required to
                pay any additional amount to Y to the extent that it would not
                be required to be paid but for:--

                    (A) the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement
                    contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or

                    (B) the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to
                    Section 3(f) to be accurate and true unless such failure
                    would not have occurred but for (I) any action taken by a
                    taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent
                    jurisdiction, on or after the date on which a Transaction is
                    entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or
                    brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (II) a
                    Change in Tax Law.

                                        2                           ISDA(R) 1992

<PAGE>

        (ii)    Liability. If:--

                (1) X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the
                practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, to make
                any deduction or withholding in respect of which X would not be
                required to pay an additional amount to Y under Section
                2(d)(i)(4);

                (2) X does not so deduct or withhold; and

                (3) a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly
                against X,

        then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the
        liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the amount
        of such liability (including any related liability for interest, but
        including any related liability for penalties only if Y has failed to
        comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i),
        4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).

(e)     Default Interest; Other Amounts. Prior to the occurrence or effective
designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction,
a party that defaults in the performance of any payment obligation will, to the
extent permitted by law and subject to Section 6(c), be required to pay interest
(before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount to the other party on
demand in the same currency as such overdue amount, for the period from (and
including) the original due date for payment to (but excluding) the date of
actual payment, at the Default Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the
basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. If, prior to
the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date in respect
of the relevant Transaction, a party defaults in the performance of any
obligation required to be settled by delivery, it will compensate the other
party on demand if and to the extent provided for in the relevant Confirmation
or elsewhere in this Agreement.

3.      REPRESENTATIONS

Each party represents to the other party (which representations will be deemed
to be repeated by each party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into
and, in the case of the representations in Section 3(f), at all times until the
termination of this Agreement) that:--

(a)     Basic Representations.

        (i)     Status. It is duly organized and validly existing under the laws
        of the jurisdiction of its organisation or incorporation and, if
        relevant under such laws, in good standing;

        (ii)    Powers. It has the power to execute this Agreement and any other
        documentation relating to this Agreement to which it is a party, to
        deliver this Agreement and any other documentation relating to this
        Agreement that it is required by this Agreement to deliver and to
        perform its obligations under this Agreement and any obligations it has
        under any Credit Support Document to which it is a party and has taken
        all necessary action to authorise such execution, delivery and
        performance;

        (iii)   No Violation or Conflict. Such execution, delivery and
        performance do not violate or conflict with any law applicable to it,
        any provision of its constitutional documents, any order or judgment of
        any court or other agency of government applicable to it or any of its
        assets or any contractual restriction binding on or affecting it or any
        of its assets;

        (iv)    Consents. All governmental and other consents that are required
        to have been obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any Credit
        Support Document to which it is a party have been obtained and are in
        full force and effect and all conditions of any such consents have been
        complied with; and

        (v)     Obligations Binding. Its obligations under this Agreement and
        any Credit Support Document to which it is a party constitute its legal,
        valid and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their
        respective terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganisation,
        insolvency, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
        generally and subject, as to enforceability, to equitable principles of
        general application (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
        proceeding in equity or at law)).

                                        3                           ISDA(R) 1992

<PAGE>

(b)     Absence of Certain Events. No Event of Default or Potential Event of
Default or, to its knowledge, Termination Event with respect to it has occurred
and is continuing and no such event or circumstance would occur as a result of
its entering into or performing its obligations under this Agreement or any
Credit Support Document to which it is a party.

(c)     Absence of Litigation. There is not pending or, to its knowledge,
threatened against it or any of its Affiliates any action, suit or proceeding at
law or in equity or before any court, tribunal, governmental body, agency or
official or any arbitrator that is likely to affect the legality, validity or
enforceability against it of this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to
which it is a party or its ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or such Credit Support Document.

(d)     Accuracy of Specified Information. All applicable information that is
furnished in writing by or on behalf of it to the other party and is identified
for the purpose of this Section 3(d) in the Schedule is, as of the date of the
information, true, accurate and complete in every material respect.

(e)     Payer Tax Representation. Each representation specified in the Schedule
as being made by it for the purpose of this Section 3(e) is accurate and true.

(f)     Payee Tax Representations. Each representation specified in the Schedule
as being made by it for the purpose of this Section 3(f) is accurate and true.

4.      AGREEMENTS

Each party agrees with the other that, so long as either party has or may have
any obligation under this Agreement or under any Credit Support Document to
which it is a party:--

(a)     Furnish Specified Information. It will deliver to the other party or, in
certain cases under subparagraph (iii) below, to such government or taxing
authority as the other party reasonably directs:--

        (i)     any forms, documents or certificates relating to taxation
        specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation;

        (ii)    any other documents specified in the Schedule or any
        Confirmation; and

        (iii)   upon reasonable demand by such other party, any form or document
        that may be required or reasonably requested in writing in order to
        allow such other party or its Credit Support Provider to make a payment
        under this Agreement or any applicable Credit Support Document without
        any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax or with such
        deduction or withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the completion,
        execution or submission of such form or document would not materially
        prejudice the legal or commercial position of the party in receipt of
        such demand), with any such form or document to be accurate and
        completed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to such other party and to
        be executed and to be delivered with any reasonably required
        certification,

in each case by the date specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation or, if
none is specified, as soon as reasonably practicable.

(b)     Maintain Authorisations. It will use all reasonable efforts to maintain
in full force and effect all consents of any governmental or other authority
that are required to be obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any
Credit Support Document to which it is a party and will use all reasonable
efforts to obtain any that may become necessary in the future.

(c)     Comply with Laws. It will comply in all material respects with all
applicable laws and orders to which it may be subject if failure so to comply
would materially impair its ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.

(d)     Tax Agreement. It will give notice of any failure of a representation
made by it under Section 3(f) to be accurate and true promptly upon learning of
such failure.

                                        4                           ISDA(R) 1992

<PAGE>

(e)     Payment of Stamp Tax. Subject to Section 11, it will pay any Stamp Tax
levied or imposed upon it or in respect of its execution or performance of this
Agreement by a jurisdiction in which it is incorporated, organized, managed and
controlled, or considered to have its seat, or in which a branch or office
through which it is acting for the purpose of this Agreement is located ("Stamp
Tax Jurisdiction") and will indemnify the other party against any Stamp Tax
levied or imposed upon the other party or in respect of the other party's
execution or performance of this Agreement by any such Stamp Tax Jurisdiction
which is not also a Stamp Tax Jurisdiction with respect to the other party.

5.      EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND TERMINATION EVENTS

(a)     Events of Default. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party
or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified
Entity of such party of any of the following events constitutes an event of
default (an "Event of Default") with respect to such party:--

        (i)     Failure to Pay or Deliver. Failure by the party to make, when
        due, any payment under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i)
        or 2(e) required to be made by it if such failure is not remedied on or
        before the third Local Business Day after notice of such failure is
        given to the party;

        (ii)    Breach of Agreement. Failure by the party to comply with or
        perform any agreement or obligation (other than an obligation to make
        any payment under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or
        2(e) or to give notice of a Termination Event or any agreement or
        obligation under Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)) to be complied with
        or performed by the party in accordance with this Agreement if such
        failure is not remedied on or before the thirtieth day after notice of
        such failure is given to the party;

        (iii)   Credit Support Default.

                (1) Failure by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such
                party to comply with or perform any agreement or obligation to
                be complied with or performed by it in accordance with any
                Credit Support Document if such failure is continuing after any
                applicable grace period has elapsed;

                (2) the expiration or termination of such Credit Support
                Document or the failing or ceasing of such Credit Support
                Document to be in full force and effect for the purpose of this
                Agreement (in either case other than in accordance with its
                terms) prior to the satisfaction of all obligations of such
                party under each Transaction to which such Credit Support
                Document relates without the written consent of the other party;
                or

                (3) the party or such Credit Support Provider disaffirms,
                disclaims, repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, or
                challenges the validity of, such Credit Support Document;

        (iv)    Misrepresentation. A representation (other than a representation
        under Section 3(e) or (f)) made or repeated or deemed to have been made
        or repeated by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party in
        this Agreement or any Credit Support Document proves to have been
        incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or repeated or
        deemed to have been made or repeated;

        (v)     Default under Specified Transaction. The party, any Credit
        Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of
        such party (1) defaults under a Specified Transaction and, after giving
        effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period, there
        occurs a liquidation of, an acceleration of obligations under, or an
        early termination of, that Specified Transaction, (2) defaults, after
        giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period, in
        making any payment or delivery due on the last payment, delivery or
        exchange date of, or any payment on early termination of, a Specified
        Transaction (or such default continues for at least three Local Business
        Days if there is no applicable notice requirement or grace period) or
        (3) disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or rejects in whole or in part, a
        Specified Transaction (or such action is taken by any person or entity
        appointed or empowered to operate it or act on its behalf);

        (vi)    Cross Default. If "Cross Default" is specified in the Schedule
        as applying to the party, the occurrence or existence of (1) a default,
        event of default or other similar condition or event (however

                                        5                           ISDA(R) 1992

<PAGE>

        described) in respect of such party, any Credit Support Provider of such
        party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party under one or more
        agreements or instruments relating to Specified Indebtedness of any of
        them (individually or collectively) in an aggregate amount of not less
        than the applicable Threshold Amount (as specified in the Schedule)
        which has resulted in such Specified Indebtedness becoming, or becoming
        capable at such time of being declared, due and payable under such
        agreements or instruments, before it would otherwise have been due and
        payable or (2) a default by such party, such Credit Support Provider or
        such Specified Entity (individually or collectively) in making one or
        more payments on the due date thereof in an aggregate amount of not less
        than the applicable Threshold Amount under such agreements or
        instruments (after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or
        grace period);

        (vii)   Bankruptcy. The party, any Credit Support Provider of such party
        or any applicable Specified Entity of such party:--

                (1) is dissolved (other than pursuant to a consolidation,
                amalgamation or merger); (2) becomes insolvent or is unable to
                pay its debts or fails or admits in writing its inability
                generally to pay its debts as they become due; (3) makes a
                general assignment, arrangement or composition with or for the
                benefit of its creditors; (4) institutes or has instituted
                against it a proceeding seeking a judgment of insolvency or
                bankruptcy or any other relief under any bankruptcy or
                insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors' rights,
                or a petition is presented for its winding-up or liquidation,
                and, in the case of any such proceeding or petition instituted
                or presented against it, such proceeding or petition (A) results
                in a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or the entry of an
                order for relief or the making of an order for its winding-up or
                liquidation or (B) is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or
                restrained in each case within 30 days of the institution or
                presentation thereof; (5) has a resolution passed for its
                winding-up, official management or liquidation (other than
                pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (6) seeks
                or becomes subject to the appointment of an administrator,
                provisional liquidator, conservator, receiver, trustee,
                custodian or other similar official for it or for all or
                substantially all its assets; (7) has a secured party take
                possession of all or substantially all its assets or has a
                distress, execution, attachment, sequestration or other legal
                process levied, enforced or sued on or against all or
                substantially all its assets and such secured party maintains
                possession, or any such process is not dismissed, discharged,
                stayed or restrained, in each case within 30 days thereafter:
                (8) causes or is subject to any event with respect to it which,
                under the applicable laws of any jurisdiction, has an analogous
                effect to any of the events specified in clauses (1) to (7)
                (inclusive); or (9) takes any action in furtherance of, or
                indicating its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any
                of the foregoing acts; or

        (viii)  Merger Without Assumption. The party or any Credit Support
        Provider of such party consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with
        or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets to, another
        entity and, at the time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or
        transfer:--

                (1) the resulting, surviving or transferee entity fails to
                assume all the obligations of such party or such Credit Support
                Provider under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to
                which it or its predecessor was a party by operation of law or
                pursuant to an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the other
                party to this Agreement; or

                (2) the benefits of any Credit Support Document fail to extend
                (without the consent of the other party) to the performance by
                such resulting, surviving or transferee entity of its
                obligations under this Agreement.

(b)     Termination Events. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party
or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified
Entity of such party of any event specified below constitutes an Illegality if
the event is specified in (i) below, a Tax Event if the event is specified in
(ii) below or a Tax Event Upon Merger if the event is specified in (iii) below,
and, if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event Upon Merger

                                        6                           ISDA(R) 1992

<PAGE>

if the event is specified pursuant to (iv) below or an Additional Termination
Event if the event is specified pursuant to (v) below:--

        (i)     Illegality. Due to the adoption of, or any change in, any
        applicable law after the date on which a Transaction is entered into, or
        due to the promulgation of, or any change in, the interpretation by any
        court, tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of
        any applicable law after such date, it becomes unlawful (other than as a
        result of a breach by the party of Section 4(b)) for such party (which
        will be the Affected Party):--

                (1) to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a
                payment or delivery or to receive a payment or delivery in
                respect of such Transaction or to comply with any other material
                provision of this Agreement relating to such Transaction; or

                (2) to perform, or for any Credit Support Provider of such party
                to perform, any contingent or other obligation which the party
                (or such Credit Support Provider) has under any Credit Support
                Document relating to such Transaction;

        (ii)    Tax Event. Due to (x) any action taken by a taxing authority, or
        brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on
        which a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action
        is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (y) a
        Change in Tax Law, the party (which will be the Affected Party) will, or
        there is a substantial likelihood that it will, on the next succeeding
        Scheduled Payment Date (1) be required to pay to the other party an
        additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section
        2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii)
        or 6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount is required to be
        deducted or withheld for or on account of a Tax (except in respect of
        interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) and no additional amount
        is required to be paid in respect of such Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4)
        (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B));

        (iii)   Tax Event Upon Merger. The party (the "Burdened Party") on the
        next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date will either (1) be required to
        pay an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under
        Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e),
        6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount has been
        deducted or withheld for or on account of any Indemnifiable Tax in
        respect of which the other party is not required to pay an additional
        amount (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)), in either
        case as a result of a party consolidating or amalgamating with, or
        merging with or into, or transferring all or substantially all its
        assets to, another entity (which will be the Affected Party) where such
        action does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii);

        (iv)    Credit Event Upon Merger. If "Credit Event Upon Merger" is
        specified in the Schedule as applying to the party, such party ("X"),
        any Credit Support Provider of X or any applicable Specified Entity of X
        consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers
        all or substantially all its assets to, another entity and such action
        does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii) but the
        creditworthiness of the resulting, surviving or transferee entity is
        materially weaker than that of X, such Credit Support Provider or such
        Specified Entity, as the case may be, immediately prior to such action
        (and, in such event, X or its successor or transferee, as appropriate,
        will be the Affected Party); or

        (v)     Additional Termination Event. If any "Additional Termination
        Event" is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the
        occurrence of such event (and, in such event, the Affected Party or
        Affected Parties shall be as specified for such Additional Termination
        Event in the Schedule or such Confirmation).

(c)     Event of Default and Illegality. If an event or circumstance which would
otherwise constitute or give rise to an Event of Default also constitutes an
Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality and will not constitute an Event
of Default.

                                        7                           ISDA(R) 1992

6.      EARLY TERMINATION

(a)     Right to Terminate Following Event of Default. If at any time an Event
of Default with respect to a party (the "Defaulting Party") has occurred and is
then continuing, the other party (the "Non-defaulting Party") may, by not more
than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of
Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an
Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions. If, however,
"Automatic Early Termination" is specified in the Schedule as applying to a
party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions
will occur immediately upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an
Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(l), (3), (5), (6) or, to the
extent analogous thereto, (8), and as of the time immediately preceding the
institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant
petition upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default
specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8).

(b)     Right to Terminate Following Termination Event.

        (i)     Notice. If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will,
        promptly upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying
        the nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction and
        will also give such other information about that Termination Event as
        the other party may reasonably require.

        (ii)    Transfer to Avoid Termination Event. If either an Illegality
        under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there is only one
        Affected Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened
        Party is the Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to
        its right to designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv),
        use all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a
        loss, excluding immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20
        days after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all its rights and
        obligations under this Agreement in respect of the Affected Transactions
        to another of its Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event
        ceases to exist.

        If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give
        notice to the other party to that effect within such 20 day period,
        whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days
        after the notice is given under Section 6(b)(i).

        Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject
        to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party,
        which consent will not be withheld if such other party's policies in
        effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the
        transferee on the terms proposed.

        (iii)   Two Affected Parties. If an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1)
        or a Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party
        will use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after
        notice thereof is given under Section 6(b)(i) on action to avoid that
        Termination Event.

        (iv)    Right to Terminate. If:--

                (1) a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under
                Section 6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected
                with respect to all Affected Transactions within 30 days after
                an Affected Party gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or

                (2) an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(2), a Credit Event Upon
                Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a Tax Event
                Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected
                Party,

        either party in the case of an Illegality, the Burdened Party in the
        case of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party in the case of a Tax
        Event or an Additional Termination Event if there is more than one
        Affected Party, or the party which is not the Affected Party in the case
        of a Credit Event Upon Merger or

                                        8                           ISDA(R) 1992

<PAGE>

        an Additional Termination Event if there is only one Affected Party may,
        by not more than 20 days notice to the other party and provided that the
        relevant Termination Event is then continuing, designate a day not
        earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination
        Date in respect of all Affected Transactions.

(c)     Effect of Designation.

        (i)     If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under
        Section 6(a) or (b), the Early Termination Date will occur on the date
        so designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or
        Termination Event is then continuing.

        (ii)    Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early
        Termination Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section
        2(a)(i) or 2(e) in respect of the Terminated Transactions will be
        required to be made, but without prejudice to the other provisions of
        this Agreement. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early
        Termination Date shall be determined pursuant to Section 6(e).

(d)     Calculations.

        (i)     Statement. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the
        occurrence of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the
        calculations on its part, if any, contemplated by Section 6(e) and will
        provide to the other party a statement (1) showing, in reasonable
        detail, such calculations (including all relevant quotations and
        specifying any amount payable under Section 6(e)) and (2) giving details
        of the relevant account to which any amount payable to it is to be paid.
        In the absence of written confirmation from the source of a quotation
        obtained in determining a Market Quotation, the records of the party
        obtaining such quotation will be conclusive evidence of the existence
        and accuracy of such quotation.

        (ii)    Payment Date. An amount calculated as being due in respect of
        any Early Termination Date under Section 6(e) will be payable on the day
        that notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early
        Termination Date which is designated or occurs as a result of an Event
        of Default) and on the day which is two Local Business Days after the
        day on which notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of
        an Early Termination Date which is designated as a result of a
        Termination Event). Such amount will be paid together with (to the
        extent permitted under applicable law) interest thereon (before as well
        as after judgment) in the Termination Currency, from (and including) the
        relevant Early Termination Date to (but excluding) the date such amount
        is paid, at the Applicable Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the
        basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed.

(e)     Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs, the
following provisions shall apply based on the parties' election in the Schedule
of a payment measure, either "Market Quotation" or "Loss", and a payment method,
either the "First Method" or the "Second Method". If the parties fail to
designate a payment measure or payment method in the Schedule, it will be deemed
that "Market Quotation" or the "Second Method", as the case may be, shall apply.
The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date and
determined pursuant to this Section will be subject to any Set-off.

        (i)     Events of Default. If the Early Termination Date results from an
        Event of Default:--

                (1) First Method and Market Quotation. If the First Method and
                Market Quotation apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the
                Non-defaulting Party the excess, if a positive number, of (A)
                the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the
                Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions
                and the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts
                owing to the Non-defaulting Party over (B) the Termination
                Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the
                Defaulting Party.

                (2) First Method and Loss. If the First Method and Loss apply,
                the Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party, if a
                positive number, the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in respect of
                this Agreement.

                                        9                           ISDA(R) 1992

<PAGE>

                (3) Second Method and Market Quotation. If the Second Method and
                Market Quotation apply, an amount will be payable equal to (A)
                the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the
                Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions
                and the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts
                owing to the Non-defaulting Party less (B) the Termination
                Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the
                Defaulting Party. If that amount is a positive number, the
                Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it
                is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the
                absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.

                (4) Second Method and Loss. If the Second Method and Loss apply,
                an amount will be payable equal to the Non-defaulting Party's
                Loss in respect of this Agreement. If that amount is a positive
                number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting
                Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will
                pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.

        (ii)    Termination Events. If the Early Termination Date results from a
        Termination Event:--

                (1) One Affected Party. If there is one Affected Party, the
                amount payable will be determined in accordance with Section
                6(e)(i)(3), if Market Quotation applies, or Section 6(e)(i)(4),
                if Loss applies, except that, in either case, references to the
                Defaulting Party and to the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed
                to be references to the Affected Party and the party which is
                not the Affected Party, respectively, and, if Loss applies and
                fewer than all the Transactions are being terminated, Loss shall
                be calculated in respect of all Terminated Transactions.

                (2) Two Affected Parties. If there are two Affected Parties:--

                    (A) if Market Quotation applies, each party will determine a
                    Settlement Amount in respect of the Terminated Transactions,
                    and an amount will be payable equal to (I) the sum of (a)
                    one-half of the difference between the Settlement Amount of
                    the party with the higher Settlement Amount ("X") and the
                    Settlement Amount of the party with the lower Settlement
                    Amount ("Y") and (b) the Termination Currency Equivalent of
                    the Unpaid Amounts owing to X less (II) the Termination
                    Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Y; and

                    (B) if Loss applies, each party will determine its Loss in
                    respect of this Agreement (or, if fewer than all the
                    Transactions are being terminated, in respect of all
                    Terminated Transactions) and an amount will be payable equal
                    to one-half of the difference between the Loss of the party
                    with the higher Loss ("X") and the Loss of the party with
                    the lower Loss ("Y").

                If the amount payable is a positive number, Y will pay it to X;
                if it is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value of
                that amount to Y.

        (iii)   Adjustment for Bankruptcy. In circumstances where an Early
        Termination Date occurs because "Automatic Early Termination" applies in
        respect of a party, the amount determined under this Section 6(e) will
        be subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by law
        to reflect any payments or deliveries made by one party to the other
        under this Agreement (and retained by such other party) during the
        period from the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment
        determined under Section 6(d)(ii).

        (iv)    Pre-Estimate. The parties agree that if Market Quotation applies
        an amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable
        pre-estimate of loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the
        loss of bargain and the loss of protection against future risks and
        except as otherwise provided in this Agreement neither party will be
        entitled to recover any additional damages as a consequence of such
        losses.

7.      TRANSFER

Subject to Section 6(b)(ii), neither this Agreement nor any interest or
obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of
security or otherwise) by either party without the prior written consent of the
other party, except that:--

(a)     a party may make such a transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a
consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all
or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any
other right or remedy under this Agreement); and

(b)     a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in
any amount payable to it from a Defaulting Party under Section 6(e).

Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this Section will be void.

8.      CONTRACTUAL CURRENCY

(a)     Payment in the Contractual Currency. Each payment under this Agreement
will be made in the relevant currency specified in this Agreement for that
payment (the "Contractual Currency"). To the extent permitted by applicable law,
any obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual Currency
will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency other than the
Contractual Currency, except to the extent such tender results in the actual
receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in a reasonable manner and
in good faith in converting the currency so tendered into the Contractual
Currency, of the full amount in the Contractual Currency of all amounts payable
in respect of this Agreement. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual
Currency so received falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency
payable in respect of this Agreement, the party required to make the payment
will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately pay such additional
amount in the Contractual Currency as may be necessary to compensate for the
shortfall. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received
exceeds the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this
Agreement, the party receiving the payment will refund promptly the amount of
such excess.

(b)     Judgments. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or
order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency is rendered
(i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement, (ii) for
the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this
Agreement or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the
payment of any amount described in (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking
recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is
entitled pursuant to the judgment or order, will be entitled to receive
immediately from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the Contractual
Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other
currency and will refund promptly to the other party any excess of the
Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in
such other currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from any
variation between the rate of exchange at which the Contractual Currency is
converted into the currency of the judgment or order for the purposes of such
judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which such party is able, acting
in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency received
into the Contractual Currency, to purchase the Contractual Currency with the
amount of the currency of the judgment or order actually received by such party.
The term "rate of exchange" includes, without limitation, any premiums and costs
of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into the
Contractual Currency.

(c)     Separate Indemnities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, these
indemnities constitute separate and independent obligations from the other
obligations in this Agreement, will be enforceable as separate and independent
causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the party
to which any payment is owed and will not be affected by judgment being obtained
or claim or proof being made for any other sums payable in respect of this
Agreement.

(d)     Evidence of Loss. For the purpose of this Section 8, it will be
sufficient for a party to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an
actual exchange or purchase been made.

                                       11                           ISDA(R) 1992

9.      MISCELLANEOUS

(a)     Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes
all oral communication and prior writings with respect thereto.

(b)     Amendments. No amendment, modification or waiver in respect of this
Agreement will be effective unless in writing (including a writing evidenced by
a facsimile transmission) and executed by each of the parties or confirmed by an
exchange of telexes or electronic messages on an electronic messaging system.

(c)     Survival of Obligations. Without prejudice to Sections 2(a)(iii) and
6(c)(ii), the obligations of the parties under this Agreement will survive the
termination of any Transaction.

(d)     Remedies Cumulative. Except as provided in this Agreement, the rights,
powers, remedies and privileges provided in this Agreement are cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights, powers, remedies and privileges provided by law.

(e)     Counterparts and Confirmations.

        (i)     This Agreement (and each amendment, modification and waiver in
        respect of it) may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including
        by facsimile transmission), each of which will be deemed an original.

        (ii)    The parties intend that they are legally bound by the terms of
        each Transaction from the moment they agree to those terms (whether
        orally or otherwise). A Confirmation shall be entered into as soon as
        practicable and may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including
        by facsimile transmission) or be created by an exchange of telexes or by
        an exchange of electronic messages on an electronic messaging system,
        which in each case will be sufficient for all purposes to evidence a
        binding supplement to this Agreement. The parties will specify therein
        or through another effective means that any such counterpart, telex or
        electronic message constitutes a Confirmation.

(f)     No Waiver of Rights. A failure or delay in exercising any right, power
or privilege in respect of this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a
waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will
not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise, of that right,
power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

(g)     Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and are not to affect the construction of or to be taken into
consideration in interpreting this Agreement.

10.     OFFICES; MULTIBRANCH PARTIES

(a)     If Section 10(a) is specified in the Schedule as applying, each party
that enters into a Transaction through an Office other than its head or home
office represents to the other party that, notwithstanding the place of booking
office or jurisdiction of incorporation or organisation of such party, the
obligations of such party are the same as if it had entered into the Transaction
through its head or home office. This representation will be deemed to be
repeated by such party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into.

(b)     Neither party may change the Office through which it makes and receives
payments or deliveries for the purpose of a Transaction without the prior
written consent of the other party.

(c)     If a party is specified as a Multibranch Party in the Schedule, such
Multibranch Party may make and receive payments or deliveries under any
Transaction through any Office listed in the Schedule, and the Office through
which it makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to a Transaction
will be specified in the relevant Confirmation.

                                       12                           ISDA(R) 1992

11.     EXPENSES

A Defaulting Party will, on demand, indemnify and hold harmless the other party
for and against all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including legal fees and
Stamp Tax, incurred by such other party by reason of the enforcement and
protection of its rights under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to
which the Defaulting Party is a party or by reason of the early termination of
any Transaction, including, but not limited to, costs of collection.

12.     NOTICES

(a)     Effectiveness. Any notice or other communication in respect of this
Agreement may be given in any manner set forth below (except that a notice or
other communication under Section 5 or 6 may not be given by facsimile

        is received by a responsible employee of the recipient in legible form
        (it being agreed that the burden of proving receipt will be on the
        sender and will not be met by a transmission report generated by the
        sender's facsimile machine);

        (iv)    if sent by certified or registered mail (airmail, if overseas)
        or the equivalent (return receipt requested), on the date that mail is
        delivered or its delivery is attempted; or

Business Day, in which case that communication shall be deemed given and
effective on the first following day that is a Local Business Day.

(b)     Change of Addresses. Either party may by notice to the other change the
address, telex or facsimile number or electronic messaging system details at
which notices or other communications are to be given to it.

13.     GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

(a)     Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the law specified in the Schedule.

(b)     Jurisdiction. With respect to any suit, action or proceedings relating
to this Agreement ("Proceedings"), each party irrevocably:--

        (i)     submits to the jurisdiction of the English courts, if this
        Agreement is expressed to be governed by English law, or to the
        nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the
        United States District Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New
        York City, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by the laws of
        the State of New York; and

        (ii)    waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying
        of venue of any Proceedings brought in any such court, waives any claim
        that such Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum and
        further waives the right to object, with respect to such Proceedings,
        that such court does not have any jurisdiction over such party.

                                       13                           ISDA(R) 1992

<PAGE>

Nothing in this Agreement precludes either party from bringing Proceedings in
any other jurisdiction (outside, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed
by English law, the Contracting States, as defined in Section 1(3) of the Civil
Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 or any modification, extension or
re-enactment thereof for the time being in force) nor will the bringing of
Proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the bringing of
Proceedings in any other jurisdiction.

(c)     Service of Process. Each party irrevocably appoints the Process Agent
(if any) specified opposite its name in the Schedule to receive, for it and on
its behalf, service of process in any Proceedings. If for any reason any party's
Process Agent is unable to act as such, such party will promptly notify the
other party and within 30 days appoint a substitute process agent acceptable to
the other party. The parties irrevocably consent to service of process given in
the manner provided for notices in Section 12. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of either party to serve process in any other manner permitted
by law.

(d)     Waiver of Immunities. Each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, with respect to itself and its revenues and
assets (irrespective of their use or intended use), all immunity on the grounds
of sovereignty or other similar grounds from (i) suit, (ii) jurisdiction of any
court, (iii) relief by way of injunction, order for specific performance or for
recovery of property, (iv) attachment of its assets (whether before or after
judgment) and (v) execution or enforcement of any judgment to which it or its
revenues or assets might otherwise be entitled in any Proceedings in the courts
of any jurisdiction and irrevocably agrees, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, that it will not claim any such immunity in any Proceedings.

<PAGE>

"Market Quotation" means, with respect to one or more Terminated Transactions
and a party making the determination, an amount determined on the basis of
quotations from Reference Market-makers. Each quotation will be for an amount,
if any, that would be paid to such party (expressed as a negative number) or by
such party (expressed as a positive number) in consideration of an agreement
between such party (taking into account any existing Credit Support Document
with respect to the obligations of such party) and the quoting Reference
Market-maker to enter into a transaction (the "Replacement Transaction") that
would have the effect of preserving for such party the economic equivalent of
any payment or delivery (whether the underlying obligation was absolute or
contingent and assuming the satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent)
by the parties under Section 2(a)(i) in respect of such Terminated Transaction
or group of Terminated Transactions that would, but for the occurrence of the
relevant Early Termination Date, have been required after that date. For this
purpose, Unpaid Amounts in respect of the Terminated Transaction or group of
Terminated Transactions are to be excluded but, without limitation, any payment
or delivery that would, but for the relevant Early Termination Date, have been
required (assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) after
that Early Termination Date is to be included. The Replacement Transaction would
be subject to such documentation as such party and the Reference Market-maker
may, in good faith, agree. The party making the determination (or its agent)
will request each Reference Market-maker to provide its quotation to the extent
reasonably practicable as of the same day and time (without regard to different
time zones) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the relevant Early
Termination Date. The day and time as of which those quotations are to be
obtained will be selected in good faith by the party obliged to make a
determination under Section 6(e), and, if each party is so obliged, after
consultation with the other. If more than three quotations are provided, the
Market Quotation will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations, without regard
to the quotations having the highest and lowest values. If exactly three such
quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the quotation remaining
after disregarding the highest and lowest quotations. For this purpose, if more
than one quotation has the same highest value or lowest value, then one of such
quotations shall be disregarded. If fewer than three quotations are provided, it
will be deemed that the Market Quotation in respect of such Terminated
Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions cannot be determined.

"Non-default Rate" means a rate per annum equal to the cost (without proof or
evidence of any actual cost) to the Non-defaulting Party (as certified by it) if

dealers having an office in the same city.

"Relevant Jurisdiction" means, with respect to a party, the jurisdictions (a) in
which the party is incorporated, organized, managed and controlled or considered
to have its seat, (b) where an Office through which the party is acting for
purposes of this Agreement is located, (c) in which the party executes this
Agreement and (d) in relation to any payment, from or through which such payment
is made.

made under Section 2(a)(i) with respect to a Transaction.

on, such payer.

"Settlement Amount" means, with respect to a party and any Early Termination
Date, the sum of:--

(a)     the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Market Quotations (whether

<PAGE>

(b)     such party's Loss (whether positive or negative and without reference to
any Unpaid Amounts) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated
Transactions for which a Market Quotation cannot be determined or would not (in
the reasonable belief of the party making the determination) produce a
commercially reasonable result.

present or future, contingent or otherwise, as principal or surety or otherwise)
in respect of borrowed money.

(including an agreement with respect thereto) now existing or hereafter entered
into between one party to this Agreement (or any Credit Support Provider of such
party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party) and the other party to

applicable Specified Entity of such other party) which is a rate swap

Termination Date (or, if "Automatic Early Termination" applies, immediately
before that Early Termination Date).

"Termination Currency" has the meaning specified in the Schedule.

"Termination Currency Equivalent" means, in respect of any amount denominated in
the Termination Currency, such Termination Currency amount and, in respect of
any amount denominated in a currency other than the Termination Currency (the
"Other Currency"), the amount in the Termination Currency determined by the
party making the relevant determination as being required to purchase such
amount of such Other Currency as at the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if
the relevant Market Quotation or Loss (as the case may be), is determined as of
a later date, that later date, with the Termination Currency at the rate equal
to the spot exchange rate of the foreign exchange agent (selected as provided
below) for the purchase of such Other Currency with the Terminated Currency at
or about 11:00 a.m. (in the city in which such foreign exchange agent is
located) on such date as would be customary for the determination of such a rate
for the purchase of such Other Currency for value on the relevant Early
Termination Date or that later date. The foreign exchange agent will, if only
one party is obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), be selected in
good faith by that party and otherwise will be agreed by the parties.

"Unpaid Amounts" owing to any party means, with respect to an Early Termination
Date, the aggregate of (a) in respect of all Terminated Transactions, the
amounts that became payable (or that would have become payable but for Section
2(a)(iii)) to such party under Section 2(a)(i) on or prior to such Early
Termination Date and which remain unpaid as at such Early Termination Date and
(b) in respect of each Terminated Transaction, for each obligation under Section
2(a)(i) which was (or would have been but for Section 2(a)(iii)) required to be
settled by delivery to such party on or prior to such Early Termination Date and
which has not been so settled as at such Early Termination Date, an amount equal
to the fair market value of that which was (or would have been) required to be
delivered as of the originally scheduled date for delivery, in each case
together with (to the extent permitted under applicable law) interest, in the
currency of such amounts, from (and including) the date such amounts or
obligations were or would have been required to have been paid or performed to
(but excluding) such Early Termination Date, at the Applicable Rate. Such

actual number of days elapsed. The fair market value of any obligation referred
to in clause (b) above shall be reasonably determined by the party obliged to
make the determination under Section 6(e) or, if each party is so obliged, it
shall be the average of the Termination Currency Equivalents of the fair market
values reasonably determined by both parties.

        to pay to, Party B the fair market value for such termination, as
        determined by Party A in good faith and in accordance with market
        practice and its own customary procedures, upon the occurrence of one or
        more of the following events:

        (a)     If the indebtedness under the Loan Agreement is (for whatever
                reason, in whatever manner) partially or fully paid or
                discharged (except with respect to any scheduled amortization);
        (b)     If Party A ceases to be a party to the Loan Agreement;
        (c)     If the lenders party to the Loan Agreement become secured or, if
                already secured, the lenders obtain additional security
                thereunder and Party A, in its capacity as a party to this
                Agreement and any Transaction hereunder, is not entitled to the
                same rights, privileges, and interest in the collateral and/or
                guaranty agreements as the lenders are entitled to under the
                Loan Agreement;
        (d)     If there is a default, an event of default, or other similar
                condition or event (however described) in relation to Party B
                under the Loan Agreement (without regard to the existence of any
                waiver or forbearance agreement with respect thereto); and
        (e)     If the Loan Agreement is amended, restated, supplemented, or
                otherwise modified and Party A does not consent, in its sole
                discretion, to such amendment, restatement, supplement, or other
                modification.

        Party A may exercise such right to terminate, at any time in its sole
        discretion, following the occurrence of any one of such events through
        the Termination Date. A failure or delay in exercising the foregoing
        right to terminate will not be presumed to operate as a waiver, and a
        single or partial exercise of such right will not be presumed to
        preclude any subsequent or further exercise of that right.

                                     Part 6
                              Additional Agreements

1.      Recording of Conversations. Each party (i) consents to the monitoring or
        recording, at any time and from time to time, by the other party of any
        and all communications between officers or employees of the parties,
        (ii) waives any further notice of such monitoring or recording, and
        (iii) agrees to notify (and, if required by law, obtain the consent of)
        its officers and employees with respect to such monitoring or recording.

2.      Mediation and Arbitration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
        contained herein, the parties agree to submit to mediation and, should
        settlement through mediation not occur, to arbitration any and all
        claims, disputes, and controversies between them (and their respective
        employees, officers, directors, affiliates, attorneys, and other agents)
        resulting from or arising out of this Agreement. Such mediation and
        arbitration shall proceed in the jurisdiction where Party A is located,
        shall be governed by the law specified in this Agreement, and shall be
        conducted (a) in accordance with such rules as may be agreed upon by the
        parties or (b) in the event the parties do not reach an agreement as to
        such rules within thirty (30) days after a notice of dispute, in
        accordance with the Commercial Mediation Rules and Commercial
        Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. If, within
        thirty (30) days after service of a written demand for mediation, the
        mediation does not result in settlement of the dispute, then any party
        may demand arbitration, and the decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be
        binding on the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by the
        arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. It is
        agreed that the arbitrators shall have no authority to award treble,
        exemplary, or punitive damages of any type under any circumstances,
        whether or not such damages may be available under state or federal law,
        or under the Federal Arbitration Act, or under the Commercial
        Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, the parties
        hereby waiving their right, if any, to recover any such damages.

3.      Set Off. Section 6 of the Agreement is amended by adding the following
        new subsection 6(f):

                "(f) Right of Set-Off. Upon the occurrence of an Event of
                Default with respect to Party B, or an Illegality or Credit
                Event Upon Merger where Party B is the Affected Party, Party A
                will have the right (but not the obligation), without prior
                notice to Party B or any other person, to set-off any obligation
                of Party A or any of Party A's present or future Affiliates,
                branches, or offices owing to Party B, against any obligation of
                Party B owing to Party A or any of Party A's present or future
                Affiliates, branches, or offices (whether or not such
                obligations arise under this Agreement, whether or not matured,
                whether or not contingent, and regardless of the place of
                payment or booking office of the obligations). In order to
                enable Party A to exercise its rights of set-off, if an
                obligation is unascertained, Party A may in good faith estimate
                that obligation and set-off in respect of the estimate, subject
                to Party A accounting to Party B when the obligation is
                ascertained.

                Nothing in this Section 6(f) shall be effective to create a
                charge or other security interest. This Section 6(f) shall be
                without prejudice and in addition to any right of set-off,
                combination of accounts, lien, or other right to which any party
                is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law,
                contract, or otherwise)."

4.      By signing this Schedule, Party B acknowledges that it has received and
        understands the SunTrust Bank "Terms of Dealing for OTC Risk Management
        Transactions" and the "Risk Disclosure Statement for OTC Risk Management
        Transactions" (each attached hereto and incorporated by reference into

                           SUNTRUST BANK ("SUNTRUST")
              TERMS OF DEALING FOR OTC RISK MANAGEMENT TRANSACTIONS

In connection with the negotiation, entry into, and performance from time to
time of over-the-counter ("OTC") risk management transactions, please be advised
that:

SunTrust acts as principal only and does not act as advisor, agent, broker, or
fiduciary for or with respect to any counterparty (unless otherwise expressly
agreed in a written engagement letter).

SunTrust expects that its counterparties have the authority and capacity to
enter into and perform their obligations under their OTC risk management
transactions with SunTrust, and SunTrust relies on the express and implied
representations of its counterparties with respect thereto.

SunTrust expects that its counterparties possess adequate knowledge and
experience to assess independently, or with the assistance of their own
advisors, the merits and risks of each OTC risk management transaction that the
counterparty may from time to time enter into, amend, or terminate.

SunTrust endeavors to maintain the confidentiality of all confidential
counterparty information and expects its counterparties to do the same. Unless a
counterparty gives SunTrust written notice to the contrary, each counterparty
authorizes SunTrust and all SunTrust affiliates, including SunTrust Capital
Markets, Inc. (STCM), to share with each other confidential information
concerning a counterparty and/or its accounts for marketing or other purposes
from time to time. Any trade ideas, term sheets, and other similar documents
sent to counterparties by SunTrust are not to be shared with others.

SunTrust may pay fees, commissions, and other amounts to agents, brokers, and/or
other third parties in connection with OTC risk management transactions entered
into with counterparties. SunTrust considers the amount of such fees,
commissions, and other amounts to be confidential and does not disclose the same
to its counterparties.

SunTrust may from time to time receive orders for similar or identical
transactions, and SunTrust makes no representation with respect to execution
priorities.

STCM's Authorized Officers have the authority to bind SunTrust in connection
with OTC risk management transactions. A current list of Authorized Officers may
be obtained from STCM upon request.

OTC risk management obligations of SunTrust are not FDIC insured.

                                       25

                           SUNTRUST BANK ("SUNTRUST")
         RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FOR OTC RISK MANAGEMENT TRANSACTIONS

Over-the-counter ("OTC") risk management transactions, like other financial
transactions, involve a variety of significant potential risks. OTC risk
management transactions generally include options, forwards, swaps, swaptions,
caps, floors, collars, combination and variations of such instruments, and other
executory contractual arrangements, and may involve interest rates, currencies,
securities, commodities, equities, credit, indices, and other underlying
interests.

Before entering into any OTC risk management transaction, you should carefully
consider whether the transaction is appropriate for you in light of your
experience, objectives, financial and operational resources, and other relevant
circumstances. You should also ensure that you fully understand the nature of
the transaction and contractual relationship into which you are entering and the
nature and extent of your exposure to risk of loss, which may significantly
exceed the amount of any initial payment or investment by you.

The specific risks presented by a particular OTC risk management transaction
necessarily depend upon the character of the specific transaction and your
circumstances. In general, however, all OTC risk management transactions involve
the risk of adverse or unanticipated market developments, risk of illiquidity
and credit risk, and may involve other material risks. Equity risk management
transactions may increase or decrease in value with a change in, among other
things, stock prices and interest rates which could result in unlimited loss. In
addition, you may be subject to internal operational risks in the event that
appropriate internal systems and controls are not in place to monitor the
various risks and funding requirements to which you are subject by virtue of
your activities in the OTC risk management and related markets. OTC risk
management transactions frequently are tailored to permit parties to customize
transactions to accomplish complex financial and risk management objectives.
Such customization can also introduce significant risk factors of a complex
character.

As in any financial transaction, you must understand the requirements (including
investment restrictions), if any, applicable to you that are established by your
regulators or by your Board of Directors or other governing body. You should
also consider the tax and accounting implications of entering into any risk
management or other transaction. To the extent appropriate in light of the
specific transaction and your circumstances, you should consider consulting such
advisers as may be appropriate to assist you in understanding the risks
involved. If you are acting in the capacity of financial adviser or agent, you
must evaluate the foregoing matters in light of the circumstances applicable to
your principal.

In entering into any OTC risk management transaction, you should also take into
consideration that, unless you and SunTrust have established in writing an
express financial advisory or other fiduciary relationship or you and SunTrust
have expressly agreed in writing that you will be relying on SunTrust's
recommendations as the primary basis for making your trading or investment
decisions, SunTrust is acting solely in the capacity of an arm's-length
contractual counterparty and not in the capacity of your financial advisor or
fiduciary. In addition, SunTrust or its affiliates may from time to time have
substantial long or short positions in and may make a market in or otherwise buy
or sell instruments identical or economically related to the OTC risk management
transaction entered into with you or may have an investment banking or other
commercial relationship with the issuer of any security or financial instrument
underlying an OTC risk management transaction entered into with you.

THIS BRIEF STATEMENT DOES NOT DISCLOSE ALL OF THE RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT
ASPECTS OF ENTERING INTO OTC RISK MANAGEMENT TRANSACTIONS. YOU SHOULD REFRAIN
FROM ENTERING INTO ANY SUCH TRANSACTION UNLESS YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND ALL SUCH
RISK AND HAVE INDEPENDENTLY DETERMINED THAT THE TRANSACTION IS APPROPRIATE FOR
YOU.

        Permitted Investments. "Permitted Investments" means investments in the

"United States Governmental Securities" means any direct obligation of, or
obligation guaranteed by, the United States of America, or any agency controlled

not less than "A 1" if rated by S&P."

        2. Guaranty of Payment and Performance. The Guarantor hereby guarantees
to each of the Obligees, the full and punctual payment when due (whether at
stated maturity, by required pre-payment, by acceleration or otherwise), as well
as the performance, of all of the Obligations including all such which would
become due but for the operation of the automatic stay pursuant to Section
362(a) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code and the operation of Sections 502(b) and
506(b) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. This Guaranty is an absolute,
unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual payment and
performance of all of the Obligations and not of their collectibility only and
is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that the Agent or any Obligee
first attempt to collect any of the Obligations from the Company or resort to
any collateral security or other means of obtaining payment. Should the Company
default in the payment or performance of any of the Obligations, the obligations
of the Guarantor hereunder with respect to such Obligations in default shall,
upon demand by the Agent, or any Noteholder, become immediately due and payable
to the Agent, for the benefit of the Obligees and the Agent, without demand or
notice of any nature, all of which are expressly waived by the Guarantor.
Payments by the Guarantor hereunder may be required by the Agent or the Obligees
on any number of occasions. All payments by the Guarantor to any Obligee at any
time after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing shall be turned
over to the Agent for distribution in accordance with the terms hereof. All
payments by the Guarantor hereunder shall be made to the Agent, in the manner
and at the place of payment specified therefor in the Credit Agreement for the
account of the Obligees and the Agent. The Obligees will share all payments
received hereunder on a pro rata basis with respect to their individual
Obligations, regardless of whether this Guaranty is found to be inapplicable to
some or all of any Obligee's respective Obligations.

        3. Guarantor's Agreement to Pay Enforcement Costs, etc. The Guarantor
further agrees, as the principal obligor and not as a guarantor only, to pay to
the Agent and each of the Obligees, on demand, all costs and expenses (including
court costs and legal expenses) incurred or expended by the Agent or any Obligee
in connection with the Obligations, this Guaranty and the enforcement thereof
(which enforcement may be undertaken by any Obligee, so long as the proceeds of
such enforcement are paid to the Agent by such Obligee, for distribution in
accordance with the terms hereof), together with interest on amounts recoverable
under this Section 3 from the time when such amounts become due until payment,
whether before or after judgment, at the rate of interest for overdue principal
set forth in the Credit Agreement, the 1995 Agreement, the Nova Agreement or the
2000 Agreement, as applicable, provided that if such interest exceeds

<PAGE>

                                       -4-

the maximum amount permitted to be paid under applicable law, then such interest
shall be reduced to such maximum permitted amount.

        4. Proceeds Received Under the Guaranty.

                4.1 Guaranty Account.

                (a) The Agent shall establish and maintain an account into
which, subject to Section 4.1(b), it shall deposit all amounts received by it in
its capacity as Agent for the benefit of the Obligees (and not in any other
capacity), in respect of this Guaranty so long as an Event of Default shall be
continuing, including all monies received on account of any payment on demand or
other realization pursuant to this Guaranty (the "Guaranty Account"). All
amounts deposited in the Guaranty Account shall be held by the Agent for the
benefit of the Obligees subject to the terms hereof, it being understood that
any such amounts may be released to the Guarantor to the extent required by this
Guaranty. The Guarantor shall have no rights with respect to, and the Agent, for
the benefit of the Obligees shall have exclusive dominion and control over, the
Guaranty Account.

                (b) The Agent shall establish sub-accounts in its Guaranty
Account with respect to each outstanding Letter of Credit (as defined in the
Credit Agreement). All amounts deposited in the Guaranty Account in respect of
Letters of Credit shall be allocated among, and deposited in, the respective
sub-accounts therein pro rata in accordance with the Reimbursement Obligations
(as defined in the Credit Agreement) with respect to the related Letters of
Credit. If, on or after the date on which any funds are deposited in the
Guaranty Account pursuant to paragraph (b) above, any Letter of Credit is drawn
upon by the beneficiary thereof, the Agent shall apply any funds in the
sub-account with respect to such Letter of Credit to the reimbursement of such
Letter of Credit Participation (as defined in the Credit Agreement) as if such
reimbursement were being made by the Company pursuant to the Credit Agreement
(but not in an amount in excess of the amount of such drawing plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon from the date of draw to the date of payment).

                (c) At the time of any expiration or cancellation of any
outstanding Letter of Credit, or any other reduction in the amount of
Reimbursement Obligations thereunder (other than as a result of a Letter of
Credit Participation), the amount of funds in the sub-account with respect to
such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any partial reduction in the amount of
Reimbursement Obligations thereunder, a pro rata portion of such funds) shall be
released from such sub-account, and the funds so released shall be deposited in
the Guaranty Account.

                4.2 Application of Proceeds.

                (a) Amounts deposited in the Guaranty Account shall be applied
in the following order of priority:

<PAGE>

                                       -5-

                First, to the payment of (i) the reasonable costs and expenses
(including attorney fees and disbursements) incurred by the Agent in
administering and carrying out its obligations under this Guaranty and (ii) all
amounts owing to the Agent in respect of indemnification or expense
reimbursement claims owing to the Agent pursuant to Section 5;

                Second, to the payment of (i) the reasonable costs and expenses
(including attorney fees and disbursements) of any Obligee in exercising or
attempting to exercise any right or remedy hereunder and (ii) all amounts owing
to any Obligee in respect of indemnification or expense reimbursement claims
owing to it pursuant to Section 5;

                Third, to the Obligees in respect of the outstanding Obligations
of each Obligee, respectively, at such time, pro rata in accordance with the
aggregate amounts of the outstanding Obligations of each Obligee, respectively,
at such time, until the outstanding Obligations shall have been paid in full;
and

                Fourth, the balance, if any, to the Guarantor or such other
person or persons as shall be entitled thereto.

                (b) All amounts deposited in any sub-account in the Guaranty
Account shall be applied as provided in Sections 4.1 (b) and (c).

                (c) Each Obligee agrees that, notwithstanding any provision of
this Guaranty, the Credit Agreement, the 1995 Agreement, the Nova Agreement or
the 2000 Agreement, any sums and amounts received by such Obligee pursuant to
this Section 4.2 shall be applied to the payment of its outstanding Obligations
as follows: first, to the payment of all outstanding Obligations owed to such
Obligee, other than principal, premium, interest and obligations in respect of
reimbursement of Letter of Credit Participations; second, to the payment of all
outstanding Obligations owed to such Obligee consisting of accrued interest; and
third, to the payment of all outstanding Obligations owed to such Obligee
consisting of principal, premium, Makewhole Price and obligations in respect of
reimbursement of Letter of Credit Participations.

                4.3. Time of Payments. Unless the Agent shall have received
written instructions from the holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Obligations as to the times at which any amounts are to be distributed pursuant
to Section 4.2, all distributions under Section 4.2 shall be made at such times
and as promptly as the Agent shall determine to be reasonable and practicable
under the circumstances, subject to Section 4.4; provided, however, that any
distributions from the Guaranty Account shall be made substantially
simultaneously; provided, further, that distributions from the Guaranty Account
shall be made at least once in each 6 months or any time the amount on deposit
therein exceeds $1,000,000.

                4.4. Application of Amounts Not Distributable. If there is no
provision under the Credit Agreement, the 1995 Agreement, the Nova Agreement or
the 2000

<PAGE>

                                       -6-

Agreement, as the case may be, for the application of amounts that are
to be distributed to the Lenders or the Noteholders pursuant to Section 4.2
(whether by virtue of the applicable outstanding Obligations thereunder not
being then due and payable or otherwise) or for the holding of such amounts by
or on behalf of such parties pending application thereof, then the Agent, for
the benefit of the Obligees shall invest the amounts in the Guaranty Account in
investments permitted by Section 4.5 and shall hold such amounts and all
proceeds of such investments in the Guaranty Account for the benefit of the
Obligees until such amounts are either applied against the outstanding
Obligations of each Obligee, respectively, or such outstanding Obligations have
been paid in full.

                4.5. Investment of Amounts in Guaranty Account. Pending the
disbursement thereof pursuant to the terms of this Guaranty, all amounts in the
Guaranty Account shall (to the extent deemed practical) be invested by the
Agent, for the benefit of the Obligees, in Permitted Investments. The Agent
shall, to the extent that the timing of distributions to be made from the
Guaranty Account is known or can be reasonably anticipated, select Permitted
Investments for the Guaranty Account that mature prior to the anticipated date
of any distribution to be made from the Guaranty Account. The Agent shall not be
liable for any loss resulting from any investment made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 4.5, except to the extent such loss was the result of
such person's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Agent agrees to
account to the Obligees for each investment of funds in the Guaranty Account,
and to supply to the Obligees the documents relating thereto, promptly upon
request.

                4.6. Information. Each Obligee agrees promptly from time to
time, upon written request of the Agent, to advise the Agent of the nature and
amount of outstanding obligations owing to it as of such date as the Agent may
specify.

        5. Expenses and Indemnification by the Guarantor. By countersigning this
Guaranty, the Guarantor agrees (i) to reimburse the Agent and each Obligee, on
demand, for any reasonable expenses incurred, including reasonable (1) counsel
fees, (2) other charges and (3) disbursements and compensation of agents,
arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of, the execution or
delivery of this Guaranty or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or
thereby or the performance by the parties hereto or thereto of their respective
obligations hereunder or thereunder or in connection with the enforcement or
protection of the rights of the Agent, and the Obligees under this Guaranty and
(ii) to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, the Obligees and each of their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents (each such person being
called an "Indemnitee"), on demand, from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee in their respective
capacities or any of them in any way relating to or arising out of this Guaranty
or any action taken or omitted by them under this Guaranty; provided, however,
that the Guarantor shall not be liable to any Indemnitee for any such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,

<PAGE>

                                       -7-

penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements to the
extent they have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Indemnitee.

        6. Waivers by Guarantor; Lender's Freedom to Act. The Guarantor agrees
that the Obligations will be paid and performed strictly in accordance with
their respective terms, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or
hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the
rights of the Agent or any Obligee with respect thereto. The Guarantor waives
promptness, diligences, presentment, demand, protest, notice of acceptance,
notice of any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind, all
defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law
or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the
marshalling of assets of the Company or any other entity or other person
primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the Obligations, and all
suretyship defenses generally. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Guarantor agrees to the provisions of any instrument evidencing, securing or
otherwise executed in connection with any Obligation and agrees that the
obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in
whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Agent or any
Obligee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against
the Company or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable
with respect to any of the Obligations; (ii) any extensions, compromise,
refinancing, consolidation or renewals of any Obligation; (iii) any change in
the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Obligations or any
rescissions, waivers, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or other amendments
or modifications of any of the terms or provisions of the Obligations or any
other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with
any of the Obligations, (iv) the addition, substitution or release of any entity
or other person primarily or secondarily liable for any Obligation; (v) the
adequacy of any rights which the Agent or any Obligee may have against any
collateral security or other means of obtaining repayment of any of the
Obligations; (vi) the impairment of any collateral securing any of the
Obligations, including without limitation the failure to perfect or preserve any
rights which the Agent or any Obligee might have in such collateral security or
the substitution, exchange, surrender, release, loss or destruction of any such
collateral security; or (vii) any other act or omission which might in any
manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Guarantor or otherwise operate as a
release or discharge of the Guarantor, all of which may be done without notice
to the Guarantor. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Guarantor hereby
expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of (A) any
"one action" or "anti-deficiency" law which would otherwise prevent the Agent or
any Obligee from bringing any action, including any claim for a deficiency, or
exercising any other right or remedy (including any right of set-off), against
the Guarantor before or after the Agent's or such Obligee's commencement or
completion of any foreclosure action, whether judicially, by exercise of power
of sale or otherwise, or (B) any other law which in any other way would
otherwise require any election of remedies by the Agent or any Obligee.

<PAGE>

                                       -8-

         7. Unenforceability of Obligations Against Company. If for any reason
the Company has no legal existence or is under no legal obligation to discharge
any of the Obligations, or if any of the Obligations have become irrecoverable
from the Company by reason of the Company's insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization or by other operation of law or for any other reason, this
Guaranty shall nevertheless be binding on the Guarantor to the same extent as if
the Guarantor at all times had been the principal obligor on all such
Obligations. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of
the Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of
the Company, or for any other reason, all such amounts otherwise subject to
acceleration under the terms of any of the Obligations or any other agreement
evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Obligation
shall be immediately due and payable by the Guarantor.

        8. Subrogation; Subordination.

                8.1. Waiver of Rights Against Company. Until the final payment
        and performance in full of all of the Obligations, the Guarantor shall
        not exercise and hereby waives any rights against the Company arising as
        a result of payment by the Guarantor hereunder, by way of subrogation,
        reimbursement, restitution, contribution or otherwise, and will not
        prove any claim in competition with the Agent or any Obligee in respect
        of any payment hereunder in any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization
        case or proceedings of any nature; the Guarantor will not claim any
        setoff, recoupment or counterclaim against the Company in respect of any
        liability of the Guarantor to the Company; and the Guarantor waives any
        benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security which
        may be held by the Agent or any Obligee.

                8.2. Subordination. The payment of any amounts due with respect
        to any indebtedness of the Company for money borrowed or credit received
        now or hereafter owed to the Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the
        prior payment in full of all of the Obligations. The Guarantor agrees
        that, after the occurrence of any default in the payment or performance
        of any of the Obligations, the Guarantor will not demand, sue for or
        otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of the Company to the
        Guarantor until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full. If,
        notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Guarantor shall collect,
        enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness while any
        Obligations are still outstanding, such amounts shall be collected,
        enforced and received by the Guarantor as trustee for the Obligees and
        the Agent and be paid over to the Agent, for each of the Obligees and
        the Agent, on account of the Obligations without affecting in any manner
        the liability of the Guarantor under the other provisions of this
        Guaranty.

                8.3. Provisions Supplemental. The provisions of this Section 8
        shall be supplemental to and not in derogation of any rights and
        remedies of the Obligees and the Agent under any separate subordination
        agreement which the Agent or any of the Obligees may at any time and
        from time to time enter into with the Guarantor for the benefit of the
        Obligees and the Agent.

<PAGE>

                                       -9-

        9. Setoff. Regardless of the adequacy of any collateral security or
other means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations, each of the Agent
and the Obligees is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without
notice to the Guarantor (any such notice being expressly waived by the
Guarantor) and to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply such
deposits and other sums against the obligations of the Guarantor under this
Guaranty, whether or not the Agent or such Obligee shall have made any demand
under this Guaranty and although such obligations may be contingent or
unmatured. Any funds obtained by any such setoff shall be paid to the Agent for
deposit into the Guaranty Account.

        10. Further Assurances. The Guarantor agrees that it will from time to
time, at the request of the Agent or any Obligee, do all such things and execute
all such documents as the Agent or such Obligee may consider necessary or
desirable to give full effect to this Guaranty and to perfect and preserve the
rights and powers of the Obligees and the Agent hereunder. The Guarantor
acknowledges and confirms that the Guarantor itself has established its own
adequate means of obtaining from the Company on a continuing basis all
information desired by the Guarantor concerning the financial condition of the
Company and that the Guarantor will look to the Company and not to the Agent or
any Obligee in order for the Guarantor to keep adequately informed of changes in
the Company's financial condition.

        11. Termination; Reinstatement. This Guaranty shall remain in full force
and effect until the Agent and the Obligees are given written notice of the
Guarantor's intention to discontinue this Guaranty, notwithstanding any
intermediate or temporary payment or settlement of the whole or any part of the
Obligations. No such notice shall be effective unless received and acknowledged
by an officer of the Agent and an officer of each Noteholder, at the address of
the Agent for notices set forth in Section 16.6 of the Credit Agreement and at
the address of each Noteholder specified in or pursuant to the Note Agreements.
No such notice shall affect any rights of the Agent or any Obligee hereunder,
including without limitation the rights set forth in Sections 5 and 8, with
respect to any Obligations incurred or accrued prior to the receipt of such
notice or any Obligations incurred or accrued pursuant to any contract or
commitment in existence prior to such receipt, and this Guaranty shall remain in
full force and effect until all such Obligations are paid in full. This Guaranty
shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, notwithstanding any such
notice, if at any time any payment made or value received with respect to any
Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Agent or any
Obligee upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company, or
otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made or value received.

        12. Invalidated Payments. If the Agent or any Obligee receives any
amount which is shared pursuant to this Guaranty that is subsequently required
to be returned or repaid by the Agent or Obligee to the Guarantor, the Company
or any affiliate thereof or their respective representatives or successors in
interest, whether by court order, settlement or otherwise (a "Repayment Event"),
then

                (a)     if the Repayment Event results in the Agent being
required to return or repay any amount distributed by it to the Obligees under
this Guaranty, each

<PAGE>

                                      -10-

Obligee to which such amount was distributed shall, forthwith upon its receipt
of a notice thereof from the Agent, pay the Agent an amount equal to its ratable
share (based on the amount distributed to such Obligee) of the amount required
to be returned or repaid relating to such Repayment Event,

                (b)     if the Repayment Event results in any Obligee (any such
Obligee, an "Affected Obligee") being required to return or repay any amount
received by it which was delivered to and distributed by the Agent to the
Affected Obligee and the other Obligees pursuant to this Guaranty, each other
Obligee to which any amount was distributed shall, forthwith upon its receipt of
notice thereof from the Affected Obligee, pay the Agent an amount, up to an
amount equal to the prior distributions to such other Obligee, for distribution
to such Affected Obligee such that, after giving effect to such payment and
distribution, all Obligees shall have received such proportion of the amounts
distributed pursuant to this Guaranty as they would have received had the
original payment which was the subject of the Repayment Event not occurred, and

                (c)     in either case, the Agent shall thereafter apply all
amounts to be distributed pursuant hereto in a manner consistent with the terms
of this Guaranty such that all Obligees receive such proportion of such amounts
as they would have received had the original payment which is required to be
returned or repaid as the result of a Repayment Event not occurred;

it being understood that if any Obligee shall fail to promptly pay any such
amount to the Agent, (i) the Agent may deduct such amount from any amount
payable thereafter to such Obligee under this Guaranty, and (ii) such amount not
paid to the Agent within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice from the
Agent, shall bear interest from the expiry of such thirty (30) day period at a
rate per annum equal to the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) from
time to time and shall be due and owing by such Obligee.

        13. Successors and Assigns. This Guaranty shall be binding upon the
Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the
Agent and the Obligees and their respective successors, transferees and assigns.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, each Obligee (as
applicable) may assign or otherwise transfer the Credit Agreement, the Notes,
the other Loan Documents, the 1995 Agreement, the Nova Agreement, the 2000
Agreement or any other agreement or note held by it evidencing, securing or
otherwise executed in connection with the Obligations, or sell participations in
any interest therein, to any other entity or other person, and such other entity
or other person shall thereupon become vested, to the extent set forth in the
agreement evidencing such assignment, transfer or participation, with all the
rights in respect thereof granted to such Obligee herein, all in accordance with
Section 15 of the Credit Agreement, Section 11.4 of the 1995 Agreement, Section
11.4 of the Nova Agreement and Section 11.4 of the 2000 Agreement. The Guarantor
may not assign any of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Guarantor may assign its Obligations to the surviving entity in its merger
with another domestic Subsidiary in accordance with Section 9.5 of the Credit
Agreement, Section 7.4 of the 1995 Agreement, Section 7.4 of the

<PAGE>

                                      -11-

Nova Agreement and Section 7.4 of the 2000 Agreement, provided that no Event of
Default exists and is continuing.

        14. Joinder Agreement and Affirmation. To the extent requested by the
Agent for the benefit of the Obligees, or by any Obligee, the Guarantor will
cause each Subsidiary (excluding any foreign Subsidiaries) assigned any of the
Guarantor's Obligations in accordance with Section 13, to execute and deliver to
the Agent for the benefit of the Obligees, (a) a Joinder Agreement and
Affirmation in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto, and (b) any other
instruments and documents as the Agent or any Obligee may reasonably require,
together with legal opinions in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Agent and the requesting Obligees, to be delivered to the Agent and the
Obligees opining as to authorization, validity and enforceability of such
Guaranty.

        15. Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this Guaranty nor consent to any departure by the Guarantor therefrom shall be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Agent, the
Required Lenders under the Credit Agreement, holders of 66 2/3% of the principal
amount of the 1995 Notes, holders of 66 2/3% of the principal amount of the Nova
Notes and holders of 66 2/3% of the principal amount of the 2000 Notes. No
failure on the part of the Agent or any Obligee to exercise, and no delay in

    be entitled to receive from, or will be required to pay to, Party B the fair
    market value for such termination, as determined by Party A in good faith
    and in accordance with market practice and its own customary procedures,
    upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events:

        respect to any scheduled amortization);
    (b) If Party A ceases to be a party to the Loan Agreement;

        to under the Loan Agreement;
    (d) If there is a default, an event of default, or other similar condition
        or event (however described) in relation to Party B under the Loan
        Agreement (without regard to the existence of any waiver or forbearance
        agreement with respect thereto); and
    (e) If the Loan Agreement is amended, restated, supplemented, or otherwise
        modified and Party A does not consent, in its sole discretion, to such

    discretion, following the occurrence of any one of such events through the
    Termination Date. A failure or delay in exercising the foregoing right to
    terminate will not be presumed to operate as a waiver, and a single or
    partial exercise of such right will not be presumed to preclude any
    subsequent or further exercise of that right.

     hereby waiving their right, if any, to recover any such damages.

     subsection 6(f):

              with respect to Party B, or an Illegality or Credit Event Upon
              Merger where Party B is the Affected Party, Party A will have the
              right (but not the obligation), without prior notice to Party B or
              any other person, to set-off any obligation of Party A or any of
              Party A's present or future Affiliates, branches, or offices owing
              to Party B, against any obligation of Party B owing to Party A or
              any of Party A's present or future Affiliates. branches, or
              offices (whether or not such obligations arise under this
              Agreement, whether or not matured, whether or not contingent, and
              regardless of the place of payment or booking office of the
              obligations). In order to enable Party A to exercise its rights of
              set-off, if an obligation is unascertained, Party A may in good
              faith estimate that obligation and set-off in respect of the
              estimate, subject to Party A accounting to Party B when the
              obligation is ascertained.

              Nothing in this Section 6(f) shall be effective to create a charge
              or other security interest. This Section 6(f) shall be without
              prejudice and in addition to any right of set-off, combination of
              accounts, lien, or other right to which any party is at any time
              otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract, or
              otherwise)."

 4.  By signing this Schedule, Party B acknowledges that it has received and
     understands the SunTrust Bank "Terms of Dealing for OTC Risk Management
     Transactions" and the "Risk Disclosure Statement for OTC Risk Management
     Transactions" (each attached hereto and incorporated by reference into this

                            SunTrust Bank ("SunTrust")
              Terms of Dealing for OTC Risk Management Transactions

In connection with the negotiation, entry into, and performance from time to
time of over-the-counter ("OTC") risk management transactions, please be advised
that:

SunTrust acts as principal only and does not act as advisor, agent, broker, or
fiduciary for or with respect to any counterparty (unless otherwise expressly
agreed in a written engagement letter).

SunTrust expects that its counterparties have the authority and capacity to
enter into and perform their obligations under their OTC risk management
transactions with SunTrust, and SunTrust relies on the express and implied
representations of its counterparties with respect thereto.

SunTrust expects that its counterparties possess adequate knowledge and
experience to assess independently, or with the assistance of their own
advisors, the merits and risks of each OTC risk management transaction that the
counterparty may from time to time enter into, amend, or terminate.

SunTrust endeavors to maintain the confidentiality of all confidential
counterparty information and expects its counterparties to do the same. Unless a
counterparty gives SunTrust written notice to the contrary, each counterparty
authorizes SunTrust and all SunTrust affiliates, including SunTrust Capital
Markets, Inc. (STCM), to share with each other confidential information
concerning a counterparty and/or its accounts for marketing or other purposes
from time to time. Any trade ideas, term sheets, and other similar documents
sent to counterparties by SunTrust are not to be shared with others.

SunTrust may pay fees, commissions, and other amounts to agents, brokers, and/or
other third parties in connection with OTC risk management transactions entered
into with counterparties. SunTrust considers the amount of such fees,
commissions, and other amounts to be confidential and does not disclose the same
to its counterparties.

SunTrust may from time to time receive orders for similar or identical
transactions, and SunTrust makes no representation with respect to execution
priorities.

STCM's Authorized Officers have the authority to bind SunTrust in connection
with OTC risk management transactions. A current list of Authorized Officers may
be obtained from STCM upon request.

OTC risk management obligations of SunTrust are not FDIC insured.

                            SunTrust Bank ("SunTrust")
          Risk Disclosure Statement for OTC Risk Management Transactions

Over-the-counter ("OTC") risk management transactions, like other financial
transactions, involve a variety of significant potential risks. OTC risk
management transactions generally include options, forwards, swaps, swaptions,
caps, floors, collars, combination and variations of such instruments, and other
executory contractual arrangements, and may involve interest rates, currencies,
securities, commodities, equities, credit, indices, and other underlying
interests.

Before entering into any OTC risk management transaction, you should carefully
consider whether the transaction is appropriate for you in light of your
experience, objectives, financial and operational resources, and other relevant
circumstances. You should also ensure that you fully understand the nature of
the transaction and contractual relationship into which you are entering and the
nature and extent of your exposure to risk of loss, which may significantly
exceed the amount of any initial payment or investment by you.

The specific risks presented by a particular OTC risk management transaction
necessarily depend upon the character of the specific transaction and your
circumstances. In general, however, all OTC risk management transactions involve
the risk of adverse or unanticipated market developments, risk of illiquidity
and credit risk, and may involve other material risks. Equity risk management
transactions may increase or decrease in value with a change in, among other
things, stock prices and interest rates which could result in unlimited loss. In
addition, you may be subject to internal operational risks in the event that
appropriate internal systems and controls are not in place to monitor the
various risks and funding requirements to which you are subject by virtue of
your activities in the OTC risk management and related markets. OTC risk
management transactions frequently are tailored to permit parties to customize
transactions to accomplish complex financial and risk management objectives.
Such customization can also introduce significant risk factors of a complex
character.

As in any financial transaction, you must understand the requirements (including
investment restrictions), if any, applicable to you that are established by your
regulators or by your Board of Directors or other governing body. You should
also consider the tax and accounting implications of entering into any risk
management or other transaction. To the extent appropriate in light of the
specific transaction and your circumstances, you should consider consulting such
advisers as may be appropriate to assist you in understanding the risks
involved. If you are acting in the capacity of financial adviser or agent, you
must evaluate the foregoing matters in light of the circumstances applicable to
your principal.

In entering into any OTC risk management transaction, you should also take into
consideration that, unless you and SunTrust have established in writing an
express financial advisory or other fiduciary relationship or you and SunTrust
have expressly agreed in writing that you will be relying on SunTrust's
recommendations as the primary basis for making your trading or investment
decisions, SunTrust is acting solely in the capacity of an arm's-length
contractual counterparty and not in the capacity of your financial advisor or
fiduciary. In addition, SunTrust or its affiliates may from time to time have
substantial long or short positions in and may make a market in or otherwise buy
or sell instruments identical or economically related to the OTC risk management
transaction entered into with you or may have an investment banking or other
commercial relationship with the issuer of any security or financial instrument
underlying an OTC risk management transaction entered into with you.

THIS BRIEF STATEMENT DOES NOT DISCLOSE ALL OF THE RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT
ASPECTS OF ENTERING INTO OTC RISK MANAGEMENT TRANSACTIONS. YOU SHOULD REFRAIN
FROM ENTERING INTO ANY SUCH TRANSACTION UNLESS YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND ALL SUCH
RISK AND HAVE INDEPENDENTLY DETERMINED THAT THE TRANSACTION IS APPROPRIATE FOR
YOU.

          benefits to which the Participant is entitled pursuant to the RBEP

                                                                   EXHIBIT 10.17

                 BARNES GROUP INC. EXECUTIVE SEPARATION PAY PLAN

1.      Purpose. The purpose of the Barnes Group Inc. Executive Separation Pay
Plan (the "Plan") is to provide appropriate benefits to eligible executives of
Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company") whose employment is terminated by the Company.

2.      Covered Employees. Full-time salaried employees of the Company who are
in salary grades 24 and above, and full-time salaried employees of the Company
who are in salary grades 18 through 23 who have at least six months of service,
are covered by the Plan. A person is considered to be a full-time employee if
the person is regularly scheduled to work at least 30 hours per week.

3.      Payment of Benefits. An employee covered under the Plan is entitled to
receive benefits under the Plan if his/her employment is terminated by the
Company; provided, however, that no benefits will be paid under the Plan if:
(a)     the termination action is determined by the Company to be based on
        misconduct of any type including, but not limited to, violation of any
        Company rules or policies, or activity which results in the conviction
        of a felony; or
(b)     the termination is the result of the sale of the stock or substantially
        all of the assets of a business unit of the Company and the employee is
        offered employment by the purchaser, within 30 days after the closing of
        the sale, in a position that is at least comparable to, and for
        compensation and benefits that are, in the aggregate, at least

<PAGE>

        substantially equivalent to, the employee's position, compensation and
        benefits with the Company prior to the sale.

4.      SEVERANCE PAY

4.1     A terminated employee who is entitled to receive benefits under this
        Plan is eligible to receive severance pay based on the following
        schedule:
        (a)     Grades 18-20: four months of base salary plus an additional two
                weeks of base salary for each year of service over five years up
                to a maximum total payment of six months of base salary.
        (b)     Grades 21-23: seven months of base salary.
        (c)     Grades 24 and above, except for the President and Chief
                Executive Officer: twelve months of base salary.
        The minimum severance pay benefit payable under this Plan shall be one
        month's base salary or the amount of accrued vacation, whichever is
        greater. The payment of more than the minimum severance pay benefit
        shall be contingent on the terminated employee's execution of a release
        of any claims in a form approved by the Company's General Counsel. For
        purposes of the Plan, "base salary" shall be deemed to mean the
        employee's base salary in effect immediately prior to termination and
        any severance payment shall be calculated on the basis of the employee's
        salary grade immediately prior to termination.

                                                                               2

<PAGE>

4.2     Payment shall be made on the terminated employee's regularly scheduled
        payroll payment dates as if he/she had continued as an employee and will
        be subject to normal deductions for items such as income taxes, Social
        Security, and Medicare.
4.3     Severance pay for a terminated employee who was in any of salary grades
        18 through 26 shall cease on the date that such terminated employee
        begins other employment, including but not limited to work for another
        party. The terminated employee shall promptly notify the Company in
        writing when he/she commences such employment.
4.4     Severance pay for a terminated employee who was in any of salary grades
        27 and above shall not cease on the date that such terminated employee
        begins other employment, including but not limited to work for another
        party, but shall continue throughout the entire severance period.

5.      Accrued Vacation A terminated employee entitled to receive benefits
        under this Plan will also be paid for any unused vacation or paid time
        off that he/she has accrued in accordance with Company policy prior to
        the termination date. Payment for such accrued unused vacation or paid
        time off shall be made in a lump sum, net of normal deductions for items
        such as income taxes, Social Security and Medicare, within five days
        after the employee's termination date.

                                                                               3

<PAGE>

6.      OTHER BENEFITS

6.1     If the terminated employee will receive more than the minimum severance
        pay benefit, pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof, then he/she may continue
        participation, on the same terms in effect immediately prior to
        termination, in the Company's medical, dental, group life, supplemental
        life, dependent life, accidental death and dismemberment insurance,
        flexible benefit (i.e., premium pass-through plan, health care
        reimbursement account and dependent care reimbursement account), and
        long term disability plans for the period during which he/she receives
        severance payments. If payments cease during but prior to the end of any
        month, coverage will continue until the end of the last month during
        which such terminated employee receives any severance payments.
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company reserves
        the right to discontinue or change the terms (including but not limited
        to the carrier) of any employee benefit plan. After severance payments
        cease, COBRA medical and dental coverage and the health care
        reimbursement account may be continued as required by law.
6.2     Except to facilitate benefit continuation as provided in Section 6.1
        hereof, a person's status as an employee shall cease upon the
        termination date and not continue during the period in which severance
        payments are made. Without limiting the foregoing, employment shall be
        terminated for purposes of the Guaranteed Stock Plan, any applicable
        pension or profit-sharing plan, stock option plans, and for all other
        purposes upon the termination date.

                                                                               4

<PAGE>

6.3     A terminated employee shall not be eligible to receive unemployment
        benefits for any period during which he/she receives severance benefits.

7.      ADMINISTRATION

7.1     Benefits Committee. The Plan is administered by the Benefits Committee
        of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Committee"). The Committee may
        promulgate rules or regulations for the administration of the Plan. The
        Committee shall, in its sole discretion, interpret and construe the
        Plan's terms and conditions, and determine an individual's eligibility
        for benefits. Any interpretations, constructions or determinations made
        by the Committee in good faith shall be final and binding.
7.2     Claims Procedure. If any person believes that he/she is not receiving
        any benefits to which he/she is entitled under the Plan, the person,
        after reviewing the matter with the human resource representative
        serving the person's place of work, may file a written claim with the
        Director, Compensation and Benefits, Barnes Group Inc., 123 Main Street,
        Bristol, Connecticut 06010, or such other person designated by the
        Benefits Committee, who shall respond to such claim in writing within 45

        such denial in writing to the Benefits Committee, c/o Barnes Group Inc.,
        123 Main Street, Bristol, Connecticut 06010. Any such appeal must be
        filed within 60 days after the denial of the claim. The Benefits
        Committee shall notify the claimant of its decision in writing within 60
        days after receiving the appeal.

                                                                               5

                                                               BARNES GROUP INC.

                                              MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

OUR BUSINESS

          Barnes Group is a diversified international manufacturer of precision
components and assemblies and distributor of industrial supplies. The Company is
comprised of three business segments. The Associated Spring segment is a
manufacturer of precision mechanical and nitrogen gas springs, retaining rings
and injection-molded plastic components that are used in a variety of
industries, including transportation, consumer goods, electronics and
telecommunications. The Barnes Aerospace segment supplies precision machined and
fabricated components and assemblies for commercial and military aircraft and
industrial gas turbines, as well as engine component overhaul and repair
services in support of the global airline industry. The Barnes Distribution
segment is an international distributor of MRO supplies and a full-service
provider of logistics management services for industrial, heavy equipment and
transportation maintenance markets. It also distributes close-tolerance
engineered metal components manufactured principally by Associated Spring.
Through these three businesses, Barnes Group helps its customers enhance their
competitiveness and responsiveness by realizing the benefits of Barnes Group's
manufacturing and logistics management capabilities.

KEY BUSINESS DRIVERS

          There are a number of end-market demand factors that impact sales in
each of the three businesses. Key sales drivers for Associated Spring are: light
vehicle production in North America and Europe, which correlates well with the
sales of automotive springs and with tool and die build, which impacts the
Company's nitrogen gas spring sales; sales of cell phone handsets and other
electronic products in the telecommunications, computer and optical device
markets; and sales of white goods, small engines, compressors, heavy duty trucks
and similar products that impact the Company's industrial springs.

          For original equipment manufacturer (OEM) components produced at
Barnes Aerospace, key sales drivers include new commercial and military aircraft
production and land-based industrial gas turbine deliveries. The number of
commercial aircraft in the active fleet and the number of revenue passenger
miles flown by the world's airlines are key drivers of sales for the Barnes
Aerospace overhaul and repair operations.

          General industrial activity in North America and Europe is the key
sales driver for Barnes Distribution, as Barnes Distribution's customer base is
well diversified through many different economic sectors.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

          The preparation of financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assump-tions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting
policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The
most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are
described below. Actual results could differ from such estimates.

          INVENTORY VALUATION

          Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method is used to value the majority of domestic inventories.
Provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated
net realizable value. Loss provisions, if any, on contracts are established when
reasonably expected. Loss provisions are based on the excess inventoriable costs
over the net revenues of the products or group of related products under
contract. The process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory
often requires the Company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning
future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold
in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect
estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future adjustments to these
provisions.

                                                                          Page 7

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

          BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

          Assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded
at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. At December 31, 2002,
the Company had $164.6 million of goodwill, representing the cost of
acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of
acquired companies. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) 142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing. The
assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of "reporting
units," as defined by SFAS 142. Management completed this assessment during the
second quarter of 2002 based on the best information available as of the date of
the assessment, which incorporated management assumptions about expected future
cash flows. Based on this assessment, there was no goodwill impairment in 2002.
Future cash flows can be affected by changes in the global economy and local
economies, industries and markets in which the Company sells products or
services, and the execution of management's plans, particularly with respect to
integrating acquired companies. There can be no assurance that future events
will not result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets.

          REORGANIZATION OF BUSINESSES

          The Company records a liability for reorganization initiatives at the
time that management approves and commits to a reorganization plan. Such a plan
identifies all significant actions to be taken and specifies an expected
completion date that is within a reasonable period of time. The liability
includes those costs that can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are
subject to adjustments based upon actual costs incurred (see "Recent Accounting
Changes" on page 16).

          PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

          Accounting policies and significant assumptions related to pension and
other postretirement benefits are disclosed in Note 10 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

          In 2002, the portfolio managers authorized to invest pension trust
funds were changed and the mix of assets in which managers invest was revised.
The following table provides a breakout of the new targeted mix of investments,
by asset classification, along with the historical rates of return for each
asset class and the long-term projected rates of return.

/(1)/ Historical returns based on the life of the respective index,
approximately 20 to 25 years.

          The historical rates of return were calculated based upon compounded
average rates of return of published indices. The fixed income investments
represent approximately 27% of the trust asset mix and are estimated to be 5% to
10% lower than the fixed income components of typical pension trusts. The fixed
income investments include a higher-than-average component of yield-aggressive
investments, including high-yield corporate bonds. Based on the overall
historical and projected rates of return, management is projecting the long-term
rate of return on pension assets to be 9.5%.

          A one-quarter percentage point change in the assumed long-term rate of
return would impact the Company's pretax income by approximately $0.8 million
annually. A one-quarter percentage point change in the discount rate would
impact the Company's pretax income by approximately $0.3 million annually. The
Company reviews these and other assumptions at least annually.

          The Company uses a calculated value to determine the market-related
value of pension plan assets. This approach results in a market-related value of
pension assets that differs from the fair

                                              MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

market value of plan assets. This difference results from the deferment in the
recognition of asset gains and losses above or below expected returns on assets
for a period of approximately five years. At December 31, 2002, the
market-related value of pension assets exceeded the fair market value by $70.0
million. This difference under SFAS 87 will increase pension expense by $3.1
million in 2003 and an additional $2.3 million in 2004.

          INCOME TAXES

          As of December 31, 2002, the Company had recognized $38.6 million of
deferred tax assets, net of valuation reserves. The realization of these
benefits is dependent on future taxable income.For those jurisdictions where the
expiration date of tax carry-forwards or the projected operating results
indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided.
Management believes that sufficient income will be earned in the future to
realize deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowances recorded. The
recognized net deferred tax asset is based on the Company's estimates of future
taxable income and its tax planning strategies. The realization of these
deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax codes, statutory tax rates
and future taxable income levels.

ACQUISITIONS

          During the past three years, the Company acquired a number of
businesses, which were accounted for using the purchase method. Accordingly, the
results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in the
consolidated results from their respective acquisition dates.

          In May 2000, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets and
liabilities of Curtis Industries, Inc. (Curtis) for $63.4 million. Curtis, a
distributor of MRO supplies and high-quality security products, was combined
with Bowman Distribution to form Barnes Distribution. This business combination
created a broader product offering, enhanced service capabilities and
opportunities for increased sales penetration. The combination also created
significant cost savings opportunities, primarily through headquarters and
distribution center consolidations and increased purchasing leverage. The
majority of these cost savings were realized in 2002.

          In connection with the Curtis acquisition, the Company incurred
certain integration costs. The integration plan included combining the
headquarters functions and consolidating warehousing and distribution networks.
As a result, the Company recorded total costs of $6.4 million, relating
primarily to lease consolidation costs, facility closure costs and reductions in
personnel. Costs of $4.7 million associated with the acquired business were
reflected as assumed liabilities in the allocation of the purchase price to net
assets acquired. The remaining integration costs of $1.7 million were reflected
in expenses in 2000. As of December 31, 2002, $1.5 million remained as
liabilities related primarily to future lease payments.

          In September 2000, the Company purchased substantially all of the
assets and liabilities of AVS/Kratz-Wilde Machine Company and Apex
Manufacturing, Inc. (Kratz-Wilde/Apex) for $40.9 million. Kratz-Wilde/Apex
fabricates and machines intricate aerospace components for jet engines and
auxiliary power units. These businesses are included in the Barnes Aerospace
segment. This acquisition augmented Barnes Aerospace by extending product depth
and customer penetration, and also provided an additional FAA-licensed aircraft
engine repair facility.

          In 2001, the Company completed two bolt-on acquisitions, for a
combined purchase price of $3.8 million. In January 2001, the Company acquired
Euro Stock Springs & Components Limited (Euro Stock). Euro Stock distributes
standard springs through catalogs to customers located primarily in Europe. This
business, which is included in the Barnes Distribution segment, expanded Barnes
Distribution's presence in Europe and added a new sales channel through Euro
Stock's product catalog. In November 2001, the Company acquired certain assets
of Forward Industries, L.L.C., and its subsidiary Forward Industries, Ltd.
Forward Industries designs and manufactures nitrogen gas springs that are used
in the appliance, automotive, heating and cooling and electrical industries.
This acquisition has been integrated with the Company's existing nitrogen gas
spring business and is included in the Associated Spring segment. The
acquisition broadened the nitrogen gas spring product line offering of
Associated Spring.

          In 2002, the Company completed two acquisitions for a total purchase
price of $34.0 million. Consideration for the acquisitions included cash of
approximately $31.0 million, of which $2.0 million

                                                                          Page 9

will be paid in two equal installments in April 2003 and April 2004, and
issuance of 119,048 shares of Barnes Group common stock (at a market value at
the time of the acquisition of approximately $3.0 million). In February 2002,
the Company acquired substantially all of the manufacturing assets of
Seeger-Orbis GmbH & Co. OHG of Germany (Seeger-Orbis) from TransTechnology
Corporation. Seeger-Orbis is a leading manufacturer of retaining rings used in a
number of transportation and industrial applications. The Seeger-Orbis
acquisition expanded Associated Spring's product line and geographic reach,
particularly into the automotive and industrial manufacturing markets of Western
Europe. In April 2002, the Company acquired Spectrum Plastics Molding Resources,
Inc. of Ansonia, Connecticut (Spectrum). Spectrum is a premier manufacturer of
plastic injection-molded components and assemblies that are used primarily in
the telecommunications, electronics, medical and consumer goods industries.
Spectrum, which is included in the Associated Spring segment, provides
Associated Spring with the capability of providing more complete product
solutions with discrete or continuous metal-in-plastic and plastic-on-metal
injection-molded components.

          The purchase price of each acquisition has been allocated to tangible
and intangible assets and liabilities of the businesses, based upon estimates of
their respective fair values. For acquisitions initiated prior to June 30, 2001,
the resulting goodwill had been amortized over a 40-year life. Beginning in
2002, goodwill is no longer amortized, as the lives are considered indefinite.
See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

          On February 6, 2003, the Company acquired Kar Products LLC of Des
Plaines, Illinois, and certain assets and liabilities of its Canadian business,
A.&H. Bolt & Nut Company Ltd. (Kar Products). Kar Products adds to the Barnes
Distribution segment a diversified customer base that operates in all 50 states,
Puerto Rico and Canada, further enhancing Barnes Distribution's international
presence and leadership position within the MRO market. The purchase price of
$78.5 million was paid through a combination of $60.0 million cash and $18.5
million (923,506 shares) of Barnes Group common stock. The Company expects to
achieve a number of post-acquisition cost savings and other synergies through
headquarters and infrastructure consolidation. The Company also anticipates that
the acquisition will be accretive in the first year.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

          The following table sets forth the Company's consolidated statement of
income data as a percentage of revenue:

================================================================

          Barnes Group reported record net sales of $784 million in 2002, an
increase of $15 million, or 2%, over 2001 net sales of $769 million. The sales
increase reflected the Company's recent acquisitions, which contributed $40
million, all to Associated Spring's sales, as well as organic growth in
Associated Spring. This growth was partially offset by a 9% decline in sales at
Barnes Aerospace, which coincides with a sharp decline in the commercial
aerospace markets, and a 4% sales decline at Barnes Distribution. The decline at
Barnes Distribution reflects the impact of adverse market conditions in the
manufacturing, industrial and transport services sectors. From a geographic
perspective, the Company's foreign sales increased 17% year-over-year, while
domestic sales decreased 3%.

                                              MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

          In 2001, Barnes Group net sales were up $29 million, or 4%, over 2000,
reflecting a sharp rise in sales at Barnes Aerospace and sales from the
Company's 2000 and 2001 acquisitions. This growth was partially offset by a
decline in transportation- and telecommunications-related sales at Associated
Spring and the adverse impact of weak economic conditions on Barnes
Distribution's sales. The businesses acquired in 2000 and 2001 provided
incremental sales of $61 million in 2001: $1 million to Associated Spring, $34
million to Barnes Aerospace and $26 million to Barnes Distribution.

          Operating income was $44.8 million in 2002, an increase of 11.2%
compared with $40.3 million in 2001. These results reflect higher operating
profit at Associated Spring and Barnes Distribution. The year-over-year increase
in operating profit was impacted positively by a $4.8 million pretax business
consolidation charge, relating primarily to the Associated Spring segment, taken
in the fourth quarter of 2001, which did not recur in 2002. In addition,
operating income in 2002 benefited from efficiencies gained from the actions
taken in this business consolidation. These improvements were partially offset
by lower profits at Barnes Aerospace due to lower sales volume and additional
severance expense, higher postretirement benefit expense at Associated Spring
and lower pension income Companywide. Pension income decreased by $1.2 million
due primarily to reduced investment performance of plan assets and a lower
discount rate. The cost of postretirement benefits, other than pensions,
increased $1.4 million due to increased benefit levels provided to certain U.S.
employees.

          Overall operating income margin was 5.7% in 2002 compared with 5.2% in
2001. While gross profit margin held steady at 32.4% in 2002, gross profit
margins improved at both Associated Spring and Barnes Distribution. The decline
in gross profit margin in Barnes Aerospace, due directly to the sales shortfall,
offset the improvements in the other two businesses. Total selling and
administrative expenses declined to 26.7% as a percentage of sales, from 27.2%
in 2001. In total dollars, selling and administrative expenses increased $0.2
million to $209.2 million in 2002, which included $5.8 million in selling and
administrative expenses related to the recent acquisitions, offset by the impact
of the $4.8 million fourth-quarter 2001 charge. Reductions in selling and
administrative expenses resulting from synergies realized from Barnes
Distribution's integration of Curtis were partially offset by the higher
pension, postretirement and other compensation costs, including the higher
severance expense at Barnes Aerospace.

          Operating income was $40.3 million in 2001, compared with $62.9
million in 2000. A number of items contributed to the operating income decline.
The primary factors were the impact of a weak industrial economy on sales volume
and a shift in the overall sales mix to lower-margin businesses. The $29 million
net sales increase was comprised of $61 million in incremental sales from the
2001 and 2000 acquisitions and a $31 million increase in the existing Aerospace
business, which was substantially offset by a $63 million sales decrease in the
higher-gross-margin Associated Spring and Barnes Distribution businesses. Also
impacting operating income were higher personnel costs, specifically health
insurance and pension costs. Selling and administrative expenses increased $20.5
million in 2001 over 2000, reflecting the fourth-quarter charge and the costs
attributable to the newly acquired businesses, as well as the continued
investment made in the sales, marketing and engineering functions throughout the
Company.

SEGMENT REVIEW

          Associated Spring sales for 2002 were $322 million, up $43 million, or
15%, from sales of $279 million in 2001. Sales were a record $327 million in
2000. Sales in 2002 increased over 2001 due to higher light vehicle production
in the domestic transportation markets as well as from incremental sales from
the acquisitions of Forward Industries, Seeger-Orbis and Spectrum, which in the
aggregate totaled $40 million. Offsetting these increases was a sharp drop in
organic sales of telecommunications and electronics products, as sales to those
end markets fell by over 40% in 2002. Domestic sales at Associated Spring grew
by approximately 5% in 2002, while foreign sales increased by approximately 38%
to $120 million. Sales grew sharply in Europe in 2002, reflecting the
Seeger-Orbis acquisition and organic growth in nitrogen gas spring sales from
Sweden, but were lower in Asia, reflecting the weakness in the
telecommunications and electronics markets. Associated Spring's sales fell in
2001 compared with 2000, due to the sharp contraction in domestic light vehicle
production, a weak domestic economy and a worldwide decline in
telecommunications and electronics sales.

          Associated Spring reported operating profit of $28.1 million in 2002,
compared with $19.4 million in 2001 and $44.0 million in 2000. The increase in
operating profit in 2002 reflects

                                                                         Page 11

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

the higher sales volume; higher profits resulting from actions taken since late
2000 to reduce the business's cost structure; operational improvements,
particularly in Mexico; and the absence of a $4.6 million charge taken in 2001
to reduce the business unit's infrastructure. This increase was partially offset
by a decline in sales of more profitable telecommunications and electronics
products, and one-time costs related to the purchase accounting step-up of
inventory to fair value at Seeger-Orbis. In 2002, the closure of the Texas
spring plant was completed, with retained business from the Texas plant being
relocated to other Associated Spring facilities, improving their capacity
utilization. As of December 31, 2002, the remaining accrual balance of $0.5
million related primarily to facility holding costs for the Texas plant, which
is currently held for sale. Management anticipates that the impact of the
transfer of business from the Texas plant will continue to be accretive to
operating profit in 2003. The decrease in operating profit in 2001 reflects the
sales volume decline and, in particular, the significant shortfall in the more
profitable electronics business. In addition, operating profit was significantly
impacted in the fourth quarter of 2001 from expenses immediately recognized at
the time of the announcement of the Texas plant closure.

          Barnes Aerospace sales for 2002 were $183 million, down $17 million,
or 9%, from a record $200 million in 2001. Sales in 2000 totaled $135 million.
The sales decline in 2002 largely reflected the sharp decrease in global new
commercial aircraft deliveries and continued aircraft order cancellations or
deferrals by the major airlines in the wake of the events of September 11, 2001.
The 2002 decline also reflects lower overhaul and repair sales, as a significant
number of aircraft were removed from the active fleet in response to continued
low passenger traffic. These factors were partially offset by higher direct and
indirect military sales. Sales increased in 2001 versus 2000 as Barnes Aerospace
benefited from the successful cultivation of new markets and customers and from
approximately $34 million in incremental sales related to the acquisition of
Kratz-Wilde/Apex. Total orders for 2002 were $178 million, compared with $216
million in 2001. Order backlog declined to $152 million at December 31, 2002,
from $159 million at December 31, 2001. Both orders and order backlog were
affected by the same factors that negatively impacted sales in 2002.

          Barnes Aerospace operating profit was $10.8 million in 2002, compared
with $16.4 million in 2001 and $8.0 million in 2000. Operating profit fell in
2002 primarily as a result of the decline in sales volume. In addition, during
2002, management addressed what is likely to be a protracted recovery in the
aerospace industry by reducing employment by approximately 20%, resulting in
severance expenses of $1.3 million. Management believes that these headcount
reductions and other steps to reduce costs, such as work furloughs and reduced
overtime, have properly positioned the business for the current economic
environment. Operating profit increased in 2001 versus 2000, reflecting the
sharply higher sales volume and the benefit of lean manufacturing initiatives
completed throughout the year.

          Sales at Barnes Distribution were $287 million in 2002, down $11
million, or 4%, from $298 million in 2001; sales in 2000 were $291 million.
Sales fell in 2002 due to weak economic conditions within the manufacturing and
industrial sectors in the United States and many international markets, which
have persisted since late 2000. This was partially offset by new sales
initiatives, including an increased focus on national and regional account
development, which generated more than $3 million in sales during 2002. This
initiative, combined with electronic commerce initiatives, will be a growth
driver in 2003 and beyond. Sales increased in 2001 versus 2000 as a result of
incremental sales from acquisitions of $26 million, which was largely offset by
a $19 million decline in organic sales driven by the weak economic conditions
noted above.

          Despite the year-over-year decline in sales, operating profit at
Barnes Distribution increased to $7.5 million in 2002 from $5.5 million in 2001.
The increase largely reflects higher operating efficiency as synergies from the
Curtis acquisition were successfully realized. Operating profit also benefited
from an improvement in gross profit margin stemming from selective price
increases and lower product procurement costs. Operating profit decreased in
2001 from $12.9 million in 2000 as a result of lower organic sales volume, which
more than offset the benefits from incremental sales volume and early
realization of synergies from the Curtis acquisition.

OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE

          Other income totaled $3.7 million in 2002, compared with $3.9 million
in 2001 and $4.8 million in 2000. The decrease in other income in 2002, compared
with 2001, was due to foreign exchange transaction gains of $1.2 million in 2002
compared with gains of $1.9 million in 2001,

offset by higher equity income from the Company's NASCO joint venture. The
foreign exchange gains related primarily to exposures on U.S. dollar-denominated
financial instruments, primarily in the Company's Brazil operation. The
Company's policy is to hedge foreign currency transaction exposure except in
locations where the local currency has historically weakened against the U.S.
dollar. The decrease in 2001, compared with 2000, was due to lower equity income
from NASCO, offset in part by higher net foreign exchange transaction gains.

          Lower interest expense in 2002, compared with 2001, was a result of
lower market interest rates and a fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreement
that collectively more than offset the impact of an increase in average
borrowings. Other expenses declined in 2002 due to an accounting change that
eliminated goodwill amortization of $4.2 million in 2001. This change is more
fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

          Interest expense and other expenses increased in 2001 as a result of
acquisitions. Interest expense increased due to significantly higher borrowings,
offset in part by lower average interest rates. Other expenses increased with
the additional goodwill amortization associated with the acquisitions.

INCOME TAXES

          The Company's effective tax rate was 18.0% in 2002, compared with
18.5% in 2001 and 26.6% in 2000. The decline in the tax rate in both 2002 and
2001 is due to a significant shift in the overall mix of income to a higher
percentage of foreign income, in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the
U.S. statutory tax rate. In addition, the lower tax rate in 2002 reflects the
benefit of an ESOP dividend distribution tax deduction. The 2002 tax deduction
includes a retroactive election for the 2001 dividend distribution, the result
of an amendment to the Company's Retirement Savings Plan (RSP). The effective
tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22.0% to 25.0% in 2003, assuming a
single-year deduction for the RSP dividends and an anticipated shift in earnings
to countries with higher tax rates, primarily the United States.

NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER SHARE

          Consolidated net income was $27.2 million in 2002, $19.1 million in
2001 and $35.7 million in 2000. Basic earnings per share was $1.45 for 2002,
compared with $1.03 in 2001 and $1.92 in 2000. Diluted earnings per share was
$1.42 for 2002, $1.01 for 2001 and $1.90 in 2000.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

          Management assesses the Company's liquidity in terms of its overall
ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investing activities. Of
particular importance in the management of liquidity are cash flows generated
from operating activities, capital expenditure levels, dividends, capital stock
transactions, effective utilization of surplus cash positions overseas and
adequate bank lines of credit.

          The Company's ability to generate cash from operations in excess of
its internal operating needs is one of its financial strengths. Management
continues to focus on cash flow and working capital and anticipates that
operating activities in 2003 will provide sufficient cash to take advantage of
opportunities for organic business expansion and to meet the Company's current
financial commitments. Future acquisitions are expected to be financed through a
mix of internal cash, borrowing and equity.

          Operating activities are the principal source of cash flow for the
Company, generating $54.4 million in 2002, $65.0 million in 2001 and $51.9
million in 2000. Operating cash flow in 2002 reflects higher net income when
compared with 2001. The reduction in depreciation and amortization was due to
the absence of $4.2 million of goodwill amortization in 2002, as discussed in
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, depreciation
declined $0.7 million due to lower capital spending over the past three years
and the retirement of older assets. Management continues to stress the need for
effective working capital management, which contributed to positive cash flow in
2002. Significant progress was made in reducing inventory levels, primarily at
Barnes Distribution and Barnes Aerospace. Accounts payable decreased in part due
to reduced inventory purchases, combined with the impact, in 2002, of aggressive
working capital management at the end of 2001. The increase in deferred taxes
reflects operating loss carry-forwards generated in 2002 that will be utilized
in the future and the impact of a minimum pension liability adjustment. In 2001,
the increase

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

in operating cash flow was due primarily to significant improvements in working
capital, which more than offset the lower net income in that year.

          Investing activities used cash of $48.0 million in 2002, compared with
$26.0 million in 2001 and $134.5 million in 2000. Investing activities in 2002
included the acquisitions of Seeger-Orbis and Spectrum. The Seeger-Orbis
acquisition was funded from cash held by the Company outside the United States.
In 2001, funds used for two bolt-on acquisitions were offset in part by a
favorable purchase price adjustment received in 2001 on the Kratz-Wilde/Apex
acquisition. The significant cash use in 2000 is attributable to the purchases
of Curtis and Kratz-Wilde/Apex. The Company's capital spending program focuses
on business growth and improvements in productivity and quality. In 2002,
capital spending was reduced in response to the economic downturn. The Company
expects to increase capital spending in 2003 to roughly 2001 levels.

          Net cash used by financing activities was $24.4 million in 2002 and
$13.3 million in 2001, compared with net cash provided by financing activities
of $64.8 million in 2000. Cash from financing activities in 2002 included $4.7
million of cash proceeds from the termination of an interest rate swap. This
cash, combined with cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from
additional borrowings and excess cash, was used to fund acquisitions and capital
expenditures and to pay dividends. Cash dividends were held at $0.80 per share.
Total cash used to pay 2002 dividends to stockholders was $15.0 million. In
2001, proceeds from the sale of a cross-currency debt swap, combined with strong
cash flow from operating activities, were used in part to fund capital
expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase the Company's stock and reduce debt. In
2000, the increase in borrowings reflected the issuance of additional long-term
debt to fund business acquisitions as well as to supplement cash generated by
operating activities.

          The Company maintains bank-borrowing facilities to supplement internal
cash generation. At December 31, 2002, the Company had a $150 million borrowing
facility under a three-year revolving credit agreement, of which $32 million was
borrowed at an interest rate of 3.05%. Additionally, the Company had $6.0
million in borrowings under uncommitted short-term bank credit lines, at an
interest rate of 2.38%. The revolving credit borrowing facility was signed in
June 2002 and replaced a revolving credit facility that was due to expire in
December 2002.

          Borrowing capacity is limited by various debt covenants. The most
restrictive covenant requires the Company to maintain a ratio of Total Debt to
EBITDA, as defined in the revolving credit agreement, of not more than 3.0 times
at December 31, 2002. The actual ratio at December 31, 2002, was 2.66 times and
would have allowed additional borrowings of $27.6 million. In conjunction with
the Kar Products acquisition, the Company amended the revolving credit
agreement, pursuant to which the ratio was increased to 3.25 times for the first
three quarters of 2003 and will return to 3.0 times at December 31, 2003, a
ratio the Company expects to meet. In connection with the financing of the
acquisition, the Company borrowed an additional $56 million under the revolving
credit facility.

          At December 31, 2002, the Company held $28.4 million in cash and
equivalents, predominately in its non-U.S. subsidiaries. Although repatriation
of certain non-U.S. cash balances to the U.S. could have adverse tax
consequences, cash held outside the U.S. is available to fund international cash
requirements, including acquisitions.

          The Company believes its credit facilities, coupled with cash
generated from operations, are adequate for its anticipated future requirements.

          In November 2000, the Company financed a portion of the Curtis and
Kratz-Wilde/Apex business acquisitions by issuing $60 million of privately
placed Senior Notes (Notes) with three insurance companies. These Notes bear an
annual fixed rate of 9.34% and are payable in three equal annual installments
beginning in 2006. In August 2002, the Company terminated an interest rate swap
agreement that had effectively converted the Notes to variable-rate debt. In
connection with the swap agreement termination, the Company received a cash
payment of $4.7 million. The corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of
the debt is being amortized against interest expense over the remaining life of
the Notes.

          The funded status of the Company's pension plans is dependent upon
many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of market
interest rates. Recent declines in the value of securities traded in equity
markets and declines in long-term interest rates have had a negative impact

                                              MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

on the funded status of the plans. In 2002, no contribution was required and no
cash contribution was made to any of the U.S. qualified pension plans.
Furthermore, no significant cash contributions to the qualified plans are
anticipated in 2003. In accordance with SFAS 87, "Employers' Accounting for
Pensions," the Company recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment for
under-funded plans as of December 31, 2002, through an after-tax charge of $16.8
million to accumulated other non-owner changes to equity.

MARKET RISK

          Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from
adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. The Company's
financial results could be impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates and commodity price changes. The Company uses financial
instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative or
trading purposes.

          The Company's long-term debt portfolio consists of fixed-rate and
variable-rate instruments and is managed to reduce the overall cost of borrowing
while also minimizing the effect of changes in interest rates on near-term
earnings. In August 2002, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement that effectively converts $18.8 million of its fixed-rate Senior Notes
to variable-rate debt. This interest swap agreement had a positive impact on
2002 earnings, reducing interest expense by $0.1 million.

          The Company's primary interest rate risk is derived from its
outstanding variable-rate debt obligations. At December 31, 2002, the result of
a hypothetical 1% increase in the average cost of the Company's variable-rate
debt, including the interest rate swap agreement, would have reduced annual
pretax profit by $0.6 million.

          At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the Company's fixed-rate debt
was $153.0 million, compared with its carrying amount of $156.9 million. The
Company estimates that a 1% decrease in market interest rates at December 31,
2002, would have increased the fair value of the Company's fixed-rate debt to
$158.5 million.

          The Company has manufacturing, sales and distribution facilities
around the world and thus makes investments and conducts business transactions
denominated in various currencies. The currencies of the locations where the
Company's business operations are conducted are the U.S. dollar, Singapore
dollar, Euro, British pound, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Canadian dollar,
Swedish krona and Chinese renminbi. The Company is exposed primarily to U.S.
dollar-denominated financial instruments at its international locations. A 10%
adverse change in all currencies at December 31, 2002, would have resulted in a
$1.0 million loss in the fair value of those financial instruments.

          Foreign currency commitments and transaction exposures are managed at
the operating units as an integral part of their businesses in accordance with a
corporate policy that addresses acceptable levels of foreign currency exposures.
The Company does not hedge its foreign currency net investment exposure. To
reduce foreign currency exposure in countries where the local currency is
strengthening against the U.S. dollar, management has converted U.S
dollar-denominated cash and short-term investments to local currency and is
using forward currency contracts for other U.S. dollar-denominated assets in an
effort to reduce the effect of the volatility of changes in foreign exchange
rates on the income statement. In weaker currency countries, such as Brazil and
Mexico, management continues to invest excess cash in U.S. dollar-denominated
instruments.

          The Company's exposure to commodity price changes relates primarily to
certain manufacturing operations that utilize high-grade steel spring wire and
titanium. The Company manages its exposure to changes in those prices through
its procurement and sales practices. The Company is not dependent upon any
single source for any of its principal raw materials or products for resale, and
all such materials and products are readily available.

INFLATION

          Management believes that during the 2000-2002 period, inflation did
not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

                                                                         Page 15

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

RECENT ACCOUNTING CHANGES

          The Company adopted SFAS 141, "Business Combinations," and SFAS 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS 141 requires companies to account
for acquisitions entered into after June 30, 2001, using the purchase method and
establishes criteria to be used in determining whether acquired intangible
assets are to be recorded separately from goodwill. SFAS 142 sets forth the
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and other
intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but instead are
evaluated at least annually for impairment by comparing the carrying value to
the fair value at the reporting unit level. Intangible assets with finite lives
will be amortized over their useful lives. SFAS 142 is effective for
acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001, and, as of January 1, 2002, became
effective for all other prior acquisitions.

          In August 2001, SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets," was issued. This statement was effective on January 1,
2002, for the Company. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact
on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

          In April 2002, SFAS 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and
64, amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections," was issued.
The standard eliminates an inconsistency between the required accounting for
sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease
modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback
transactions. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

          In June 2002, SFAS 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities," was issued. This statement provides guidance on the
recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with exit or disposal
activities and requires that such liabilities be recognized when incurred. This
statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after
December 31, 2002, and does not impact the Company's existing accruals. Adoption
of this standard may impact the timing of recognition of costs associated with
future exit and disposal activities.

          In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 45 (FIN 45),
"Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others." FIN 45 expands disclosure
requirements and requires that a guarantor recognize, at fair value, a liability
for its obligation under a guarantee. The recognition and measurement
requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002. Management believes that FIN 45 will not have
a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or
cash flows. The Company has complied with the expanded disclosure requirements.

          In December 2002, SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock Compensation -
Transition and Disclosure," was issued. This statement addresses transition
provisions and disclosure requirements. The Company has complied with the
amended disclosure requirements.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

          This Annual Report may contain certain forward-looking statements as
defined in the Public Securities Litigation and Reform Act of 1995. These
forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause
actual results to differ materially from those contained in the statements.
Investors are encouraged to consider these risks and uncertainties as described
within the Company's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, including the following: the ability of the Company to integrate
newly acquired businesses and to realize acquisition synergies on schedule;

sold by the Company; the Company's success in identifying and attracting
customers in new markets; the Company's timely ability to develop new and
enhanced products to meet customers' needs; the effectiveness of the Company's
marketing and sales programs; increased competitive activities that could
adversely affect customer demand for the Company's products; changes in economic
and political conditions worldwide and in the locations where the Company does
business; interest and foreign exchange rate fluctuations; and regulatory
changes.

                                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All dollar amounts included in the notes are stated in thousands except per
share data and the tables in Note 17.)

1.        SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

          General: The preparation of financial statements requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year
amounts to conform to the current year presentation.

          Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. Intercompany
transactions and account balances have been eliminated. The Company accounts for
its 45% investment in the common stock of NASCO, a suspension spring company
jointly owned with NHK Spring Co., Ltd. of Japan, under the equity method. The
NASCO investment of $9,908 and $9,431 as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respec-
tively, is included in other assets. Other income in the accompanying income
statements includes income of $1,090, $408 and $1,611 for the years 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively, from the Company's investment in NASCO. The Company
received dividends from NASCO totaling $44, $464 and $666 in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

          Revenue recognition: Sales and related cost of sales are recognized
when products are shipped to customers and title has passed.

          Cash and cash equivalents: Cash in excess of operating requirements is
invested in short-term, highly liquid, income-producing investments. All highly
liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less are cash
equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at fair value.

          Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
The last-in, first-out (LIFO) method was used to accumulate the cost of the
majority of U.S. inventories, which represent 66% of total inventories. The cost
of all other inventories was determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method. Loss provisions, if any, on contracts are established when reasonably
expected. Loss provisions are based on the excess inventoriable costs over the
net revenues of the products or group of related products under contract.

          Property, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment is stated
at cost. Depreciation is recorded over estimated useful lives, ranging from 20
to 50 years for buildings and three to 17 years for machinery and equipment. The
straight-line method of depreciation was adopted for all property, plant and
equipment placed in service after March 31, 1999. For property, plant and
equipment placed into service prior to April 1, 1999, depreciation is calculated
using accelerated methods.

          Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the net
assets of companies acquired in business combinations. In accordance with SFAS
142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective January 1, 2002, goodwill
is not being amortized, as the lives are considered indefinite. For periods
prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill acquired since 1970 but prior to July 1,
2001, was being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. Annually,
goodwill is subject to impairment testing in accordance with SFAS 142. Based on
this assessment, there was no goodwill impairment in 2002.

                                                                         Page 21

===============================================================================

          Derivatives: The Company has manufacturing, sales and distribution
facilities around the world and thus makes investments and conducts business
transactions denominated in various currencies. The Company is also exposed to
fluctuations in interest rates and commodity price changes. These financial
exposures are monitored and managed by the Company as an integral part of its
risk management program. The Company uses financial instruments to hedge its
exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates
but does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. The Company
also does not use derivatives to manage commodity exposures or hedge its foreign
currency net investment exposure.

          The Company adopted SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities," as amended, on January 1, 2001. The standard requires
that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
The accounting for changes in the fair value depends on how the derivative is
used and designated. In accordance with the transition provisions of SFAS 133,
the Company recorded a $400 gain on January 1, 2001, which was entirely offset
by a loss recorded on the re-measurement of underlying balance sheet items.
There was no transition adjustment to other non-owner changes to equity.

          Foreign currency contracts qualify as fair value hedges of
unrecognized firm commitments, or cash flow hedges of recognized assets and
liabilities or anticipated transactions. Gains and losses on derivatives are
recorded directly to earnings or other non-owner changes to equity, depending on
the designation. Amounts recorded to other non-owner changes to equity are
reclassified to earnings in a manner that matches the earnings impact of the
hedged transaction. Any ineffective portion is recorded directly to earnings.
The Company's policy for classifying cash flows from derivatives is to report
the cash flows consistent with the underlying instrument.

          At December 31, 2002, the fair value of derivatives held by the
Company was a net liability of $1,833. During 2002, losses of $279 included in
other non-owner changes to equity were reclassified to earnings. Amounts in
other non-owner changes to equity expected to be reclassified to earnings within
the next year are not material. During 2002, gains or losses related to hedge
ineffectiveness were immaterial. Foreign currency transaction gains included in
income were $1,172, $1,874 and $1,012 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively,
inclusive of gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives.

          Foreign currency translation: The majority of the Company's foreign
subsidiaries use the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and
liabilities of foreign operations are translated at year-end rates of exchange;
revenues and expenses are translated at average annual rates of exchange. The
resulting translation gains and losses are reflected in accumulated other
non-owner changes to equity within stockholders' equity.

          Stock-Based Compensation: The Company has stock-based employee
compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 15. The Company

          The weighted-average grant date fair values of options granted during
2002, 2001 and 2000 were $5.37, $4.77 and $4.44, respectively.

2.        ACQUISITIONS

          During the past three years, the Company has acquired a number of
businesses, all of which were accounted for using the purchase method.
Accordingly, the results of operations of the acquired companies have been
included in the consolidated results from their respective acquisition dates.

          In May 2000, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets and
liabilities of Curtis for $63,363. Curtis, a distributor of MRO supplies and
high-quality security products, was combined with Bowman Distribution to form
Barnes Distribution. This business combination created a broader product
offering, enhanced service capabilities and increased sales penetration for the
business segment. The combination also created significant cost savings
opportunities, primarily through headquarters and distribution center
consolidations and increased purchasing leverage. A majority of these cost
savings were realized in 2002. In connection with the Curtis acquisition, the
Company incurred certain integration costs which are more fully discussed in
Note 8.

          In September 2000, the Company purchased substantially all of the
assets and liabilities of Kratz-Wilde Machine Company and Apex Manufacturing
Inc. (Kratz-Wilde/Apex) for $40,938. Kratz-Wilde/Apex fabricates and machines
intricate aerospace components for jet engines and auxiliary power units. These
businesses are included in the Barnes Aerospace segment. This

                                                                         Page 23

acquisition augmented Barnes Aerospace by extending product depth and customer
penetration, and also provided an additional FAA-licensed aircraft engine repair
facility.

          In 2001, the Company completed two bolt-on acquisitions for a combined
purchase price of $3,830. In January 2001, the Company acquired Euro Stock. Euro
Stock distributes standard springs through catalogs to customers located
primarily in Europe. This business, which is included in the Barnes Distribution
segment, expanded Barnes Distribution's presence in Europe and added a new sales
channel through Euro Stock's product catalog. In November 2001, the Company
acquired certain assets of Forward Industries, L.L.C., and its subsidiary
Forward Industries, Ltd. Forward Industries designs and manufactures nitrogen
gas springs that are used in the appliance, automotive, heating and cooling and
electrical industries. This acquisition has been integrated with the Company's
existing nitrogen gas spring business and is included in the Associated Spring
segment. The acquisition broadened the nitrogen gas spring product line offering
of Associated Spring.

          In 2002, the Company completed two acquisitions for a total purchase
price of $34,029. Consideration for the acquisitions included cash of
approximately $31,029, of which $2,000 will be paid in two equal installments in
April 2003 and April 2004, and issuance of 119,048 shares of Barnes Group common
stock (at a market value at the time of the acquisition of approximately
$3,000). In February 2002, the Company acquired substantially all of the
manufacturing assets of Seeger-Orbis GmbH & Co. OHG of Germany (Seeger-Orbis)
from TransTechnology Corporation. Seeger-Orbis is a leading manufacturer of
retaining rings used in a number of transportation and industrial applications.
The Seeger-Orbis acquisition expanded Associated Spring's product line and
geographic reach, particularly into the automotive and industrial manufacturing
markets of Western Europe. In April 2002, the Company acquired Spectrum Plastics
Molding Resources, Inc. of Ansonia, Connecticut (Spectrum). Spectrum is a
premier manufacturer of plastic injection-molded components and assemblies that
are used primarily in the telecommunications, electronics, medical and consumer
goods industries. Spectrum, which is included in the Associated Spring segment,
provides Associated Spring with the capability of providing more complete
product solutions with discrete or continuous metal-in-plastic and
plastic-on-metal injection molded components.

          The purchase prices for these acquisitions have been allocated to
tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the businesses based upon
estimates of their respective fair values.

          The 2002 and 2001 acquisitions provided incremental sales of $39,659
in 2002. The 2001 and 2000 acquisitions provided incremental sales of $60,860 in
2001. Pro forma net profit has not been presented for the 2002 and 2001
acquisitions because the results would not be significantly different than
historical results.

          The following table reflects the operating results of the Company for
the year ended December 31, 2000, on a pro forma basis, which gives effect to
the acquisitions of the two businesses acquired in 2000 at the beginning of the
year. The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the operating
results that would have occurred had the acquisitions been effective January 1,
2000; nor are they intended to be indicative of results that may occur in the
future. The underlying pro forma information includes the amortization expense
associated with the assets acquired, the Company's financing arrangements,
certain purchase accounting adjustments and related income tax effects. The pro
forma results do not include the effects of synergies and cost reduction
initiatives related to the acquisitions.

3.        SUBSEQUENT EVENT

          On February 6, 2003, the Company acquired Kar Products, a leading
full-service distributor of MRO supplies to industrial, construction,
transportation and other markets. The acquisition expands both the geographic
scope and product line reach of the Barnes Distribution segment. Kar Products
has a diversified customer base that operates in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and
Canada, further enhancing

Barnes Distribution's leadership position within the MRO market and
its international presence. The purchase price of $78,500 was financed through a
combination of $4,000 of cash, $56,000 of debt and $18,500 (923,506 shares) of
Barnes Group common stock. The Company expects to achieve a number of
post-acquisition cost savings and other synergies through headquarters and
infrastructure consolidation. The costs related to the consolidation efforts
have not been finalized and therefore are not included in the pro forma data
that follows.

          The Company is in the process of obtaining third-party valuations of
certain assets acquired with Kar Products. Thus, the allocation of the purchase
price is subject to refinement. Any amounts attributable to such assets are
expected to be finalized during 2003. The following pro forma data summarize the
combined balance sheets of the Company and Kar Products as if the acquisition
had occurred at December 31, 2002.

===============================================================================

          During 2002, an additional $1,035 of goodwill was recognized related
to Associated Spring's November 2001 acquisition of Forward Industries assets,
related primarily to an adjustment to the fair value of the equipment acquired,
and $6,837 million for the April 2002 acquisition of Spectrum. No goodwill
resulted in connection with the acquisition of Seeger-Orbis. Goodwill related to
the Barnes Aerospace 2000 acquisition of Kratz-Wilde/Apex decreased $515 in
2002, the result of the reduction of accrued acquisition costs. Also in 2002,
goodwill was reduced by $2,599 related to Barnes Distribution's Curtis
acquisition. This reduction relates primarily to an adjustment to the
reorganization accrual and inventory valuation.

          In 2001, Associated Spring's goodwill related to the acquisition of
the nitrogen gas spring business was reduced by $1,272, reflecting the
adjustment to accrued acquisition costs. Initial goodwill of $152 was recorded
for the acquisition of certain assets of Forward Industries. The $6,275 increase
in goodwill resulted from the completion of the purchase price allocation to the
Barnes Aerospace segment valuation of inventories, backlog and fixed assets,
offset by a $700 purchase price adjustment. Barnes Distribution's business
reorganization of Curtis, acquired in 2000, and the completion of the purchase
price allocation resulted in $2,332 of additional goodwill being recognized. In
addition, $898 of goodwill was recorded in Barnes Distribution related to the
acquisition of Euro Stock.

          At December 31, 2002, $80,524 of goodwill is tax deductible.

          Acquired Intangible Assets: Intangible assets, other than goodwill,
consist of registered trademarks, purchased in the acquisition of the nitrogen
gas spring business in 1999, and registered trademarks and patents purchased in
the 2002 acquisitions of Seeger-Orbis and Spectrum. The amounts attributable to
these intangible assets are included in the purchase price allocations.

          Trademarks acquired with the purchase of the nitrogen gas spring
business are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 30 years. At
December 31, 2002, the gross carrying amount of trademarks was $4,395 and
accumulated amortization was $488. The aggregate amortization expense is
approximately $146 in each of the years 2003 through 2007.

          Intangible assets that were acquired with Seeger-Orbis were $3,047 and
consist of trademarks and patents with estimated useful lives of 30 and 15
years, respectively. The accumulated amortization at the end of 2002 was $197.
The aggregate amortization expense is approximately $236 in each of the years
2003 through 2007.

          Intangible assets that were acquired with Spectrum were $2,400 and
consist primarily of trade-marks with estimated useful lives of 30 years. The
accumulated amortization at the end of 2002 was $57. The aggregate amortization
expense is $87 in each of the years 2003 through 2007.

7.        ACCRUED LIABILITIES

          Accrued liabilities at December 31 consisted of:

8.        BUSINESS REORGANIZATION ACCRUALS

          Business reorganization accruals are included in accrued liabilities.

          In connection with the Curtis acquisition in May 2000, the Company
incurred certain integration costs. The Company recorded total costs of $6,405
related primarily to lease consolidation costs, facility closure costs and
reductions in personnel. At December 31, 2001, $5,537 remained as liabilities
related to future lease payments and facility closure costs. During 2002, $2,010
of the accrual was utilized in connection with warehouse closures. In addition,
$2,030 of accruals were reduced with a corresponding reduction to goodwill. As
of December 31, 2002, an accrual of approximately $1,497 remained which related
to future lease payments, which will continue through the remaining lives of the
leases.

          During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded pretax charges
of $4,842, primarily for Associated Spring, related to actions aimed at reducing
the Company's infrastructure. Such actions included the closure of an Associated
Spring plant in Texas. Additional costs to transfer certain retained business to
other Associated Spring plants in 2002 were not accruable in 2001 and were
recognized as incurred in 2002. The 2001 charges included $179 recorded in cost
of sales and $4,663 in selling and administrative expenses, and related to net
workforce reductions of approximately 122 salaried and hourly employees, the
elimination of approximately 128,500 square feet of facilities and the disposal
of assets. At December 31, 2001, the accrual balance of $2,223 related to
facility holding costs and severance. During 2002, $1,695 of the accrual was
utilized. As of December 31, 2002, the remaining balance of $528 related to
post-closure holding costs for the Texas plant, which is currently for sale.

9.        DEBT AND COMMITMENTS

          Long-term debt at December 31 consisted of:

                                                    2002                 2001

=============================================================================

          The 7.13% Notes are payable in four equal annual installments of
$6,250 that began on December 5, 2002. The 7.66% Notes are payable in 2007. The
7.80% Notes are payable in three equal annual installments beginning in 2008.
The 9.34% Notes are payable in three equal installments beginning in 2006.

          In July 2001, the Company borrowed Yen 3,000 million, under a term
loan facility with The Development Bank of Singapore Limited. The loan is
payable in ten semi-annual installments of Yen 87.3 million that began on
December 28, 2001, with a balloon payment of Yen 2,214.3 million due June 30,
2006. The borrowing has a stated interest rate of 2.15%. In connection with the
Yen borrowing, the Company entered into a series of forward currency exchange
contracts, a form of derivative, that effectively convert the Yen principal
payments to Singapore dollar payments. The forward contracts are cash flow
hedges, and increased the effective interest rate of the borrowing to 5.5%. On
December 30, 2002, the Company prepaid the next four consecutive semi-annual
installments totaling Yen 349.2 million (U.S. equivalent $2,917). As a result of
this prepayment, there are no scheduled principal payments due on the Yen note
until June 2005. The Company also

                                                                         Page 27

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

paid $475 in settlement of the corresponding forward contracts. The fair value
of the remaining forward contracts at December 31, 2002, was a liability of
approximately $2,029.

          The fair values of these Notes are determined using discounted cash
flows based upon the Company's estimated current interest cost for similar types
of borrowings. The carrying values of other long-term debt and notes payable
approximate their fair market values.

          In June 2002, the Company replaced its revolving credit agreement with
a new three-year agreement with 11 banks that allows borrowings up to $150,000
under Notes due June 14, 2005. A fee of 0.45% per annum is paid on the unused
portion of the commitments. The Company had $32,000 borrowed under this
agreement at an interest rate of 3.05% at December 31, 2002. The Company also
has available approximately $15,000 in uncommitted short-term bank credit lines,
of which $6,000 and $5,500 was borrowed at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The interest rate on these borrowings was 2.38% and 2.78% at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

          The Industrial Revenue Bonds, due in 2008, have variable interest
rates. The interest rates on this borrowing were 1.70% and 1.80% at December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

          The Company's long-term debt portfolio consists of fixed-rate and
variable-rate instruments and is managed to reduce the overall cost of borrowing
and to mitigate fluctuations in interest rates. Interest rate fluctuations
result in changes in the market value of the Company's fixed-rate debt. In
August 2002, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, a form of
derivative, which effectively converts $18,750 of 7.13% fixed-rate Senior Notes
to variable-rate debt equal to LIBOR plus 425 basis points. The effective rate
of the borrowing was 5.71% on December 31, 2002. This interest rate contract is
a fair value hedge, which is effective in offsetting fluctuations in the fair
value of the debt instrument. The gains and losses on the interest rate contract
are recorded to earnings and are offset by gains and losses recorded on the
re-measurement of the underlying debt. The fair value of the swap is determined
based upon current market prices and was approximately $278 at December 31,
2002.

          The Company assumed $2,750 of debt related to capital leases with the
acquisition of Spectrum in April 2002. The weighted average interest rate on
these borrowings was 7.81% at December 31, 2002. This debt has an interest rate
equalization prepayment penalty.

          In August 2002, the Company terminated its $60,000 interest rate swap
dated July 2001. This agreement had converted $60,000 of fixed-rate 9.34% debt
to floating rate at LIBOR plus 276 basis points. The Company received a payment
of $5,286 at termination. The payment represented $4,702 for the fair value of
the swap plus $584 for accrued interest at the time of termination. The
accumulated adjustment to the carrying value of the debt is being amortized in
accordance with the terms of the underlying debt, which effectively reduces the
fixed rate of the debt to 7.84%.

          At December 31, 2002, the Company classified $6,000 of borrowings
under lines of credit due within one year as long-term debt. The Company has
both the intent and the ability, through its revolving credit facility, to
refinance this amount on a long-term basis.

          Long-term debt, excluding the fair value of the swap and the deferred
gain on the terminated swap, is payable as follows: $6,837 in 2003, $6,884 in
2004, $46,389 in 2005, $39,089 in 2006, $44,606 in 2007 and $72,500 thereafter.

          In addition, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling
$3,668 at December 31, 2002.

          The Company's debt agreements contain financial covenants that require
the maintenance of interest coverage and leverage ratios, and minimum levels of
net worth. The agreements also place certain restrictions on indebtedness,
capital expenditures and investments by the Company and its subsidiaries. Such
covenants and restrictions determine the amount of borrowings, dividends or
treasury stock purchases the Company can make under such agreements.

          Under the most restrictive borrowing capacity covenant in any
agreement, $27,600 of additional capacity was available at December 31, 2002.
Under the most restrictive net worth covenant in any agreement, $8,409 was
available for dividends or acquisitions of common stock at December 31, 2002.
The future level of dividend payments is a function of future net income and the
issuance of common stock. The acquisition of Kar Products included the issuance
of $18,500 of Company common stock on February 6, 2003, which increased equity
and the amount of net worth available for dividends dollar for dollar.

                                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

          As of December 31, 2002, the Company is required to maintain a ratio
of Total Debt to EBITDA, as defined in the revolving credit agreement, of not
more than 3.0 times. This ratio requirement will increase to 3.25 at March 31,
2003, and will return to 3.0 at December 31, 2003. The actual ratio at December
31, 2002, was 2.66 times.

          Interest paid was $9,496, $16,076 and $17,945 in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The amount paid in 2002 reflects the $4,702 of cash received for
the swap termination. Interest capitalized was $128, $163 and $188 in 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively, and is being depreciated over the lives of the related
fixed assets.

10.       PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

          Defined benefit pension plans cover a majority of the Company's
worldwide employees at Associated Spring and the Company's Corporate Office and
a substantial portion of the employees at Barnes Distribution. Plan benefits for
salaried and non-union hourly employees are based on years of service and
average salary. Plans covering union hourly employees provide benefits based on
years of service. The Company funds U.S. pension costs in accordance with the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). Plan assets
consist primarily of common stocks and fixed income investments, including
616,310 shares of Company stock. Additionally, the Company has defined
contribution plans covering a majority of the employees of Barnes Aerospace,
certain field sales employees of Barnes Distribution's U.S. operation, employees
of Spectrum, non-union employees of Barnes Distribution Canada and union
employees of Associated Spring-Milwaukee. Company contributions under these
plans are based primarily on the performance of the business units and employee
compensation. The Spectrum defined contribution plan was terminated effective
January 1, 2003. Contribution expense under these defined contribution plans was
$1,727, $1,803 and $1,447 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Most U.S.
salaried and non-union hourly employees are eligible to participate in the
Company's 401(k) program. See Note 15 for further discussion of this plan.

          In accordance with SFAS 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," the
Corporation has recorded a non-cash minimum pension liability adjustment for
underfunded plans of $25,920 at December 31, 2002, representing the excess of
the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO") over previously recorded
pension cost liabilities. The minimum pension liability adjustment is included
in accrued retirement benefits on the balance sheet. An after-tax charge of
$16,822 is included in accumulated other non-owner changes to equity, which is
part of shareholders' equity. The principal cause of the accrual for a minimum
pension liability adjustment was the decline in the value of equity securities
held by the pension trusts.

          The Company provides certain other medical, dental and life insurance
postretirement benefits for a majority of its retired employees in the U.S. and
Canada. It is the Company's practice to fund these benefits as incurred.

          A reconciliation of the beginning benefit obligations to the ending
benefit obligations follows:

          The Company's accumulated postretirement benefit obligations,
exclusive of pensions, take into account certain cost-sharing provisions. The
annual rate of increase in the cost of covered benefits (i.e., healthcare cost
trend rate) is assumed to be 14% at December 31, 2002, decreasing gradually to
an ultimate rate of 5% at December 31, 2012. A one percentage point change in
the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would have changed the ABO by
approximately $1,490 at December 31, 2002, and would have changed the 2002
aggregate of the service and interest cost components of postretirement benefit
expense by approximately $45.

=============================================================================

          The deferred income tax assets will be realized through reversals of
existing taxable temporary differences with the remainder, net of the valuation
allowance, dependent on future income. Management believes that sufficient
income will be earned in the future to realize the remaining net deferred income
tax assets. Tax loss carry-forwards of $67,523 have remaining carry-forward
periods ranging from two years to unlimited. The Company has tax credit
carry-forwards of $4,097, with remaining carry-forward periods ranging from one
to 10 years.

          The Company has not recognized deferred income taxes on $149,937 of
undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries, since such earnings
are considered to be reinvested indefinitely. If the earnings were distributed
in the form of dividends, the Company would be subject, in certain cases, to
both U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. Determination of the
amount of this unrecognized deferred income tax liability is not practicable.

          A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the
consolidated effective income tax rate follows:

at a cost of $1,147, $8,798 and $9,197, respectively. These amounts exclude
shares issued and reacquired in connection with certain stock-for-stock
exercises under the Company's stock option plans. These reacquired shares were
placed in treasury.

          The Company has a shareholder rights plan under which each share of
common stock contains one right (Right) that entitles the holder to purchase one
one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for
$200. The Rights generally will not become exercisable unless and until, among
other things, any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 35% or more
of the outstanding stock. The Rights are generally redeemable at $0.01 per Right
at any time until 10 days following a public announcement that a 35% or greater
position in the Company's common stock has been acquired and will expire, unless
earlier redeemed or exchanged, on December 23, 2006.

          If, following the acquisition of 35% or more of the outstanding shares
of the Company's common stock, the Company is acquired in a merger or other
business combination, or 50% or more of the Company's assets or earnings power
is sold or transferred, each outstanding Right becomes exercisable for common
stock or other securities of the acquiring entity having a value of twice the
exercise price of the Right.

14.       PREFERRED STOCK

          At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had 3,000,000 shares of
preferred stock authorized, none of which were outstanding.

          Most U.S. salaried and non-union hourly employees are eligible to
participate in the Company's 401(k) plan. Effective April 1, 2001, the 401(k)
plan, previously called the Barnes Group Inc. Guaranteed Stock Plan (GSP), was

          Incentive stock rights under the 1991 Plan (rights) and restricted
stock awards under the 2000 Plan and Key Plan (awards) entitle the holder to
receive, without payment, one share of the Company's common stock after the
expiration of the vesting period. Certain rights are also subject to the
satisfaction of established performance goals. Additionally, holders of stock
units and rights are credited with dividend equivalents, which are converted
into additional units or rights, as the case may be. All rights have up to a
five-year vesting period. In 2002, 213,300 rights and awards were granted;
14,609 rights and awards were credited to holders for dividend equivalents;
25,028 rights and awards, which include dividend equivalents, were converted to
an equivalent number of shares of common stock; and 16,000 rights and awards
were forfeited. As of December 31, 2002, there were 451,857 rights and awards
outstanding.

          Under the Non-Employee Director Deferred Stock Plan each non-employee
director is granted the right to receive 6,000 shares of the Company's common
stock upon retirement. There were 6,000, 6,000 and 12,000 shares granted to new
directors in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. There are 54,000 shares reserved
for issuance under this plan.

          Total shares reserved for issuance under all stock plans aggregated
5,653,650 at December 31, 2002.

16.       AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING

          Net income per common share is computed in accordance with SFAS 128,
"Earnings per Share." Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings
per share reflect the assumed exercise and conversion of all dilutive
securities. Shares held by the RSP are considered outstanding for both basic and
diluted earnings per share. There are no adjustments to net income for purposes
of computing income available to common stockholders for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. A reconciliation of the average number of
common shares outstanding used in the basic and diluted EPS computation follows:

17.       INFORMATION ON BUSINESS SEGMENTS

          The Company's reportable segments are strategic business groups that
offer different products and services. Each segment is managed separately
because each business requires different technology and marketing strategies.
Specifically, the Company operates three reportable business segments, as
follows:

          Associated Spring manufactures precision mechanical and nitrogen gas
springs, manifold systems and other close-tolerance engineered metal components,
principally for the electronics, telecommunications and transportation markets.
Associated Spring's custom metal parts are sold in the U.S. and through its
international subsidiaries. International manufacturing operations are located
in Brazil, Sweden, Canada, Mexico, Germany, Singapore and China.

          Barnes Aerospace supplies precision machined and fabricated components
and assemblies for the aerospace and industrial gas turbine industries.
Additionally, it refurbishes jet engine components for many of the world's
commercial airlines and the military. Barnes Aerospace's operations are
primarily in the U.S., with additional locations in Europe and Singapore. Its
markets are located primarily in the U.S., Europe and Asia.

          Barnes Distribution is an international distributor of MRO supplies
and a full-service provider of logistics management services for industrial,
heavy equipment and transportation maintenance markets. Additionally, it
distributes close-tolerance engineered metal components, principally
manufactured by Associated Spring. Barnes Distribution, formerly known as Bowman
Distribution, was formed from the combination of the Curtis acquisition and
Bowman Distribution. Barnes Distribution's operations and markets are located
primarily in the U.S., with additional locations in Canada, Europe, Asia, Mexico
and Brazil. As indicated in Note 3, the Company acquired Kar Products, a leading
full-service distributor of MRO supplies, on February 6, 2003. Kar Products will
be included in the Barnes Distribution segment.

          The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based
on the operating profit of the respective businesses, which includes net sales,
cost of sales, selling and administrative expenses and certain components of
other income and other expenses, as well as the allocation of corporate overhead
expenses.

          The equity income from the Company's investment in the NASCO joint
venture is incorporated into the segment results of Associated Spring. Sales
between the business segments and between the geographic areas in which the
businesses operate are accounted for on the same basis as sales to unaffiliated
customers. Additionally, revenues are attributed to countries based on location
of manufacturing or distribution facilities.

office space and equipment. As discussed in Note 9, the Company assumed certain
debt related to capital leases with the acquisition of Spectrum. The balance of
this debt at December 31, 2002, was $2,350. Rent expense was $10,257, $9,942 and
$9,127 for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Minimum rental commitments under
noncancellable leases in years 2003 through 2007 are $7,784, $6,816, $5,776,
$4,843 and $1,960 and $7,187 thereafter.

          RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN

          The Company continues to guarantee a minimum rate of return on certain
pre-April 2001 assets of its 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the Plan). This
guarantee will become a liability for the Company only if, and to the extent
that, the value of the related Company stock does not cover the guaranteed asset
value when an employee who had invested in the Barnes Group stock investment
election or vested in the Company match, which is paid in Barnes Group stock,
withdraws from the Plan.

          The following table provides a number of hypothetical market values of
the Company's stock compared to the estimated guarantee amounts based on those
market values:

- ---------------------------------------------------
                    $     25.00           $      30
                          20.00                 400
                          15.00               4,200
                          10.00              13,100
                           5.00              22,400
                           0.00              33,300

          At December 31, 2002, the value of the Company's guarantee on these
assets was approximately $320.

          RESTRICTIONS ON STOCK CONSIDERATION FOR SPECTRUM

          The sole shareholder of Spectrum received 119,048 shares of the
Company's common stock as partial consideration for Spectrum. For the one-year
period following the required holding period under the federal securities laws,
the sole shareholder has agreed not to sell the Company shares received in the
acquisition at a price below $25.20 per share without the consent of the
Company. In the event he sells any of the shares during that period with the
consent of the Company or during the one month following that period, the
Company will pay to him an amount equal to the difference between $25.20 per
share and a lesser price at which he sells such shares.

          PRODUCT WARRANTIES

          The Company provides product warranties in connection with the sale of
products. Product warranty liabilities were not significant as of December 31,
2002 and 2001.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF BARNES GROUP INC.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Barnes
Group Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, No. 142, "Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets," effective January 1, 2002.
