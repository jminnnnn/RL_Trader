                                     PART I

Item 1. Business.

            The Company was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1925. The
Company is in three businesses: Associated Spring, a manufacturer of custom-made
springs and other close-tolerance engineered metal components; Barnes Aerospace,
a manufacturer of precision machined and fabricated assemblies for the aircraft
and aerospace industries and a refurbisher of jet engine components; and Bowman
Distribution, a distributor of consumable repair and replacement products for
industrial, heavy equipment, and transportation maintenance markets.*

            Associated Spring. Associated Spring manufactures a wide variety of
custom metal parts for mechanical and electrical purposes. It is equipped to
produce a broad array of springs requiring precision engineering, as well as an
extensive variety of precision metal components and assemblies. Its products
range in size from fine hairsprings for instruments to large springs for heavy
machinery, and its output of a given metal part may vary in amount from a few
units to hundreds of millions. Associated Spring does not produce leaf springs
or bed springs.

             Associated Spring is also engaged in the manufacture and
distribution of nitrogen gas springs which are sold under the Company's
Hyson(TM) and Kaller(R) trademarks.

             Associated Spring's custom metal parts are sold in the United
States and through the Company's foreign subsidiaries to manufacturers in many
industries, chiefly for use as components in their own products. Custom metal
parts are sold primarily through Associated Spring's sales employees. In view of
the diversity of functions which its custom metal parts perform, Associated
Spring's output is characterized by little standardization, with the major
portion being manufactured to customer specifications.

            Associated Spring's customer base is large and diverse, including
manufacturers of industrial and textile machinery, motors, generators,
electronic equipment, aircraft, diesel and other internal combustion engines,
household appliances and fixtures, hardware, office equipment, agricultural
equipment, railroad equipment, general machinery and scientific instruments. The
automotive and electronic industries are the largest markets for its products.

- -----------------
* As used in this annual report, "Company" refers to the registrant and its
consolidated subsidiaries except where the context requires otherwise, and
"Associated Spring," "Barnes Aerospace," and "Bowman Distribution" refer to the
above-defined businesses, but not to separate corporate entities.


                                       1
<PAGE>   3
            Associated Spring has manufacturing operations in the United States,
Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Singapore, and Sweden. The Company has retained a
minority interest of 15% in its former subsidiary in Argentina.

            The Company is a partner in a joint venture corporation in the
United States with NHK Spring Co., Ltd. of Japan. The joint venture corporation,
NHK-Associated Spring Suspension Components Inc. ("NASCO"), has a manufacturing
facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky. It manufactures and sells hot-wound coil
springs for automotive suspension systems and counterbalance torque bars for
trunk lids. Barnes Group owns a minority interest of 45% in NASCO.

            Barnes Aerospace. Barnes Aerospace is engaged in the fabrication and
precision machining of components for turbine engines and airframes, the
overhaul and repair of turbine engine components, and contract manufacturing.
The Windsor, Advanced Fabrications, Windsor Airmotive and Ceramics Divisions
constitute the Barnes Aerospace Group.

            The Windsor Division, located in Windsor, Connecticut, manufactures
machined parts as well as assemblies. It specializes in the machining of
difficult-to-process aircraft engine superalloys. Manufacturing processes
include computer numerically controlled machining, electrical discharge
machining, laser drilling, rotary, continuous dress and creep-feed grinding,
multi-axis milling and turning, and automated de-burring. Customers include gas
turbine engine manufacturers for commercial and military jets as well as
land-based turbines.

            The Advanced Fabrications Division consists of two facilities
located in Lansing, Michigan, and Ogden, Utah. Both plants specialize in hot,
cold and superplastic forming and fabricating titanium and other
high-temperature alloys such as hastelloy and inconel. Complex components, kits
and assemblies produced by this division are used in aircraft engine and
airframe applications. Additional key processes include diffusion bonding, laser
and water jet cutting, complex assembly, multi-axis milling, and welding.
Advanced Fabrications' customers include airframe and gas turbine engine
manufacturers for commercial and military jets.

            The Windsor Airmotive Division, with facilities located in Windsor,
Connecticut and Singapore, specializes in the overhaul and repair of turbine
engine components including major high- and low-pressure cases, seal fin and
knife edge restoration, rotating and non-rotating air seals and internal case
supports. Processes performed at these facilities include electron beam welding,
gas tungsten and metal arc welding, plasma coating, vacuum brazing,
non-destructive testing, water jet cleaning, milling and turning. Customers
include worldwide major airlines and engine overhaul businesses and the United
States military.


                                       2
<PAGE>   4
            The Ceramics Division, located in Windsor, Connecticut, provides
contract manufacturing services for high technology manufacturing industries.
Various offload and just-in-time processes are performed in a facility which
includes clean room space.

            Bowman Distribution. Bowman Distribution is engaged in distributing
in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Ireland and
France, a variety of replacement parts, industrial maintenance supplies, and
related value-added services, including inventory management and procurement.

            Bowman Distribution is also engaged in the distribution of die
springs and nitrogen gas springs which are sold under the Company's Raymond
registered trademark, and certain standard parts consisting primarily of coil
and flat springs which are sold under the Company's SPEC registered trademark,
through its Raymond Distribution business. These products are manufactured
primarily by Associated Spring.

            Except as indicated above, the products sold by Bowman Distribution
are generally not manufactured by the Company, but are obtained from a number of
outside suppliers. Except where there is high brand awareness, the vast majority
of these products are repackaged and sold under Bowman's labels.

            Sales by Bowman Distribution are primarily to industrial and food
processing plants, chemical and petrochemical process industries, contractors,
new car dealers, garages, service stations, operators of vehicle fleets,
railroads, electric utilities and airline ground maintenance facilities.

            Segment Analysis. The analysis of the Company's revenue from sales
to unaffiliated customers, operating profit and assets by industry segments as
well as revenues from sales to unaffiliated customers and long-lived assets by
geographic area appearing on pages 22 through 24 of the Company's 1999 Annual
Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13 to this report, is incorporated
by reference.

            Competition. The Company competes with many other companies, large
and small, engaged in the manufacture and sale of custom metal parts (including
aerospace components). The Company believes Associated Spring is the largest
domestic manufacturer of precision springs used for mechanical purposes. The
Company also faces active competition in the products sold by Bowman
Distribution. The principal methods of competition for the Company's three
businesses include service, quality, price, reliability of supply, and also, in
the case of Associated Spring and Barnes Aerospace, technology and design.

            Backlog.  The backlog of the Company's orders believed to be firm
amounted to $135,647,000 at the end of 1999, as compared with $169,883,000 at
the end of 1998.  Of the 1999 year-end backlog, $79,900,000 is attributable
to the Barnes


                                       3
<PAGE>   5
Aerospace Group and all of the balance is attributable to the Associated Spring
Group. $10,762,000 of Barnes Aerospace's backlog is not expected to be shipped
in 2000. Substantially all of the remainder of the Company's backlog is expected
to be shipped during 2000.

            Raw Materials and Customers. None of the Company's divisions or
segments is dependent upon any single source for any of its principal raw
materials or products for resale, and all such materials and products are
readily available. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of total sales in
1999. Automotive manufacturers and manufacturers of electronic products are
important customers of Associated Spring. Sales by Barnes Aerospace to three
manufacturers in the aerospace industry accounted for approximately 51% of its
business. Bowman Distribution is not dependent on any one or a few customers for
a significant portion of its sales.

            Research and Development. Although most of the products manufactured
by the Company are custom parts made to the customers' specifications, the
Company is engaged in continuing efforts aimed at discovering and implementing
new knowledge that is useful in developing new products or services or
significantly improving existing products or services. The Company spent
approximately $4,272,000 on its research and development activities in 1999, as
compared to expenditures of approximately $3,673,000 in 1998 and $3,625,000 in
1997. There were no significant customer-sponsored research and development
activities.

            Patents and Trademarks. Patents, licenses, franchises and
concessions are not material to any of the Company's businesses.

            Employees. As of the date of this report, the Company employs
approximately 4,000 people.

            Environmental Laws. Compliance with federal, state, and local laws
which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into
the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has
not had a material effect and is not expected to have a material effect upon the
capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Company.


Item 2. Properties.

            The Company and its operating subsidiaries conduct business at 18
manufacturing plants and 22 warehouses at various locations throughout the
world. All of the plants, except the two locations in Singapore, and 5 of the
warehouses are owned. Associated Spring-Asia has a long-term lease on the land
but owns the building. Of the properties that are owned, none is subject to any
encumbrance. A listing of the principal facility locations of each of the
Company's businesses is set forth below. In 1999, the Company closed a
manufacturing facility located in Arden, North Carolina.

SCHEDULED A:

                                                        As of November 12, 1999

Dear Sirs:

      3031786 Nova Scotia Company (the "Company"), a Nova Scotia company, and
Barnes Group Inc. (the "Guarantor"), a Delaware corporation (as to Sections 2, 7
and 8 hereof only), hereby agree with you as follows:

SECTION 1. PURCHASE AND SALE OF NOTES

      1.1 Issue of Notes.

            (a) The Company will issue U.S. $24,500,000 in aggregate principal
amount of its 7.66% Senior Notes due November 12, 2007 (herein called the "7.66%
Notes"). Each 7.66% Note will bear interest on the unpaid principal balance
thereof from the date of the 7.66% Note at the rate of 7.66% per annum (computed
on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), payable semi-annually
on the twelfth day of May and the twelfth day of November in each year,
commencing with the payment date next succeeding the date of the 7.66% Note,
until the principal amount shall be due and payable, and will bear interest,
payable on demand, on any overdue payment (including any overdue prepayment) of
principal or premium and (to the extent permitted by law) on any overdue payment
of interest at a fluctuating rate per annum, to be adjusted daily, equal to the
greater of (a) the rate announced publicly by Citibank, N.A. in New York, New
York from time to time as its prime rate, and (b) 9.66% per annum (but in no
event
<PAGE>   6
higher than the maximum rate permitted by law); and will mature on November 12,
2007. The 7.66% Notes will be registered notes in the form set out in Exhibit
B-1.

            (b) The Company will issue U.S. $45,500,000 in aggregate principal
amount of its 7.80% Senior Notes due November 12, 2010 (herein called the "7.80%
Notes" and, together with the 7.66% Notes, the "Notes"). Each 7.80% Note will
bear interest on the unpaid principal balance thereof from the date of the 7.80%
Note at the rate of 7.80% per annum (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of
twelve 30-day months), payable semi-annually on the twelfth day of May and the
twelfth day of November in each year, commencing with the payment date next
succeeding the date of the 7.80% Note, until the principal amount shall be due
and payable, and will bear interest, payable on demand, on any overdue payment
(including any overdue prepayment) of principal or premium and (to the extent
permitted by law) on any overdue payment of interest at a fluctuating rate per
annum, to be adjusted daily, equal to the greater of (a) the rate announced
publicly by Citibank, N.A. in New York, New York from time to time as its prime
rate, and (b) 9.80% per annum (but in no event higher than the maximum rate
permitted by law); and will mature on November 12, 2010. The 7.80% Notes will be
registered notes in the form set out in Exhibit B-2.

            (c) For the purpose only of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act
(Canada), whenever interest is to be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year,
the yearly rate of interest to which the rate determined pursuant to such
calculation is equivalent is the rate so determined multiplied by the actual
number of days in the calendar year in which the same is to be ascertained and
divided by 360.

            (d) The obligations of the Company pursuant to the Notes and this
Agreement are guaranteed by the Guarantor pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement
substantially in the form of Exhibit C (the "Guaranty").

      1.2 The Closing.

      The Company agrees to sell to you and you agree to purchase from the
Company, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the principal
amount of each series of the Notes set forth opposite your name on Exhibit A
hereto at 100% of the principal amount thereof.

      The closing of your purchase shall be held at 10:00 a.m. on November 12,
1999 ("Closing Date") at the office of Day, Berry & Howard LLP, CityPlace I,
25th Floor, Hartford, Connecticut 06103-3499. At the closing the Company will
deliver to you, unless you otherwise request, a single Note in each maturity
purchased in the principal amount of such purchase, dated the Closing Date and
payable to you, or your nominee, as set forth in Exhibit A, against payment in
United States Dollars in immediately available funds.

      1.3 Purchase for Investment.


                                     - 2 -
<PAGE>   7
      You represent to the Company that (i) you are on "accredited investor"
within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, and (ii) you are purchasing the Notes for investment
for your own account and the account of your affiliated entities and with no
present intention of distributing or reselling the Notes or any part thereof to
anyone other than an affiliated entity, but without prejudice, however, to your
right at all times to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Notes
under a registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under a
registration exemption available under that Act. You acknowledge receipt of the
Private Placement Memorandum and the opportunity to ask questions of Senior
Management of the Company and the Guarantor in the course of conducting your due
diligence. It is understood that, in making the representations set out in
Sections 2.9 and 2.11, the Company is relying, to the extent applicable, upon
your representation as aforesaid.

      1.4 Failure to Deliver.

      If, at the closing, the Company fails to tender to you the Notes to be
purchased by you or if the conditions specified in Section 3 have not been
fulfilled, you may thereupon elect to be relieved of all further obligations
under this Agreement. Nothing in this Section shall operate to relieve the
Company from any of its obligations hereunder or to waive any of your rights

            (a)   Exhibit D to this Agreement correctly identifies (i) each of
                  the Guarantor's active Subsidiaries (indicating which

                  incorporation and the percentage of its Voting Stock owned by

                  Subsidiary), and (ii) each of the Guarantor's or Company's
                  Affiliates (other than Subsidiaries) which is a corporation or
                  partnership or which is a holder of 5% or more of the Voting
                  Stock of the Guarantor or Company and the nature of the
                  affiliation.

            (b)   The Guarantor and each Subsidiary is the legal and beneficial
                  owner of all of the shares of Voting Stock it purports to own
                  of each Subsidiary, free and clear in each case of any Lien.
                  All such shares have been duly issued and are fully paid and

            (c)   The Company has no Subsidiaries.

            (d)   As of September 30, 1999, the Guarantor's Foreign Subsidiaries

      2.2 Corporate Organization and Authority.

      The Guarantor, the Company, and each Subsidiary of either,

            (a)   is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
                  standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation,

            (b)   has all requisite power and authority and, except as disclosed
                  on Exhibit D, all necessary licenses, permits, franchises and

                  Properties and to carry on its business as now conducted and
                  as presently proposed to be conducted, and

            (c)   has duly qualified and is authorized to do business and in
                  good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction
                  where the character of its Properties or the nature of its
                  activities makes such qualification necessary and where the
                  failure to be so qualified would have a material adverse
                  effect on the Guarantor's, the Company's or such Subsidiary's
                  business or financial position.

      2.3 Business, Property, Indebtedness and Liens.

            (a)   The Private Placement Memorandum previously delivered to you,
                  as supplemented by the Guarantor's report on Form 8-K dated
                  August 30, 1999, correctly describes the general nature of the
                  business and principal Properties of the Guarantor, the
                  Company and the Subsidiaries of each.

            (b)   Exhibit D correctly lists all outstanding Indebtedness for
                  borrowed money (including all Capitalized Leases) of, and all
                  Liens (other than those (x) permitted by clauses (i) - (v) of
                  Section 7.6(a) and (y) those on Property which individually
                  does not have a Fair Market Value in excess of $500,000 and
                  which, when aggregated with other Property subject to Liens
                  not included pursuant to this clause (y), does not have a Fair
                  Market Value in excess of $2,000,000) on Property of, the
                  Guarantor, the Company and the Subsidiaries of either. Neither
                  the Guarantor, the Company nor any Subsidiary has agreed or
                  consented to cause or permit in the future (upon the happening
                  of a contingency or otherwise) any of its Property, whether
                  now owned or hereafter acquired, to be subject to a Lien not
                  permitted by Section 7.6(a).

      2.4 Financial Statements.

            (a)   The consolidated balance sheets of the Guarantor and its
                  Consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31 in the years 1994,



                                      -5-
<PAGE>   10
                  1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998 and the related statements of
                  income, retained earnings and changes in financial position or
                  cash flows for the fiscal years ended on such dates, all
                  accompanied by reports thereon containing opinions without
                  qualification, except as therein noted, by
                  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent certified public
                  accountants, and the consolidated balance sheets of the
                  Guarantor and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of June 30,
                  1999 and the related statements of income, retained earnings
                  and cash flows for the 6-month period then ended, certified by
                  the Guarantor's chief financial officer or chief accounting
                  officer, have been prepared in accordance with generally
                  accepted accounting principles consistently applied, and
                  present fairly the financial position of the Guarantor and its
                  Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and the results of
                  their operations for such periods; provided, however, that the
                  financial statements as of and for the period ended June 30,
                  1999 have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
                  accounting principles for interim financial statements.

            (b)   Since December 31, 1998 there have been no materially adverse
                  changes in the Properties, business, prospects, profits or
                  financial condition of the Company or the Guarantor or the
                  Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

      2.5 Full Disclosure.

      The financial statements referred to in Section 2.4 do not, nor does this
Agreement or the Private Placement Memorandum, as supplemented by the
Guarantor's report on Form 8-K dated August 30, 1999, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit a material fact necessary to make the
statements contained therein or herein not misleading. The descriptions set
forth in Exhibit H of certain other written materials furnished to you by the
Company is correct. There is no agreement, restriction or other factual matter
which the Company has not disclosed to you in writing which so far as the
Company can now reasonably foresee, will have a material adverse impact on the
long-term financial condition or prospects of the Company, the Guarantor or the
ability of the Company or the Guarantor to perform this Agreement.

      2.6 Pending Litigation; Compliance with Law.

      There are no proceedings or investigations pending, or to the knowledge of
the Guarantor or the Company threatened, against or affecting the Guarantor or
the Company or any other Subsidiary in or before any court, governmental
authority or agency or arbitration board or tribunal which, so far as the
Guarantor or the Company can now reasonably foresee, individually or in the
aggregate, will have a material adverse impact on the long-term financial
condition or prospects of the Guarantor, the Company, or the Guarantor and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or would impair the ability of the Company or the
Guarantor to perform this Agreement or the Guarantor to perform the Guaranty.
Neither the Guarantor or the Company nor any such Subsidiary is in default with
respect to any order of any court, governmental authority or agency or
arbitration board or tribunal or in violation of any laws or governmental rules
or regulations where, so far as the Guarantor or the Company can now reasonably
foresee, such default or violation will have a material adverse impact on the
long-term financial condition or prospects of the Guarantor, the Company, or the
Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or the ability of the Company
or the Guarantor to perform this Agreement or the Guarantor to perform the
Guaranty.

      2.7 Title to Properties.

      Except where the failure to possess good and marketable title in fee
simple or good title, as the case may be, would not have a material adverse
impact on the Guarantor, the Company or on the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, Guarantor, the Company, and each Subsidiary, has good and
marketable title in fee simple (or its equivalent under applicable law) to all
the real Property, and has good title to all the other Property, it purports to
own, including that reflected in the most recent balance sheet referred to in
Section 2.4 (except as sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of
business), free from Liens not permitted by Section 7.6(a).

      2.8 Patents and Trademarks.

      Except where failure to own or possess would not have a material adverse
impact on the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, the Guarantor and
its Subsidiaries own and possess all the patents, trademarks, service marks,
trade names, copyrights and licenses acquired by them pursuant to the Asset
Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of July 27, 1999 by and between the
Guarantor and Teledyne Industries Inc. The Guarantor, the Company, and each
Subsidiary, owns or possesses all the other patents, trademarks, service marks,
trade names, copyrights, licenses and rights with respect to the foregoing
necessary for the present and planned future conduct of its business, without
any conflict with the rights of others known by Senior Management.

      2.9 Sale is Legal and Authorized.


                                     - 7 -
<PAGE>   12
      The sale of the Notes by the Company and compliance by the Company and the
Guarantor with the provisions of this Agreement and of the Notes and, in the
case of the Guarantor, the Guaranty:

            (a)   have been duly authorized and are within the corporate powers
                  of the Company and the Guarantor; and

            (b)   are legal and will not conflict with, constitute a violation
                  of, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any Property of
                  the Company, the Guarantor or any Subsidiary under the
                  provisions of, any agreement, charter instrument, by-law or
                  other instrument to which the Company, the Guarantor or any
                  Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them or their
                  respective Properties may be bound.

           Neither the Guarantor nor the Company is a party to any agreement, or
subject to any charter or other corporate restriction, which restricts its right
or ability to incur Indebtedness, other than this Agreement and the agreements
identified with respect to such party and listed on Exhibit D.

      2.10 No Defaults.

      No event has occurred and no condition exists which, upon the issue of the
Notes, would constitute a Default or an Event of Default. Neither the Guarantor
nor the Company is in violation (whether or not temporarily waived) of any term
of any charter instrument or by-law and none of the Guarantor, the Company nor
any Subsidiary of either is in default under of any term under any agreement or
other instrument with respect to borrowed money. None of the Guarantor, the
Company nor any Subsidiary of either is in violation of any term of any other
agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
Property may be bound which violation, individually or in the aggregate with
other violations, might reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse
impact on the long-term business or prospects of the Guarantor, the Company or
the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

      2.11 Governmental Consent.

      Neither the nature of the Guarantor, the Company or of any Subsidiary of
either, or of any of their respective businesses or Properties, nor any
relationship between the Guarantor, the Company or any Subsidiary and any other
Person, nor any circumstance in connection with the offer, issue, sale or
delivery of the Notes or the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement or the Guaranty is such as to require a consent, approval or
authorization of, or, filing, registration or qualification with, any
governmental authority on the part of the Guarantor, the Company or any
Subsidiary in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement or the Guaranty or the offer, issue, sale or delivery of the Notes.

      2.12 Taxes.

            (a) Consolidated Federal income tax returns for the Guarantor and
its Domestic Subsidiaries have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service for
all years up to and including the year ended December 31, 1995. The Guarantor,
the Company and each Subsidiary has filed or caused to be filed all Federal,
provincial, state and local tax returns which, to the knowledge of Senior
Management are required to be filed and have paid or caused to be paid all taxes
as shown on such returns or on any assessment received by it or by any of them,
to the extent that such taxes have become due, except any such tax or assessment
the validity of which is being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and with respect to which the Guarantor, the Company or a
Subsidiary, as appropriate, has set aside on its books adequate reserves to the
extent the Guarantor, the Company or any Subsidiary and a nationally recognized
independent certified public accountant believes such reserves are necessary. To
the extent that the Guarantor in good faith believes is necessary, the
Guarantor, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries have set up reserves
which are believed by the Guarantor to be adequate for the payment of additional
taxes. All assessed deficiencies resulting from examinations by the Internal
Revenue Service up to and including the year ended December 31, 1995 have been
discharged, reserved against or will not impair the Company's ability to repay
the Loans.

      2.13 Use of Proceeds.

      The Company will apply the proceeds from the sale of the Notes to
refinance outstanding Indebtedness for borrowed money. None of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement (including, without limitation thereof, the use
of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes) will violate or result in a
violation of Section 7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or
any regulations issued pursuant thereto, including, without limitation,
Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 12 C.F.R.,
Chapter II.

      2.14 Private Offering.

      During the twelve months preceding the issue of the Notes, none of the
Guarantor, the Company nor Fleet Corporate Finance (the only Person authorized
or employed by the Company as agent, broker, dealer or otherwise in connection
with the offering or sale of the Notes or any similar Security of the Company)
has offered any of the Notes or any similar Security of the Company for sale to,
or solicited offers to buy any thereof from, or otherwise approached or
negotiated with respect thereto with, any prospective purchaser, other than the
purchasers of the Notes and not more than fifty other institutional investors,
each of whom was offered all or a portion of the Notes at private sale for
investment. The Company agrees that neither the Company nor anyone acting on its
behalf will offer the Notes or any part thereof or any similar Securities for
issue or sale to, or solicit any offer to acquire any of the same from, anyone
so as to bring


                                     - 9 -
<PAGE>   14
the issuance and sale of the Notes within the provisions of Section 5 of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

      2.15 Foreign Assets Control Regulations, etc.

            Neither the sale of the Notes by the Company hereunder nor its use
of the proceeds thereof will violate the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended,
or any of the foreign assets control regulations of the United States Treasury
Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as amended) or any enabling
legislation or executive order relating thereto.

      2.16 Status under Certain Statutes.

            None of the Company, the Guarantor, nor any Subsidiary is subject to
regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, the Interstate Commerce Act, as
amended, or the Federal Power Act, as amended.

      2.17 ERISA.

            (a) Relationship of Vested Benefits to Pension Plan Assets. The
      present aggregate value of all benefits vested under all "employee pension
      benefit plans", as such term is defined in Section 3 of ERISA, maintained
      by the Guarantor and its Related Persons (including the Company), or in
      which employees of the Guarantor or any Related Person (including the
      Company) are entitled to participate, as from time to time in effect
      (herein called the "Pension Plans"), did not, as of January 1, 1999, the
      last annual valuation date, exceed the actuarial value of the assets of
      the Pension Plans allocable to such vested benefits.

            (b) Prohibited Transactions. Neither the Guarantor or any Related
      Person (including the Company) nor any of the Pension Plans nor any trusts
      created thereunder, nor any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged
      in a "prohibited transaction", as such term is defined in Section 4975 of
      the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or described in Section 406
      of ERISA, which could subject the Guarantor, any Related Person (including
      the Company), any of the Pension Plans, any such trust, or any trustee or
      administrator thereof, or any party dealing with the Pension Plans or any
      such trust to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by
      said Section 4975 or by Section 502(i) of ERISA.

            (c) Reportable Events. Since December 31, 1986, neither any of the
      Pension Plans nor any such trusts have been terminated, nor have there
      been any "reportable events", as that term is defined in Section 4043 of
      ERISA, since the effective date of ERISA.


                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>   15
            (d) Accumulated Funding Deficiency. Neither any of the Pension Plans
      nor any such trusts have incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency", as
      such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA (whether or not waived),
      since the effective date of ERISA.

      2.18 Environmental Matters.

      None of the Guarantor, the Company nor any Subsidiary of either has
knowledge of any claim or has received any notice of any claim, and no
proceeding has been instituted raising any claim against the Guarantor, the
Company or any Subsidiary of either or any of their respective real properties
now or formerly owned, leased or operated by any of them or other assets,
alleging any damage to the environment or violation of any Environmental Laws,
except, in each case, such as could not reasonably be expected to result in a
material adverse effect on the Guarantor, the Company or the Guarantor and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Except as otherwise disclosed to you in writing,

            (a)   none of the Guarantor, the Company nor any Subsidiary of
                  either has knowledge of any facts which would give rise to any
                  claim, public or private, of violation of Environmental Laws
                  or damage to the environment emanating from, occurring on or
                  in any way related to real properties now or formerly owned,
                  leased or operated by any of them or the other assets or their
                  use, except, in each case, such as could not reasonably be
                  expected to result in a material adverse effect on the
                  Guarantor, the Company or the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries
                  taken as a whole;

            (b)   neither the Guarantor, the Company nor any Subsidiary has
                  stored any Hazardous Materials on real properties now or
                  formerly owned, leased or operated by any of them and has not
                  disposed of any Hazardous Materials in a manner contrary to
                  any Environmental Laws in each case in any manner that could
                  reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect
                  on the Guarantor, the Company or the Guarantor and its
                  Subsidiaries taken as a whole; and

            (c)   all buildings on all real properties now owned, leased or
                  operated by the Guarantor, the Company or any Subsidiary of
                  either are in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws,
                  except where failure to comply could not reasonably be
                  expected to result in a material adverse effect on the
                  Guarantor, the Company or the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries
                  taken as a whole.

      2.19 Year 2000 Compliance. The Guarantor, the Company and each Subsidiary
has reviewed the computer software, hardware and firmware systems and equipment


                                     - 11 -
<PAGE>   16
containing embedded microchips it owns or operates (the "Company Computer
Equipment") to review the effect of the date change into the year 2000. The
Guarantor reasonably believes that it is undertaking all actions to ensure that
such Company Computer Equipment will continue to accurately accept, calculate,
process, maintain, store and output all times or dates, or both, whether before,
on or after 12:00 a.m. January 1, 2000, except where failure to do so will not
have a material adverse effect on the business or operation of the Guarantor and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The Guarantor has requested that the third
party owners, suppliers or operators of key computer software, hardware and
firmware systems and equipment containing embedded microchips used or relied
upon in the conduct of the Guarantor's business ("Third Party Computer
Equipment") review the effect of the date change into the year 2000. Based on
such third parties' reviews and responses, the Guarantor reasonably believes
that such Third Party Computer Equipment will continue to accurately accept,
calculate, process, maintain, store and output all times or dates, or both,
whether before, on or after 12:00 a.m. January 1, 2000, except where failure to
do so will not have a material adverse effect on the business or operation of
the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. To the best knowledge of
the Guarantor, all products which have been, or are currently, manufactured or
sold by the Guarantor, the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be,
either (i) have no date function or (ii) are year 2000 compliant and will
operate without function error or interruption upon the date change into the
year 2000 (including certain dates within the year 1999).

SECTION 5. PREPAYMENTS

      5.1 Required Payments.

            (a) Interest on the 7.66% Notes shall be due and payable on May 12
      and November 12 each year beginning on May 12, 2000. The entire principal
      amount of the 7.66% Notes, together with interest accrued thereon to the

      interest due on the 7.80% Notes at maturity, the Company will prepay, and
      there shall become due and payable, U.S. $15,166,666.67 principal amount
      of the 7.80% Notes on November 12 in each year beginning on November 12,

      outstanding principal amount.

      5.2 Option to Prepay.

      The Company may make optional prepayments to prepay the Notes in whole or
in part, in multiples of U.S. $1,000,000, at any time at a price equal to the

on the principal amount so prepaid to the prepayment date, and (ii) the
Makewhole Price applicable at such time with respect to the amount of the Notes
being prepaid.

      5.3 Notice of Optional Prepayment.


                                     - 14 -

pursuant to Section 5.2 to each holder of the Notes not less than 10 Business
Days nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for prepayment, specifying (a)
such date, (b) the section of this Agreement under which the prepayment is to be
made, (c) the principal amount of the Notes and of such holder's Notes to be
prepaid on such date, and (d) the accrued interest applicable to the prepayment,
and setting forth a detailed calculation of what the Makewhole Price would be if
the Notes were being prepaid on the date of such notice. Notice of prepayment
having been so given, the principal amount of the Notes specified in such
notice, together with the premium, if any, and accrued interest thereon, shall
become due and payable on the prepayment date. The Company will provide a
supplemental notice by courier or facsimile confirmed by telephone to be
received by each holder of the Notes by 2:00 p.m., Hartford, Connecticut time,
on the Business Day immediately preceding the date fixed for prepayment which
will set forth a detailed calculation of the Makewhole Price.

      5.4 Partial Payment Pro Rata.

      If there is more than one Note outstanding at any time the aggregate
principal amount of each required or optional partial payment of the Notes shall
be allocated among the outstanding Notes in proportion, as nearly as
practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Notes. For the

and the Company shall not be affected by any notice or knowledge to the
contrary.

      6.2 Exchange of Notes.

      Upon surrender of any Note to the Company at its office maintained
pursuant to Section 7.3, the Company, upon request, will execute and deliver, at
its expense (except as provided below), new Notes in exchange therefor, in
denominations of at least U.S. $500,000 (except as may be necessary to reflect
any principal amount not evenly divisible by U.S. $500,000), in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of the surrendered Note.
Each such new Note (a) shall be payable to such Person as the surrendering
holder may request, and (b) shall be dated and bear interest from the date to
which interest has been paid on the surrendered Note or dated the


                                     - 15 -

      the Note, the Company at its expense will execute and deliver a new Note
      of like tenor, dated and bearing interest from the date to which interest

provided that items of the foregoing description need not be paid while being
contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings, if and for so long as

public accountants of recognized national standing to be adequate have been
established with respect thereto; provided further that, unless contesting in
good faith in accordance with the provisions hereof, notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 7.1, the Guarantor, the Company


                                     - 16 -

            restrictions on the use of real property or minor irregularities
            incident thereto which do not in the aggregate materially detract
            from the value of the Property or assets of the Guarantor, the
            Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, or impair the use of
            such Property in the operation of its business;

                  (vi) purchase money liens on real Property or equipment (which
            are filed against the real Property or equipment within 180 days of

            Company, the Guarantor or such Subsidiary.

                  (viii) other liens, that in the aggregate, do not exceed 15%

            (b) Equal and Ratable Lien: Equitable Lien. In case any Property is
subjected to a Lien in violation of Section 7.6(a), the Guarantor will make or
cause to be made provision whereby the Notes will be secured pursuant to
documents reasonably satisfactory to the holders of at least 51% in outstanding
principal amount of the Notes (exclusive of Notes owned by the Guarantor,
Company, Subsidiaries and Affiliates) equally and ratably with all other
obligations secured thereby, and in any case the Notes shall have the benefit,
to the full extent that, and with such priority as, the holders may be entitled
thereto under applicable law, of an equitable Lien on such Property securing the
Notes. Such violation of Section 7.6(a) shall constitute an Event of Default
hereunder, whether or not any such provision is made pursuant to this Section
7.6(b).

                  (c) above; and

            (e)   additional Indebtedness of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries;
                  provided, however, that (i) the total Indebtedness of the

Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Note over the

the following terms have the following meanings:

            "Called Principal" means, with respect to any Note, the principal of
      such Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 5.2 or has become or
      is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 9.2, as
      the context requires.

            "Discounted Value" means, with respect to the Called Principal of
      any Note, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled
      Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective
      scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called
      Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a
      discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which
      interest on the Notes is payable) equal to the Treasury Rate with respect
      to such Called Principal.

            "Reinvestment Yield" means, with respect to the Called Principal of
      any Note, 0.50% over the yield to maturity implied by the yields reported,
      as of 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding
      the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal for actively
      traded U.S. Treasury Securities having a constant maturity equal to the
      Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date
      (as shown on page "PX1" of the Bloomberg Financial Markets Service or such
      other display as may replace the Bloomberg Financial Markets Service);
      provided, however, that if there is no U.S. Treasury security which has a
      maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of the Notes, the Treasury
      Rate shall be obtained by interpolating linearly between (1) the U.S.
      Treasury security for which a yield is given with the duration closest to
      and greater than the Remaining Average Life, and (2) the U.S. Treasury
      security for which a yield is given with the duration closest to and less
      than the Remaining Average Life, except that if the Remaining Average Life
      is less than one year, the yield on actively traded U.S. Treasury
      securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.

            "Remaining Average Life" means, with respect to any Called
      Principal, the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth
      year) obtained by dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum of
      the products obtained by multiplying (a) the principal component of each
      Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (b)
      the number of years (calculated to the


                                     - 33 -
<PAGE>   38
      nearest one-twelfth year) that will elapse between the Settlement Date
      with respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such
      Remaining Scheduled Payment.

            "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to the Called
      Principal of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and interest
      thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such
      Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to
      its scheduled due date, provided that if such Settlement Date is not a
      date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of the
      Notes, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment
      will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date
      and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to Sections 5.2
      or 9.2.

            "Settlement Date" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any
      Note, the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid pursuant to
      Section 5.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable
      pursuant to Section 9.2, as the context requires.

on the Closing Date.

                               GUARANTY AGREEMENT


      This Guaranty Agreement (this "Guaranty Agreement") is made as of this
12th day of November, 1999 by Barnes Group Inc. (the "Guarantor") for the
benefit of the Purchasers of the Notes described below (collectively, the
"Purchasers"), their successors and assigns and any and all other
"Beneficiaries" (as such term is defined in Section 7 hereof).

                                    RECITALS


      A. The Purchasers have agreed to purchase U.S. $24,500,000 aggregate
principal amount of the 7.66% Senior Notes due November 12, 2007 (the "7.66%
Notes") and U.S. $45,500,000 aggregate principal amount of the 7.80% Senior
Notes due November 12, 2010 (the "7.80% Notes" and, together with the 7.66%
Notes, the "Notes") of 3031786 Nova Scotia Company (the "Debtor") pursuant to
the terms of the Note Agreement (the "Note Agreement") dated as of November 12,
1999 among the Debtor, the Guarantor and the Purchasers.

      B. The Debtor is the wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Guarantor.

      C. It is a condition to the purchase by the Purchasers of the Notes under
the Note Agreement that the Guarantor execute and deliver this Guaranty
Agreement.

      NOW, THEREFORE, the Guarantor hereby agrees, as follows:

1.    Guaranty of Payment and Performance of Obligations.

            (a) The Guarantor unconditionally guarantees to each of the
Beneficiaries the full and punctual payment and performance of the Obligations
(as defined in subsection (b) below). This Guaranty Agreement is an absolute,
unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual payment and
performance by the Debtor of each of the Obligations, and not of collectibility
only, and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that any Beneficiary
first attempt to collect payment from the Debtor or any other guarantor or
surety or resorts to any security or other means of obtaining payment of all or
any of the Obligations or upon any other contingency. Upon any default by the
Debtor in the full and punctual payment or performance of any of the
Obligations, the liabilities and obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall at
the option of any Beneficiary become forthwith due and payable without demand or
notice of any nature, all such demands and notices being expressly waived by the
Guarantor.

            (b) As used herein, the term "Obligations" means all indebtedness,
obligations and liabilities of any kind of the Debtor to any or all of the
Beneficiaries under or in connection with the Notes or the Note Agreement,
howsoever incurred, arising or evidenced, whether now or hereafter existing, due
or to become due or of payment or performance, and including without limitation
the Debtor's obligation to pay (i) all principal of, interest on and premium, if
any, with respect to the Notes when and as the same shall become due and payable
(whether at maturity or by declaration or otherwise), and (ii) all costs and
expenses (including court costs, reasonable
<PAGE>   65
attorneys' fees and other legal expenses) incurred by any Beneficiary in
exercising and enforcing any of its rights, powers and remedies under the Note
Agreement or the Notes including without limitation its rights and remedies
following the Debtor's default thereunder.

2.    Guaranty Continuing and Liability Unlimited.

            (a) This is a continuing guaranty and shall be binding upon the
Guarantor regardless of (a) how long before or after the date hereof any part of
the Obligations was or is incurred by the Debtor and (b) the amount of the
Obligations at any time outstanding (whether more or less than the original
principal amount of the Notes). This Guaranty Agreement may be enforced by any
or all of the Beneficiaries from time to time and as often as occasion for such
enforcement may arise.

            (b) If after receipt of any payment of, or the proceeds of any
collateral for, all or any part of the Obligations, the Beneficiaries are
compelled to surrender or voluntarily surrender such payment or proceeds to any
person because such payment or application of proceeds is or may be avoided,
invalidated, recaptured, or set aside as a preference, fraudulent conveyance,
impermissible setoff or for any other reason, whether or not such surrender is
the result of (i) any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative
body having jurisdiction over the Beneficiaries, or (ii) any settlement or
compromise by the Beneficiaries of any claim as to any of the foregoing with any
person (including the Debtor), then the Obligations or part thereof affected
shall be reinstated and continue and this Guaranty Agreement shall be reinstated
and continue in full force as to such Obligations or part thereof as if such
payment or proceeds had not been received, notwithstanding any previous
cancellation of any instrument evidencing any such Obligation or any previous
instrument delivered to evidence the satisfaction thereof. The provisions of
this Section 3(b) shall survive the termination of this Guaranty Agreement and
any satisfaction and discharge of the Debtor by virtue of any payment, court
order or any federal or state law.

3.    Unconditional Nature of Guarantor's Obligations and Liabilities.

      The obligations and liabilities of the Guarantor hereunder shall be
absolute and unconditional, shall not be subject to any counterclaim, set-off,
deduction or defense based upon any claim the Guarantor may have against the
Debtor, any other Guarantor, or any other person or entity, and shall remain in
full force and effect until all of the Obligations have been fully satisfied,
without regard to any event, circumstance or condition (whether or not the
Guarantor shall have knowledge or notice thereof) which but for the provisions
of this Section might constitute a legal or equitable defense or discharge of a
guarantor or surety or which might in any way limit recourse against the
Guarantor, including without limitation: (a) any amendment or modification or
supplement to the terms of the Note Agreement or the Notes; (b) any waiver,
consent or indulgence by any Beneficiary, or any exercise or non-exercise by any
Beneficiary of any right, power or remedy, under or in respect of this Guaranty
Agreement, the Note Agreement or the Notes (whether or not the Guarantor or the
Debtor has or have notice or knowledge of any such action or inaction); (c) the
invalidity or unenforceability, in whole or in part, of the Note Agreement or
the Notes, or the termination (except pursuant to its terms or by written
agreement between the Beneficiaries and the Debtor), cancellation or frustration
of any thereof, or any limitation or cessation of the Debtor's liability under
any thereof (other than any limitation or


                                     - 2 -
<PAGE>   66
cessation expressly provided for therein), including without limitation any
invalidity, unenforceability or impaired liability resulting from the Debtor's
lack of capacity, power and/or authority to enter into the Note Agreement or the
Notes and/or to incur any or all of the Obligations; (d) any actual, purported
or attempted sale, assignment or other transfer by any or all of the
Beneficiaries or by the Debtor of the Notes or of any of its rights, interests
or obligations under the Notes or the Note Agreement; (e) the taking or holding
by any or all of the Beneficiaries of a security interest, lien or other
encumbrance in or on any property as security for any or all of the Obligations
or any exchange, release, non-perfection, loss or alteration of, or any other
dealing with, any such security; (f) the addition of any party as a guarantor or
surety of all or any part of the Obligations or any limitation of the liability
of any additional guarantor or surety of all or any part of the Obligations
under any other agreement; (g) any merger or consolidation of the Debtor into or
with any other entity, or any sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of any
or all of Debtor's assets or any sale, transfer or other disposition of any or
all of the shares of capital stock or other securities of the Debtor to any
other person or entity; (h) any change in the financial condition of the Debtor
or the Debtor's entry into an assignment for the benefit of creditors, an
arrangement or any other agreement or procedure for the restructuring of its
liabilities, or the Debtor's insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization,
dissolution, liquidation or any similar action by or occurrence with respect to
the Debtor.

4.    Guarantor's Waiver.

      The Guarantor unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law: (a) notice of any of the matters referred to in Section 3 hereof; (b) any
right to the enforcement, assertion or exercise by any or all of the
Beneficiaries of any of its rights, powers or remedies under, against or with
respect to (i) the Note Agreement or the Notes, (ii) any other guarantor or
surety, or (iii) any security for all or any part of the Obligations; (c) any
requirement of diligence and any defense based on a claim of laches; (d) all
defenses which may now or hereafter exist by virtue of any statute of
limitations, or of any stay, valuation, exemption, moratorium or similar law,
except the sole defense of full and indefeasible payment; (e) any requirement
that the Guarantor be joined as a party in any action or proceeding against the
Debtor to enforce any of the provisions of the Note Agreement or the Notes; (f)
any requirement that any Beneficiary mitigate or attempt to mitigate damages
resulting from a default by the guarantor hereunder or from a default by the
Debtor under the Note Agreement or the Notes; (g) acceptance of this Guaranty
Agreement by any Beneficiary; and (h) all presentments, protests, notices of
dishonor, demands for performance and any and all other demands upon and notices
to the Debtor, and any and all other formalities of any kind, the omission of or
delay in performance of which might but for the provisions of this Section
constitute legal or equitable grounds for relieving or discharging the Guarantor
in whole or in part from its irrevocable, absolute and continuing obligations
hereunder, it being the intention of the Guarantor that its obligations
hereunder shall not be discharged except by payment and performance and then
only to the extent thereof.

5.    Representations and Warranties.

      The Guarantor represents and warrants that:


            (a) the Guarantor is a corporation duly organized and validly
existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the
full power, authority and legal right to enter into and perform its obligations
under this Guaranty Agreement;

            (b) this Guaranty Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance
with its terms.

            (c) the execution, delivery and performance by the Guarantor of this
Guaranty Agreement do not require any stockholder approval or the consent or
approval of any of the Guarantor's creditors (except such as have already been
obtained in writing), do not and will not contravene any applicable law, rule,
regulation, judgment or order and do not and will not contravene the provisions
of, constitute a breach of or default under, or result in the creation of any
security interest, lien or encumbrance on any of the property of the Guarantor
pursuant to, the Guarantor's articles of incorporation or by-laws or any
indenture, mortgage, license or other contract, agreement or instrument to which
the Guarantor is a party or by which it is bound or to or by which any of its
properties is subject or affected;

            (d) the execution, delivery and performance by the Guarantor of this
Guaranty Agreement do not require the consent, approval, authorization or order
of, the giving of notice to or the registration with, or the taking of any other
action with respect to, any governmental authority or agency, foreign or
domestic, other than such as have been duly obtained, given or taken; and

            (e) the transactions contemplated by this Guaranty Agreement are
being consummated by the Guarantor in furtherance of the Guarantor's ordinary
business purposes, with no contemplation of insolvency and with no intent to
hinder, delay or defraud any of its present or future creditors. Neither before
or as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Guaranty Agreement will
the Guarantor be insolvent or have an unreasonably small capital for the conduct
of its business and the payment of its anticipated obligations. The Guarantor's
assets and cash flow enable it to meet its present obligations in the ordinary
course of business as they become due, and the Guarantor does not believe that
it will incur debts beyond its ability to pay.

6.    Certain Covenants and Agreements.

      In addition to its covenants and agreements set forth elsewhere in this
Guaranty Agreement, the Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees as follows:

            (a) the Guarantor will pay all reasonable costs, expenses and
damages incurred (including without limitation court costs, reasonable
attorneys' fees and other legal expenses) in connection with any action by any
Beneficiary to collect payment from the Guarantor or otherwise to enforce the
performance of its obligations under this Guaranty Agreement; and


                                     - 4 -
<PAGE>   68
            (b) any and all indebtedness and other obligations of the Debtor to
the Guarantor (other than indebtedness to be satisfied on the Closing Date (as
defined in the Note Agreement) from the proceeds of the Notes) shall during the
term of this Guaranty Agreement be subordinated to the Obligations and other
indebtedness of the Debtor to any or all of the Beneficiaries.

7.    Successors and Assigns.

      This Guaranty Agreement shall be binding upon the Guarantor and its
respective successors and assigns (including without limitation any and all
successors and transferees which may assume the Guarantor's obligations), and
shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each Purchaser, its
successors and assigns, and each successive holder of any of the notes
(hereinafter collectively called the "Beneficiaries").

8.    Subordination of Obligations to Guarantor.

      Any and all indebtedness and other obligations of the Debtor to the
Guarantor (including without limitation any such obligations resulting from any
rights of subrogation on the part of the Guarantor as a result of any payment by
the Guarantor hereunder but other than the indebtedness to be satisfied on the
Closing Date from the proceeds of the Notes) shall during the term of this
Guaranty Agreement be subordinated to the Obligations and to any other
indebtedness of the Debtor to any or all of the Beneficiaries.

9.    Governing Law and Consent to Jurisdiction.

      This Guaranty Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Connecticut. The Guarantor agrees that any judicial proceeding with respect to
this Guaranty Agreement may at the option of the Beneficiaries be brought in the
courts of the State of Connecticut or (to the extent permitted under applicable
Federal statutes and rules) in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Connecticut. By its execution and delivery of this Guaranty Agreement, the
Guarantor consents and submits to each such jurisdiction and waives (to the
extent permitted by law) whatever rights it may now or hereafter possess by
reason of its current or any future domicile. Nothing in this Section 10 shall
be construed to limit the right of any Beneficiary to commence judicial action
or otherwise to proceed against the Guarantor in any other jurisdiction or to
serve process on the Guarantor in any manner permitted or required by law.

10.   Severability.

      Wherever possible, each provision of this Guaranty Agreement shall be
construed in such manner as to be valid and enforceable against the Guarantor
under applicable law, but if any provision hereof shall be deemed invalid or
unenforceable to any extent against the Guarantor in any jurisdiction, such
provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without invalidating or rendering unenforceable the remainder
of such provision or any of the other provisions hereof, and any such invalidity
or unenforceability against the Guarantor in one jurisdiction shall not render
such provision ineffective in any other jurisdiction.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OUR BUSINESS               Barnes Group is a worldwide manufacturer of precision
                           metal parts and a provider of industrial main-
                           tenance logistics solutions. The Company is comprised
                           of three business segments. The Associated Spring
                           segment is a manufacturer of assemblies, high
                           precision mechanical springs, nitrogen gas springs,
                           manifold systems, wireforms and stampings for the
                           transportation, industrial, electronics and
                           communications markets. The Barnes Aerospace segment
                           supplies precision components and fabricated
                           assemblies for commercial and military aircraft as
                           well as overhaul and repair services in support of
                           the global airline industry. The Bowman Distribution
                           segment provides consumable repair and replacement
                           products for industrial, heavy equipment and trans-
                           portation maintenance markets. Its Raymond
                           Distribution operation also distributes
                           close-tolerance engineered metal components
                           manufactured principally by Associated Spring.
                           Through these three businesses, Barnes Group works
                           with its customers' organizations to help them
                           realize the benefits of its manufacturing
                           capabilities and logistics management to enhance
                           their competitiveness and responsiveness.


ACQUISITION OF             On August 30, 1999, Barnes Group purchased
NITROGEN GAS               substantially all of the assets and liabilities of
SPRINGS BUSINESS           the nitrogen gas springs business of the Teledyne
                           Fluid Systems Division of Teledyne Industries, Inc.,
                           for a total cost of $92.2 million. This operation is
                           a major supplier of nitrogen gas springs and manifold
                           systems for the metal forming markets. The
                           acquisition of the nitrogen gas springs business was
                           recorded using the purchase method of accounting and
                           is included in the Associated Spring business
                           segment. This strategic acquisition provides
                           Associated Spring with new spring technologies and
                           allows it to continue to develop and expand products,
                           markets and services. The operation's results have
                           been included in Barnes Group's consolidated
                           financial statements from the date of acquisition.

                           The funds used to purchase the business were borrowed
                           initially under the Company's revolving credit
                           agreement. In November 1999, Barnes Group refinanced
                           a portion of these borrowings through the issuance of
                           $70 million of long-term private placement senior
                           notes. This debt ranges in maturity from eight to
                           eleven years at an average annual interest rate of
                           7.75%.



RESULTS OF                 For 1999, Barnes Group reported net sales of $622
OPERATIONS                 million, down 4% from the record sales of $651
                           million in 1998. The reduction in sales was
                           attributable to shortfalls at Bowman Distribution and
                           Barnes Aerospace, partially offset by increased sales
                           at Associated Spring. In addition, the newly acquired
                           nitrogen gas springs business provided incremental
                           sales of $16 million in 1999. In 1998, sales were up
                           $8.5 million from 1997 levels, primarily a result of
                           improvements at Barnes Aerospace.

                           Operating income in 1999 was $45.3 million, versus
                           $55.2 million in 1998. The decline in 1999 operating
                           income was driven by the sales volume shortfalls at
                           Bowman Distribution and Barnes Aerospace.
                           Additionally, non-Y2K system implementation issues
                           resulted in higher expense levels at Bowman
                           Distribution's North American operation, which
                           negatively impacted profit. The reduced profit at
                           Bowman Distribution and Barnes Aerospace was
                           partially offset by results at Associated Spring,
                           where profit improved 44% over 1998, and a $12.9
                           million expense, included in 1998, for the
                           accelerated retirement package for the Company's
                           retired president. Associated Spring's performance
                           was driven by higher sales volume, productivity
                           improvements and the additional profits generated
                           from the newly acquired nitrogen gas springs
                           business. Operating income in 1998 declined $10.5
                           million from 1997 as a result of the $12.9 million
                           expense related to the accelerated retirement package
                           for the Company's retired president. Part of the
                           $12.9 million of expense is $2.7 million for
                           accelerated retirement benefits which are included in
                           the 1998 pension expense.

                           Operating margin in 1999 declined to 7.3% from 8.5%
                           in 1998 and 10.2% in 1997. In 1999, cost of sales as
                           a percentage of sales increased to 68.3% from 66.9%
                           in 1998, as Bowman Distribution's North American
                           operation incurred higher distribution costs as a
                           result of inefficiencies generated during the
                           implementation of the new distribution management
                           system. Selling and administrative expenses as a
                           percentage of sales declined slightly in 1999 due to
                           the $12.9 million of expense for the accelerated
                           retirement package for the Company's retired
                           president in 1998. Excluding the cost of the
                           accelerated retirement package, selling and
                           administrative expenses as a percentage of sales
                           increased in 1999, reflecting the impact of higher
                           administrative costs associated with the Bowman
                           system implementation coupled with a higher
                           investment in sales resources, throughout the
                           Company, for the purpose of increasing future sales
                           growth. The decline in operating margin in 1998,
                           compared to 1997, is attributable to the $12.9
                           million retirement package expense incurred in 1998.


SEGMENT REVIEW -           Associated Spring sales for 1999 were $283 million,
SALES AND                  up $20.5 million from 1998. Sales in 1997 were $259
OPERATING PROFIT           million. In 1999, sales at Associated Spring's North
                           American operations increased, reflecting the
                           continued strength of the domestic economy and
                           continued penetration in both automotive and
                           non-automotive markets. Excluding the acquisition,
                           Associated Spring's international operations sales
                           kept pace with 1998 levels, despite a 9% sales
                           decline in its Brazil operation, a direct fallout of
                           the devaluation of the Brazilian currency in early
                           1999. Additionally, the acquisition of the
                           nitrogen gas springs business contributed to sales
                           increases both domestically and internationally.
                           Associated Spring's 1998 sales increased slightly
                           over 1997 on the strength of its North American
                           operations, partially offset by sales declines in its
                           international operations.



                                                                               5

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

                           Associated Spring reported profit of $33.5 million in
                           1999, compared to $23.2 million in 1998 and $24.5
                           million in 1997. The significant improvement in 1999
                           over 1998 results from the addition of the nitrogen
                           gas springs business, stabilization of the economic
                           situation in the Asia/Pacific region, manufacturing
                           efficiencies and lower operating expenses at
                           Associated Spring's headquarters. Profits declined in
                           1998, reflecting the adverse impact of the General
                           Motors strike, the turmoil within the Asia/Pacific
                           region and the cost of product line rationalization.
                           Partially offsetting the 1998 decline was the solid
                           year-over-year performance at Associated Spring's
                           North American operations and the strong turnaround
                           at its Mexican operation.

                           Barnes Aerospace sales were $121 million in 1999,
                           compared to $155 million in 1998 and $137 million
                           in 1997. Both the original equipment manufacturing
                           (OEM) business and the overhaul and repair business
                           were impacted by a slowdown in the aerospace markets,
                           which resulted in an industry-wide decline in new
                           orders and the cancellation or rescheduling of
                           existing orders. Though sales were down, Barnes
                           Aerospace continued to effectively penetrate new
                           markets and customers. In 1998, sales were up 13%
                           over 1997, driven by its OEM machining operation and
                           overhaul and repair units. This growth was partially
                           offset by lower sales at its OEM fabrication
                           operation in Ogden, Utah, which was impacted by
                           reduced customer backlog and changes in customer
                           requested delivery schedules.

                           Barnes Aerospace profit was $5.3 million, as compared
                           to $12.8 million in 1998 and $9.9 million in 1997.
                           The shortfalls in profit and margin were a direct
                           result of the sales volume decline. Effective cost
                           and expense control by Barnes Aerospace minimized the
                           adverse impact on profits from the sharp falloff in
                           sales volume. The increase in profits for 1998,
                           compared to 1997, reflected higher sales volume
                           coupled with ongoing productivity improvements and
                           cost containment.

                           Bowman Distribution sales for 1999 were $230 million,
                           compared to $247 million in 1998 and $259 million in
                           1997. Bowman's North American operation 1999 sales
                           decline was due to complications encountered in a
                           planned implementation of the fully integrated
                           distribution management system initiated in the first
                           half of 1999. This system installation encountered a
                           number of unanticipated software and implementation
                           issues that negatively impacted warehouse efficiency,
                           administrative costs and sales in 1999. Bowman
                           expects customer service levels to improve through
                           the first half of 2000 as system issues are
                           identified and process changes are implemented.
                           Bowman will continue to incur increased costs for
                           warehousing and administration until such
                           improvements are fully implemented. Bowman expects
                           to fully restore service levels to its customers'
                           satisfaction in 2000. In Europe, Bowman
                           Distribution's sales were down primarily from the
                           loss of a large customer and management's refocus
                           from smaller, less profitable accounts to larger
                           industrial accounts. Bowman's Raymond business
                           reported an increase in sales in 1999 as it continued
                           to penetrate new international markets. In 1998,
                           Bowman's sales were down 5% from 1997, primarily the
                           result of its North American business losing a major
                           customer and the continued refocus of its sales
                           efforts to meet the changing requirements of larger
                           customers.

                           Bowman Distribution's profit in 1999 was $9.9
                           million, compared to $35.0 million in 1998 and $32.6
                           million in 1997. The sharp decline in profits in 1999
                           was attributable to the sales volume decline, as well
                           as significantly higher warehousing and
                           administrative costs incurred in its North American
                           business to address operational issues caused by the
                           new system implementation. The 7.4% improvement in
                           profits in 1998 as compared to 1997 resulted from
                           lower operating expenses in both Bowman's North
                           American operation and Raymond Distribution.



NON-OPERATING              Other income totaled $5.9 million in 1999, compared
INCOME/EXPENSE             to $5.6 million in 1998 and $6.0 million in 1997. The
                           increase over 1998 reflects a higher gain on the sale
                           of underutilized assets and net foreign exchange
                           transaction gains. Partially offsetting the increase
                           in other income was lower equity income from the
                           Company's NASCO joint venture. The decrease in other
                           income in 1998, as compared to 1997, resulted from
                           lower foreign exchange gains offset by an increase in
                           equity income from the Company's NASCO joint venture.

                           Interest expense and other expenses increased in 1999
                           as a result of the acquisition of the nitrogen gas
                           springs business. Specifically, interest expense
                           increased as a result of additional borrowings used
                           to fund the acquisition. Other expenses increased
                           with the additional goodwill amortization associated
                           with the acquisition. Interest expense in 1998
                           declined compared to 1997, reflecting lower debt
                           levels and lower interest rates.


INCOME TAXES               The Company's effective income tax rate has declined
                           steadily over the last six years. The Company's
                           effective tax rate was 33.0% in 1999, compared with
                           36.9% in 1998 and 37.3% in 1997. The lower rate in
                           1999 was due to lower state taxes, higher percentage
                           of foreign income with tax rates lower than the U.S.
                           statutory tax rate, and foreign tax benefits
                           associated with the acquisition of the nitrogen gas
                           springs business.


NET INCOME AND             Consolidated net income was $28.6 million in 1999,
NET INCOME                 $34.5 million in 1998 and $40.4 million in 1997.
PER SHARE                  Basic earnings per share were $1.47 in 1999, compared
                           to $1.72 in 1998 and $2.00 in 1997. Diluted earnings
                           per share were $1.46 in 1999, compared to $1.69 in
                           1998 and $1.96 in 1997. The 1998 earnings included an
                           after-tax charge of $7.7 million, or $0.38 per share,
                           related to the accelerated retirement package of the
                           Company's retired president.

                           In April 1997, stockholders approved an increase in
                           authorized common shares from 20 million to 60
                           million and a three-for-one stock split. All per
                           share data reflect the stock split.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

INFLATION                  Management believes that during 1997-1999, inflation
                           did not have a material impact on the Company's
                           historical financial statements.


LIQUIDITY AND
CAPITAL RESOURCES          The Company's ability to generate cash from
                           operations in excess of its internal operating needs
                           is one of its financial strengths. In 1999, the
                           Company continued to effectively manage working
                           capital, and its efforts in accounts receivable,
                           inventories and accounts payable generated nearly $18
                           million in positive cash flow. Management will
                           continue to aggressively manage cash flows and
                           anticipates that operating activities in 2000,
                           combined with aggressive asset management, will
                           provide sufficient cash to take advantage of
                           opportunities for internal business expansion and to
                           meet the Company's current financial commitments.
                           External business expansion will be funded with a
                           combination of new debt and internal cash.

                           Management assesses the Company's liquidity in terms
                           of its overall ability to generate cash to fund its
                           operating and investing activities. Of particular
                           importance in the management of liquidity are cash
                           flows generated from operating activities, capital
                           expenditure levels, dividends, capital stock
                           transactions, effective utilization of surplus cash
                           positions overseas and adequate bank lines of credit.

                           Operating activities are the principal source of cash
                           flow for the Company, generating $62.8 million in
                           1999, down from the record of $76.0 million in 1998
                           and $71.6 million in 1997. The decrease in operating
                           cash flows is primarily related to the decline in the
                           Company's operating results, as well as the cash
                           payment of $7.8 million in 1999 associated with the
                           accelerated retirement package for the Company's
                           retired president. During the past three years,
                           operating activities provided over $210 million in
                           cash, which the Company used, in part, to pay
                           dividends to stockholders, repurchase Company stock
                           and fund significant investments in new equipment.
                           Continued emphasis on asset management eliminated the
                           need for additional investments in working capital
                           during the past three years.

                           Investing activities used cash of $117.0 million in
                           1999, compared with $35.3 million in 1998 and $34.2
                           million in 1997. The increase in cash used in 1999 is
                           attributable to the purchase of the nitrogen gas
                           springs business. In 1999, the Company reduced its
                           capital spending following five years of heavy
                           investments by all three business segments. The
                           Company's capital spending program continues to focus
                           on business growth and improvements in productivity
                           and quality. The Company expects capital spending in
                           2000 to continue at a strong pace.

                           In 1999, the Company's financing activities generated
                           cash of $58.8 million, compared to cash usage of
                           $31.9 million in 1998 and $26.6 million in 1997. Cash
                           was generated primarily through the issuance of $89.0
                           million of long-term debt to fund the purchase of the
                           nitrogen gas springs business. The increase in cash
                           from borrowings was also partially used to repurchase
                           $22.4 million of Company stock. Cash dividends
                           increased in 1999 for the fifth consecutive year, to
                           $0.75 per share. As a result, total cash used to pay
                           1999 dividends to stockholders increased to $14.6
                           million.

                           The Company has utilized and will continue to use
                           cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries to fund international
                           cash requirements, including acquisitions, when it is
                           cost effective. The repatriation of certain cash
                           balances to the U.S. could have adverse tax
                           consequences; however, those balances are generally
                           available to fund business needs outside the U.S.

                           In November 1999, the Company financed a portion of
                           the nitrogen gas springs business acquisition through
                           issuance of $70 million of private placement senior
                           notes (the Notes). The Notes, placed with seven
                           insurance companies, range in maturity from eight to
                           eleven years and bear an average annual interest rate
                           of 7.75%. The balance of the acquisition purchase
                           price is financed through borrowings under the
                           Company's long-term revolving credit agreement. The
                           issuance of the Notes and usage of the Company's
                           long-term revolving credit agreement will result in
                           both higher interest expense and higher
                           debt-to-capitalization ratios in the future.

                           To supplement internal cash generation, the Company
                           maintains substantial bank borrowing facilities. At
                           December 31, 1999, the Company had $150 million of
                           borrowing capacity available under a revolving credit
                           agreement, of which $32.5 million was borrowed at an
                           interest rate of 6.5%. Additionally, the Company had
                           $4.5 million in borrowings under uncommitted
                           short-term bank credit lines at an interest rate of
                           6.8%. The Company believes its bank credit
                           facilities, including the new Notes, coupled with
                           cash generated from operations, are adequate for its
                           anticipated future requirements.


MARKET RISK                Market risk is the potential economic loss that may
                           result from adverse changes in the fair value of
                           financial instruments. The Company's financial
                           results could be impacted by changes in interest
                           rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity
                           price changes. The Company uses financial instruments
                           to reduce its cost of debt, and to hedge its exposure
                           to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
                           exchange rates.

                           The Company's long-term debt portfolio consists of
                           fixed-rate and variable-rate instruments and is
                           managed to reduce the overall cost of borrowing while
                           also reducing the effect of changes in interest rates
                           on near-term earnings. The Company's primary interest
                           rate risk is derived from its outstanding
                           variable-rate debt obligations. At December 31, 1999,
                           the result of a hypothetical 1% increase in the
                           average cost of the Company's variable-rate debt,
                           including the interest rate exchange agreement, would
                           not have had a material impact on the pretax profit
                           of the Company or the fair value of the interest rate
                           exchange agreement.

                                                                               7

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

                           In September 1999, the Company entered into a
                           three-year, $70 million cross-currency exchange
                           agreement. In effect, the agreement converts the
                           Company's U.S. dollar-denominated interest and
                           principal liabilities into Swedish krona-denominated
                           liabilities at a fixed interest rate for a three-year
                           period ending October 2002. Additionally, as part of
                           managing its debt portfolio, the Company maintains an
                           interest rate exchange agreement to convert a portion
                           of its 9.47% fixed-rate Senior Notes to variable-rate
                           debt. These agreements are viewed by the Company as
                           risk management tools and are not used for
                           speculative or trading purposes. The overall
                           objectives are to reduce the exposure associated with
                           currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the
                           Swedish krona and to reduce the exposure to
                           variable-rate debt. The effect on 1999 earnings of
                           the U.S. dollar and Swedish krona cross-currency
                           exchange agreement and interest rate exchange
                           agreement was to decrease the Company's expense by
                           $0.2 million.

                           At December 31, 1999, the fair value of the Company's
                           fixed-rate debt was $106.8 million, compared to its
                           carrying amount of $107.3 million. The Company
                           estimates that a 1% decrease in market interest rates
                           at December 31, 1999 would have increased the fair
                           value of the Company's fixed-rate debt to $112.5
                           million.

                           The Company has manufacturing, sales and distribution
                           facilities around the world and thus makes
                           investments and conducts business transactions
                           denominated in various currencies. Foreign currency
                           commitments and transaction exposures are managed at
                           the operating units as an integral part of their
                           businesses. Residual exposures that cannot be offset
                           may be hedged. The Company does not hedge its foreign
                           currency net asset exposure.

                           The currencies that the Company was primarily exposed
                           to on December 31, 1999, were the Singapore dollar,
                           Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Canadian dollar and
                           Swedish krona. Based on a 10% adverse movement in all
                           currencies, the potential loss in fair value from the
                           Company's financial instruments at the end of 1999
                           would have resulted in reducing pretax profit by $2.4
                           million.

                           The Company's exposure to commodity price changes
                           relates primarily to certain manufacturing operations
                           that utilize steel spring wire and titanium. The
                           Company manages its exposure to changes in those
                           prices through its procurement and sales practices.
                           The Company is not dependent upon any single source
                           for any of its principal raw materials or products
                           for resale, and all such materials and products are
                           readily available.



FUTURE ACCOUNTING          In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards
CHANGES                    Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
                           Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
                           Instruments and Hedging Activities." This standard
                           requires that the Company recognize derivatives on
                           the balance sheet at fair value. In June 1999, the
                           statement's effective date was delayed by one year,
                           and it will be effective January 1, 2001, for the
                           Company. Management believes that adoption of this
                           standard will not have a material impact on the
                           Company's financial position, results of operations
                           or cash flows.

YEAR 2000 READINESS        The Company's program to address the Y2K issue
                           consisted of the following phases: assessment,
                           remediation, testing and contingency planning. Barnes
                           Group met its commitment to be fully Y2K ready with
                           all of its critical business systems as of the end of
                           1999.

                           The costs specific to addressing the Y2K readiness
                           project were those directly related to upgrading
                           existing systems to be Y2K ready and costs related to
                           outside consultants assisting the Y2K project. These
                           costs were expensed as incurred and approximated $0.6
                           million in 1998 and $1.9 million in 1999. However, a
                           significant portion of the Company's overall
                           information technology (IT) expense approximating
                           $11.5 million in 1998 and $13.8 million in 1999 was
                           either directly or indirectly included to address Y2K
                           readiness either through software remediation or
                           implementation. In addition, capitalized IT-related
                           hardware and software expenditures approximated $12
                           million in both 1998 and 1999. Subsequent to 1999,
                           additional costs specific to ensuring the Company is
                           Y2K ready are not expected to be significant.

                           The Company completed its assessment of its Y2K risks
                           related to significant relationships with its
                           critical third-party suppliers and customers. Despite
                           these efforts, the Company can provide no assurance
                           that all supplier and customer Y2K compliance plans
                           were successfully completed in a timely manner,
                           although it is not currently aware of any problems
                           which would significantly impact its future
                           operations.

                           The foregoing Y2K readiness statements are designated
                           as a "Readiness Disclosure" within the meaning of the
                           Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act of
                           1998.

FORWARD-LOOKING            The Company cautions readers that certain factors may
STATEMENTS                 affect the Company's results for future fiscal
                           periods. These factors involve risks and
                           uncertainties that could cause future results to
                           differ materially from those expressed or implied in
                           any forward-looking statements made on behalf of the
                           Company. For this purpose, any statement other than
                           one of historical fact may be considered a
                           forward-looking statement. Some important factors
                           that could cause actual results to vary materially
                           from those anticipated in forward-looking statements
                           include economic volatility, currency fluctuations,
                           interest rate fluctuations, regulatory changes and
                           technological changes, all of which may affect the
                           Company's operations, products and markets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All dollar amounts included in the notes are stated in thousands except per
share data and the tables in Note 13.)

1 SUMMARY OF               GENERAL: The preparation of financial statements
SIGNIFICANT                requires management to make estimates and assumptions
ACCOUNTING POLICIES        that affect the reported amounts of assets and
                           liabilities at the date of the financial statements
                           and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
                           during the reporting period. Actual results could
                           differ from those estimates.

                           Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
                           year amounts to conform to the current year pre-
                           sentation.

                           CONSOLIDATION: The accompanying consolidated
                           financial statements include the accounts of the
                           Company and all of its subsidiaries. Intercompany
                           transactions and account balances have been
                           eliminated. The Company accounts for its 45%
                           investment in the common stock of NASCO, an
                           automotive suspension spring company jointly owned
                           with NHK Spring Co., Ltd., of Japan, under the equity
                           method. Other income in the accompanying income
                           statements includes income of $1,714, $2,573 and
                           $1,763 for the years 1999, 1998 and 1997,
                           respectively, from the Company's investment in NASCO.
                           The Company received dividends from NASCO totaling
                           $1,006, $732 and $596 in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
                           respectively.

                           REVENUE RECOGNITION: Sales and related cost of sales
                           are recognized when products are shipped to
                           customers.

                           CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM
                           INVESTMENTS: Cash in excess of operating requirements
                           is invested in short-term, highly liquid, income
                           producing investments. All highly liquid investments
                           purchased with an original maturity of three months
                           or less are cash equivalents, while other investments
                           with an original maturity of one year or less are
                           classified as short-term investments. Both cash
                           equivalents and short-term investments are carried at
                           fair market value.

                           INVENTORIES: Inventories are valued at the lower of
                           cost or market. The last-in, first-out (LIFO) method
                           was used to accumulate the cost of the majority of
                           U.S. inventories, which represent 71% of total
                           inventories. The cost of all other inventories was
                           determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
                           method.

                           PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and
                           equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is recorded
                           over estimated useful lives, ranging from twenty to
                           fifty years for buildings and three to seventeen
                           years for machinery and equipment. The straight-line
                           method of depreciation was adopted for all property,
                           plant and equipment placed into service after March
                           31, 1999. For property, plant and equipment placed
                           into service prior to April 1, 1999, depreciation is
                           provided using accelerated methods. The change in
                           accounting principle was made to reflect improvements
                           in the design and durability of machinery and
                           equipment. Management believes that the straight-line
                           method results in a better matching of revenues and
                           costs, and the new method is prevalent in the
                           industries in which the Company operates.
                           Additionally, in 1999, the Company adopted AICPA
                           Statement of Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs
                           of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
                           Internal Use," which requires capitalization of
                           certain costs incurred in the development of
                           internal-use software. The change to straight-line
                           depreciation and the adoption of the AICPA Statement
                           of Position 98-1 did not have a material impact on
                           the Company's financial position, results of
                           operations or cash flows.

                           GOODWILL: Goodwill represents the excess purchase
                           price over the net assets of companies acquired in
                           business combinations. Goodwill acquired since 1970
                           is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
                           forty years; similar investments for businesses
                           acquired prior to 1970 (approximately $5,200) are
                           not being amortized. On a periodic basis, the Company
                           estimates future undiscounted cash flows of the
                           businesses to which goodwill relates to ensure that
                           the carrying value of goodwill has not been impaired.
                           Goodwill resulting from the purchase of the nitrogen
                           gas springs business was $71,482. At December 31,
                           1999 and 1998, accumulated amortization was $10,536
                           and $9,391, respectively.

                           FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: Assets and liabilities
                           of foreign operations, except those in countries with
                           high rates of inflation, are translated at year-end
                           rates of exchange; revenues and expenses are
                           translated at average annual rates of exchange. The
                           resulting translation gains and losses are reflected
                           in accumulated other comprehensive income within
                           stockholders' equity.

                           For operations in countries with high rates of
                           inflation, translation gains and losses are included
                           in net income. These translation effects, along with
                           foreign currency transactions, generated net gains of
                           $752, $240 and $2,095 in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
                           respectively.

                           NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: Earnings per share are
                           computed in accordance with Statement of Financial
                           Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings per Share."
                           Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted
                           average number of common shares outstanding during
                           the year. Diluted earnings per share reflect the
                           assumed exercise and conversion of all dilutive
                           securities. Shares held by the Guaranteed Stock Plan
                           are considered outstanding for both basic and diluted
                           earnings per share.

                           There are no adjustments to net income for purposes
                           of computing income available to common shareholders
                           for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997.
                           For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share,
                           the weighted average number of shares outstanding was
                           increased by 224,899 shares, 330,659 shares and
                           419,433 shares for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively,
                           representing the potential dilutive effects of
                           stock-based incentive plans.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2 ACQUISITION OF        On August 30, 1999, the Company purchased substantially
NITROGEN GAS            all of the assets and liabilities of the nitrogen gas
SPRINGS BUSINESS        springs business of the Teledyne Fluid Systems Division
                        of Teledyne Industries, Inc., pursuant to an Asset
                        Purchase and Sale Agreement dated July 27, 1999. The
                        acquisition of the nitrogen gas springs business was
                        recorded using the purchase method of accounting and is
                        included in the Associated Spring business segment. The
                        $92.2 million acquisition cost has been allocated to
                        tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the
                        nitrogen gas springs business based upon estimates of
                        their respective fair market values. The resulting
                        goodwill will be amortized over 40 years. The funds used
                        to purchase the assets and liabilities were initially
                        borrowed under the Company's $150 million revolving
                        credit agreement. On November 12, 1999, the Company
                        financed a portion of the acquisition through the
                        issuance of $70 million of long-term private placement
                        debt. The debt ranges in maturity from eight to eleven
                        years at an average annual interest rate of 7.75%. The
                        issuance of the long-term debt and use of the Company's
                        long-term revolving credit agreement will result in both
                        higher interest expense and higher
                        debt-to-capitalization ratios in the future.
                        Additionally, the consolidation of the nitrogen gas
                        springs business will reduce the Company's effective tax
                        rate as a result of the associated income being taxed at
                        lower foreign tax rates, as well as the result of
                        certain foreign tax benefits.

                        The following table reflects the operating results of
                        the Company for the years ended December 31, 1999 and
                        1998 on a pro forma basis, which gives effect to the
                        acquisition of the nitrogen gas springs business at the
                        beginning of each of the years presented. The pro forma
                        results are not necessarily indicative of the operating
                        results that would have occurred had the acquisition
                        been effective either January 1, 1999 or January 1,
                        1998, nor are they intended to be indicative of results
                        that may occur in the future. The underlying pro forma
                        information includes the amortization expense associated
                        with the assets acquired, the Company's financing
                        arrangements, certain purchase accounting adjustments
                        and related income tax effects.

</TABLE>

The 9.47% Notes are payable in thirteen semiannual payments of $3,077 that began
on September 16, 1995, while the 7.13% Notes are payable in four equal annual
payments of $6,250, beginning on December 5, 2002. On November 12, 1999, the
Company issued $70,000 of privately placed debt securities comprising $24,500 of
7.66% Notes, payable in 2007, and $45,500 of 7.80% Notes, payable in three equal
annual payments of $15,167, beginning in 2008. The Notes are not redeemable
prior to maturity. Proceeds from the 7.66% and 7.80% Notes, in addition to
borrowings under the Company's revolving credit agreement, were used to fund the
acquisition of the nitrogen gas springs business. The fair values of these Notes
are determined using discounted cash flows based upon the Company's estimated
current interest cost for similar types of borrowings. The carrying values of
other long-term debt and notes payable approximate their fair market value.

The Company has a revolving credit agreement with five banks that allows
borrowings up to $150,000 under Notes due December 6, 2002. A fee of 0.115% per
annum is paid on the unused portion of the commitments. Under this agreement,
the Company had $32,500 borrowed at an interest rate of 6.5% at December 31,
1999, of which $25,692 is classified as long-term debt. The Company has
available approximately $35,000 in short-term bank credit lines, of which $4,500
was in use at both December 31, 1999 and 1998. The interest rate on these
borrowings was 6.8% and 5.6% at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

The Industrial Revenue Bond, due in 2008, has a variable interest rate. The
interest rate on this borrowing was 5.75% and 5.25% at December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively.

At December 31, 1999, the Company classified $6,154 of its 9.47% Notes due
within one year as long-term debt. The Company has both the intent and the
ability, through its revolving credit agreement, to refinance these amounts on a
long-term basis.

Long-term debt is payable as follows: $44,250 in 2002, $6,250 in 2003, $6,250 in
2004 and $83,250 thereafter.

The Company had outstanding an interest rate swap (swap), a form of derivative,
which effectively converted half of its fixed-rate 9.47% Notes to variable-rate
debt with interest equal to London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 83 basis
points. The effective interest rate on the floating rate portion was 7.0% and
6.1% at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. This swap decreases as the
Notes are repaid. The fair value of the swap is determined based upon current
market prices and was $251 at December 31, 1999. On September 7, 1999, the
Company entered into a three-year, $70 million cross-currency exchange agreement
to convert U.S. dollar-denominated interest and principal liabilities into
Swedish krona-denominated liabilities at a fixed interest rate during the
three-year period. The fair value of this foreign currency swap was determined
using current market prices and was $2,197 at December 31, 1999. The Company
does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.



                                                                              15

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In addition, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $4,066 at
December 31, 1999.

Certain of the Company's debt arrangements contain requirements as to
maintenance of minimum levels of working capital and net worth, and place
certain restrictions on dividend payments and acquisitions of the Company's
common stock. Under the most restrictive covenant in any agreement, $28,784 was
available for dividends or acquisitions of common stock at December 31, 1999.

Interest paid was $5,505, $4,947 and $5,554 in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. Interest capitalized was $264, $711 and $472 in 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively, and is being depreciated over the lives of the related fixed
assets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company has not recognized deferred income taxes on $106,562 of
undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries, since such earnings
are considered to be reinvested indefinitely. If the earnings were distributed
in the form of dividends, the Company would be subject, in certain cases, to
both U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. Determination of the
amount of this unrecognized deferred income tax liability is not practicable.

A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the
consolidated effective income tax rate follows:

Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $15,781, $18,473 and $25,337 in 1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively.

8 COMMON STOCK             In 1999, 1998 and 1997, 105,189 shares, 270,854
                           shares and 566,077 shares, respectively, of common
                           stock were issued from treasury for the exercise of
                           stock options, purchases by the Employee Stock
                           Purchase Plan and various other incentive awards. In
                           1999, 1998 and 1997, the Company acquired 1,090,014
                           shares, 598,160 shares and 395,179 shares,
                           respectively, of the Company's common stock at a cost
                           of $22,351, $17,042 and $10,673, respectively. These
                           acquired shares were placed in treasury.

                           On April 2, 1997, the stockholders approved an
                           amendment to the Company's restated certificate of
                           incorporation providing for an increase in the number
                           of authorized common shares from 20 million to 60
                           million and a reduction in the par value of common
                           and preferred stock from $1.00 to $0.01 per share.
                           This enabled the Company to effect a three-for-one
                           stock split for stockholders of record on April 3,
                           1997. All references to shares and per share amounts
                           in the consolidated financial statements and
                           accompanying notes have been adjusted retroactively
                           for the three-for-one stock split. Stockholders'
                           equity at December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, reflects
                           the effect of the stock split and change in par value
                           per share. These changes reduced the common stock
                           account by $15,517 and increased the additional
                           paid-in capital account by a like amount in 1997.


                           In December 1996, the Company adopted a new
                           shareholder rights plan. Under the new plan, each
                           share of common stock contains one right (Right)
                           which entitles the holder to purchase one one-hun-
                           dredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
                           Preferred Stock, for two hundred dollars. The Rights
                           generally will not become exercisable unless and
                           until, among other things, any person or group
                           acquires beneficial ownership of 35% or more of the
                           outstanding stock. The new Rights are generally
                           redeemable at $0.01 per Right at any time until ten
                           days following a public announcement that a 35% or
                           greater position in the Company's common stock has
                           been acquired and will expire, unless earlier
                           redeemed or exchanged, on December 23, 2006.

                           If, following the acquisition by a person or group of
                           35% or more of the outstanding shares of the
                           Company's common stock, the Company is acquired in a
                           merger or other business combination or 50% or more
                           of the Company's assets or earnings power is sold or
                           transferred, each outstanding Right becomes
                           exercisable for common stock or other securities of
                           the acquiring entity having a value of twice the
                           exercise price of the Right.

9 PREFERRED STOCK          At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had
                           3,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized, none
                           of which were outstanding. As discussed in Note 8,
                           the par value of preferred stock was reduced from
                           $1.00 to $0.01 per share in 1997.

                                                                              17

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

10 STOCK PLANS

                           All U.S. salaried and non-union hourly employees are
                           eligible to participate in the Company's Guaranteed
                           Stock Plan (GSP). The GSP provides for the investment
                           of employer and employee contributions in the
                           Company's common stock. The Company guarantees a
                           minimum rate of return on certain GSP assets. At
                           December 31, 1999, the Company's guarantee on these
                           assets was $2,321. This amount will only become a
                           liability for the Company if, and to the extent, the
                           value of the related Company stock does not cover the
                           guaranteed asset value on the day an employee
                           withdraws from the plan.

                           The GSP was a leveraged ESOP until mid-1999. In 1989,
                           the GSP purchased 1,737,930 shares of the Company's
                           common stock at a cost of $21,000 using the proceeds
                           of a loan guaranteed by the Company. These shares
                           were held in trust and were issued to employees'
                           accounts in the GSP as the loan was repaid. The loan
                           interest was based on LIBOR and generated interest
                           costs of $32, $212 and $387 in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
                           respectively. Contributions and certain dividends
                           received were used in part by the GSP to service its
                           debt. Contributions included both employee and
                           Company contributions.

                           The Company contributions were equal to the amount
                           required by the GSP to pay the principal and interest
                           due under the GSP loan plus that required to purchase
                           any additional shares required to be allocated to
                           employee accounts, less the sum of employee
                           contributions and dividends received by the GSP.
                           Effective July 2, 1999, the GSP is no longer
                           leveraged. The Company now contributes 50% of
                           employee contributions up to 6% of eligible
                           compensation plus any guarantee payments. Employees
                           may elect to contribute additional amounts up to a
                           total of 10% of eligible compensation. The GSP used
                           $1,012, $1,899 and $1,781 of Company dividends for
                           debt service in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
                           The Company expenses all cash contributions made to
                           the GSP. The Company recognized expense of $1,115 in
                           1999 and income of $403 and $498 in 1998 and 1997,
                           respectively. As of December 31, 1999, the GSP held
                           3,060,386 shares of the Company's common stock. For
                           financial statement purposes, the Company reflected
                           its guarantee of the GSP's debt as a liability with a
                           like amount reflected as a reduction of stockholders'
                           equity.

                           The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
                           (ESPP) under which eligible employees may elect to
                           have up to 10% of base compensation deducted from
                           payroll for the purchase of the Company's common
                           stock at 85% of market value on the date of purchase.
                           The maximum number of shares which may be purchased
                           under the ESPP is 2,025,000. The number of shares
                           purchased under the ESPP was 62,868, 45,599 and
                           46,600 in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. As of
                           December 31, 1999, 457,011 additional shares may be
                           purchased.

                           The 1991 Barnes Group Stock Incentive Plan (1991
                           Plan) authorizes the granting of incentives to
                           executive officers, directors and key employees in
                           the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
                           incentive stock rights and performance unit awards. A
                           predecessor plan that provided for similar incentives
                           expired in 1991. Options granted under that plan
                           continue to be exercisable, and any options which
                           terminate without being exercised become available
                           for grant under the 1991 Plan. A maximum of 2,384,826
                           common shares are subject to issuance under this plan
                           after December 31, 1999. Compensation cost related to
                           these plans was $610, $1,596 and $1,150 in 1999, 1998
                           and 1997, respectively. The Company recorded, in
                           additional paid-in capital, tax benefits related to
                           stock options of $40, $1,573 and $2,404 in 1999, 1998
                           and 1997, respectively.

                           In 1998, 60,000 Incentive Stock Rights and 75,000
                           stock options were granted outside of the 1991 Plan.
                           The options are included in the tables below.

                           Data relating to options granted under these plans

As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, there were 412,024 shares and 928,050 shares,
respectively, available for future grant under the 1991 Plan and its predecessor
plan.

Incentive Stock Rights entitle the holder to receive, without payment, incentive
stock units (units), each of which is equivalent to one share of the Company's
common stock, after the lapse of the incentive period. Certain units are also
subject to the satisfaction of established performance goals. Additionally,
holders are credited with dividend equivalents, which are converted into
additional units. All units granted have up to a five-year incentive period. In
1999, 5,000 units were granted; 8,612 units were credited to holders for
dividend equivalents; 16,144 units, which include dividend equivalents, were
converted to an equivalent number of shares of common stock; and 92,501 units
were forfeited. Additionally, 125,199 units, which include dividend equivalents,
were terminated in 1998 in conjunction with the accelerated retirement agreement
for the Company's retired president. As of December 31, 1999, there were 299,027
units outstanding.

Under the Non-Employee Director Deferred Stock Plan, each non-employee director
is awarded 6,000 shares of the Company's common stock upon retirement. There
were no shares issued under this plan in 1999 and 1998, while 12,000 shares were
issued in 1997. Additionally, 6,000 shares were canceled as of December 31,
1999. There are 48,000 shares reserved for issuance under this plan.

Total shares reserved for issuance under all stock plans aggregated 2,889,837 at
December 31, 1999.

The Company applies APB Opinion 25 to account for stock-based compensation. Had
compensation cost for the Company's stock-based compensation plans been
determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those
plans consistent with the method of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," the Company's net income
and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts
indicated below:

POSTRETIREMENT             Company's worldwide employees at Associated Spring,
BENEFITS                   Bowman Distribution and its Executive Office. Plan
                           benefits for salaried and non-union hourly employees
                           are based on years of service and average salary.
                           Plans covering union hourly employees provide
                           benefits based on years of service. The Company funds

                           Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as
                           amended. Plan assets consist primarily of common
                           stocks and fixed income investments, including
                           384,048 shares of Company stock. Additionally, the

                           Company contributions under this plan are based
                           primarily on the performance of the business units
                           and employee compensation. Contribution expense under
                           this plan was $1,292, $2,029 and $2,593 in 1999, 1998
                           and 1997, respectively.

                           The Company provides certain other medical, dental
                           and life insurance postretirement benefits for a
                           majority of its retired employees in the U.S. and
                           Canada. It is the Company's practice to fund these
                           benefits as incurred.

The Company's accumulated postretirement benefit obligations, exclusive of
pensions, take into account certain cost-sharing provisions. The annual rate of
increase in the cost of covered benefits (that is, healthcare cost trend rate)
is assumed to be 6.0% for 1999, reducing to 5.0% by the year 2001. A one
percentage point increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would
increase the accumulated benefit obligations by approximately $2,188 at December
31, 1999, and would have increased the 1999 aggregate of the service and
interest cost components of postretirement benefit expense by approximately
$167. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate
would decrease the accumulated benefit obligations by approximately $2,122 at
December 31, 1999, and would have decreased the 1999 aggregate of the service
and interest cost components of postretirement benefit expense by approximately
$125.


12 LEASES         The Company has various noncancellable operating leases for
                  buildings, office space and equipment. Capital leases were not
                  significant. Rent expense was $7,712, $7,133 and $7,178 for
                  1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Minimum rental commitments
                  under noncancellable leases in years 2000 through 2004 are
                  $6,097, $5,802, $4,678, $3,660, $3,063 and $7,246 thereafter.

13 INFORMATION ON
BUSINESS SEGMENTS


                           The Company's reportable segments are strategic
                           business groups that offer different products and
                           services. Each segment is managed separately because
                           each business requires different technology and
                           marketing strategies. Specifically, the Company
                           operates three reportable business segments:

                           ASSOCIATED SPRING manufactures custom-made mechanical
                           and nitrogen gas springs, manifold systems and
                           other close-tolerance engineered metal components,
                           principally for the transportation, electronics and
                           industrial markets. Associated Spring's custom metal
                           parts are sold in the United States and through its
                           international subsidiaries. International
                           manufacturing operations are located in Brazil,
                           Sweden, Canada, Mexico and Singapore. The automotive
                           and automotive parts industries constitute Associated
                           Spring's largest markets.

                           BOWMAN DISTRIBUTION distributes fast-moving,
                           consumable repair and replacement products for
                           industrial, heavy equipment and transportation
                           maintenance markets. Additionally, it distributes
                           close-tolerance engineered metal components
                           principally manufactured by Associated Spring. Bowman
                           Distribution's operations and markets are located
                           primarily in the United States. Other important
                           locations include Canada and Europe.

                           BARNES AEROSPACE supplies precision machined and
                           fabricated components and assemblies for the
                           aerospace industry. Additionally, it refurbishes jet
                           engine components for many of the world's commercial
                           airlines and the military. Barnes Aerospace's
                           operations are primarily in the United States, with
                           additional locations in Europe and Singapore. Its
                           markets are located in the United States, Europe and
                           Asia.

                           The Company evaluates the performance of its
                           reportable segments based on operating profit of the
                           respective businesses. In 1999, segment operating
                           profit was modified to follow the accounting policies
                           described in Note 1. The equity income from the
                           Company's investment in the NASCO joint venture is
                           incorporated into the segment results of Associated
                           Spring. The Company evaluates the performance of its
                           reportable segments based on the operating profit of
                           the respective businesses, which includes net sales,
                           cost of sales, selling and administrative expenses
                           and certain components of other income and other
                           expenses, as well as the allocation of corporate
                           overhead expenses. Sales between the business
                           segments and between the geographic areas are
                           accounted for on the same basis as sales to
                           unaffiliated customers. Additionally, revenues are
                           attributed to countries based on location of
                           manufacturing or distribution facilities.

                           The following tables set forth information about the
                           Company's operations by its three reportable business
                           segments and by geographic area.

                  NOTES:

                  In 1999, sales from any one customer did not exceed 10% of the
                  Company's total revenues. In 1998, one customer accounted for
                  11.8% of the Company's total revenues.

                  "Other" revenues represent intersegment sales, of which the
                  majority are sales by Associated Spring to Bowman
                  Distribution.

                  The operating profit of Associated Spring includes income from
                  its equity investment in NASCO of $1.7 million, $2.6 million
                  and $1.8 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

                  "Other" operating profit in 1998 includes the $12.9 million

REPORT OF           TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF
INDEPENDENT         BARNES GROUP INC.
ACCOUNTANTS
                    In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
[PRICEWATERHOUSE-   and the related consolidated statements of income,
COOPERS LOGO]       stockholders' equity and cash flows present fairly, in all
                    material respects, the financial position of Barnes Group
                    Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and
                    the results of their operations and their cash flows for
                    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
                    1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally
                    accepted in the United States. These financial statements
                    are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
                    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
                    statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
                    these statements in accordance with auditing standards
                    generally accepted in the United States, which require that
                    we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
                    about whether the financial statements are free of material
                    misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
                    evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
                    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
                    used and significant estimates made by management and
                    evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
                    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
                    opinion expressed above.
