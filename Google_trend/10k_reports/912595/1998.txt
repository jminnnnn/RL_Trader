ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

THE COMPANY

Mid-America  Apartment  Communities,  Inc.  (the  "Company")  is   a
Memphis, Tennessee-based self-administered and self-managed umbrella
partnership real estate investment trust, ("REIT") ("UPREIT")  which
owns  and  operates  115  apartment  communities  containing  30,912
apartment  units  in  13  states  (the  "Communities"),  has   2,660
apartment  units  under  construction in 7  new  communities  and  5
additions to existing communities, and a further 804 apartment units
in  various  stages of development.  The Company  has  entered  into
definitive   agreements  to  acquire  three   additional   apartment
communities  containing 624 apartment units, of  which  negotiations
are still in progress.

Founded  in 1977 by George E. Cates, the Company's Chairman  of  the
Board  of  Directors  and  Chief Executive  Officer,  the  Company's
predecessor  grew  from an operator of a single  252-unit  apartment
community  in Memphis, Tennessee into a fully-integrated  owner  and
operator  of  5,580 apartment units in 22 apartment  communities  in
four  southeastern states immediately prior to the Company's initial
public offering in February 1994 (the "Initial Offering"). Since the
Initial  Offering,  the  Company's portfolio  has  increased  by  93
apartment  communities containing 25,332 apartment units,  including
1)   12  apartment  communities  containing  3,212  apartment  units
acquired  in  the  Company's merger with America  First  REIT,  Inc.
("AFR")  in June 1995 (the "AFR Merger") for an aggregate  value  of
approximately $111 million (as measured by Common Stock  issued  and
AFR  debt assumed) and 2) 30 apartment communities containing  7,691
apartments   acquired   in  the  company's  merger   with   Flournoy
Development Company and related partnerships ("FDC") on November 25,
1997 (the "FDC Merger")  for an aggregate value of $423 million. The
FDC  Merger  resulted  in  the  establishment  of  Flournoy  Service
Corporation ("FSC"), the name of which was later changed to Flournoy
Development Corporation, of which the Company owns 100% of the  non-
voting common stock, specifically to own and operate the third-party
construction, brokerage and management activities formerly conducted
by  FDC.  At least 95% of the after tax cash flow after intercompany
interest  expense of this subsidiary is distributed  to  Mid-America
Apartments,  L.P., a Tennessee limited partnership  (the  "Operating
Partnership")  through its  ownership of the non-voting common stock
in  FSC,  with the 5% balance to the owners of  FSC's common  stock,
consisting  of Mr. Cates and John F. Flournoy, the Vice-Chairman  of
the  Company. FSC did not make a distribution to Messrs.  Cates  and
Flournoy in 1997 and does not currently anticipate a distribution in
1998.  The operations of FSC include the management of 43 properties
with  4,971 apartment units owned by third party investors, and  the
development  and construction of properties for third  parties.  The
Company believes that this structure is permitted under the terms of
the  Internal  Revenue  Code  and also provides  the  most  economic
benefit to its shareholders.

The   Company's  business  is  conducted  principally  through   the
Operating  Partnership.  The Company is the sole general partner  of
the Operating Partnership, holding, as of December 31, 1997, 181,844
Common  Units or a 1% general partnership interest in the  Operating
Partnership.  The Company's wholly-owned qualified REIT  subsidiary,
MAC  II  of  Delaware, Inc., a Delaware corporation,  is  a  limited
partner  in the Operating Partnership and, as of December 31,  1997,
held  15,736,248  Common Units, or 81.1% of all  outstanding  Common
Units.

In  connection  with the formation of the Operating Partnership  and
the  Initial  Offering, the Operating Partnership  issued  2,460,413
Common Units  to the former owners of Communities contributed to the
Operating Partnership.  The Common Units held by such former  owners
are redeemable by the holders, at their option, for shares of Common
Stock  on a one-for-one basis or, at the Company's option, for cash.
The Company has filed a shelf registration statement relating to the
offer  and sale of the Common Units  by the holders thereof.  As  of
December  31, 1997, such former owners held 2,384,097 Common  Units.
In subsequent transactions and acquisitions of properties, including
in  the  FDC  Merger, an additional 553,205 Common Units  have  been
issued,  resulting in a total of 2,937,302 Common Units being  owned
by outside investors.

Certain  Communities are owned by limited partnerships of which  the
Operating  Partnership and the Company or a wholly  owned  qualified
REIT  subsidiary  are  the only partners. The Company,  directly  or
through  seven  wholly  owned qualified REIT subsidiaries,  owns  19
Communities.  The  Company also has established Mid-America  Capital
Partners,  L.P., a single-purpose entity formed in 1997  to  own  26
apartment communities containing 5,947 apartment units, of which the
Operating  Partnership owns a 99% limited partnership  interest  and
the  Company,  through a subsidiary, owns a 1%  General  Partnership
interest

OPERATING PHILOSOPHY

MID-SIZE  MARKET  FOCUS.  The Company focuses on owning,  operating,
developing, constructing and acquiring apartment communities in mid-
size  southeastern and Texas cities. The Company believes that these
markets   generally   have  been  less  susceptible   to   apartment
overbuilding  during  past real estate investment  cycles,  and  the
Company  believes that apartment communities in these markets  offer
attractive  long-term  investment  returns.  The  Company  seeks  to
develop  and  acquire apartment communities in its existing  markets
and selected new markets where it believes there is less competition
for  acquisitions  or  new construction from other  well-capitalized
buyers.  The Company believes it can acquire apartment  units  at  a
significant discount to estimated replacement cost in these  markets
and  through  its experience construct and develop apartments  at  a
reasonable  investment cost to generate higher returns on investment
than is available in large metropolitan areas.

INTENSIVE MANAGEMENT FOCUS.  The Company strongly emphasizes on-site
property  management. Particular attention is paid to  opportunities
to increase rents, raise average occupancy rates, and control costs,
with property managers being given the responsibility for monitoring
market trends and the discretion to react to such trends.

DEDICATION  TO  CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Management's experience  is  that
maintaining a consistently high level of customer satisfaction leads
to   greater  demand  for  the  Company's  apartment  units,  higher
occupancy  and  rental rates, and increased long-term profitability.
The   Company,  as  part  of  its  intense  management  focus,   has
implemented  a  practice of having highly trained property  managers
and   service  technicians  on-site  at  each  of  the  Communities.
Management undertakes frequent resident surveys and focus groups, in
order to measure customer satisfaction.

DECENTRALIZED  OPERATIONAL  STRUCTURE.   The  Company's  operational
structure is organized on a geographic basis. The Company's property
managers  have  overall operating responsibility for their  specific
Communities. Property managers report to area managers  or  regional
managers  who, in turn, are accountable to the Company's  President.
Management  believes  that  its  decentralized  operating  structure
capitalizes   on  specific  market  knowledge,  increases   personal
accountability relative to a centralized structure and is beneficial
in the acquisition, redevelopment and development process.

GROWTH STRATEGIES

The  Company seeks to increase earnings per share and operating cash
flow  to  maximize shareholder value through a balanced strategy  of
internal and external growth.

INTERNAL  GROWTH  STRATEGY.  Management's goal is  to  maximize  its
return  on  investment in each Community by increasing rental  rates
and  reducing  operating expenses while maintaining  high  occupancy
levels.  The  Company  (i)  seeks  higher  net  rental  revenues  by
enhancing and maintaining the competitiveness of the Communities and
(ii)  manages  expenses  through its system of  detailed  management
reporting  and  accountability  in order  to  achieve  increases  in
operating  cash  flow.  The  steps taken to  meet  these  objectives
include:

*     empowering the Company's property managers to adjust rents  in
  response to local market conditions and to concentrate resident turnover
  in peak rental demand months;

*    implementing programs to control expenses through investment in cost-
  saving initiatives, such as the installation of individual  apartment
  unit water and utility meters in certain Communities;

*    ensuring that, through monthly inspections of all Communities by
  senior management and prompt attention to maintenance and recurring
  capital needs, the Communities are properly maintained;

*    improving the "curb appeal" of the Communities through extensive
  landscaping and exterior improvements and repositioning Communities from
  time to time to maintain market leadership positions;

*     investing  heavily in training programs for its property-level
  personnel;

*    compensating all employees through performance-based compensation
  programs and stock ownership programs; and

*    maintaining a hands-on management style and "flat" organizational
  structure that emphasizes senior management's continued close contact
  with the market and employees.

EXTERNAL GROWTH STRATEGY.  The Company's external growth strategy is
to   acquire  and  develop  additional  apartment  units  and,  when
apartment   communities  no  longer  meet  the  Company's  long-term
strategic objectives or investment return goals, to dispose of those
Communities.   Through  the  Company's  umbrella  partnership   REIT
("UPREIT")  structure,  the  Company  has  the  ability  to  acquire
apartment communities through the issuance of UPREIT Units  in  tax-
deferred exchanges with owners of such properties. Since the Initial
Offering,  the  Company  has  grown by 25,332  apartment  units,  an
increase  of  approximately 454% over the number of apartment  units
immediately  prior  to the Initial Offering. Typical  attributes  of
apartment communities which the Company seeks to acquire are:

*    well-constructed properties having attractive locations, potential
  for increases in rental rates and occupancy, potential for reductions in
  operating costs and acquisition prices below estimated replacement cost;

*    properties with opportunities for internal growth through (i) market
  repositioning by means of property upgrades which typically include
  landscaping, selective refurbishing and the addition of amenities and
  (ii) realizing economies of scale in management and purchasing;  and

*    properties located in the Company's existing markets and mid-size
  southeastern and Texas metropolitan areas having favorable  market
  characteristics.

The  Company develops new apartments when it believes it can achieve
an  attractive return on investment substantially above the rate  of
return  of  acquisitions. In November the Company acquired,  through
the   FDC  Merger,  Flournoy  Development  Company,  a  builder  and
developer  of  multifamily apartments with 30  years  of  experience
owning, managing, developing and building apartments. As a result of
this  merger, the Company has significantly expanded its  commitment
to  new  development.  The Company has established higher investment
return   criteria  for  new  development  than  it   maintains   for
acquisitions and generally expects that its new development  program
will  generate  higher  stabilized returns on investment  than  most
acquisition opportunities.  Since the Initial Offering, the  Company
has completed the following development projects:

*     122 apartment units constructed at the Woods of Post House  in
  Jackson, Tennessee in close proximity to three other Communities;

*    24 additional apartment units at the Reflection Pointe apartment
  community in Jackson, Mississippi; and

*     32  additional  apartment units at the Park Haywood  apartment
  community in Greenville, South Carolina.

In  1997, the Company substantially completed construction of a 234-
unit  expansion  of  the  384-unit Lincoln on  the  Green  apartment
community  at the Tournament Players' Club at Southwind in  Memphis,
Tennessee.   The development of expansion for Lincoln on  the  Green
was  managed successfully and began by Flournoy Development  Company
prior  to the merger with the Company.  The Company currently has  a
development pipeline of 3,466 apartments that are in various  stages
of  construction and development, of which 1,690 are anticipated  to
be  completed  in  1998. It is likely that additional  opportunities
will be identified for development in late 1998 and 1999.

COMPLETED  ACQUISITIONS.     During 1997, the Company acquired  the
following  apartment  communities  (the  "Completed  Acquisitions")
containing  an  aggregate  of  3,314 apartment  units  (dollars  in
millions):

COMPETITION

All of the Company's Communities are located in developed areas that
include other apartment communities.  Occupancy and rental rates are
affected  by  the number of competitive apartment communities  in  a
particular  area.   The Company's properties compete  with  numerous
other  multifamily properties, the owners of which may have  greater
resources  than  the  Company and whose  management  may  have  more
experience  than the Company's management.  Moreover,  single-family
rental  housing, manufactured housing, condominiums and the new  and
existing  home  market  provide housing  alternatives  to  potential
residents of apartment communities.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

RECENT  ACQUISITIONS

Since  December  31,  1997, the Company has acquired  the  following
apartment  communities  (the  "Recent Acquisitions")  containing  an
aggregate of 392 apartment units (dollars in millions):

                             NUMBER   ACQUISITION CONTRACT
PROPERTY         MARKET     OF UNITS     DATE       PRICE
- ----------   -------------- --------  ----------- --------
Walden Run   McDonough, GA    240        2/5/98    $ 13.4
Van Mark     Huntsville, AL   152       2/26/98       5.1
                            --------              --------                
    Total                     392                  $ 18.5
                            ========              ========

The  Company  funded  the  cash required to  consummate  the  Recent
Acquisitions  with  borrowings under  the  Company's  bank  line  of
credit.

PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS

The  Company has entered into definitive agreements to purchase  the
200-unit  Eagle Ridge apartments in Birmingham, Alabama,   the  204-
unit  Village Apartments at Carrollwood in Tampa, Florida  and   the
220-unit  Georgetown  Grove  Apartments in  Savannah,  Georgia.  The
Company  plans to fund the cash required to consummate the  Proposed
Acquisitions with issuance of Umbrella Partnership units, borrowings
under  the  Credit Line and assumption of existing mortgages.  There
are  remaining issues to negotiate on these contracts and there  can
be no assurance that these acquisitions will close.

DEVELOPMENT

The  Company's  Board of Directors has approved the  development  of
three   apartment   communities  totaling  702  units   located   in
Montgomery,  Alabama,  Murfreesboro,  Tennessee,  and  Panama  City,
Florida;  the Board has also approved the development of a  124-unit
addition to the Company's St Augustine property in Jacksonville, Florida.
The  total estimated cost of these projects is $50.5 million  to  be
invested in 1998 and 1999.

The Company has a total of 1,762 apartments in pre-development or in-
depth feasibility review. If all these are developed, together  with
the 1,070 apartments under construction and the 634 apartments under
construction  and  lease-up, the total  planned  investment  in  new
development in 1998 is $118 million, with an additional  $70 million
to complete the projects in 1999. The Company has several additional
projects  in earlier stages of feasibility study, and it anticipates
that  the  additional  apartment communities will  be  approved  for
development later in 1998 which will require additional  funding  in
1999.


DISTRIBUTION INCREASE

In  January  1998, the Company raised its quarterly distribution  to
common  shareholders  from  $.535  per  share  to  $.55  per  share,
effective with its distribution paid on January 30, 1998.




ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

The  Company  seeks  to  acquire and develop  apartment  communities
appealing to middle and upper income residents in mid-size cities in
the  southeastern United States and Texas. Approximately 71% of  the
Company's   apartment  units  are  located  in   Georgia,   Florida,
Tennessee,  and Texas markets. The Company's strategic focus  is  to
provide  its  residents high quality apartment units  in  attractive
community  settings,  characterized  by  extensive  landscaping  and
attention  to aesthetic detail. The Company utilizes its  experience
and  expertise in maintenance, landscaping, marketing and management
to  effectively  "reposition" many of the apartment  communities  it
acquires to raise occupancy levels and per unit average rentals. The
average age of the Communities at December 31, 1997 was 12.2  years.
The  following table sets forth certain operating data regarding the
Company  for the periods indicated excluding development communities.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

The  Common Stock has been listed and traded on the NYSE  under  the
symbol  "MAA" since the Initial Offering in February 1994. On  March
13, 1998, the reported last sale price of the Company's common stock
on  the NYSE was $28.13 per share and there were approximately 1,640
holders  of record of the Common Stock. The Company estimates  there
are  approximately 16,000 beneficial owners of the Common Stock. The
following  table sets forth the quarterly high and low sales  prices
of  the  Common  Stock as reported on the NYSE and the distributions
declared by the Company with respect to the periods indicated.

                              Sales Prices         
                            ----------------          Dividends

      -----
      First Quarter      $ 29.750     $ 27.625            .535
      Second Quarter       28.875       25.00             .535
      Third Quarter        30.500       26.625            .535
      Fourth Quarter       30.063       26.625            .55



The  Company's current annual distribution rate with respect to  the
Common  Stock is $2.20 per share. The actual distributions  made  by
the  Company will be affected by a number of factors, including  the
gross revenues received from the Communities, the operating expenses
of  the  Company,  the interest expense incurred on  borrowings  and
unanticipated capital expenditures.

The  Company pays a preferential regular monthly distribution on the
Series  A  Preferred Stock issued in October 1996 and the  Series  B
Preferred Stock issued in November 1997 at an annual rate of  $2.375
per  share and $2.21875 per share, respectively. No distribution may
be  made  on the Common Stock unless all accrued distributions  have
been made with respect to the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock.
No  assurance can be given that the Company will be able to maintain
its   distribution  rate  on  its  Common  Stock  or  make  required
distributions  with  respect to the Series A or Series  B  Preferred
Stock.

In  1997,  the Company implemented the DRSPP under which holders  of
Common  Stock (and Series A and Series B Preferred Stock) may  elect
automatically  to reinvest their distributions in additional  shares
of  Common  Stock and/or to make optional purchases of Common  Stock
free of brokerage commissions and charges. Shares purchased directly
from the Company will be purchased at up to a 3% discount from their
fair  market  value  at  the Company's discretion.  To  fulfill  its
obligations under the DRSPP, the Company may either issue additional
shares  of  Common  Stock or repurchase Common  Stock  in  the  open
market.

Future distributions by the Company will be at the discretion of the
Board  of  Directors  and will depend on the actual funds  available
for  distribution  of the Company, its financial condition,  capital
requirements,  the annual distribution requirements under  the  REIT
provisions  of  the  Code and such other factors  as  the  Board  of
Directors deems relevant.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

The   following  is  a  discussion  of  the  consolidated  financial
condition  and  results of operations of the Company for  the  years
ended  December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995. This discussion should  be
read in conjunction with all of the financial statements included in
this  Annual Report on Form 10-K. These financial statements include
all  adjustments which are, in the opinion of management,  necessary
to  reflect a fair statement of the results for the interim  periods
presented,  and  all  such adjustments are  of  a  normal  recurring
nature.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

Funds  from  operations ("FFO") represents net income  (computed  in
accordance  with  GAAP)  excluding  extraordinary  items,   minority
interest   in  Operating  Partnership  income,  gain  or   loss   on
disposition  of  real  estate assets, and  certain  non-cash  items,
primarily  depreciation  and  amortization,  less  preferred   stock
dividends.  The  Company  computes FFO in accordance  with  NAREIT's
current   definition,  which  eliminates  amortization  of  deferred
financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets as  items
added  back  to  net income when computing FFO. The Company  adopted
this  method of calculating FFO effective as of the NAREIT-suggested
adoption date of January 1, 1996. FFO should not be considered as an
alternative  to  net  income  or  any  other  GAAP  measurement   of
performance,  as  an  indicator of operating performance  or  as  an
alternative  to cash flows from operating, investing, and  financing
activities as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes that  FFO
is  helpful in understanding the Company's results of operations  in
that  such  calculation reflects cash flow from operating activities
and  the  Company's ability to support interest payments and general
operating expenses before the impact of certain activities  such  as
changes  in  other  assets  and  accounts  payable.   The  Company's
calculation  of FFO may differ from the methodology for  calculating
FFO  utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable
to such other REITs.

For   the   year    ended  December  31,  1997,  FFO  increased   by
approximately  $8,102,000 or 22%, when compared to  the  year  ended
December  31,  1996. The increase was primarily attributable  to  an
approximate  $27,233,000 increase in revenues, which  was  partially
offset  by increases in expenses mainly associated with the increase
in  the  number of apartment units owned by the Company.  On  a  per
share basis, FFO increased approximately 3% from $2.66 per share for
the  year  ended December 31, 1996 to $2.73 per share for  the  same
period in 1997.

For   the   year    ended  December  31,  1996,  FFO  increased   by
approximately $6,809,000 or 23.7%, when compared to the year earlier
(adjusted  only for the new NAREIT definition of FFO). The  increase
was primarily attributable to an approximate $16,919,000 increase in
revenues, which was partially offset by increases in expenses mainly
associated with the increase in the number of apartment units  owned
by  the Company. On a per share basis, FFO increased 8.6% from $2.44
per share (restated for the effect of adoption of the current NAREIT
FFO  definition and the change in accounting policy)  for  the  year
ended  December 31, 1995 to $2.65 per share for the same  period  in
1996.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 TO THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 1996

During   the  1997  period,  the  Company  acquired  12  communities
containing 3,314 apartment units.  In addition, through the November
25,  1997  merger  with Flournoy Development Company  ("FDC"),   the
Company  acquired  32 communities containing 8,641  apartment  units
including 950 apartment units under development. The total number of
apartment  units  owned  at December 31,  1997  was  30,468  in  115
apartment  communities,  compared to 19,280  in  73  communities  at
December  31,  1996.  Average  monthly  rental  per  apartment  unit
increased  to  $549 at December 31, 1997 from $529 at  December  31,
1996 for the Company's properties owned prior to the merger. For the
communities  owned  prior to the merger, average occupancy  for  the
years  ended   December  31,  1997 and 1996  was  94.5%  and  95.4%,
respectively.  For the properties acquired through the  FDC  Merger,
average  monthly  rental per apartment unit  was  $613  and  average
occupancy was 92.2% at December 31, 1997.

Total revenues for 1997 increased by approximately $27,234,000,  due
primarily  to (i) approximately $12,743,000 from the 12  Communities
acquired  in  1997,  (ii)  approximately  $5,342,000  from  the   30
completed  Communities  acquired  through  the  FDC  Merger,   (iii)
approximately  $6,759,000 from a full years  operation  of  the  six
Communities  acquired in 1996, (iii) approximately  $2,113,000  from
the   Communities   owned   throughout  both   periods,   and   (iv)
approximately  $277,000  from The Woods at Post  House  in  Jackson,
Tennessee  which  completed development in  the  Fall  of  1995  and
Lincoln  on the Green phase II in Memphis, Tennessee which completed
development early 1998.

Property  operating  expenses for 1997  increased  by  approximately
$9,834,000, due primarily to (i) approximately $4,929,000  from  the
12  Communities acquired in 1997, (ii) approximately $1,938,000 from
the  30 completed Communities acquired through the FDC Merger, (iii)
approximately  $2,298,000 from a full years  operation  of  the  six
Communities acquired in 1996, (iii) approximately $583,000 from  the
Communities  owned  throughout both periods, and (iv)  approximately
$86,000 from The Woods at Post House  which completed development in
the  Fall  of 1995 and Lincoln on the Green phase II. Utility  costs
decreased from 5.5% of revenue to 4.6% of revenue for the year ended
December  31,  1997 compared to the same period a year earlier,  due
primarily  to over 13,000 units now submetered for water  usage  and
continued  benefits  from  the  1996 completion  of  the  individual
apartment unit electricity metering at Sailwinds at Lake Magdalene.

General and  administrative expense increased $448,000 for the  year
ended  December 31, 1997 compared to December 31, 1996 and decreased
from  5.5% of revenue to 4.8% of revenue for the year ended December
31, 1997 compared to the same period a year earlier.  The reductions
result  from  $122,000  transfer of landscape overhead  to  property
costs,   $156,000  reduced  state  and  local  taxes  and  increased
operating efficiencies of a larger operation.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to (i)
approximately $2,503,000 from the 12 Communities acquired  in  1997,
(ii)  approximately  $1,247,000 from the  30  completed  Communities
acquired  through  the  FDC Merger, (iii)  approximately  $1,493,000
from a full years operation of the six Communities acquired in 1996,
(iii)  approximately $1,224,000 from additional capital expenditures
on    Communities   owned   throughout  both   periods,   and   (iv)
approximately  $54,000 from The Woods at Post House and  Lincoln  on
the  Green  phase II.  Amortization of deferred financing costs  and
unamortized costs in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for
1997   were   approximately  $888,000  and  approximately  $309,000,
respectively.

Interest expense increased approximately $3,177,000 during 1997  due
primarily to apartment acquisitions. The Company reduced its average
borrowing cost to 7.41% at December 31, 1997 as compared to 7.92% on
December  31, 1996. The average maturity on the Company's  debt  was
10.2 and 9.9 years at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.   In
1997,  the Company recorded an approximate $8,622,000 loss on  early
extinguishment of debt, net of minority interest, primarily from the
repayment of certain debt in connection with the FDC Merger.

Income before minority interest for the year ended December 31, 1997
increased  approximately $5,069,000 over  the  same  period  a  year
earlier.


COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 TO THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 1995

During   the  1996  period,  the  Company  acquired  six   apartment
communities  and sold three apartment communities. The total  number
of  apartment  units owned at December 31, 1996  was  19,280  in  73
apartment  communities,  compared to 18,219  in  70  communities  at
December  31,  1995.  Average  monthly  rental  per  apartment  unit
increased  to  $529 at December 31, 1996 from $508 at  December  30,
1995.  Average occupancy for the years ended  December 31, 1996  and
1995 was 95.4% and 95.2%, respectively.

Total revenues for 1996 increased by approximately $16,919,000,  due
primarily  to (i) approximately $4,833,000 from the six  Communities
acquired  in 1996, (ii)  approximately $7,156,000 from a full  years
operation  of  the  15 Communities acquired in 1995,  including  the
Communities   acquired  in  the  AFR  Merger,  (iii)   approximately
$4,363,000  from the Communities owned throughout both periods,  and
(iv)  approximately  $567,000 from   The  Woods  at  Post  House  in
Jackson, Tennessee  which completed development in the Fall of 1995.

Property  operating  expenses for 1996  increased  by  approximately
$4,616,000, due primarily to (i) approximately $1,686,000  from  the
six  Communities  acquired  in 1996, (ii)  approximately  $2,746,000
from  a  full  year's operations of the 15 Communities  acquired  in
1995,  including  the Communities acquired in the  AFR  Merger,  and
(iii)  approximately $234,000 from The Woods at  Post  House.  These
increases  were offset by a decrease of approximately  $51,000  from
the   Communities   owned  throughout  both  periods.   Repair   and
maintenance expense decreased primarily due to the Company's  change
in the capitalization policy to conform with policies currently used
by  the  majority  of  the largest apartment  REITs.  Utility  costs
decreased from 6.1% of revenue to 5.5% of revenue for the year ended
December  31,  1996 compared to the same period a year earlier,  due
primarily  to  the installation of 6,400 individual  apartment  unit
water  meters  and the completion of the individual  apartment  unit
electricity metering at Sailwinds at Lake Magdalene.

General  and  administrative expense increased in 1996 approximately
$1,303,000  primarily due to the opening of the new training  center
and other expenses due to the continued growth of the company.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to (i)
approximately  $893,000 from the six apartment communities  acquired
in  1996,  (ii)   approximately $1,346,000  from  the  15  apartment
communities acquired in 1995, including the Communities acquired  in
the  AFR  Merger,  (iii)  approximately $2,187,000  from  additional
capital  expenditures on Communities owned throughout both  periods,
and  (iv)  approximately $443,000 from  The Woods at Post  House  in
Jackson, Tennessee  which completed development in the Fall of 1995.
Amortization  of deferred financing costs and unamortized  costs  in
excess  of  fair  value  of  net  assets  acquired  for  1996   were
approximately $661,000 and approximately $192,000, respectively.

Interest expense increased approximately $3,082,000 during 1996  due
primarily to apartment acquisitions. The Company reduced the average
borrowing cost to 7.92% at December 31, 1996 as compared to 8.15% on
December  31, 1995. The average maturity on the Company's  debt  was
9.9 years at both December 31, 1996 and 1995.

In 1996, the Company recorded an approximate $2,185,000 gain for the
disposition  of three apartment communities.  The dispositions  were
structured as tax-deferred exchanges for federal tax purposes.  As a
result  of  the foregoing, income before minority interest  for  the
year ended December 31, 1996 increased approximately $5,166,000 over
the same period a year earlier.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net   cash    provided  by  operating  activities   increased   from
approximately $38,018,000 for the year ended December  31,  1996  to
approximately $44,797,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997.  The
increase  in  net  cash flow was primarily due  to  an  increase  in
depreciation  and amortization less an extraordinary  loss  recorded
due to the early extinguishment of certain debt.

Net  cash  used in investing activities increased from approximately
$70,436,000  for  the year ended December 31, 1996 to  approximately
$138,263,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997. The increase  was
primarily  due to the acquisition of 3,314 apartment units  in  1997
for  approximately  $76,287,000 as compared to  the  acquisition  of
1,760  apartment  units in 1996 for approximately $66,258,000.  This
increase in net cash flow used in investing activities was partially
offset  by  the  sale  of three apartment communities  in  1996  for
approximately   $17,096,000.  Capital   improvements   to   existing
properties  totaled  approximately $20,205,000 for  the  year  ended
December  31,  1997, compared to approximately $18,437,000  for  the
same  period  in  1996.  Of  the  $20,205,000  capital  improvements
approximately  $7,743,000  was for recurring  capital  expenditures,
including  carpet and appliances, approximately $6,112,000  was  for
revenue   enhancing  projects,  approximately  $5,557,000  was   for
acquisition   capital   with  the  remaining   balance   for   other
miscellaneous  expenditures, including corporate. Recurring  capital
expenditures  averaged  $0.47 per share  in  1997.  Construction  in
progress  for  new  apartment  units  increased  from  approximately
$2,837,000  for  the year ended December 31, 1996  to  approximately
$16,093,000 for the comparable period in 1997, due primarily to  the
completion  of the 234-unit development at Lincoln on the  Green  in
Memphis,  Tennessee  which  began leasing  during   1997  and  other
developments including $1,685,000 for the 254-unit Reserve at Dexter
Lake,  $1,273,000 for the 288-unit Mandarin, $879,000 for  the  154-
unit phase II addition for Whisperwood Spa and $789,000 for the 316-
unit Terraces at Fieldstone.

Net  cash  provided  by  financing activities  increased  from
approximately $33,425,000 during the year ended December 31, 1996 to
approximately  $104,218,000 for the year ended  December  31,  1997.
During  1997, approximately $202,320,000 was provided by  borrowings
under   the   Credit  Line  and  notes  payable  and   approximately
$46,635,000 was provided from the issuance of preferred shares.  The
principal  uses  of the cash included approximately $30,021,000  for
the  repayment  of notes payable and approximately  $39,771,000  for
dividends and distributions.

At  December  31,  1997,  the Company had approximately  $45,225,000
outstanding  on the Credit Line. At December 31, 1997,  the  Company
had  approximately  $63,200,000  (including  the  Credit  Line)   of
floating  rate debt at an average interest rate of 6.5%;  all  other
debt was fixed rate term debt at an average interest rate of 7.8%.

The weighted average interest rate and weighted average maturity  at
December  31,  1997  for  the approximately  $632,213,000  of  notes
payable were 7.4% and 10.2 years, respectively. The Company used the
approximately  $46,635,000 of net proceeds from the Preferred  Stock
Offering, which closed in November, for the acquisitions of the 192-
unit Sterling Ridge apartment community in Augusta, Georgia and  the
184-unit  Colony at South Park apartment community in  Aiken,  South
Carolina  and  used the balance to reduce the amount outstanding  on
the  Credit Line. In November 1997, the Company increased its credit
limit under the Credit Line from $90,000,000 to $110,000,000 and  in
March  1998 increased the credit limit to $200,000,000.  The Company
expects to use the Credit Line for future acquisitions, development,
and  to  provide letters of credit as credit enhancements  for  tax-
exempt bonds.  In March 1997 the Company issued 2,300,000 shares  of
Common  Stock in an underwritten public offering.  The net  proceeds
from  such offering were approximately $62.5 million, all  of  which
were  contributed to the Operating Partnership and utilized to repay
outstanding borrowings under the Credit Line.   The Credit  Line  is
secured   and  is  subject  to  borrowing  base  calculations   that
effectively reduce the maximum amount that may be borrowed under the
Credit  Line  to approximately $44,300,000 as of the  date  of  this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The  Company  believes that cash provided by operations is  adequate
and  anticipates that it will continue to be adequate  in  both  the
short  and  long-term  to  meet  operating  requirements  (including
recurring  capital expenditures at the Communities) and  payment  of
distributions  by  the Company in accordance with REIT  requirements
under the Code.

During  1997,  capital  expenditures were approximately  $20,205,000
for   property  improvements  and  $16,093,000   for   the
development  of  new  units. For 1998,  the  Company  plans
approximately  $27,000,000 for property  improvements  and
$120,000,000  for development of new units. The Company  expects  to
meet  its  long  term  liquidity  requirements,  such  as  scheduled
mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, expansions and non-
recurring   capital  expenditures,  through  long  and   medium-term
collateralized and uncollateralized fixed rate borrowings,  issuance
of  debt  or  additional equity securities in the  Company  and  the
Credit Line.

INSURANCE

In  the opinion of management, property and casualty insurance is in
place   which  provides  adequate  coverage  to  provide   financial
protection against normal insurable risks such that it believes that
any  loss  experienced would not have a significant  impact  on  the
Company's liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

INFLATION

Substantially  all of the resident leases at the Communities  allow,
at  the  time  of  renewal,  for adjustments  in  the  rent  payable
thereunder, and thus may enable the Company to seek rent  increases.
The  substantial majority of these leases are for one year or  less.
The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the
risk to the Company of the adverse effects of inflation.

YEAR 2000

The  Company  is aware of the issues associated with the programming
code  in  existing  computer systems as the millennium  (Year  2000)
approaches.   The  "Year  2000" issue is pervasive  and  complex  as
virtually every computer operation will be affected in some  way  by
the  rollover  of  the two digit year value to  00.   The  issue  is
whether  computer  systems  will properly recognize  date  sensitive
information  when  the year changes to 2000.  Systems  that  do  not
properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or
cause a system to fail.

The  Company  is utilizing both internal and external  resources  to
identify,  correct or reprogram, and test the systems for  the  Year
2000  compliance.  During 1997, the Company developed a plan to deal
with  the Year 2000 issue.  Management has conducted a comprehensive
review  of  the Company's computer systems to identify  the  systems
that  could be affected by the Year 2000 issue and has developed  an
implementation  plan to resolve potential issues.  The  Company  has
reviewed  our core mainframe systems and application subsystems  and
have  obtained  the Year 2000 compliant releases and are  developing
the  installation  and testing plan for each of these  applications.
The  Company has corresponded with our third party service providers
and  other  providers of software and hardware for certification  of
their compliance with Year 2000 issues.  It is anticipated that  all
reprogramming  efforts  will  be completed  by  December  31,  1998,
allowing  adequate time for testing.  Management  has  assessed  the
Year  2000 compliance expense and believe that the related potential
effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of
operations should be immaterial. The Company is expensing all  costs
associated with the Year 2000 as the costs are incurred.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results  of  Operations contains certain forward-looking  statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,  as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  as
amended,  which  are  intended to be covered  by  the  safe  harbors
created  thereby. These statements include the plans and  objectives
of  management for future operations, including plans and objectives
relating  to  capital expenditures and rehabilitation costs  on  the
apartment  communities.  Although  the  Company  believes  that  the
assumptions   underlying   the   forward-looking   statements    are
reasonable,  any  of  the  assumptions  could  be  inaccurate   and,
therefore,  there  can  be  no assurance  that  the  forward-looking
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will prove to
be  accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent  in
the  forward-looking statements included herein,  the  inclusion  of
such  information should not be regarded as a representation by  the
Company  or  any other person that the objectives and plans  of  the
Company will be achieved.

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

On  July  23,  1997, the Company acquired its corporate headquarters  for
$2,912,000.    In connection with the acquisition, the Company  formed  a
special  committee of its external directors to negotiate the transaction
on its behalf because certain executive officers of the Company were also
partners  in the partnership which owned the building.  The consideration
consisted  of  approximately $862,000 cash, 22,246 Operating  Partnership
Units  valued  at  $634,000 ($28.50 per unit) and the  assumption  of  an
existing  loan.  Certain executive officers of the Company were  partners
in  the  partnership who owned the building and received 5,831  units  of
common shares connected with the exchange.

All transactions involving related parties must be approved by a majority
of  the  disinterested members of the Company's Board of  Directors.  The
Company has, and expects to have, transactions in the ordinary course  of
its  business  with  directors and officers  of  the  Company  and  their
affiliates,   including  members  of  their  families  or   corporations,
partnerships  or other organizations in which such officers or  directors
have  a  controlling interest, on substantially the same terms (including
price, or interest rates and collateral) as those prevailing at the  time
for comparable transactions with unrelated parties.

                      Independent Auditors' Report


The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.


     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mid-
America Apartment Communities, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as
of December 31, 1997 and 1996 and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 1997.   These financial
statements are the responsibility of the management of the Company.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financials statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects the financial position of the Company at

Mid-America  Apartment  Communities, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Years ended December 31,  1997,  1996  and  1995


1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization and Formation of the Company

Mid-America  Apartment  Communities, Inc.  (the  "Company")  is  a  self-
administrated and self-managed real estate investment trust  which  owns,
develops, acquires and operates multifamily apartment communities in  the
southeastern United States and Texas.  The Company owns and operates  115
apartment  communities principally through its majority owned subsidiary,
Mid-America  Apartments,  L.P.  (the  "Operating  Partnership")  and  its
subsidiary,  Mid-America  Capital Partners, L.P.  ("MACP").   MACP  is  a
recently  formed  special  purpose  entity  established  to  issue  first
mortgage   bonds.    In  addition  to  owning  and  operating   apartment
communities,  the  Company conducts third party property  management  and
construction  and development activities through its service corporation,
Flournoy Development Corporation.


Basis of Presentation

The  accompanying  financial statements include  the  accounts   of   the
Company,  the  Operating   Partnership,  and  other  subsidiaries.    All
significant  intercompany accounts and transactions have been  eliminated
in consolidation.

Minority Interest

Minority  interest in the accompanying consolidated financial  statements
relates  to  the ownership interest in the Operating Partnership  by  the
holders  of  Class  A  Common  Units of the Operating  Partnership.   The
Company  is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership.    Net
income  is  allocated to the Minority Interests based on their respective
ownership  percentage of the Operating Partnership  as  described  below.
Issuance  of  additional  Common Shares or  Operating  Partnership  Units
changes  the  ownership of both the Minority Interests and  the  Company.
Such  transactions  and  the proceeds therefrom are  treated  as  capital
transactions and result in an allocation between shareholders' equity and
Minority Interests to account for the change in the respective percentage
ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

The  Company's Board established economic rights in respect of each  unit
of  limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership  that  were
equivalent  to  the economic rights in respect of each  share  of  common
stock.   Each unit is redeemable at the option of the holder  thereof  in
exchange  for one share of common stock.  The Operating  Partnership  has
followed  the policy of paying the same per unit distribution in  respect
of  the  units  as the per share distribution in respect  of  the  common
stock.   Prior to 1997, the Operating Partnership agreement provided  for
the  allocation of additional net income to the holders of Class A  units
that  would otherwise be the net income of the Company or another entity.
Effective January 1, 1997 the Operating Partnership agreement was amended
to  eliminate  the  additional allocation of income to  the  unitholders.
Operating  Partnership  net income for 1997 was  allocated  approximately
17.9% to holders of Class A Common Units and 82.1% to the Company.

Use of Estimates

Management  of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating  to the reporting of assets and  liabilities and the  disclosure
of   contingent  assets  and  liabilities  to  prepare  these   financial
statements  in conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

The  Company  leases residential apartments under operating  leases  with
terms  of one year or less.  Rental and other revenues are recorded  when
earned.

In  addition  to  leasing  the owned Communities,  the  Company  provides
property management services for affiliated Section 42 Housing Tax Credit
multifamily   properties  ("Section  42")  and  conventional  properties.
Property  management  revenue  is  recorded  on  the  accrual  method  of
accounting as earned.

The  Company  receives development and construction fees related  to  the
development  of  the affiliated Section 42 properties.   Development  and
construction income is recognized as earned as the property is  developed
and  certain  operating  and financing performance  conditions  are  met.
Development  income  is  not recognized to the extent  that  requirements
exist  to  invest  a portion of such development fees in the  partnership
entities from which the fees are earned.

Construction  contract revenues, which are presented net of  construction
contract  costs  in  the  accompanying  statements  of  operations,   are
recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.  Under this method,
the percentage of contract revenue to be recognized currently is computed
based upon that percentage of estimated total revenue that incurred costs
to  date  bear to total estimated costs, after giving effect to the  most
recent  estimates  of costs to complete.  Revisions in cost  and  revenue
estimates  are reflected in the period in which the facts, which  require
the  revision, become known.  When revised cost estimates indicate a loss
on  an  individual  contract, the total estimated loss  is  provided  for
currently in its entirety without regard to the percentage of completion.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The  Company  considers cash, investments in money  market  accounts  and
certificates of deposit  with original maturities of three months or less
to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for  property
taxes, insurance, debt service and replacement reserves.

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation

Real  estate assets are carried at the lower of depreciated cost  or  net
realizable  value. Interest, property taxes, and other development  costs
incurred during construction is capitalized until completion. Interest of
$388,000  and  $91,000  was capitalized in 1997 and  1996,  respectively.
Repairs  and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant
improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized.  The cost of
interior painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds are expensed as incurred.

In  conjunction with acquisitions of properties, the Company's policy  is
to  provide  in  its acquisition budgets adequate funds to  complete  any
deferred  maintenance  items  to bring the  properties  to  the  required
standard, including the cost of replacement appliances, carpet,  interior
painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds.  These costs are capitalized.

Following  a  review of its capital expenditure and depreciation  policy,
effective January 1, 1996, the Company implemented a new policy of  which
the  primary  changes  were  (i) to increase minimum  dollar  amounts  to
capitalize   from  $500  to  $1,000;   (ii)  for  stabilized   properties
(generally, properties owned and operated by the Company for at least one
year),  to  capitalize  replacement purchases for  major  appliances  and
carpeting of an entire apartment unit which was previously expensed;  and
(iii) to reduce the depreciation life of certain assets from 20 years  to
10 to 15 years.

The  Company  believes  that  the  newly  adopted  accounting  policy  is
preferable because it is consistent with policies currently being used by
the  majority  of  the  largest apartment REITs  and  provides  a  better
matching  of  expenses with the estimated benefit period. The   Company's
1995  financial statements were not restated for the effect of the change
in  accounting  policy.   The  policy has been implemented  prospectively
effective January 1, 1996.  The effect of the change in depreciable lives
was not material to consolidated net income of the Company.

Depreciation  is  computed on a straight line basis  over  the  estimated
useful  lives  of the related assets which range from 8 to 40  years  for
land  improvements and buildings and 5 years for furniture, fixtures  and
equipment.  Depreciation expense includes $195,000, $155,000 and $104,000
in  1997,  1996  and  1995  which relates to  computer  software,  office
furniture  and  fixtures and other assets found in other  industries  and
which is required to be recognized, for purposes of funds from operations
computations, as expenses in the calculation of net income.

The  Company periodically evaluates its real estate assets for impairment
based upon undiscounted cash flows and measures impairment based on  fair
value.  This  determination  is  dependent  primarily  on  the  Company's
estimates  on  occupancy,  rent  and expense  increases,  which  involves
numerous  assumptions and judgments as to future events over a period  of
many  years.  At December 31, 1997 the Company does not hold  any  assets
which meet the impairment criteria.

Real Estate Held for Development or Sale

Real  estate  held for development or sale, which consists  primarily  of
sites  intended  for future multifamily developments, is  stated  at  the
lower  of  aggregate cost or fair value.  The cost includes the  purchase
price of the land, construction, and development costs and fees, as  well
as capitalized interest and loan fees.

Deferred Costs and Intangibles

Organization costs are amortized using the straight line method  over  60
months.   Deferred financing costs are amortized over the  terms  of  the
related  debt  using  a  method which approximates the  interest  method.
Unamortized  cost  in  excess of fair value of net  assets  acquired   is
amortized using the straight line method over a range of 8 to 30 years.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 1997, SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," was issued,
effective  for  years beginning after December 15, 1997.  This  statement
establishes  standards for reporting and display of comprehensive  income
and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements.
This  new accounting statement is not expected to have a material  impact
on  the  Company's consolidated financial statements.  The  Company  will
adopt this accounting standard in 1998.

Also  in  June  1997,  SFAS No. 131, "Disclosure  about  Segments  of  an
Enterprise  and  Related Information," was issued,  effective  for  years
beginning after December 15, 1997.  This statement requires companies  to
identify  segments consistent with the manner in which  management  makes
decisions  about  allocating resources to segments  and  measuring  their
performance.  Disclosures for the newly identified segments  are  similar
to  those required under current standards, with the addition of  certain
quarterly  disclosure  requirements.  It also establishes  standards  for
related  disclosures  about products and services, geographic  areas  and
major  customers.   The  Company will adopt this accounting  standard  in
1998.

Reclassification

Certain  prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform  with  1997
presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on shareholders' equity
or net income available for common shareholders.

2.   Business Combinations

On  November  25,  1997, the Company completed the merger  with  Flournoy
Development  Company  and  related entities ("FDC")  (the  "FDC  Merger")
accounted   for   using  the  purchase  method  of   accounting.    Total
consideration  consisted of $88,271,000, including  1,550,311  shares  of
common  stock  and  412,110 Operating Partnership  units  in  Mid-America
Apartments,  L.P., valued at $56,213,000 ($28.6875 per share  and  unit),
$29,608,000  cash and transaction costs of approximately $2,450,000.  The
Company   may  also  issue  additional  shares  of  Common  Stock    (the
"Contingent Value Shares") having a value of up to $7,500,000 if  certain
agreed upon conditions are satisfied during calendar years 1998, 1999 and
2000.   When and if issued, the Contingent Value Shares will be  recorded
as  additional purchase consideration based upon the fair  value  of  the
Common  Stock at the date of issuance.  The operating results of FDC  are
included  in the accompanying statement of operations commencing November
25, 1997.

The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the merger
were recorded at their respective fair values as follows:

     Fair value of assets acquired, 
           primarily real estate assets        $  411,397,000

3. Borrowings

During  1997, the Company entered into a new $110 million line of  credit
agreement (the "Credit Line") which expires in November 1999.  The Credit
Line  is  secured by certain of the properties, bears interest  at  LIBOR
plus  1.25%  (7.07%  at December 31, 1997), and has  various  restrictive
financial covenants.  At December 31, 1997, $45.2 million was outstanding
under  the  Credit  Line.   At  December  31,  1996,  $30.4  million  was
outstanding under a $90 million line of credit, which was replaced by the
Credit Line.

At  December  31,  1997 MACP had indebtedness of $140 million  to  Morgan
Stanley  Mortgage Capital Inc. pursuant to a short-term  promissory  note
(the  MSMC  Loan).  The 26 Communities, with a net book value  of  $213.6
million  at  December 31, 1997, owned by MACP are pledged to  secure  the
MSMC  Loan.   The MSMC Loan has a variable interest rate  of  LIBOR  plus
1.00%  (6.72% at December 31, 1997).  The MSMC Loan was repaid subsequent
to December 31, 1997.  See note 11.

The  Company  has  approximately $447.0 million  and  $284.8  million  at
December  31, 1997 and 1996 under various mortgage notes payable.   These
notes  are  secured  by  real estate assets and certain  restricted  cash
accounts.

As  of December 31, 1997, the Company estimated that the weighted average
interest rate on the Company's debt was 7.41% with an average maturity of
10.2  years.  These  estimates  consider the  effect  of  the  MSMC  Loan
repayment discussed in note 11.

During  1997,  the  Company extinguished a bond  note,  resulting  in  an
extraordinary loss of $771,000.  At consummation of the merger with  FDC,
the  Company repaid certain debt primarily attributable to FDC, resulting
in an extraordinary loss of $7,851,000, net of minority interest.

The following tables summarize the Company's indebtedness at December 31,
1997.   The  tables  are prepared as if the issuance  of  the  commercial
mortgage  pass-through certificates and repayment of the MSMC Loan  which
occurred in 1998 (see note 11) had occurred at December 31, 1997:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------


The   Company's  indebtedness  includes  various  restrictive   financial
covenants.   The  Company believes that it was in compliance  with  these
covenants as of December 31, 1997.


4.  Fair Value Disclosure of Financial Instruments

Cash  and  cash  equivalents,  rental receivable,  accounts  payable  and
accrued  expenses and other liabilities and security deposits are carried
at amounts which reasonably approximate their fair value.

Fixed  rate   notes  payable at December 31, 1997 and 1996  total  $569.0
million and $268.0 million, respectively, and reasonably approximates the
estimated fair value (excluding prepayment penalties) based upon interest
rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities as of December 31, 1997 and 1996.  These notes were subject to
prepayment  penalties, in the event of repayment prior to maturity.   The
carrying  value of variable rate notes payable at December 31,  1997  and
1996  total $63.2 million and $47.2 million, respectively, and reasonably
approximates their fair value.  Included in these variable rate notes are
certain Multifamily Housing Renewal bonds with rates which are less  than
the  prime  lending  rates at December 31, 1997 and 1996.   Approximately
$16.6  million  in 1997 and $16.8 million in 1996 of these mortgages  are
non-taxable and have lower rates than would be expected for taxable notes
with similar terms.

The  fair  value  estimates  presented herein are  based  on  information
available  to  management  as of December 31, 1997  and  1996.   Although
management  is  not aware of any factors that would significantly  affect
the   estimated   fair  value  amounts,  such  amounts  have   not   been
comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since
that  date,  and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly
from the amounts presented herein.

5.  Commitments and Contingencies

The  Company is not presently subject to any material litigation nor,  to
the  Company's  knowledge, is any material litigation threatened  against
the Company, other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course
of  business,  some  of  which is expected to  be  covered  by  liability
insurance and none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect
on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

The Company incurred lease expense relating to a five year aircraft lease
agreement  for  the  years ended December 31, 1997,  1996,  and  1995  of
$187,000, $185,400, and $185,400, respectively.

6.  Income Taxes

No  provision  for federal income taxes has been made in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.  The Company has made an  election  to
be  taxed  as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT") under Sections  856
through 860 of the Code.  As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject
to  Federal  income  tax to the extent it distributes  95%  of  its  REIT
taxable income to its shareholders and meets certain other tests relating
to  the number of shareholders, types of assets and allocable income.  If
the  Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the  Company
will  be  subject  to  the Federal income tax (including  any  applicable
alternative  minimum  tax)  on its taxable income  at  regular  corporate
rates.   Even though  the Company qualifies for taxation as a  REIT,  the
Company may be subject to certain Federal, state and local taxes  on  its
income  and  property  and  to  Federal income  and  excise  tax  on  its
undistributed income.

Earnings  and  profits, which determine the taxability  of  dividends  to
shareholders,  differ  from net income reported for  financial  reporting
purposes primarily because of differences in depreciable lives, bases  of
certain  assets  and  liabilities and in the  timing  of  recognition  of
earnings  upon  disposition  of  properties.   For  federal  income   tax
purposes,  the  following summarizes the taxability of cash distributions
paid  on  the common shares in 1996 and 1995 and the estimated taxability
for 1997:

                                  1997       1996       1995

net proceeds of $47.8 million.

Series B Preferred Stock

Series  B Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Series B Preferred Stock")  has  a

annual  distribution of $2.21875 per share, payable monthly.  In November
1997  the  Company  issued  1,938,830 Series B shares  and  received  net
proceeds of  $46.7 million.

Common Stock Offerings

In  March  1997 the Company issued 2,300,000 shares of Common  Stock  and
received  net  proceeds of $62.5 million.  In October  1997  the  Company
issued  3,499,000  shares of Common Stock and received  net  proceeds  of
$98.2 million.  The Company contributed the net proceeds of the offerings
to  the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional Common Units  in
the Operating Partnership.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

In  January 1997, the Company adopted a Dividend Reinvestment  and  Stock
Purchase  Plan (the "DRSPP") pursuant to which the Company's shareholders
will  be  permitted  to  acquire  shares  of  Common  Stock  through  the
reinvestment of distributions on Common Stock, Series A Preferred  Stock,
Series  B  Preferred  Stock   and through  optional  cash  payments  from
shareholders. The Company has registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission  the  offer and sale of up to 750,000 shares of  Common  Stock
pursuant  to the DRSPP. During 1997,  24,785 shares of Common Stock  were
acquired by shareholders pursuant to the DRSPP.

Earnings Per Share and Dividend Data

The  Company  adopted SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share",  effective  for
financial  statements for periods ending after December  15,  1997.   All
prior period EPS data has been restated to conform with the provisions of
this statement.

The  computation  of basic earnings per share is based  on  the  weighted
average  number of common shares outstanding.  The computation of diluted
earnings  per  share is based on the weighted average  number  of  common
shares outstanding plus the shares resulting from the assumed exercise of
all  outstanding options using the treasury stock method.  The  following
table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the
basic  and  diluted earnings per share computations for the  years  ended
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995.

8.  Employee Benefit Plans

401 (k) Savings Plan

The  Mid-America  Apartment Communities, Inc. 401(k) Savings  Plan  is  a
defined  contribution  plan that satisfies the  requirements  of  Section
401(a) and 401(k) of the Code.  The Company may, but is not obligated to,
make a matching contribution of $.50 for each $1.00 contributed, up to 6%
of  the  participant's compensation. The Company's contribution  to  this
plan  was  $154,300,  $118,700  and  $81,600  in  1997,  1996  and  1995,
respectively.

Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan

The  Company has adopted a non-qualified deferred compensation  plan  for
key  employees  who are not qualified for participation in the  Company's
401  (k) Savings Plan.  Under the terms of the plan, employees may  elect
to  defer  a percentage of their compensation and the Company  matches  a
portion  of  their  salary deferral.  The plan is designed  so  that  the
employees' investment earnings under the non-qualified plan should be the
same  as  the earning assets in the Company's 401 (k) Savings Plan.   The
Company's match to this plan in 1997, 1996 and 1995 was $18,600,  $23,600
and $8,600, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The  Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the  "ESPP") provides a means for employees to purchase common stock  of
the Company.  The board has authorized the issuance of 150,000 shares for
the plan.  The ESPP is administered by the Compensation Committee who may
annually  grant  options  to  employees to purchase  annually  up  to  an
aggregate of 15,000 shares of common stock at a price equal to 85% of the
market  price of the common stock.  During 1997, 1996 and 1995, the  ESPP
purchased 2,758, 3,176 and 2,710 shares, respectively.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(the  "ESOP") which is a non-contributory stock bonus plan that satisfies
the  requirements of Section 401 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code.   Each
employee  of  the Company is eligible to participate in  the  ESOP  after
attaining the age of 21 years and completing one year of service with the
Company.   Participants'  ESOP accounts will be 100%  vested  after  five
years  of  continuous service, with no vesting prior to that  time.   The
Company  contributed  22,500 shares of Common  Stock  to  the  ESOP  upon
conclusion  of  the  IPO.   During  1997,  1996  and  1995,  the  Company
contributed  $344,000, $276,000 and $186,000, respectively, to  the  ESOP
which   purchased   an  additional  11,921,  8,208  and   5,148   shares,
respectively.

Stock Option Plan

The  Company has adopted the 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option  Plan
(the  "Plan")  to  provide incentives to attract and  retain  independent
directors,  executive officers and key employees.  The Plan provides  for
the  grant of options to purchase a specified number of shares of  common
stock  ("Options")  or  grants  of  restricted  shares  of  common  stock
("Restricted Stock").  The Plan also allows the Company to grant  options
to  purchase Operating Partnership units at the price of the Common Stock
on  the New York Stock Exchange on the day prior to issuance of the units
(the  "LESOP Provision").  The Plan authorizes Options to buy a total  of
500,000  shares of common stock. The Compensation Committee of the  Board
of Directors is responsible for granting Options and shares of Restricted
Stock  and  for establishing the exercise price of Options and terms  and
conditions  of Restricted Stock.  During the first quarter of  1997,  the
Company  amended the Plan to increase the shares authorized  an  increase
from 500,000 to 1,000,000 and to remove the restriction on the number  of
options that may be issued, subject to overall plan limits.

In  1997  the  Company  granted options to certain executives  and  other
officers  to purchase 96,000 shares of Common Stock and 110,000 Operating
Partnership  units pursuant to the LESOP Provision.  In 1997  options  to
purchase  75,000 shares of common stock and 110,000 Operating Partnership
units were exercised and the Company advanced a portion  of
the  purchase  price  of  these shares and  units.   The  employee  
advances mature five years from date of issuance and accrue  interest,
payable in arrears, at a rate of 7.0% per annum.  At December 31,  1997,
the  outstanding principal balance on the employee advances  was
approximately  $700,000  and is recorded in the  Company's  statement  of
shareholders' equity.  The Company entered into supplemental bonus agreements
with   the  employees which are intended to fund the payment of the advances
over a five year period.   Under  the  terms  of  the  supplemental   bonus
agreements, the Company will pay cash bonuses to these employees equal to
20%  of  the original note balance on each anniversary date of the notes.
The  bonuses  are limited to 15% of the aggregate purchase price  of  the
common shares and units.

Operating Partnership Units for the three years ended December  31,  1997

    December 31, 1997                  140,500             21.71     


Exercise  prices for options outstanding as of December 31,  1997  ranged
from  $19.75 to $29.50.  The weighted average remaining contractual  life
of those options is 8 years.

On  January  1,  1996, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123, "Accounting  for
Stock-Based Compensation",  which requires either the (i) fair  value  of
employee  stock-based compensation plans be recorded as  a  component  of
compensation  expense in the statement of operations as of  the  date  of
grant  of awards related to such plans, or (ii) impact of such fair value
on net income and earnings per share be disclosed on a pro forma basis in
a  footnote to financial statements for awards granted after December 15,
1994,  if  the  accounting for such awards continues to be in  accordance
with  Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting  for  Stock
Issued  to  Employees,"  ("APB  25").  The  Company  will  continue  such
accounting under the provisions of APB 25.  The pro forma effects in 1997
and 1996 to net income per common share were not considered material.


9.  Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk

The  Partnership  has only limited involvement with derivative  financial
instruments  and does not use them for trading purposes.  The Partnership
occasionally  utilizes  derivative financial  instruments  as  hedges  in
anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined  interest
rate risk.

In  anticipation of the March 6, 1998 financing transaction discussed  in
Note  11  "Subsequent Events (Unaudited)", the Partnership  entered  into
four  separate  interest  rate contracts in 1997  with  notional  amounts
aggregating  $140  million.  As of December 31, 1997 the  fair  value  of
these  interest  rate  contracts,  based  on  broker  estimates,  was  an
unrealized loss of approximately $1.1 million ($1.4 million realized loss
as  of March 6, 1998). Unrealized changes in the market value of interest
rate  contracts are deferred until the hedged transaction  is  consumated
and  realized gains and losses resulting from changes in the market value
of  these contacts are deferred and amortized into interest expense  over
the life of the related debt issuance.

10. Related Party Transaction

During 1997 the Company acquired its corporate headquarters building  for
$2,912,000  from a partnership whose partners included certain  executive
officers  of  the Company.  The consideration paid consisted of  $862,000
cash,  22,246 Operating Partnership Units valued at $634,000 ($28.50  per
unit)  and the assumption of an existing loan.  Prior to acquisition  the
Company leased the building from the partnership.

11.  Subsequent Events  (Unaudited)

Declaration of Dividend

The  Company declared a fourth quarter common stock dividend of $.55  per
share  to  be  paid January 30, 1998 to holders of record on January  23,
1998.

Completed Acquisitions

Since December 31, 1997, the Company has acquired the following apartment
communities (the "Completed Acquisitions") containing an aggregate of 392
apartment units (dollars in millions):

                                    NUMBER OF  ACQUISITION   CONTRACT

The  financial statements of the completed acquisitions are not  included
in the audited consolidated financial statements included herein.

Financing Transactions

On  March  6,  1998,  MACP completed the sale of  $142,000,000  of  first
mortgage bonds (the "MACP Bonds") secured by liens on 26 properties owned
by  MACP.   The  MACP Bonds were issued to Mid-America Finance,  Inc.,  a
wholly  owned  qualified REIT subsidiary of the Company, which  deposited
MACP  Bonds  into  a  grantor  trust (the  "Trust").   The  Trust  issued
commercial  mortgage  pass-through certificates  representing  beneficial
ownership  of  the  MACP Bonds.  The five year fixed rate  non-amortizing
certificates  bear interest at 6.376%.  The net proceeds to  the  Company
were  approximately  $139.2 million after payment  of  initial  discount,
underwriters' fees, costs of rate lock and other expenses.   The  Company
used  the  net proceeds of  the MACP Bonds to repay the MSMC  Loan.  

On  March  13,  1998,  the  Company issued mortgages  of  $36.2  million,
refinancing  $29.04 million of existing loans.  These new  mortgages  are
fixed at 7.00% and will amortize over 25 years and will balloon in 2005.

On  March  16, 1998, the Company increased its line of credit  from  $110
million to $200 million with terms substantially the same as before.

                AMENDED AND RESTATED CHARTER

                             OF

           MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC.



      The undersigned corporation hereby amends and restates
its Charter under the Tennessee Business Corporation Act.

      A.    The  name  of  the  corporation  is  Mid-America
Apartment Communities, Inc. (the "Corporation").

      B.    The  Charter of the Corporation is  amended  and
restated as follows:

          Name.   The  name  of the corporation  (which  is
hereinafter   called  the  "Corporation")   is   Mid-America
Apartment Communities, Inc.

          For Profit.  The Corporation is for profit.
           Principal and Registered Office.  The address  of
the   Corporation's  initial  registered  office   and   its
principal office is 6584 Poplar Avenue, Suite 340,  Memphis,
Tennessee 38138.

            Initial  Registered  Agent.   The  name  of  the
Corporation's  initial registered agent at  that  office  is
George E. Cates.

            Incorporator.   The  name  and  address  of  the
incorporator is John A. Good, 6075 Poplar Avenue, Suite 623,
Memphis, Tennessee 38119.

           Authorized  Capital Stock.  The total  number  of
shares of stock which the Corporation has authority to issue
is  twenty million (20,000,000) shares of Common Stock, $.01
par value per share, and five million (5,000,000) shares  of
Preferred Stock, $.01 par value per share.

           The  Preferred Stock may be issued from  time  to
time  by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, in  such
series  and  with  such  preferences,  conversion  or  other
rights,  voting  powers,  restrictions,  limitations  as  to
dividends,  qualifications or other  provisions  as  may  be
fixed by the Board of Directors.

          Directors. The  Corporation  shall  have  a  Board  of
Directors  consisting of not less than three  (3)  nor  more
than  nine (9) members unless otherwise determined from time
to  time by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of at
least  eighty percent (80%) of the members of the  Board  of
Directors.  However, the number of directors shall never  be
less  than  the  minimum number required  by  the  Tennessee
Business  Corporation  Act.   A  director  need  not  be   a
shareholder.   Directors  shall be divided  into  three  (3)
classes  as nearly equal in number as possible.  The initial
term  of  Class  I  directors shall  expire  at  the  annual
shareholder meeting in 1994.  The initial term of  Class  II
directors shall expire at the annual shareholder meeting  in
1995  and  the initial term of the Class III director  shall
expire  at the annual shareholder meeting in 1996.  At  each
annual shareholder meeting, the shareholders shall elect one
or more directors to serve a three-year term of the class of
directors whose term is expiring at such annual meeting  and
until their successors are elected and qualify.

                 Independent   Directors.    Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, at all times (except during
a  period not to exceed sixty (60) days following the death,
resignation, incapacity or removal from office of a director
prior  to  expiration of the director's term of  office),  a
majority  of  the Board of Directors shall be  comprised  of
persons   who   are  not  officers  or  employees   of   the
Corporation,    "Affiliates"   of   the   Corporation,    or
"Affiliates" of  any subsidiary of the Corporation, or   any
partnership which is an Affiliate of the Corporation.

               Definition of Affiliate.  For purposes of the
foregoing  subsection, "Affiliate" of a  person  shall  mean
  any  person that, directly or indirectly, controls  or  is
controlled  by or is under common control with such  person,
  any  other  person  that owns, beneficially,  directly  or
indirectly,  five  percent (5%) or more of  the  outstanding
capital stock, shares or equity interests of such person, or
 any officer, director, employee, partner or trustee of such
person  or  any person controlling, controlled by  or  under
common  control  with  such person (excluding  trustees  and
persons  serving in similar capacities who are not otherwise
an  Affiliate of such person).  The term "person" means  and
includes  individuals,  corporations,  general  and  limited
partnerships,   stock   companies  or  associations,   joint
ventures,  associations,  companies,  trusts,  banks,  trust
companies,  land trusts, business trusts, or other  entities
and  governments  and  agencies and  political  subdivisions
thereof.   For  the  purposes of this definition,  "control"
(including the correlative meanings of the terms "controlled
by"  and  "under common control with"), as used with respect
to  any  person,  shall  mean the  possession,  directly  or
indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of
the  management  and  policies of such person,  through  the
ownership  of  voting securities, partnership  interests  or
other equity interests.

                Amendment  of this Article.  Notwithstanding
any  other  provision of this Charter or the Bylaws  of  the
Corporation (and notwithstanding that some lesser percentage
may  be specified by law, this Charter or the Bylaws of  the
Corporation), the provisions of this Article 7 shall not  be
amended,   altered,   changed  or   repealed   without   the
affirmative  vote of at least eighty percent  (80%)  of  the
members of the Board of Directors or the affirmative vote of
the  holders  of not less than a majority of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to  vote
generally in the election of directors, voting as  a  single
voting group.

           Dividends.   All  shares  of  Common  Stock  will
participate  equally  in dividends  payable  to  holders  of
shares of Common Stock when and as declared by the Board  of
Directors  and  in net assets available for distribution  to
holders  of  shares  of  Common Stock  upon  liquidation  or
dissolution.

          Preemptive Rights.  No holder of shares of capital
stock  of  the  Corporation shall  have  any  preemptive  or
preferential right to subscribe to or purchase   any  shares
of  any  class of the Corporation, whether now or  hereafter
authorized;   any warrants, rights, or options  to  purchase
any   such   shares;  or   any  securities  or   obligations
convertible  into any such shares or into warrants,  rights,
or options to purchase any such shares.

           Limitation of Director Liability.  No director of
the  Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation  or  its
shareholders  for monetary damages for breach  of  fiduciary
duty as a director; provided, that this provision shall  not
eliminate or limit the liability of a director:  (A) for any
breach  of the director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation
or  its shareholders; (B) for acts or omissions not in  good
faith  or which involve intentional misconduct or a  knowing
violation  of  law; or (C) under Section  48-18-304  of  the
Tennessee  Business Corporation Act.  This  provision  shall
not  eliminate or limit the liability of a director for  any
act  or  omission  occurring prior to  the  date  when  this
provision  became effective.  No amendment of this provision
after  the  time of its effectiveness shall  affect  in  any
manner  the  elimination  or  limitation  on  liability   of
directors  for  acts occurring prior to  the  time  of  such
amendment.

           Indemnification.  Any word or  words  defined  in
Part  5  of  Chapter  18 of Title 48 of the  Tennessee  Code
Annotated,   as   amended   from   time   to    time    (the
"Indemnification  Article") used in this Article  11,  shall
have  the  same  meaning as provided in the  Indemnification
Article.

            The  Corporation  shall  indemnify  and  advance
expenses  to a director, officer, employee or agent  of  the
Corporation  in connection with a proceeding to the  fullest
extent   permitted   by   and   in   accordance   with   the
Indemnification Article.

           Insurance.   The  Corporation  may  purchase  and
maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or  was  a
director,  officer, employee or agent of the Corporation  or
who,  while  a director, officer, employee or agent  of  the
Corporation  is  or  was  serving  at  the  request  of  the
Corporation  as  a  director,  officer,  partner,   trustee,
employee   or   agent   of  another  foreign   or   domestic
corporation,  partnership, joint  venture,  trust,  employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, against liability asserted
against  or  incurred  by such person in  that  capacity  or
arising  from  such person's status as a director,  officer,
employee or agent, whether or not the Corporation would have
power  to  indemnify such person against the same  liability
under the Indemnification Article.

           REIT Status.  The Corporation shall seek to elect
and  maintain  status  as  a real  estate  investment  trust
("REIT") under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code
of  1986,  as  amended from time to time (the  "Code").   It
shall  be the duty of the Board of Directors to ensure  that
the Corporation satisfies the requirements for qualification
as a REIT under the Code, including, but not limited to, the
ownership  of  its  outstanding stock,  the  nature  of  its
assets, the sources of its income, and the amount and timing
of  its  distributions to its shareholders.   The  Board  of
Directors shall take no action to disqualify the Corporation
as  a REIT or to otherwise revoke the Corporation's election
to  be taxed as a REIT without the affirmative vote of  two-
thirds  (2/3)  of  the  number of  shares  of  Common  Stock
entitled to vote on such matter at a special meeting of  the
Shareholders.

             Restrictions on Transfer.

              Affidavits of Transferees.  Whenever it
is  deemed  by  the  Board of Directors  to  be  prudent  in
protecting the tax status of the Corporation as a REIT under
the Code and regulations issued under the Code, the Board of
Directors  may  require to be filed with the  Corporation  a
statement  or  affidavit  from each proposed  transferee  of
shares of capital stock of the Corporation setting forth the
number  of  such shares already owned by the transferee  and
any  related  person(s) specified in the form prescribed  by
the  Board of Directors for that purpose.  Any contract  for
the sale or other transfer of shares of capital stock of the
Corporation shall be subject to this provision.

                Affidavits  of Shareholders.  Prior  to  any
transfer  or transaction which would cause a shareholder  to
own, directly or indirectly, shares in excess of the "Limit"
as  defined in paragraph (d) of this Article 14, and in  any
event   upon   demand  of  the  Board  of  Directors,   such
shareholder  shall  file with the Corporation  an  affidavit
setting forth the number of shares of capital stock  of  the
Corporation  (a) owned directly and (b) owned indirectly  by
the  person  filing  the affidavit.  For  purposes  of  this
paragraph  (b),  shares of capital stock not owned  directly
shall  be deemed to be owned indirectly by a person if  that
person  would  be  the beneficial owner of such  shares  for
purposes  of  Rule  13d-3,  or any successor  rule  thereto,
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of  1934  (the
"Exchange  Act")  and/or  would be considered  to  own  such
shares by reason of the attribution rules in Section 544 (as
modified  by  Section 856(h)) of the Code or the regulations
issued thereunder.

           The  affidavit  to be filed with the  Corporation
shall  set forth all information required to be reported  in
returns  filed  by  shareholders under  Treasury  Regulation
Section  1.857-9 issued under the Code or similar provisions
of  any  successor regulation, and in reports  to  be  filed
under  section 13(d), or any successor rule thereto, of  the
Exchange Act.  The affidavit, or an amendment thereto, shall
be  filed  with the Corporation within ten (10)  days  after
demand therefor and at least fifteen (15) days prior to  any
transfer  or transaction which, if consummated, would  cause
the  filing  person  to hold a number of shares  of  capital
stock of the Corporation in excess of the "Limit" as defined
in paragraph (d) of this Article 14.

                Void  Transfers.  Notwithstanding any  other
provision  hereof to the contrary except Section 14(e),  any
acquisition  of  shares of capital stock  that   causes  any
person's  ownership  to  exceed the  Limit  (as  defined  in
Section  14(d)) or  would result in the disqualification  of
the  Corporation as a REIT under the Code shall be  void  ab
initio to the fullest extent permitted under applicable  law
and  the intended transferee of those shares shall be deemed
never  to  have  had an interest therein.  If the  foregoing
provision  is determined to be void or invalid by virtue  of
any  legal decision, statute, rule or regulation, then those
shares  shall be deemed to be Excess Shares (as  defined  in
Section 14(d)) and subject to Section 14(f) below.

               Excess Shares.  Except as provided in Section
14(e),  no  person shall at any time directly or  indirectly
own  in  the  aggregate more than 9.9%  of  the  outstanding
shares  of  capital stock of the Corporation (the  "Limit").
Shares which but for this Section 14(d) would be owned by  a
person  and  would, at any time, be in excess of  the  Limit
shall be deemed "Excess Shares" and shall become subject  to
Section  14(f).   For  the  purpose of  determining  whether
shares  are  Excess Shares, "ownership" of shares  shall  be
deemed  to include shares constructively owned by  a  person
under  the provisions of Section 544 (as modified by Section
856(h))  of  the Code.  All shares of capital stock  of  the
Corporation  which any person has the right to acquire  upon
exercise  of  outstanding rights, options and warrants,  and
upon  conversion  of any securities convertible  into  those
shares, if any, shall be considered outstanding for purposes
of  determining the applicable Limit if such inclusion  will
cause such person to own more than the Limit.

                Exemptions.  The ownership limits set  forth
in   Sections  14(c)  and  14(d)  shall  not  apply  to  the
acquisition of shares of capital stock of the Corporation by
an  underwriter in a public offering of those shares  or  in
any  transaction involving the issuance of shares of capital
stock  by  the  Corporation in which the Board of  Directors
determines  that  the underwriter or other person  or  party
initially  acquiring  those shares  will  timely  distribute
those  shares  to  or among others so that,  following  such
distribution, the ownership of those shares will not  be  in
violation of Section 14(c) or 14(d).  The Board of Directors
in  its  discretion may exempt from the Limit and  from  the
filing  requirements of Section 14(b) ownership or transfers
of  certain  designated  shares  of  capital  stock  of  the
Corporation  while owned by or transferred to a  person  who
has  provided  the  Board  of Directors  with  evidence  and
assurances  acceptable to the Board of  Directors  that  the
qualification  of the Corporation as a REIT under  the  Code
and  the  regulations issued under the  Code  would  not  be
jeopardized thereby.

               Treatment of Excess Shares.

                (i)   If  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the
Corporation  shall at any time determine that a  transaction
has  taken place within the scope of Section 14(c)  or  that
any  person intends to acquire Excess Shares, the  Board  of
Directors  shall  take  such  action  as  it  or  they  deem
advisable  to  refuse to give effect to or to  prevent  such
transaction, including but not limited to refusing  to  give
effect to such transfer on the books of the Corporation.

                (ii) If, notwithstanding Sections 14(c)  and
(f)(i),   a   purported  transferee  ("Record   Transferee")
acquires  Excess  Shares,  the Record  Transferee  shall  be
deemed  to  have  received such Excess Shares  as  agent  on
behalf  of, and to hold such Excess Shares in trust for  the
exclusive  benefit  of, the person(s)  to  whom  the  Excess
Shares   may  be  later  transferred  pursuant  to   Section
14(f)(iii).   The Record Transferee shall have no  right  to
receive  dividends  or  other distributions  on  the  Excess
Shares  and  shall have no right to vote the Excess  Shares.
The  Record Transferee shall have no claim, cause of action,
or  any other recourse whatsoever against the transferor  of
the  Excess Shares.  The Record Transferee's sole right with
respect   to  the  trust  shall  be  to  receive,   at   the
Corporation's  sole and absolute discretion, either  (i)  an
amount  upon the resale of the Excess Shares as directed  by
the  Corporation pursuant to Section 14(f)(iii) or  (ii)  an
amount  upon  the  redemption of the Excess  Shares  by  the
Corporation pursuant to Section 14(f)(iii).

                (iii)      The  Board  of  Directors  shall,
within six months after receiving notice of a transfer  that
causes a Record Transferee to own Excess Shares, either,  in
its  sole  and  absolute discretion, (a) direct  the  Record
Transferee  to sell all of the Excess Shares held  in  trust
pursuant to Section 14(f)(ii) for cash in such manner as the
Board  of Directors directs or (b) redeem such Excess Shares
for  the  price  and  on  the terms  set  forth  in  Section
14(f)(iii)(b) on such date within such six month  period  as
the Board of Directors may determine.

                     (a)   If the Board of Directors directs
the  Record  Transferee to sell the Excess  Shares  held  in
trust,  the Record Transferee shall pay the Corporation  out
of  the  proceeds of such sale all expenses incurred by  the
Corporation in connection with such sale plus any  remaining
amount of such proceeds that exceeds the amount paid by  the
Record  Transferee  for the Excess Shares,  and  the  Record
Transferee shall be entitled to retain only any proceeds  in
excess   of  such  amount  required  to  be  paid   to   the
Corporation.

                      (b)    If   the  Board  of   Directors
determines  to redeem the Excess Shares, written  notice  of
redemption  (the "Notice") shall be provided to  the  Record
Transferee of the Excess Shares not less than one week prior
to the redemption date (the "Redemption Date") determined by
the  Board  of  Directors and included in the  Notice.   The
redemption price per share to be paid for Excess Shares will
be  equal to the lesser of (i) the principal price  paid  by
the  Record  Transferee from whom Excess  Shares  are  being
redeemed  or  (ii) (a) the closing price per  share  of  the
shares  on  the  principal national securities  exchange  on
which  the shares are listed or admitted to trading, (b)  if
the  shares  are not so listed or admitted to  trading,  the
closing bid price on the date of Notice as reported  on  the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.  System, if
quoted  thereon (the price per share determined under clause
(a)  or (b) being herein defined as the "Market Price"),  or
(c) if a Market Price is not determinable in accordance with
either  clause  (a) or (b) of this sentence, the  net  asset
value  per  share on the date of Notice determined  in  good
faith  by the Board of Directors, (iii) the Market Price  on
the  date on which the person would but for this Article  14
have  been deemed to acquire ownership of the Excess Shares,
or (iv) the maximum price allowed under Part 5 of Chapter 35
of  Title  48 of the Tennessee Code Annotated.   The  amount
payable  to  the  Record Transferee  for  Excess  Shares  so
redeemed  may be paid, at the option of the Corporation,  in
the  form  of the number of "Units" equal to the  number  of
shares redeemed divided by the "Conversion Factor," as those
terms  are  defined  in the Partnership  Agreement  of  Mid-
America  Apartment Communities, Inc.  The  redemption  price
for  any  shares  of  capital stock of  the  Corporation  so
redeemed  shall  be paid on the Redemption Date.   From  and
after the Redemption Date, the holder of any redeemed shares
of  capital  stock  of the Corporation  shall  cease  to  be
entitled to any distributions or other benefits with respect
to  redeemed shares, except the right to receive payment  of
the redemption price fixed as aforesaid.

               Application of Article.  Nothing contained in
this Article 14 or in any other provision hereof shall limit
the  authority of the Board of Directors to take any and all
other action as it in its sole discretion deems necessary or
advisable  to  protect the Corporation and the interests  of
its    shareholders   by   maintaining   the   Corporation's
eligibility  to be, and preserving the Corporation's  status
as, a REIT under the Code.

               Definition of "Person".  For purposes of this
Article  only, the term "person" shall include  individuals,
corporations,  limited  partnerships, general  partnerships,
joint  stock  companies  or  associations,  joint  ventures,
associations,  consortia, companies,  trusts,  banks,  trust
companies, land trusts, common law trusts, business  trusts,
or other entities and governments and agencies and political
subdivisions thereof.

                 Severability.  If  any  provision  of  this
Article  14  or  any  application of any such  provision  is
determined  to  be  invalid by any federal  or  state  court
having  jurisdiction  over the issue, the  validity  of  the
remaining  provisions  shall  not  be  affected  and   other
applications of such provision shall be affected only to the
extent  necessary to comply with the determination  of  that
court.

                Legend.  Certificates representing shares of
capital  stock  of  the  Corporation  shall  bear  a  legend
referencing the restrictions set forth in this Article 14.

                NYSE  Settlement.  Nothing in these Articles
of  Incorporation shall preclude any settlement  transaction
with respect to the Common Stock of the Company entered into
through the facilities of the New York Exchange.

      C.   The Amended and Restated Charter was approved  by
unanimous  written  consent of the sole shareholder  of  the
Corporation on  January 10th, 1994.

          Retention  of Rights and Properties.   As  of  the
          effective   time,  the  separate   existence   and
          corporate  organization of Cates shall  cease  and

          mixed,  and  all  debts due on  whatever  account,
          including,   without   limitation,    shares    or
          subscriptions  to  shares,  all  other  choses  in
          action,  rights, and credits, and  all  and  every

          Corporation and shall succeed to and shall  assume
          such  rights  and obligations and the  duties  and
          liabilities and obligations of both Cates and MAC,

          pending  by  or  against  Cates  or  MAC  may   be
          prosecuted  as if the merger had not taken  place.
          Neither the rights of creditors nor any liens upon
          the property of Cates or MAC shall be impaired  by
          the merger.

     (d)  At  the effective time, each share of Cates common
          stock,  without  par value, held by non-dissenting
          shareholders  and not exchanged for  cash  in  the
          manner  hereinbelow described shall, by virtue  of
          the  merger of Cates with and into MAC and without
          any  action being taken by the holder thereof,  be
          exchanged for and converted into two thousand five
          hundred   (2,500)  fully  paid  and  nonassessable
          shares of common stock of MAC, having a par  value
          of $.01 per share (the "MAC Stock")

     (e)  At  the effective time, each share of common stock
          of  MAC  then issued and outstanding shall  remain
          issued and outstanding as the common stock of  the
          Surviving Corporation.

2.    The  foregoing  Plan of Merger was  duly  adopted  and
approved  by the sole shareholder and the Board of Directors
of MAC by action without a meeting on January 18, 1994.  The

VIII.              Further Assurances.  Each of the Constituent
Corporations shall use their best efforts to take action and
to  do all things necessary in order to consummate and  make
effective  the  actions contemplated in this  Agreement  and
Plan  of  Merger.  If at any time the Surviving Corporation,
or  its  successors or assigns, shall consider to be advised
that  any  further assignments or assurances in law  or  any
other  acts are necessary or desirable to (a) vest,  perfect
or  confirm,  of  record  or  otherwise,  in  the  Surviving
Corporation  its rights, title or interest in, to  or  under
any  of the rights, properties or assets of FDC acquired  or
to  be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of,
or  in  connection with, the merger, or (b) otherwise  carry
out  the purposes of this Agreement and Plan of Merger,  FDC
and  its  proper officers and directors shall be  deemed  to
have  granted  to the Surviving Corporation  an  irrevocable
power  of  attorney to execute and deliver all  such  proper
deeds, assignments and assurances in law and to do all  acts
necessary or proper to vest, perfect or confirm title to and
possession  of  such rights, properties  or  assets  in  the
Surviving  Corporation  and  otherwise  to  carry  out   the
purposes  of  this  Agreement and Plan of  Merger,  and  the
proper  officers and directors of the Surviving  Corporation
are fully authorized in the name of FDC or otherwise to take
any and all such action.

IX.             Capital Stock.  At the Effective Time:

(1)                       Each share of Common Stock of  FDC
               (other than any dissenting shares), without any action on
               the part of the holder thereof, shall be converted into the
               right to receive six hundred eight thousand eighty-nine
               millionths (.608089) shares of MAAC Common Stock (the
               "Conversion Ratio").  MAAC shall deliver the shares of MAAC
               Common Stock at, or as soon as practicable after, the
               Effective Time.  Each dissenting share shall be converted
               into the right to receive payment from the Surviving
               Corporation with respect thereto in accordance with the
               provisions of the GBCC.  The Conversion Ratio shall be
               subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock
               split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, or other change
               in number of shares of FDC Common Stock or shares of MAAC
               Common Stock outstanding.  For all purposes, each share of
               MAAC Common Stock is agreed to have a value of Twenty-Eight
               Dollars ($28.00) per share.

(2)                       On  and after the Effective  Date,
               the holders of FDC Common Stock shall cease to have any
               rights as shareholders of FDC except for the right to
               surrender their stock in exchange for payment of the merger
               consideration.
               (2)  Each share of Common Stock of MAAC issued and
               outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
               remain issued and outstanding.

X.              No  Fractional Shares.  No fractional shares
of MAAC Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to the Merger.
In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share of MAAC
Common  Stock, cash adjustments will be paid to  holders  in
respect  of  any fractional share of MAAC Common Stock  that
would  otherwise be issuable.  The amount of such adjustment
shall  be  the product of such fraction of a share  of  MAAC
Common Stock multiplied by $28.00.

XI.              Dissenting Shares.  Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, shares of FDC Common Stock that  are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date and that
are held by shareholders, if any, who are entitled to assert
a  right  to  dissent  from the merger and  who  demand  and
validly perfect their rights to receive the "fair value"  of
their  shares with respect to the merger under the  relevant
provisions  of the GBCC (the "Dissenting Shares")  shall  be
entitled solely to the payment of the "fair value"  of  such
shares in accordance with the provisions of the GBCC; except
that  (i)  if such demand to receive "fair value"  shall  be
withdrawn  upon  the  consent of the Surviving  Corporation,
(ii)  if  this  Agreement  and  Plan  of  Merger  shall   be
terminated, or the merger shall not be consummated, (iii) if
no  demand or petition for the determination of "fair value"
by  a  court shall have been made or filed within  the  time
provided in the provisions of the GBCC or (iv) if a court of
competent  jurisdiction shall determine that such holder  of
Dissenting Shares is not entitled to the relief provided  by
the provisions of the GBCC, then the right of such holder of
Dissenting Shares to be paid the "fair value" of his  shares
of FDC Common Stock shall cease and, with respect to clauses
(i),  (iii)  and  (iv) above, such Dissenting  Shares  shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to  have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Date, the right
to  receive  the merger consideration with respect  thereto,
without  any  interest thereon, and with respect  to  clause
(ii) above, the status of such shareholder shall be restored
retroactively without prejudice to any corporate  proceeding
which may have been taken during the interim.

XII.              Amendment  or  Termination.  Notwithstanding
shareholder approval of this Agreement and Plan  of  Merger,
this  Agreement  and  Plan  of  Merger  may  be  amended  or
terminated  at any time on or before the Effective  Date  by
agreement  of  the  Boards of Directors of  the  Constituent
Corporations, provided that no amendment may be  made  which
decreases the Conversion Ratio.

XIII.              Counterparts.  This Agreement  and  Plan  of
Merger  may be executed in counterparts each of which  shall
be  deemed  an original and all of which together  shall  be
considered  one and the same agreement.  The  parties  agree
that   a   facsimile  may  be  executed  as   an   original.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto, pursuant to the
approval and authority duly given by resolutions adopted  by
their   respective   Boards  of  Directors   and   the   FDC
shareholders, have duly executed this Agreement and Plan  of
Merger as of the day and year first written above.

      In addition, the Company may from time to time pay the
Executive  other incentive compensation, including  but  not

(1)                 "Voluntary   Termination"   means    the
Executive's   voluntary  termination   of   his   employment
hereunder,  which may be affected by the Executive's  giving
the  Board 90 days written notice of the Executive's  desire
to  terminate his employment or the Executive's  failure  to
provide  substantially all the services described in Section
3 hereof for a period greater than two (2) consecutive weeks
by  reason  of the Executive's voluntary refusal to  perform
such  services.   Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if   the
Executive  gives notice of Voluntary Termination and,  prior
to the expiration of the 90-day notice period, the Executive
voluntarily  refuses or fails to provide  substantially  all
the  services  described in Section 3 hereof  for  a  period
greater   than   two   consecutive  weeks,   the   Voluntary
Termination shall be deemed to be effective as of  the  date
on  which  the Executive so ceases to carry out his  duties.
For purposes of this Section 8, voluntary refusal to perform
services   shall  not  include  taking  vacation   otherwise
permitted  in  accordance  with  Section  5(b)  hereof,  the
Executive's  failure to perform services on account  of  his
illness  or the illness of a member of his immediate family,
provided  such  illness is adequately substantiated  at  the

termination  of the Executive's employment  by  act  of  the
Board for any of the following reasons:

          (i)    the Executive's conviction  of  a
          crime  involving some act of  dishonesty
          or    moral    turpitude   (specifically
          excepting   simple   misdemeanors    not
          involving  acts  of dishonesty  and  all
          traffic violations);

          (ii)      the     Executive's     theft,
          embezzlement,  misappropriation  of   or
          intentional and malicious infliction  of
          damage   to  the  Company  property   or

          hereof;

          (iv)  the Executive's continuous neglect
          of   his   duties   hereunder   or   his
          continuous failure or refusal to  follow
          any reasonable, unambiguous duly adopted
          written  direction of the Board  or  any
          duly  constituted committee thereof that
          is not inconsistent with the description
          of  the Executive's duties set forth  in
          Section 3 above; and

          (v)    the Executive's abuse of alcohol,
          drugs   or  other  substances,  or   his
          engaging   in  other  deviant   personal
          activities  in  a manner  that,  in  the
          reasonable   judgment  of   the   Board,
          adversely    affects   the   reputation,
          goodwill  or  business position  of  the
          Company.

(4)              "Involuntary Termination" means conduct  on
the  part  of  the Company that constitutes  continuous  and
material  interference by the Company with  the  Executive's
performance of his duties as set forth in Section  3  hereof
or the intentional or material breach by the Company of this
Agreement.

I.               Voluntary  Termination;  Termination   With
Cause.   If  the Executive shall cease being an employee  of
the  Company on account of a Voluntary Termination or  shall
suffer  a  Termination With Cause, then the Executive  shall
not be entitled to any compensation after the effective date
of  such  Voluntary  Termination or Termination  With  Cause
(except compensation accrued but unpaid on the date of  such
event).   In  the  event  of such Voluntary  Termination  or
Termination With Cause, the Executive shall continue  to  be
subject  to the noncompetition covenant contained in Section
11 hereof for the remainder of the five-year period from the
date of execution of the Agreement.

J.              Death  or  Disability;  Termination  Without
Cause;  or Involuntary Termination.  If the Executive  shall
suffer  a  death, disability, Involuntary Termination  or  a
Termination  Without Cause, then the Company shall  pay  the
Executive  cash  compensation in a lump  sum  equal  to  the
lesser of one year's base salary or the amount which may  be
deducted  by  the Company pursuant to Section  280G  of  the
Internal Revenue Code.

K.              Noncompetition.   For five  years  from  the
execution  of the Agreement, the Executive shall not,  other
than in his capacity as officer and director of the Company,
directly  or  indirectly, for his own  account  or  for  the
account   of   others,  either  as  an  officer,   director,
stockholder, owner, partner, promoter, employee, consultant,
advisor, agent, manager or in any other capacity, engage  in
the acquisition, development, operation, management, leasing
or   landscaping   of  any  multifamily   community.    Such
prohibition extends to all multifamily communities, wherever
located,  during the Term of the Executive's employment  and
to  multifamily properties within thirty (30) miles  of  any
one  of  the  Properties after termination of the Agreement.
In   the   event  of  Termination  for  Cause  or  Voluntary
Termination,  the Executive shall continue to be  restricted
by  this  Section  11  for the remainder  of  the  five-year
period.

      The Executive agrees that damages at law for violation
of the restrictive covenant contained herein would not be an
adequate  or  proper remedy to the Company, and that  should
the  Executive  violate or threaten to violate  any  of  the
provisions of such covenant, the Company, its successors  or
assigns,  shall  be  entitled  to  obtain  a  temporary   or
permanent  injunction against Executive in any court  having
jurisdiction  over  the  person  and  the  subject   matter,
prohibiting  any  further violation of any  such  covenants.
The  injunctive relief provided herein shall be in  addition
to   any  award  of  damages,  compensatory,  exemplary   or
otherwise, payable by reason of such violation.

      Furthermore,  the  Executive  acknowledges  that  this
Agreement has been negotiated at arms length by the parties,
neither  being  under  any compulsion  to  enter  into  this
Agreement, and that the foregoing restrictive covenant  does
not  in any respect inhibit his ability to earn a livelihood
in  his  chosen profession without violating the restrictive
covenant  contained herein.  The Company by  these  presents
has attempted to limit the Executive's right to compete only
to  the  extent necessary to protect the Company from unfair
competition.    The   Company  recognizes,   however,   that
reasonable people may differ in making such a determination.
Consequently,  the  Company agrees  that  if  the  scope  or
enforceability of the restrictive covenant contained  herein
is  in  any way disputed at any time, a court or other trier
of  fact  may modify and enforce the covenant to the  extent
that  it  believes to be reasonable under the  circumstances
existing at the time.

A.                The  maximum  number of shares  of  Common
Stock  of  the Company that may be used in conjunction  with
the  grant  of  Awards  under the  Plan  is  1,000,000.   In
determining the number of shares available from time to time
for  Awards under the Plan, each Class A Common Unit covered
by any Award shall be considered the equivalent of one share
of  Common  Stock,  and the Company shall not  grant  awards
involving  Class A Common Units in excess of  the  remaining
number of shares of Common Stock available under the Plan.

B.                Shares of stock which are attributable  to
Awards  which expire or are otherwise terminated, cancelled,
surrendered  or  forfeited,  during  a  calendar  year,  are
available  for  issuance  or use in connection  with  future
Awards,  during  the calendar year in which they  expire  or
otherwise become available, provided, however, that, if  any
such  shares  could not again be available for Awards  to  a
Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act
under  applicable share counting requirements of Rule 16b-3,
such  shares  shall be available exclusively for  Awards  to
Participants who are not subject to Section 16.

C.                Shares of Common Stock to be issued  under
the  Plan  may be authorized and unissued shares  of  Common
Stock, treasury stock or a combination thereof.

D.                In  the  event of a merger, consolidation,
reorganization,   recapitalization,   stock   split,   stock
dividend,  other extraordinary dividend or other changes  in
corporate  structure or capitalization affecting the  Common
Stock, the Committee may make appropriate adjustment in  the
number  of  shares  or number and kind of  other  securities
subject  to  options, rights and other Awards granted  under
the  Plan,  and/or the exercise price and  other  terms  and
conditions  of  Awards  or  appropriate  adjustment  in  the
maximum  number of shares referred to in Section  5  of  the
Plan,  as  the  Committee may determine to be  necessary  or
appropriate  in order to prevent dilution or enlargement  of
the rights of Participants.

V.        Awards Under the Plan

A.                Stock  Options.  The Committee  may  grant
Incentive Stock Options ("ISO"), Non-Qualified Stock Options
or  both to purchase shares of Common Stock from the Company
to such Officers and other key employees in such amounts and
subject to such terms and conditions, as the Committee shall
determine  in its sole discretion, subject to the provisions
of  the  Plan, provided, however, that in no event  may  any
Stock Option be granted hereunder after the expiration of 10
years  after  the  date  of  the  Plan.   The  automatic  or
discretionary   grant   of   "reload"   Stock   Options   is
specifically authorized.

           In the case of ISO's, the terms and conditions of
such grants, including the exercise price of the purchase of
Common  Stock,  shall  be subject to  and  comply  with  the
requirements  of Section 422 of the Code, as  from  time  to
time amended, and any implementing regulations.

          The exercise price at which shares of Common Stock
may be purchased pursuant to the grant of an Option shall be
fixed  by  the Committee at the time of grant; however,  the
price  of  an ISO must be equal to or greater than the  Fair
Market  Value of the shares of Common Stock covered thereby.
The  exercise price of an ISO granted to any Participant who
owns shares of Common Stock possessing more than 10% of  the
total  combined voting power of all outstanding   shares  of
Common  Stock of the Company must be at least equal to  110%
of  the  fair market value of the shares of Common Stock  on
the  date of grant.  Options granted under the Plan will not
be  ISOs  to  the extent that the Fair Market Value  of  the
shares  of  Common  Stock with respect to which  ISOs  first
become exercisable in any year exceeds $100,000.

B.                  Restricted   Securities   Awards.    The
Committee may grant Restricted Securities Awards ("RSAs") to
such  Officers and other key employees in such  amounts  and
subject  to  such terms and conditions as the Committee  may
determine   in   its   sole   discretion,   including   such
restrictions  on  transferability  and  other  restrictions,
vesting  or  other provisions as the Committee  may  impose,
which restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at
such  times, under such circumstances, in such installments,
or otherwise, as the Committee shall determine.

           Unless  otherwise determined by the Committee  at
the  time  of an Award, the holder of an RSA shall have  the
right  to  vote  the restricted securities  and  to  receive
dividends  or distributions thereon, unless and  until  such
restricted securities are forfeited.

           In  the event all or any of the shares of  Common
Stock  or  Class A Common Units subject to RSA are forfeited
due  to  failure to meet or comply with restrictions imposed
by  the Committee at the time of grant prior to the lapse of
such   restrictions,  the  Company  shall   repay   to   the
Participant  (or the Participant's estate) any  cash  amount
paid by the Participant for such forfeited shares.

C.                 Tandem  and  Substitute  Awards.   Awards
granted  under  the  Plan  may, in  the  discretion  of  the
Committee,  be  granted either alone or in addition  to,  in
tandem with, or in substitution for, any other Award granted
under the Plan or any award granted under any other plan  of
the  Company,  any Subsidiary or Affiliate, or any  business
entity  to  be  acquired by the Company or a  Subsidiary  or
Affiliate,  or any other right of a Participant  to  receive
payment from the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate.  If
an  Award  is granted in substitution for another  Award  or
award,  the  Committee shall require the surrender  of  such
other  Award or award in consideration for the grant of  the
new  Award.  Awards granted in addition to or in tandem with
other Awards or awards may be granted either as of the  same
time  as  or  a different time from the grant of such  other
Awards or awards.

VI.        Award Agreements

      Awards  under  the  Plan  shall  be  evidenced  by  an
agreement  approved  by the Committee that  sets  forth  the
terms,   conditions  and  limitations  of  an  Award.    The
Committee  may  amend agreements theretofore  entered  into,
either  prospectively or retroactively, including,  but  not
limited  to,  the acceleration of vesting  of  or  lapse  of
restrictions  on  an  Award and the  extension  of  time  to
exercise  an  Award,  except that, no such  amendment  shall
affect the Award in a materially adverse manner without  the
consent of the Participant (except for an amendment made  to
cause the Plan to qualify for an exemption provided by  Rule
16b-3).

VII.        Miscellaneous Provisions Related to Participants

A.                 The  grant  of  an  Award  shall  not  be
construed  as giving a Participant the right to be  retained
in  the employ of the Company.  The Company may at any  time
dismiss  a  Participant  from  employment,  free  from   any
liability  or  any  claim under the Plan,  unless  otherwise
expressly  provided in the Plan or in any  Award  Agreement.
No  Participant or other person shall have any claim  to  be
granted any Award, and there is no obligation for uniformity
of  treatment of Participants or holders or beneficiaries of
Awards.

B.                Except as may be otherwise provided  under
Section  6.2,  no  Award  granted  under  the  Plan,  unless
otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, shall entitle the
holder of such Award to any dividend, voting or other  right
of  a  stockholder  unless and until the date  of   issuance
under the Plan of the shares that are subject to such Award.

C.                The purchase price of the shares of Common
Stock  as to which an Option is exercised shall be  paid  in
cash  or by check, except as otherwise hereinafter provided,
at   the  time  of  exercise.   In  addition,  in  its  sole
discretion,  the  Committee may  determine  that  it  is  an
appropriate  method of payment for grantees to pay  for  any
shares  subject to an option by (i) delivering  certificates
for unrestricted shares of Common Stock having a value equal
to  the  Exercise Price of the Options being  exercised,  or
(ii) delivering a properly executed exercise notice together
with  a  copy  of irrevocable instructions to  a  broker  to
deliver  promptly to the Company the amount of proceeds  for
the sale of shares of Common Stock or margin credit extended
on  shares of Common Stock (including the Common Stock to be
acquired  pursuant to the exercise of Options)  to  pay  the
purchase  price.  To facilitate the foregoing,  the  Company
may  enter  into agreements for coordinated procedures  with
one  or  more brokerage firms.  The value of Company  Common
Stock surrendered in payment of the Exercise Price shall  be
its  Fair Market Value, determined pursuant to Section 2.10,
on  the  date  of  exercise.  Upon receipt of  a  notice  of
exercise  of a Stock Option and upon payment of the Exercise
Price, the Company shall promptly deliver to the Participant
a certificate or certificates for the shares of Common Stock
purchased,  without  charge to  him  or  her  for  issue  or
transfer  tax.   The Committee, in its sole discretion,  may
form  time  to time permit the method of exercising  Options
known  as  pyramiding or "cashless exercise" (that  is,  the
automatic  application of shares received upon the  exercise
of  a portion of an Option to satisfy the exercise price for
additional portions of the Option).

D.               A Participant may be required to pay to the
Company, and the Company shall have the right to deduct from
all amounts paid to a Participant (whether under the Plan or
otherwise), any taxes required by law to be paid or withheld
in  respect  of  Awards hereunder to such Participant.   The
Committee  may  provide  for  additional  cash  payments  to
holders  of Awards to defray or offset any tax arising  from
the  grant, vesting exercise or payment of any Award or,  at
the  election of the holder of the Award, the Committee  may
withhold  shares  or accept the transfer of  shares  to  the
Company,  in  such  amounts as are equivalent  to  the  Fair
Market Value of the withholding obligations.

E.                If  the  Committee  determines  that  such
action  is  advisable, the Company may,  or  may  cause  the
Operating   Partnership  to,  assist  any   Participant   in
obtaining  financing from the Company or from  any  bank  or
other  third party, on such terms as are determined  by  the
Committee,  and in such amount as is required to  accomplish
the  purposes  of the Plan, including, but not  limited  to,
permitting the exercise of an Award and/or paying any  taxes
in  respect  thereof to the extent permitted by  law.   Such
assistance  may  take  any  form that  the  Committee  deems
appropriate,  including, but not limited to, a  direct  loan
from  the  Company or the Operating Partnership, a guarantee
of   the   obligation  by  the  Company  or  the   Operating
Partnership,  or  the  maintenance by  the  Company  or  the
Operating  Partnership of deposits with such bank  or  third
party.

F.               Awards, and any right that comes within the
general definition of "derivative security" of Rule 16a-1(c)
under   the  Exchange  Act,  shall  not  be  assignable   or
transferable by a Participant except by will or the laws  of
descent  and  distribution  (or pursuant  to  a  beneficiary
designation  authorized under Section 8.7), and  during  the
Award  holder's  lifetime, such Awards and rights  shall  be
exercisable  only  by  such holder  or  such  holder's  duly
appointed guardian or legal representative.

G.               Each Participant may file and maintain with
the Company a written designation of one or more persons  as
the  beneficiary or beneficiaries who shall be  entitled  to
receive the Award or related payment payable under the  Plan
upon the Participant's death.  If no such designation is  in
effect  at  the  time of a Participant's  death,  or  if  no
designated beneficiary survives the Participant or  if  such
designation conflicts with the law, the Participant's estate
shall  be  entitled to receive the Award or related payment,
if any, payable under the Plan upon the Participant's death.

VIII.        Governing Law

     The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan, any
rules  and  regulations relating to the Plan and  any  Award
Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the laws of
the State of Tennessee and applicable federal law.

IX.        Severability

     If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes
or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction or as to any Participant or Award under any law
deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision or  Award
shall   be  construed  or  deemed  amended  to  conform   to
applicable  laws,  or  if it cannot be construed  or  deemed
amended,  in  the  determination of the  Committee,  without
materially  altering the intent of the Plan  or  the  Award,
such  provision  shall be stricken as to such  jurisdiction,
Participant or Award and the remainder of the Plan  and  any
such Award shall remain in full force and effect.

X.        Unfunded Plan

      The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan.
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Plan shall
be unfunded and shall not create (or be construed to create)
a trust or a separate fund or funds.  To the extent that any
person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company
pursuant   to   an  Award,  such  right  (unless   otherwise
determined  by the Committee) shall be no greater  than  the
right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.

XI.        Rule 16b-3 Compliance

A.                 Unless   a  Participant  could  otherwise
transfer an equity security, derivative security, or  shares
issued upon exercise of a derivative security granted  under
the Plan without incurring liability under Section 16(b)  of
the  Exchange Act, (i) an equity security issued  under  the
Plan,  other than an equity security issued pursuant to  the
exercise  of a derivative security granted under  the  Plan,
shall  be  held  for at least six months from  the  date  of
acquisition, and (ii) at least six months shall elapse  from
the date of acquisition of a derivative security to the date
of  disposition of the derivative security (other than  upon
exercise  or  conversion) or disposition of  any  underlying
equity   security  issued  pursuant  to  the   exercise   or
conversion of such derivative security.

B.                It is the intent of the Company that  this
Plan  comply  in all respects with applicable provisions  of
Rule  16b-3 and Rule 16a-1(c)(3) under the Exchange  Act  in
connection  with any grant of Awards to or other transaction
by  a  Participant  who  is subject to  Section  16  of  the
Exchange   Act  (except  for  transactions  exempted   under
alternative Exchange Act Rules or acknowledged in writing to
be  non-exempt  by such Participant).  Accordingly,  if  any
provision  of  this  Plan or any Award  Agreement  does  not
comply  with  the requirements of Rule 16b-3  or  Rule  16a-
1(c)(3)  as  then  applicable to any such transaction,  such
provision will be construed or deemed amended to the  extent
necessary to conform to the applicable requirements of  Rule
16b-3  or  Rule  16a-1(c)(3) so that such Participant  shall
avoid liability under Section 16(b).

XII.        Effective Date and Term of Plan

A.               The Plan is an amendment and restatement of
the  1994  Restricted Stock and Stock  Option  Plan  of  the
Company  originally adopted by the Company's shareholder  on
January 26, 1994.  The Plan became effective on February  4,
1994.

B.                The  Plan  shall remain  in  effect  until
January  31,  2004, unless sooner terminated by  the  Board.
After  this  date,  no further Awards  may  be  granted  but
previously  granted  Awards  shall  remain  outstanding   in
accordance  with their applicable terms and  conditions,  as
stated in the Award Agreement, and conditions of the Plan.

XIII.        Amendment and Termination of the Plan

A.               The Plan may be amended by the Board in any
respect,   without   the   consent   of   stockholders    or
Participants,  except  that  any  such  amendment  (although
effective when made) shall be subject to the approval of the
Company's  stockholders within one  year  after  such  Board
action  if  such  stockholder approval is  required  by  any
federal or state law or regulation or the rules of any stock
exchange  or automated quotation system on which the  Common
Stock  may  then  be  listed or quoted, and  the  Board  may
otherwise, in its discretion, determine to subject any other
amendment  to  the  Plan to stockholders for  approval.   In
addition, no amendment may materially impair the rights of a
Participant  under  any Award previously granted  under  the
Plan   without  the  consent  of  such  Participant,  unless
required by law.

B.                The Plan may be terminated at any time  by
the  Board.   No further Awards may be made under  the  Plan
after  termination,  but termination shall  not  affect  the
rights  of  any Participant under, or the authority  of  the
Committee  with respect to, any grants or awards made  prior
to termination.

           This  Revolving Credit Agreement is dated as of
     March  16, 1998 (this "Agreement") among
     Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. ("MAAC"),
     Mid-America Apartments, L.P. ("Mid-America"),
     the  financial  institutions listed on Schedule 1 as
     amended  or supplemented from time to time (the
     "Lenders"), and
     AmSouth  Bank,  an Alabama banking corporation, as
     Administrative Agent  for  the  Lenders, its
     successors  and  assigns  (in  such capacity, the
     "Administrative Agent").
           This Agreement is executed in amendment and
     restatement  of that  certain  Revolving  Credit Agreement
     among  the  Borrowers,  the Administrative Agent and
     certain lenders, dated November 20, 1997.
           The parties, intending to be legally bound,
     severally agree
     as follows: 
     I.   LOAN TERMS
     1.1. The Loans
     Each  Lender  shall make loans ("Loans") to MAAC and
     Mid-America, jointly  and  severally  (each  a
     "Borrower"  and  together  the "Borrowers").
     The  agreements of the Lenders to make Loans, are
     several and not joint.
     All  Loans  shall  be  made  on the terms,  and
     subject  to  the conditions, of this Agreement.  The
     Borrowers may borrow,  repay, prepay and reborrow
     under this Agreement from the Effective  Date until
     the  Termination  Date  of  the  Loans,  in  an
     aggregate principal amount not to exceed, at any one
     time outstanding,  the lesser of:
                  the    sum   of   Two   Hundred
          Million    Dollars ($200,000,000.00), or
                the  Borrowing Base reduced by (a) the
          amount  of  all outstanding  Letters  of  Credit
          and  (b)  the  amount   of outstanding Advances.
          
          
          
     1.2. Borrowings

                All  Loans to the Borrowers that have
          Interest Periods that  begin  on the same day
          and end on the same  day  shall constitute a
          single borrowing ("Borrowing").
          
     1.3. Commitments

                A Lender's Commitment as of the date of
          this Agreement is  the  amount  shown opposite
          its name on  Schedule  1;  a Lender's Commitment
          may be subsequently reduced pursuant  to this
          Agreement  or  increased  pursuant  to  a
          permitted assignment.  As of the date of this
          Agreement, the Aggregate Commitment is
          $200,000,000.00.
          
     1.4. Notes

               The Loans shall be evidenced by promissory
          notes of the Borrowers,  payable  to the order
          of  each  Lender,  in  the principal amount of
          their respective Proportionate Share  of the
          Aggregate Commitment, and in the form
          substantially the same  as  the copy of the Note
          attached hereto as Exhibit  A (the  "Notes").
          The Notes, in addition to  evidencing  new
          indebtedness,  also  amend, restate, renew  and
          consolidate certain   notes  related  to  the
          Mortgaged  Property,   as explained on Exhibit I
          attached hereto.
          
          1.5. Maximum amounts of Loans and Borrowings
                     (a)   No  Lender shall make Loans in
               an aggregate unpaid  principal  amount
               that  exceeds  the  Lender's Commitment.
               Each Borrowing shall consist of Loans made
               by  the  Lenders  in  proportion  to  their
               respective Commitments.
                     (b)   No Loan shall be made to the Borrowers if,
          immediately  following  the making  of  the  Loan,  the
          aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans  to  the
          Borrowers  would  exceed the lesser  of  the  Aggregate
          Commitment or the Borrowing Base.
     1.6. Minimum Borrowing size
           Each  Borrowing  shall be in the principal  amount  of
       $2,000,000 or a larger integral multiple of $500,000.
                                 
     1.7. Swing Line Facility

                (a)   The "Swing Line Facility" is being extended
          under, and as a component of, the Aggregate Commitment,
          and   shall   be   advanced  and  readvanced   by   the
          Administrative  Agent  to the Borrowers  in  accordance
          with  the provisions of this Agreement hereinafter  set
          forth, and shall be evidenced by, and payable, together
          with   interest   thereon,  in  accordance   with   the
          provisions  of,  the  Swing Line  Facility  Note.   The
          Borrowers expressly acknowledge and agree that:
                                 
                          1.    the Administrative Agent directly
               assumes the obligation to fund, and shall have the
               sole  obligation to fund, 100% of each Advance  of
               the Swing Line Facility which is made, or required
               to  be made, in accordance with the provisions  of
               this Agreement, and

                          2.    the Borrowers shall not have  the
               right  under any fact or circumstance to  look  to
               any  other  party, including, without  limitation,
               any  other Lender, for the funding of all  or  any
               portion  of  the  Swing  Line  Facility  which  is
               required  to  be  made  in  accordance  with   the
               provisions of this Agreement if the Administrative
               Agent shall default in doing so, all risk of  such
               default  being  assumed in  all  respects  by  the
               Borrowers.
               
                (b)   Subject  to satisfaction of the  applicable
          general   terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in   this
          Agreement, Advances under the Swing Line Facility  will
          be  available  on any day the Administrative  Agent  is
          open  for business and on the same day notice is  given
          by  the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent, provided
          that  any such request by the Borrowers for an  Advance
          under  the  Swing  Line Facility  is  received  by  the
          Administrative  Agent  prior to 1:00  P.M.,  Birmingham
          time,  on  the  date  such Advance is  requested.   The
          outstanding  principal balance  under  the  Swing  Line
          Facility may be prepaid, in whole or in part and at any
          time,  without prior notice to the Administrative Agent
          and  without payment of penalty or premium.  Notice  of
          prepayments  under  the  Swing Line  Facility  must  be
          received  by  the Administrative Agent  prior  to  1:00
          P.M.,  Birmingham  time, and payment  received  by  the
          close  of  business  on  the  day  of  notice  for  the
          Borrowers  to  receive credit for such prepayment  that
          day.   With respect to an Advance under the Swing  Line
          Facility  in  excess of $750,000, the  Borrowers  shall
          submit  to the Administrative Agent a detailed  request
          for  the Advance in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
          B.   For an Advance of $750,000 or less under the Swing
          Line  Facility,  the  Borrowers  shall  submit  to  the
          Administrative  Agent  a written memo  requesting  such
          Advance.   Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary
          contained herein, all controlled advances and  payments
          automatically  generated by the Administrative  Agent's
          cash  management system shall not require  any  of  the
          above  notices from the Borrowers.  The Borrowers shall
          notify  the  Administrative Agent  in  writing  of  the
          responsible  officer, who shall  be  either  the  chief
          financial  officer,  the chief executive  officer,  the
          chief   operating  officer,  or  the   treasurer   (the
          "Responsible  Officer") authorized to request  Advances
          under  the  Swing  Line  Facility  on  behalf  of   the
          Borrowers.

                (c)   Upon  request of the Administrative  Agent,
          each of the other Lenders shall within 24 hours of such
          request  fund their Proportionate Share in each Advance
          under the Swing Line; however, the failure of any  such
          Lender  to  fund  their  Proportionate  Share  of  each
          Advance under the Swing Line Facility shall not relieve
          the  Administrative  Agent from  its  obligation  under
          subparagraph 1.7(a) above to fund the entire Advance.
1.8. Letters of Credit
           The Letter of Credit Facility is being extended under,
     and  as  a  component  of,  the Aggregate  Commitment.   The
     Borrowers  shall  have  the right, from  time  to  time,  to
     request  the  Administrative Agent  to  issue  one  or  more
     unconditional  and  irrevocable letters of  credit  for  its
     account or a Subsidiary's (each a "Letter of Credit").   The
     Borrowers,   the   Lenders  and  the  Administrative   Agent
     acknowledge  and agree that the Existing Letters  of  Credit
     previously  issued  by  the  Administrative  Agent  for  the
     account  of  MAAC shall each constitute a Letter  of  Credit
     hereunder  for  all purposes.  Any request by the  Borrowers
     for  a  Letter of Credit shall be subject to the  terms  and
     conditions of this paragraph hereinafter set forth:
     
                (a)  Each request for the issuance of a Letter of
          Credit  shall be in writing, shall state the  requested
          date  of  issuance  of the Letter(s) of  Credit  (which
          shall  be  at  least five (5) Business Days  after  the
          request is received by the Administrative Agent), shall
          state  the requested amount of the Letter(s) of  Credit
          and  the purposes for which the Letter(s) of Credit are
          requested,  shall indicate both the account  party  and
          the  beneficiary of the Letter(s) of Credit, and  shall
          specify  the  terms of the Letter(s) of  Credit  (which
          terms   shall   be  reasonably  satisfactory   to   the
          Administrative Agent).

                (b)   The  aggregate amount of Letters of  Credit
          outstanding   at   any  one  time  shall   not   exceed
          $60,000,000.
          
               (c)  At no time during the term of the Loans shall
          there be more than twenty (20) Letters of Credit in the
          aggregate  outstanding, unless otherwise agreed  to  by
          Administrative Agent in its sole discretion.
          
                (d)  No Letter of Credit shall have an expiration
          date beyond the Maturity Date.
          
               (e)  The purpose of each Letter of Credit shall be
          to  provide  credit  enhancement for  tax  exempt  bond
          financing of the Borrowers or a Subsidiary or for  such
          other   purposes   as   may  be   acceptable   to   the
          Administrative  Agent,  which  approval  shall  not  be
          unreasonably withheld or delayed.
          
                (f)  The Administrative Agent shall have the sole
          obligation  to  issue Letter(s) of  Credit  under  this
          Agreement, and Borrower shall not have the right  under
          any  fact  or circumstance to look to any other  party,
          including,  without limitation, any other  Lender,  for
          the   issuance  of  the  Letter(s)  of  Credit  if  the
          Administrative  Agent defaults in doing  so,  all  such
          risk of default being assumed by the Borrowers.
          
                (g)   Upon  written  request  of  a  Lender,  the
          Administrative  Agent  shall  provide  a  copy  of  the
          Letter(s) of Credit to such Lender.
          
1.9. Drafts under a Letter of Credit

           Any  draw honored by the Administrative Agent under  a
     Letter  of  Credit shall constitute an automatic Advance  at
     the  Base  Rate  and  shall  be evidenced  by  and  payable,
     together  with  interest  thereon, in  accordance  with  the
     provisions of the Notes.  Upon request of the Administrative
     Agent,  each of the other Lenders shall, not later  than  24
     hours    after   such   request,   fund   their   respective
     Proportionate Share in each such Advance which is made as  a
     result of a draw under a Letter of Credit.
     
1.10. Maturity of Loans

           Subject  to  Section  7.2, (Action  on  Default),  and
     Section  1.15 (Borrowers' termination of Borrowing  Rights),
     the  unpaid principal amount of each Loan shall be  due  and
     payable on the Maturity Date.
     
            The  Borrowing  Rights  of  the  Borrowers  and   the
     obligation  of the Lenders to extend Loans shall permanently
     terminate on the Termination Date.
     
1.11. Fees

               (a)  Letter of Credit Fees
                     The  annual fee for the issuance of a Letter
          of Credit shall be equal to one and one-quarter percent
          (1.25%) per annum multiplied by the face amount of such
          Letter  of  Credit;  and any such  fee  shall  be  paid
          annually in advance for the entire period of time  that
          such  Letter of Credit is outstanding (the  "Letter  of
          Credit  Fee").   One-eighth of one percent  (.125%)  of
          each  Letter  of  Credit Fee shall be retained  by  the
          Administrative  Agent  for its sole  account,  and  the
          remaining one and one-eighth percent (1.125%) shall  be
          shared  with  the  Lenders  in  accordance  with  their
          respective  Proportionate Share.  The  Borrowers  shall
          also  pay to the Administrative Agent an administrative
          fee at the customary rate charged by the Administrative
          Agent for the issuance of letters of credit generally.
               (b)  Commitment Fee
                     The  Borrowers have agreed  to  pay  to  the
          Lenders   a  commitment  fee  (the  "Commitment   Fee")
          pursuant  to  a  separate letter  agreement  among  the
          Administrative Agent and the Borrowers.   Such  payment
          is  being made in consideration of the agreement of the
          Lenders to make funds available to the Borrowers  under
          the terms and provisions hereof from the Effective Date
          until  the Termination Date.  The Borrowers agree  that
          this commitment fee is fair and reasonable, considering
          the condition of the money market, the creditworthiness
          of  the Borrowers and the interest rate to be paid  for
          the Loan.
               (c)  Facility Fee
                    The Borrowers shall pay an annual fee, due on
          the  closing of the Loans and on November 24, 1998 (the
          "Facility  Fee").   Such  payment  shall  be  made   in
          consideration of the Lenders' agreement to  make  funds
          available   to  the  Borrowers  under  the  terms   and
          provisions  hereof.  The Facility Fee  due  on  closing
          shall   be  payable  pursuant  to  a  separate   letter
          agreement  between the Administrative  Agent  and  each
          Lender.   The  Facility Fee due on November  24,  1998,
          shall  be  payable  to the Lenders in  accordance  with
          their respective Proportionate Share.
          
               (d)  Collateral Fee

                    The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative
          Agent,  for  the  sole  benefit of  the  Administrative
          Agent,  a  fee  of $3,500 for each Apartment  Community
          submitted to the Administrative Agent for inclusion  as
          a Mortgaged Property throughout the term of the Loans.
          
               (e)  Other Fees

                     The  Borrowers  shall pay the Administrative
          Agent such other fees as required by the Administrative
          Agent  in  a  separate  letter  agreement  between  the
          Administrative Agent and the Borrowers.
1.12. Interest Periods
           Each Eurodollar Loan shall have an Interest Period  of
     thirty  (30)  or sixty (60) days (the "Interest Period")  as
     the  Borrowers  specify  in  the  applicable  Borrowing   or
     Conversion Notice, except that:
                     an  Interest Period that would otherwise end
          on  a  day that is not a Business Day shall end on  the
          following  Business  Day unless the following  Business
          Day  falls in another calendar month, in which case the
          Interest  Period  shall end on the  preceding  Business
          Day, and
                     an  Interest Period that begins on the  last
          Business Day of a calendar month (or on a day for which
          there  is  no  numerically  corresponding  day  in  the
          calendar month at the end of the Interest Period) shall
          end on the last Business Day of a calendar month.
1.13. Interest
           For  each Loan, the Borrowers may elect that such Loan
     accrue  interest at either the Base Rate or  the  Eurodollar
     Rate.
                (a)  Each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest  at
          the Eurodollar Rate on its unpaid principal amount from
          the  first  to the last day in its applicable  Interest
          Period.    Accrued  interest  shall   be   payable   on
          Eurodollar  Loans  on the last day  of  the  applicable
          Interest Period.
          
                (b)   Each Base Rate Loan and each Loan evidenced
          by  the Swing Line Facility Note shall bear interest at
          the  Base Rate on its unpaid principal amount from  the
          date  such Loan is made until repaid.  Accrued interest
          shall be payable on Base Rate Loans and Loans evidenced
          by  the  Swing Line Facility Note on the first  day  of
          each month.
          
                (c)   The  Borrowers shall pay on the  Conversion
          Date  accrued interest on any Loan converted  prior  to
          the last day of its Interest Period.
          
                (d)   Overdue principal of or interest on a  Loan
          shall  bear interest, payable on demand, from the first
          day  the  principal or interest is overdue  until  paid
          (after as well as before judgment) at a rate per  annum
          equal  to  the  sum of 2% plus the applicable  interest
          rate on the particular Loan for each day.
          
                (e)   Upon  the successful completion, reasonably
          satisfactory to all of the Lenders, of MAAC's  issuance
          or  sale of common or preferred stock that produces net
          proceeds  of  no  less than $90,000,000,  the  interest
          rates available hereunder shall be modified as follows:
          
                          1.   the Margin utilized in calculating
               the  Eurodollar  Rate shall  equal  one  and  one
               quarter percent (1.25%); and
               
                         2.   the Base Rate shall equal the Prime
               Rate minus .75%.  The Borrowers may submit to  the
               Lenders  a  written request for such  continuation
               of, or reduction in, the Margin and the Base Rate,
               and shall deliver to the Lenders such information,
               reports  and opinions with such request  that  the
               Lenders deem desirable or necessary.
               
                (f)  The Administrative Agent shall determine the
          interest rates for all Loans and shall promptly  notify
          the  Borrowers and the Lenders of such interest  rates.
          Such  determinations shall be conclusive in the absence
          of manifest error.
          
1.14. Maximum Eurodollar Borrowings

           Notwithstanding  anything to  the  contrary  contained
     herein,  there  shall not be more than nine  (9)  Eurodollar
     Borrowings outstanding at any given time.
     
1.15. Borrowers' termination of Borrowing Rights

           The  Borrowers may, upon at least three Business Days'
     notice  to  the Administrative Agent, permanently  terminate
     their Borrowing Rights.  If the Borrowers so terminate their
     Borrowing  Rights, the unpaid principal amount of all  Loans
     to  the  Borrowers with all accrued interest, and all  fees,
     and funding losses, and other amounts owing by the Borrowers
     under this Agreement, shall be payable on the effective date
     of the termination.  Additionally, the Borrowers shall cause
     all  outstanding Letters of Credit to be surrendered to  the
     Administrative  Agent  on  such date  of  termination.   The
     Administrative  Agent shall promptly notify the  Lenders  of
     such termination of the Borrowers' Borrowing Rights.
1.16. Voluntary and Mandatory Prepayments
                (a)  The Borrowers may prepay on any Business Day
          the unpaid principal amount of the Loans in a Borrowing
          in  whole  or in a part that is $2,000,000 or a  larger
          integral multiple of $500,000.
                (b)   In  the  event  the  aggregate  outstanding
          balance  of  the  Loans shall at any  time  exceed  the
          Borrowing Base, the Borrowers shall immediately make  a
          principal  payment  which will reduce  the  outstanding
          aggregate  principal balance of the Loans to an  amount
          not exceeding the Borrowing Base.
                (c)   (i)  If  a  Development Project  for  which
          Advances   have  been  made  in  accordance  with   the
          Borrowing  Base  has  not become a Stabilized  Property
          within  one  (1)  year  from the date  Certificates  of
          Occupancy have been issued for all buildings within the
          Development   Project,  the  Advance   Rate   of   such
          Development Project shall be reduced from 50%  to  25%;
          (ii)  if  such  Development Project has  not  become  a
          Stabilized  Property  within  18  months  of  the  date
          Certificates  of  Occupancy have been  issued  for  all
          buildings  within the Development Project, the  Advance
          Rate   shall  be  reduced  to  $0.00;  and   (iii)   if
          Certificates of Occupancy for all buildings within  the
          Development  Project  have not been  issued  within  24
          months  from the commencement of construction  of  such
          Development Project, the Advance Rate shall be  reduced
          to $0.00; and then, in all such instances, a payment of
          principal  shall immediately be due and payable  in  an
          amount  sufficient to reduce the outstanding  principal
          balance  of  the Loans to an amount not  exceeding  the
          Borrowing  Base.   Nothing  in  this  subsection  shall
          preclude the Borrowers from subsequently resubmitting a
          Development  Project described in  this  subsection  in
          accordance with Section 3.5 hereof.
          
               (d)  A prepayment of principal must be accompanied
          by  payment of accrued interest on the principal amount
          prepaid.  Prepayments of Loans accruing interest at the
          Eurodollar  Rate  shall  be  subject  to  Section  1.18
          (Funding losses).
                (e)   In  the  event a Curative  Measure  is  not
          substantially completed within ninety (90) days of  the
          date  the subject Mortgaged Property was added  to  the
          Borrowing  Base, the Borrowers shall, within  ten  (10)
          days  after  notice  from the Administrative  Agent  to
          Borrowers, make a prepayment of principal equal to  the
          cost  of  such  Curative Measure as set  forth  in  the
          applicable  Inspection  Report,  unless  such  Curative
          Measure is completed within such ten (10) day period.
                (f)  If a Stabilized Property has been injured or
          damaged  by  fire or other casualty to the extent  that
          twenty-five  percent  (25%)  of  the  apartment   units
          included  in such Stabilized Property has been rendered
          uninhabitable, the Borrowing Base shall be  immediately
          reduced,  and  the  Loans repaid by  the  corresponding
          amount,  in  an amount equal to 60% of the Fair  Market
          Value of such Stabilized Property immediately prior  to
          such  damage or injury; provided, however, that if  the
          damaged  Stabilized Property is insured  in  an  amount
          sufficient  to  rebuild or restore such damage  and  if
          rental   insurance  is  payable  for  the  repair   and
          reconstruction  period, no reduction in  the  Borrowing
          Base  will  result hereunder.  It is agreed that  after
          such  damaged Stabilized Property has been repaired  to
          the  Administrative Agent's satisfaction, the Borrowing
          Base   shall  be  recalculated  as  of  the  date   the
          Administrative Agent approved such repair, based on the
          then Fair Market Value.
          
Prepayment Notices

           The Borrowers shall notify the Administrative Agent of
     a  prepayment, specifying the date of the prepayment and the
     amount  of  the Borrowings to be prepaid, at least  two  (2)
     Business Days before the date of prepayment.
            Upon   receipt   of  a  notice  of  prepayment,   the
     Administrative  Agent shall promptly notify each  Lender  of
     its  contents and of the Lender's Proportionate Share of the
     prepayment.
     
1.17. Payments generally

                (a)   The  Borrowers shall make each  payment  of
          principal of and interest on its Borrowings and of fees
          hereunder by 11:00 a.m. on the date due, in immediately
          available   funds  in  Birmingham,  Alabama,   to   the
          Administrative  Agent  at  its  Notice  Address.    The
          Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to  each
          Lender its Proportionate Share of each such payment.
          
                (b)   If a payment of principal, interest or fees
          is  due  on a day that is not a Business Day, the  date
          for  the  payment  shall be extended to  the  following
          Business Day, except that if the following Business Day
          falls  in  another  calendar month, the  date  for  the
          payment of a Loan shall be the preceding Business  Day.
          If  the date for a payment of principal is so extended,
          or  is  extended  by  operation of  law  or  otherwise,
          interest  on  the  payment shall  be  payable  for  the
          extended time.
          
                (c)   All interest and fees shall be computed  on
          the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual
          number of days elapsed.
          
                (d)  Entries in records maintained by a Lender in
          accordance  with  its  usual  practice  evidencing  the
          Borrowers'  indebtedness  to  the  Lender  under   this
          Agreement and under the Notes, including the amounts of
          Loans,  applicable  Interest Periods  and  payments  of
          principal  and interest, shall be prima facie  evidence
          of  the existence and amounts of the obligations of the
          Borrowers  to  which  the entries relate.   A  Lender's
          failure to maintain such records, or any error therein,
          shall  not affect the Borrowers' obligations  to  repay
          the Loans in accordance with this Agreement.
          
1.18. Funding losses

          If

             - the Borrowers make a payment of principal of
               a  Loan before the last day of the Interest Period  for
               such  Loan  (including prepayment of Loans pursuant  to
               Section 9.4 (Illegal Loans), or

             - the Borrowers fail to borrow or prepay or to
               convert  a  Loan  after  the Administrative  Agent  has
               notified  any other Lender of the Borrowing, prepayment
               or  Conversion, then the Borrowers shall reimburse each
               Lender  on  demand for any resulting  loss  or  expense
               incurred   by  it,  including  any  loss  incurred   in
               obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third
               parties,  but excluding loss of margin for  the  period
               after  such payment or Conversion or failure to borrow,
               prepay  or  convert,  provided  that  the  Lender   has
               delivered  to  the  Borrowers a certificate  reasonably
               detailing  the  amount of the loss  or  expense,  which
               certificate  shall  be conclusive  in  the  absence  of
               manifest error.
               
     1.19. Pro-rata treatment

               Except  as  otherwise  expressly  provided  in   this
               Agreement,  or  to the extent otherwise required  due
               to a Lender's failure to fund,

               - each payment of a fee shall be allocated among the
               Lenders in their Proportionate Share for the relevant period,
               - each  payment  of principal of  a  Borrowing shall
               be   allocated  among  the  Lenders  in   their
               respective Proportionate Share of the unpaid  principal
               amounts of their Loans included in the Borrowing, and
               - each payment of interest on a Borrowing shall
               be  allocated  among  the Lenders in  their  respective
               Proportionate  Share  of  the amounts  of  accrued  and
               unpaid   interest  on  their  Loans  included  in   the
               Borrowing.
               
               
               
     1.20. Whole dollars

                In  computing the amounts of the Lenders' Loans to  be
          included in a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may  round
          each  Lender's Loan to the next higher or lower whole dollar
          amount.
          
          
II.  BORROWINGS AND CONVERSION PROCEDURES

     2.1. Borrowing Notices

                    (a)  The Borrowers shall notify the Administrative
               Agent  (a  "Borrowing Notice") by 1:00 p.m., Birmingham
               time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding a
               Eurodollar Borrowing and by 1:00 p.m., Birmingham time,

               Borrowing.
               
                     (b)  A Borrowing Notice shall be in substantially
               the form of Exhibit C and shall specify:
               
                               1.   the aggregate principal amount  of
                    the Borrowing,

                           2.     whether  the  Borrowing  is   a
               Eurodollar Loan or a Base Rate Loan,
               
                           3.     the  Interest  Period   for   a
               Eurodollar  Borrowing  (which  shall  not   extend
               beyond the Maturity Date),
               
                          4.    the  Borrowers'  account  at  the
               Administrative Agent to which the proceeds of  the
               Borrowing are to be deposited, and
               
                          5.    whether the Borrowing  is  to  be
               utilized  for  a  particular  Development  Project
               subject to a Mortgage.
               
2.2. Funding of Loans

           The  Administrative Agent shall promptly  notify  each
     Lender  of the contents of each Borrowing Notice and of  the
     principal amount of the Lender's Loan to be included in  the
     Borrowing.
     
           Not later than 12 p.m. on the day of a Borrowing, each
     Lender  shall make available the full amount of its Loan  to
     be included in the Borrowing, in immediately available funds
     in  Birmingham, to the Administrative Agent  at  its  Notice
     Address.
     
           Unless  the  Administrative Agent determines  that  an
     applicable  condition specified in Section 3  has  not  been
     satisfied,  the  Administrative Agent shall make  the  funds
     received  from  the  Lenders pursuant to  this  Section  2.2
     available  to  the  Borrowers at the Administrative  Agent's
     Notice Address by 2 p.m. on such day for a Borrowing.
     
2.3. Lender's failure to fund

           Unless  a  Lender  notifies the  Administrative  Agent
     before  the  date of a Borrowing (whether for  a  Eurodollar
     Borrowing,  a  draw under a Letter of Credit  or  any  other
     Borrowing available hereunder) that the Lender will not make
     available to the Administrative Agent the full amount of its
     Loan  to  be  included in the Borrowing, the  Administrative
     Agent  may  assume  that  the Lender's  Loan  will  be  made
     available  to  the Administrative Agent on the  day  of  the
     Borrowing and may, in reliance on that assumption, make  the
     full amount of the Loan available to the Borrowers.
     
           If the Administrative Agent makes the full amount of a
     Lender's  Loan  available to the Borrowers, and  the  Lender
     does not make available to the Administrative Agent some  or
     all  of the Loan (the "Unfunded Amount") by the date of  the
     Borrowing,  then  the  Lender shall pay  the  Administrative
     Agent  on demand interest at the Federal Funds Rate  on  the
     Unfunded  Amount  from the date of the Borrowing  until  the
     Lender   makes   the  Unfunded  Amount  available   to   the
       Administrative Agent or the Borrowers repay the Loan.
                                 
           If  a Lender does not make the full amount of its Loan
     included  in  a  Borrowing available to  the  Administrative
     Agent  by  the  third Business Day after  the  date  of  the
     Borrowing,   the   Borrowers   shall,   promptly   on    the
     Administrative Agent's demand, repay the full amount of such
     Loan  to  the  Administrative Agent, together  with  accrued
     interest  at the interest rate for the Loans comprising  the
     Borrowing.
           Nothing in this Section 2.3 shall relieve a Lender  of
     the  obligation  to  make  the  full  amount  of  its  Loans
     available to the Administrative Agent.

2.4. Conversions

          The Borrowers may at any time at the end of an Interest
     Period,  if  they  are  not in Default,  convert  the  Loans
     bearing  interest at the Eurodollar Rate into new Loans  for
     an   additional   Interest  Period  (a   "Conversion").    A
     Conversion  shall  convert each Loan in a Borrowing  in  the
     same  proportion.  Since each Loan in a Borrowing  shall  be
     converted  in the same proportions, Conversion  shall  refer
     equally to Conversion of Loans and Conversion of Borrowings.
     
           A  Borrower may initiate a Conversion by notifying the
     Administrative Agent (a "Conversion Notice") not later  than
     1:00  p.m.  on the third Business Day before the  Conversion
     Date.
     
           The  Administrative Agent shall promptly  notify  each
     Lender of the contents of each Conversion Notice and of  the
     Lender's Loans that will result from the Conversion.
     
           A Conversion Notice shall be in substantially the form
     of Exhibit D and shall:
     
        - state the Conversion Date,
                                 
        - identify each then outstanding Borrowing that
          is to be converted,
        - state  the aggregate unpaid principal amount
          of the Loans in such outstanding Borrowings, and
        - state  the  principal  amount  and  Interest
          Period  (which  shall  not extend beyond  the  Maturity
          Date)  of  each  Borrowing into which such  outstanding
          Borrowings are to be converted.

           Each Borrowing resulting from a Conversion must, as to
     amount and Interest Period, conform to the requirements  for
     a  Borrowing comprised of Loans made on such date (as if the
     Loans  to  be converted had been prepaid, and the new  Loans
     made, on the Conversion Date), and a Conversion Notice shall
     be  effective solely as to the resulting Borrowings that  do
     so  conform.   If  a  Conversion Notice purports  to  or  is
     effective  to convert only part of the Borrowings  specified
     in  the  Conversion  Notice, the  remaining  parts  of  such
     Borrowings  shall  on the Conversion date  automatically  be
     converted  into a single Base Rate Borrowing.  The Borrowers
     shall  be  liable to the Lenders for any funding  losses  in
     accordance  with Section 1.18 on any portion of a  Borrowing
     not converted.
     
           A  Conversion of a Loan must satisfy the conditions in
     Section 3.2 for the making of a Loan.
     
           If part or all of a Loan is not otherwise converted by
     the  last day of its Interest Period, it shall automatically
     be  converted on the last day of its Interest Period into  a
     Base Rate Loan.
     
2.5. Defective notices

               The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify a Lender
          or the Borrowers if the Administrative Agent believes that a
          notice  or other document given to the Administrative  Agent
          by  a  party  under  Section 1 or this Section  2  fails  to
          conform to the requirements of such Section.

               evidence  of appropriate zoning, environmental reports,
               surveys,   evidence  of  insurance   and   such   other

               of  the Borrowers contained in this Agreement are  true
               on  the  date of this Agreement, substantially  in  the
               form of Exhibit J; and
               
                         - such  other  documents as the Administrative
               Agent   reasonably  requests  and  deems   satisfactory
               relating to each Borrower's and Subsidiary's existence,
               the  corporate  authority  for  and  validity  of  this
               Agreement, the Mortgages, each Subsidiary Guaranty  and
               any other relevant matter.
               
                The  Administrative  Agent shall promptly  notify  the
          Borrowers  and  the  Lenders  when  this  Agreement  becomes
          effective,  and such notice shall be conclusive and  binding
          on all parties.

               - each  Borrower represents that  no  material
     adverse change in its financial condition or results of
     operations has occurred;
     
               - immediately before and after the  Borrowing,
     no Default will have occurred and be continuing;
     
               - the  representations and warranties  of  the
     Borrowers contained in this Agreement are true  on  and
     as of the date of the Borrowing with the same effect as
     if  made  on and as of such date (except to the  extent
     such representations and warranties expressly relate to
     an earlier date);
     
               - the Administrative Agent receives, with  the

     each Borrowing on a Development Project;

                - all  licenses,  permits  and  approvals  of

                - each   request  for  a  Borrowing   for   a

                - there   shall  have  occurred  no  material
     violation of any applicable laws, ordinances, rules  or

     way  of fees, fines, costs, expenses, curative work  or
     other  potential  loss  or  expense  to  the  Borrowers
     exceeding  the  sum of $100,000.00 or $500,000  in  the
     aggregate for multiple violations;
     
                - there   shall  be  no  action,   suits   or

     warranty  by  the  Borrowers  that,  on  the  date  of   the
     Borrowing, the conditions set forth in this Section 3.2  are
     satisfied.
     
3.3. Conditions to Maintaining Loans

                (a)   The  Administrative Agent  shall  have  the
          right,  at  any time and from time to time, to  require
          the  Borrowers  to furnish to the Administrative  Agent
          current   financial  information,  Inspection  Reports,
          and/or environmental studies of any one or more of  the
          Mortgaged Properties if, in the unrestricted discretion
          of  the Administrative Agent, such Mortgaged Properties
          shall have declined in value in any material amount  or
          may  be  in  violation of any applicable  Environmental
          Laws.   The  Borrowers shall have the right to  require
          the   Administrative   Agent  to   commission   updated
          appraisals,  and  the Administrative Agent  shall  also
          have  the  right  to  require  updated  appraisals   if
          required  by  law  or  banking regulations.   Any  such
          appraisals and environmental studies must be  in  form,
          content    and   conclusion   satisfactory    to    the
          Administrative  Agent,  subject to  the  Administrative
          Agent's approval in all respects, and must be made by a
          qualified,    licensed   professional   selected    and
          commissioned by the Administrative Agent.  If any  such
          current  financial  information, updated  appraisal  or
          environmental study should reflect a decline in  value,
          the  Borrowing Base shall be reduced accordingly;  and,
          if the then outstanding Loans should exceed the reduced
          Borrowing   Base,  the  Borrowers  shall  be  obligated
          immediately  to  reduce  the Loans  to  an  amount  not
          exceeding  the applicable reduced Borrowing  Base.   If
          any  such  appraisal  or current financial  information
          should  reflect  an increase in value,  the  applicable
          Borrowing  Base shall be increased accordingly  to  the
          extent appropriate.
          
                (b)   For  each Development Project, the Borrower
          shall  provide to the Administrative Agent a  quarterly
          statement  of  occupancy, no later than  the  15th  day
          after  the  end  of  each quarter for  the  immediately
          preceding calendar quarter.
          
               (c)  If any environmental study should reflect the
          necessity  or desirability for action to  be  taken  to
          prevent  or cure the violation or prospective violation
          of  applicable Environmental Laws, the Borrowers shall,
          at  their  sole cost and expense, immediately undertake
          such   action   and   diligently  prosecute   same   to
          conclusion.

                (d)  Although the Administrative Agent shall have
          the   right   to   require  as  many   appraisals   and
          environmental surveys as it shall elect with respect to
          each   Mortgaged  Property,  the  Borrowers  shall   be
          obligated to pay for only one (1) appraisal and one (1)
          environmental  survey, with respect to  each  Mortgaged
          Property  during  any one (1) consecutive  twelve  (12)
          month   period.   Any  appraisals  requested   by   the
          Borrowers  pursuant  to  Section  3.3(a)  shall  be  at
          Borrowers'  sole  expense and shall  be  excluded  from
          consideration in determining whether the Borrowers  are
          obligated  to  pay  the costs of additional  appraisals
          required  by  the  Administrative Agent.   Any  initial
          appraisals and environmental studies furnished  to  the
          Administrative Agent in connection with each  Mortgaged
          Property  shall also be excluded from consideration  in
          determining whether Borrowers are obligated to pay  the
          cost  of additional appraisals or environmental studies
          for any such Property.
          
3.4. Conditions to Release of Mortgaged Property

                (a)   The privilege is given and reserved so that
          the  Borrowers  may obtain the release of  a  Mortgaged
          Property  from the lien of a Mortgage upon  payment  to
          the  Administrative  Agent, for  application  upon  the
          Loan,  a  principal amount equal to the amount  of  the
          applicable  Advance  Rate for such Mortgaged  Property,
          together  with all interest accrued upon  such  amount,
          and  all  out-of-pocket expenses and advances then  due
          and  owing  to  the Administrative Agent in  connection
          with the Loans.
                (b)   The  release  privilege herein  granted  is
          conditioned  upon  (1) there being no Default  existing
          (a)  at the time any such release is requested, or  (b)
          on  the  date the release is to be delivered,  (2)  the
          release  not  causing  a  Default,  and  (3)  continued
          compliance with the Borrowing Base upon the release  of
          the subject Mortgaged Property.
                (c)  Any Apartment Community remaining subject to
          a  Mortgage  shall  not be dependent on  the  Mortgaged
          Property   being   released  for   access,   utilities,
          amenities or any other matter.

                (d)  Any such requested release shall be made  at
          the sole cost and expense of the Borrowers.
          
3.5. Conditions to Addition of Property

           The  Borrowers  shall be entitled to  offer  Apartment
     Communities which, if approved by Two-Thirds of the Lenders,
     shall,  upon satisfaction of the following conditions,  then
     be  deemed  to constitute Mortgaged Properties and available
     for use in determining the Borrowing Base:
     
                (a)  For Apartment Communities to be added to the
          Borrowing  Base as either a Stabilized  Property  or  a
          Development Project, the Borrower shall deliver to  the
          Administrative  Agent the following, all  in  form  and
          content satisfactory to the Administrative Agent:
          
                          1.    Evidence that the entity  holding
               title  to  the  Apartment Community  is  either  a
               Borrower or a Subsidiary;
               
                          2.   an environmental report or reports
               evidencing  that  the Apartment  Community  is  in
               material  compliance with all Environmental  Laws,
               using   the   standard   generally   applied    by
               sophisticated  commercial lenders  experienced  in
               real estate financing;

                          3.    evidence of hazard and  liability
               insurance as required herein;

               guidelines  of  the  Federal Institutions  Reform,
               Recovery and Enforcement Act;

               thirty  (30)  days' prior written  notice  to  the
               Administrative Agent.  The Borrower  will  deliver
               (or  cause  to be delivered) to the Administrative
               Agent   original  or  certified  copies   of   the
               insurance  policies, or satisfactory  certificates
               of  insurance, and, as often as the Administrative
               Agent  may  reasonably  request,  a  report  of  a
               reputable  insurance broker with respect  to  such
               insurance.   At  the option of the  Borrower,  the
               Borrower  may  maintain  the  insurance  coverages
               required  by this Section 5, pursuant to so-called
               "blanket  insurance policies", in which event  the
               Borrower  shall,  from  time  to  time,  upon  the
               Administrative  Agent's request,  furnish  to  the
               Administrative   Agent   certificates   from   the
               respective   insurance   companies    (or    their
               authorized  agents) setting forth  the  types  and
               amounts   of   insurance  being  maintained,   any
               applicable  deductible provisions, and such  other
               information  as  the  Administrative   Agent   may
               require   (including,  without   limitation,   the
               effective  dates of any such insurance),  together
               with   copies   of  all  such  blanket   insurance
               policies.
               
5.3. Compliance with laws

     The Borrower shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary to,
     comply  in  all material respects with all applicable  laws,
     ordinances,   rules,   regulations   and   requirements   of
     governmental  authorities, except  where  the  necessity  of
     compliance   is  contested  in  good  faith  by  appropriate
     proceedings.
     
5.4. Books and records; payment of Taxes

     The  Borrower shall keep proper books and  records  in

     While a Default is continuing, representatives of any Lender
     may inspect the Borrower's relevant books and records at any
     reasonable time.
     
           The  Borrower shall pay and discharge,  at  or  before
     maturity,  all  their respective material  Tax  liabilities,
     except   for   liabilities  contested  in  good   faith   by
     appropriate proceedings and as to which appropriate reserves
     in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
     have been established.

5.5. Notice of Defaults

     The Borrower shall, within five Business Days of a 
     senior  officer  of the Borrower obtaining  knowledge  of  a
     continuing  Default, deliver to the Administrative  Agent  a
     certificate  of  the Certifying Officer  setting  forth  the
     details of the Default and the action the Borrower is taking
     or proposes to take with respect to the Default.
     
5.6. ERISA events

          If a member of the Controlled Group

                   -  gives  or is required to give notice to  the

          administrator  of  a  Pension  Plan  has  given  or  is
          required to give notice of such reportable event,

                   -   receives  notice  of  complete  or  partial
          Withdrawal Liability under Title IV of ERISA,

                   -  receives notice from the PBGC under Title IV
          of ERISA of an intent to terminate or appoint a trustee
          to administer a Pension Plan, or

                   - knows that a Pension Plan is terminated or in
          reorganization,  then the Borrower  shall  within  five
          Business  Days  deliver a copy of  the  notice  to  the
          Administrative Agent.

5.7. Use of proceeds

           The  Borrower  shall use Loan proceeds  only  for  its
     general corporate purposes.  The Borrower shall not use  any

     T, U or X of the Federal Reserve Board.

5.8. Maintenance of existence; merger; sale of assets

           The  Borrower shall keep in full force and effect  its
     corporate or partnership existence, as the case may be,  and
     its rights, privileges and franchises necessary or desirable
     in   the  normal  conduct  of  business,  provided  that   a
     Subsidiary  of a Borrower may merge or consolidate  with  or
     into the Borrower (but only if the Borrower is the surviving
     entity)  or a Subsidiary of the Borrower.  A Borrower  shall
     not  (i)  consolidate or merge with or into  another  Person
     unless  the Borrower is the surviving entity and no  Default
     by the Borrower exists immediately thereafter, or (ii) sell,
     lease or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of  its
     assets  to any other Person, except for the distribution  of
     ordinary  dividends  to shareholders  and  distributions  to
     partners.   As  used herein "substantially all"  shall  mean
     more than thirty percent (30%) of the total assets.
     
5.9. Right of inspection

           The Borrower shall permit any Person designated by the
     Administrative  Agent  to  visit  and  inspect  any  of  the
     properties,  corporate books and financial reports  of  each
     Borrower  and  all Subsidiaries and to discuss its  affairs,
     finances  and accounts with its principal officers,  at  all
     such  reasonable times during normal business hours  and  as
     often as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request.

5.10. Environmental laws

           The Borrower shall maintain at all times all Apartment
     Communities in compliance with all Environmental  Laws,  and
     immediately  notify the Administrative Agent of any  notice,
     action,  lien or similar action alleging either the location
     of   any  Hazardous  Substances  or  the  violation  of  any
     Environmental  Laws  or any release of Hazardous  Substances
     with respect to any Apartment Communities or operations.

5.11. Notice of adverse change in assets

           At  the  time of either Borrower's first knowledge  or
     notice,   such   Borrower  shall  immediately   notify   the
     Administrative Agent of any information that  may  adversely
     affect in any material manner the assets of either Borrower,
     including, but not limited to, the value or marketability of
     any Mortgaged Properties.
     
5.12. Indemnification

           (a) General.  The Borrower shall defend, indemnify and
     hold the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders harmless
     from and against any and all loss, costs, damage or expense,
     of  every  kind  and nature, including, without  limitation,
     reasonable   attorneys'   fees   and   costs,   which    the
     Administrative  Agent and the other Lenders could  or  might
     incur  by reason of any violation of any Environmental  Laws
     by either Borrower, any Subsidiary or by any predecessors or
     successors   to  title  to  any  Mortgaged  Property.    The
     indemnification granted herein shall run only to the benefit
     of  the  Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall  not
     give  any  rights  of indemnification to any  successors  in
     title.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrowers  shall
     have no obligation to indemnify the Administrative Agent and
     the  other Lenders for liability resulting solely  from  the
     gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative
     Agent, or any of the other Lenders, as determined in a final
     non-appealable order by a court of competent jurisdiction.
     
           (b)  Letter of Credit.  The Borrowers hereby agree  to
     protect,  indemnify,  pay and save the Administrative  Agent
     and  the  Lenders  harmless from and  against  any  and  all
     claims,   demands,  liabilities,  damages,  losses,   costs,
     charges  and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'  fees
     and disbursements) which the Administrative Agent and/or the
     Lenders  may incur or be subject to as a result of  (i)  the
     issuance of the Letters of Credit, other than to the  extent
     of  the bad faith, gross negligence or wilful misconduct  of
     the  Administrative  Agent and/or the Lenders  or  (ii)  the
     failure of the Administrative Agent to honor a drawing under
     any  Letter  of Credit as a result of any act  or  omission,
     whether  rightful or wrongful, of any present or  future  de
     jure  or  de  facto  government  or  governmental  authority
     (collectively,  "Governmental  Acts"),  other  than  to  the
     extent   of  the  bad  faith,  gross  negligence  or  wilful
     misconduct  of  the Administrative Agent.   As  between  the
     Borrowers and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders,  the
     Borrowers assume all risks of the acts and omissions of  any
     beneficiary  with  respect to its use,  or  misuse  of,  the
     Letters  of Credit issued by the Administrative  Agent.   In
     furtherance  and  not in limitation of  the  foregoing,  the
     Administrative   Agent  and  the  Lenders   shall   not   be
     responsible   (i)  for  the  form,  validity,   sufficiency,
          accuracy,  genuineness  or  legal  effect  of  any  document
          submitted  by  any party in connection with the  application
          for  and  issuance  of such Letters of Credit,  even  if  it
          should  in fact prove to be in any or all respects  invalid,
          insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) for the
          validity or insufficiency of any instrument transferring  or
          assigning  or  purporting to transfer  or  assign  any  such
          Letter  of  Credit or the rights or benefits  thereunder  or
          proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be
          invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) for failure  of
          the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit to comply fully
          with  conditions required in order to draw upon such  Letter
          of  Credit,  other than as a result of the bad faith,  gross
          negligence or wilful misconduct of the Administrative Agent;
          (iv)  for  errors,  omissions, interruptions  or  delays  in
          transmission  or  delivery of any message, by  mail,  cable,
          telegraph,  telex,  facsimile  transmission,  or  otherwise,
          unless  the  result  of the bad faith, gross  negligence  or
          wilful  misconduct  of  the Administrative  Agent;  (v)  for
          errors in interpretation of any technical terms, unless  the
          result   of  the  bad  faith,  gross  negligence  or  wilful
          misconduct of the Administrative Agent; (vi) for any loss or
          delay  in  the  transmission or otherwise of  any  documents
          required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of
          Credit   or   of  the  proceeds  thereof;  (vii)   for   the
          misapplication  by  the beneficiary of any  such  Letter  of
          Credit  of the proceeds of such Letter of Credit; and (viii)
          for  any  consequence arising from causes beyond the control
          of  the Administrative Agent, including any Government Acts,
          in  each  case  other than to the extent of the  bad  faith,
          gross  negligence or wilful misconduct of the Administrative
          Agent.   None of the above shall affect, impair  or  prevent
          the  vesting of the Administrative Agent's rights and powers
          hereunder.   In  furtherance and not in  limitation  of  the
          specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action  taken
          or   omitted  by  the  Administrative  Agent  under  or   in
          connection with the Letters of Credit issued by  it  or  the
          related  certificates, if taken or omitted  in  good  faith,
          shall  not  put the Administrative Agent under any resulting
          liability  to  the Borrowers provided that,  notwithstanding
          anything   in   the   foregoing   to   the   contrary,   the
          Administrative Agent will be liable to the Borrowers for any
          damages  suffered  by  the Borrowers  as  a  result  of  the
          Administrative  Agent's grossly negligent or wilful  failure
          to  pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to
          it  of a sight draft and certificates strictly in compliance
          with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit.

VI.  Negative Covenants of Borrowers

                Each  Borrower covenants and agrees that, at all times

                    it contained in Section 5 or Section 6; or
                    
                (d)  either Borrower fails to observe or perform a
               covenant  or  agreement made by it  in  this  Agreement
               (other than those referred to in Section 7.1(a), 7.1(b)
               or  7.1(c)  above) for 30 days after the Administrative
               Agent notifies the Borrower of such failure; or

               other agreement to which either Borrower is a party  or

               the   Borrower's   obligations  or   exposure   exceeds
               $500,000,  and  if  the effect of such  default  is  to
               accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness, or if the
               effect  of such default is to permit the holder thereof
               to  cause such indebtedness to become due prior to  its
               stated  maturity; provided, however, if the  amount  in
               default  is  less than $1,000,000 and no other  default
               exists  under  any  other agreement described  in  this

               good  faith contesting any default under this paragraph
               to  the  reasonable satisfaction of the  Administrative
               Agent, it shall not be a Default hereunder; or

          capital stock of MAAC, not exceeding, in the aggregate,
          as  to  all such exchanges, transfers of not more  than

          Lenders,   which  consent  shall  not  be  unreasonably
          withheld, Mid-America or any Subsidiary granting to the
          Administrative  Agent a Mortgage  shall  sell,  assign,
          transfer,  convey,  lease with an option  to  purchase,

          in  any  Mortgaged Property or any portion thereof,  or
          permit  the  same  to  be sold, assigned,  transferred,
          conveyed,   contracted  for  or  encumbered;  provided,
          however, the entering of either a contract of  sale  or
          option to purchase shall not be a default hereunder  so
          long  as  such contract of sale or option  to  purchase
          requires the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in
          Section 3.4 above; and provided further, however,  that
          the  encumbrance  of  any  Mortgaged  Property  by  any
          mechanic's lien claim shall not be deemed to constitute
          an  Event  of  Default  so long  as  a  Borrower  shall
          promptly  notify  the  Administrative  Agent  of   such
          mechanic's lien claim, and shall diligently and in good
          faith  contest (or cause to be contested) the  same  by
          appropriate   proceedings  and  shall  establish   such
          reserves  with  respect thereto as  the  Administrative
          Agent shall specify; or
          
               (n)  MAAC fails to maintain its qualification as a
          real estate investment trust under the Code.

          notify the Borrowers that
                        -   the   Borrowers'  Rights  are   terminated,
               whereupon such Borrowing Rights shall terminate, or
                        -   all  the  Borrowers'  Loans,  with  accrued
               interest,  and  all  other  amounts  payable   by   the
               Borrowers under this Agreement, are immediately due and
               payable, whereupon all such Loans, accrued interest and
               other  amounts  payable under this Agreement  shall  be
               immediately  due  and payable by the Borrowers  without
               presentment,  demand, protest or other  notice  of  any
               kind,  all of which the Borrowers waive, provided  that
               if  the  Default is one described in Section 7.1(f)  or
               7.1(g),  then without notice to the Borrowers or  other
               act  by  the Administrative Agent or Two-Thirds of  the
               Lenders,   the   Borrowers'  Borrowing   Rights   shall
               immediately  terminate,  and the  Loans,  with  accrued
               interest,   and  other  amounts  payable   under   this
               Agreement, shall become immediately due and payable  by
               the  Borrowers without presentment, demand, protest  or
               other  notice  of any kind, all of which the  Borrowers
               waive,  and the Administrative Agent may and shall,  at
               the  request of Two-Thirds of the Lenders, exercise all
               rights and remedies available to it hereunder and under
               applicable law or in equity.
               
     7.3. Notice of Default

                On  the request of a Lender, the Administrative  Agent
          shall promptly give the notice referred to in Section 7.1(d)
          and  shall promptly notify all the Lenders that such  notice
          has been given.
          
          
          
VIII. The Administrative Agent

     8.1. Appointment and authorization

                Each  Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative
          Agent  to  take such action as agent on the Lender's  behalf
          and   to   exercise  such  powers  as  are  given   to   the
          Administrative Agent under this Agreement, together with all
          powers reasonably incidental thereto.
          
     8.2. Other conduct

              The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates
                                   
                        -  shall have the same rights and powers  under
               this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise  or
               refrain  from  exercising such  rights  and  powers  as
               though it were not the Administrative Agent and
               
                        -  may accept deposits from, lend money to  and
               generally  engage  in  any kind of  business  with  the
               Borrowers  or  their Affiliates as if it were  not  the
               Administrative Agent.
               
     8.3. Scope of obligations

           The obligations of the Administrative Agent under this
     Agreement  are  only  those  expressly  set  forth   herein.

     Administrative  Agent  shall not be  required  to  take  any
     action  with  respect  to  a  Default  except  as  expressly
     provided  in  Section  7.   The Administrative  Agent  shall
     administer the Loans and perform its duties hereunder  using
     the same degree of care it uses in the administration of its
     own loans of similar amount and structure.
     
8.4. Consultation with experts

            The  Administrative  Agent  may  consult  with  legal
     counsel,  independent public accountants and  other  experts
     selected by the Administrative Agent and shall not be liable
     for  any  action taken or omitted to be taken by it in  good
     faith  in  accordance  with  the  advice  of  such  counsel,
     accountants or experts.

8.5. Liability of Administrative Agent

           Neither  the  Administrative  Agent  nor  any  of  its
     directors, officers, agents, or employees shall be
                   - liable  for any action it takes or does  not
          take  in  connection with this Agreement (i)  with  the
          consent or at the request of Two-Thirds of the Lenders,
          unless the consent or request of all of the Lenders  is
          expressly  required by this Agreement, or (ii)  in  the
          absence   of  its  own  gross  negligence  or   willful
          misconduct, or
                   - responsible for or have a duty to ascertain,
          inquire  into or verify (i) any statement, warranty  or
          representation  made in connection with this  Agreement
          or  a  Borrowing,  (ii)  a  Borrower's  performance  or
          observance  of  any  covenant or agreement,  (iii)  the
          satisfaction of any condition in Section 3 (except  for
          the  receipt of items required to be delivered  to  the
          Administrative   Agent),   or   (iv)   the    validity,
          effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement  or  any
          other  instrument  or writing furnished  in  connection
          herewith.
          
           The Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability
     by acting in reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate,
     statement or other writing (which may be a bank wire, telex,
     telecopy  or  similar  writing) it believes  is  genuine  or
     signed by the proper parties.
     
8.6. Indemnification

           Each  Lender  shall,  ratably in accordance  with  its
     Commitment,  indemnify  the  Administrative  Agent  (to  the
     extent  not reimbursed by the Borrowers) against  any  cost,
     expense,  claim,  demand, action, loss or liability  (except
     such   as  result  from  the  Administrative  Agent's  gross
     negligence  or  willful misconduct) that the  Administrative
     Agent  may suffer or incur in connection with this Agreement
     or  any  action  the  Administrative Agent  takes  or  omits
     hereunder.
     
8.7. Successor Administrative Agent

           The  Administrative Agent may resign by giving  notice
          thereof  to  the Lenders and the Borrowers.  So long  as  no
          Default exists, the Administrative Agent may be removed upon
          the  request  of  the Borrowers.  Upon such  resignation  or
          removal,    the   Borrowers   may   appoint   a    successor
          Administrative Agent with the consent of Two-Thirds  of  the
          Lenders.  If the Borrowers are in Default, Two-Thirds of the
          Lenders  may appoint a successor Administrative  Agent.   If
          the  Administrative  Agent resigns  or  is  removed  and  no
          successor  Administrative Agent is so appointed and  accepts
          such   appointment  within  30  days  after  the   resigning
          Administrative Agent's notice of resignation or its removal,
          then  the resigning or removed Administrative Agent may,  on
          behalf   of   the   Lenders,  shall  appoint   a   successor
          Administrative Agent that is a commercial bank organized  or
          licensed  under the laws of the United States of America  or
          of  any  State  thereof  and having a combined  capital  and
          surplus   of  at  least  $100,000,000.   Upon  a   successor
          Administrative Agent's written acceptance of its appointment
          as  Administrative Agent, the successor Administrative Agent
          shall  succeed to and become vested with all the rights  and
          duties of the resigning or removed Administrative Agent, and
          the  resigning  or  removed Administrative  Agent  shall  be
          discharged from its duties and obligations as Administrative
          Agent.   After  the  Administrative Agent's  resignation  or
          removal, the provisions of this Section 8 shall continue  to
          inure to its benefit as to any action it took or omitted  to
          take while it was Administrative Agent.
          
     8.8. Fees

                The  Borrowers shall pay the Administrative Agent  for
          its  account such fees for its services under this Agreement
          as the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent may agree.

IX.  Change in circumstances

     9.1. Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements

                If  a Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the
          Borrowers that the Lender is or will be generally subject to
          Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements as a result of  which  the
          Lender  will incur additional costs on its Loans,  then  the
          Lender   shall,  to  the  extent  such  costs  are  actually
          incurred,  for each day from the later of the date  of  such
          notice  and the date on which the Lender becomes subject  to
          the  Eurocurrency  Reserve  Requirements,  be  entitled   to
          additional  interest on each Loan made by the  Lender  at  a
          rate per annum (rounded upward to the nearest .01%) equal to
          the  remainder  obtained by subtracting (i)  LIBOR  for  the
          Eurodollar Loan from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing such
          LIBOR  by  the excess of 100% over the Eurocurrency  Reserve
          Requirements.
          
               Such additional interest shall be payable in arrears to
          the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lender,  on
          each date interest is payable on the Loan.
          
                A  Lender  that gives a notice under this Section  9.1
          shall  promptly  withdraw  such  notice  by  notifying   the
          Administrative  Agent  and  the  Borrowers  if  Eurocurrency
          Reserve   Requirements  cease  to  apply  to   it   or   the
          circumstances giving rise to such notice otherwise cease  to
          exist.
          
     9.2. Increased cost or reduced return

                If any Regulatory Action (other than the imposition of
          Eurocurrency  Reserve  Requirement)  taken  after  the  date
          hereof
                        -  imposes,  modifies or deems  applicable  any
               reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against
               assets  of,  deposits with or for  the  account  of  or
               credit extended by a Lender or its Office,
                        -  imposes  on  a Lender or its Office  or  the
               London  interbank market any other condition  affecting
               the Lender's Eurodollar Loans, or
                        -  imposes,  modifies or deems  applicable  any
               standards  of  capital adequacy,  and  such  Regulatory
               Action will, in the Lender's judgment,
                        -  increase the cost to the Lender or Office of
               making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan,
                        - reduce the amount receivable by the Lender or
               Office  under this Agreement with respect to  any  such
               Eurodollar Loan, or
                        -  reduce  the  rate of return on the  Lender's
               capital as a consequence of its obligations under  this
               Agreement  (taking  into  consideration  the   Lender's
               policies  on capital adequacy) by an amount the  Lender
               deems  material, then the Lender shall promptly  notify
               the  Borrowers  and the Administrative  Agent  thereof,
               enclosing (i) a certificate of an officer of the Lender
               describing  the  Regulatory  Action  leading   to   the
               increased costs or reduction with, if possible, a  copy
               of  the  relevant  law, regulation,  interpretation  or
               guideline  and  (ii)  the Lender's calculation  setting
               forth  in  reasonable detail the dollar amount  of  the
               increased costs or reduction.
               
determination of amount

                In  calculating any amount payable under this  Section
          9.2,  a  Lender may use reasonable averaging and attribution
          methods.   A Lender's determination of the amount  shall  be
          conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
          
payment of compensation

                Subject to the following sentence, the Borrowers shall
          pay  a Lender within 30 days after receipt of a notice  from
          the  Lender  under  this Section 9.2 such  amounts  as  will
          compensate  the Lender for the increased costs or reduction.
          The  Borrowers  will not, however, be required  to  pay  the
          Lender  any  amount set forth in the notice that relates  to
          any  period prior to the 30th day before the date the Lender
          gives  the notice.  Each Lender agrees that it shall  notify
          the  Borrowers  immediately  upon  becoming  aware  of  such
          increased costs.
          
          
          
Base Rate election by Borrower

               If a Lender demands compensation under this Section 9.2
          with  respect to a Eurodollar Loan, then the Borrowers  may,
          on  at  least five Business Days' prior notice to the Lender
          and  the Administrative Agent, elect that, until the  Lender
          or  the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrowers that the
          circumstances giving rise to the demand for compensation  no
          longer  apply,  all  Loans  to  the  Borrowers  that   would
          otherwise  be made by the Lender as Eurodollar Loans,  shall
          be made instead as Loans at the Base Rate (on which interest
          and  principal shall be payable contemporaneously  with  the
          related Loans of the other Lenders).

     9.3. LIBOR unavailable or inadequate

                If  on  or  before the second Business Day  before  an
          Interest Period for a Borrowing
                       -  dollar deposits in the applicable amounts are
               not  being offered to the Administrative Agent  in  the
               relevant market for the Interest Period, or

suspension of obligation to make Loans

                       -    Two-Thirds  of  the  Lenders   advise   the
               Administrative Agent that the LIBOR will not adequately
               and  fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding
               their   Loans  for  the  Interest  Period,   then   the
               Administrative   Agent  shall   promptly   notify   the
               Borrowers  and  the  Lenders  thereof,  whereupon   the
               obligations   of  the  Lenders  to  make,   or   permit
               Conversion  of  Loans into, Eurodollar Loans  shall  be
               suspended, and any subsequent request by the  Borrowers
               for  a  Eurodollar  Loan  or  for  Conversion  into   a
               Eurodollar Loan shall be deemed to be a request for, or
               for  Conversion  into, a Loan bearing interest  at  the
               Base Rate.
               
suspension after Borrowing Notice given

                          If the Lenders' obligations to make Loans is
               suspended  pursuant  to  this  Section  9.3  after  the
               Borrowers  give the Borrowing Notice for the  Borrowing
               that  includes  such Loans, then unless  the  Borrowers
               notify  the Administrative Agent at least one  Business
               Day   before  the  date  of  such  Borrowing  that  the
               Borrowers  elect  not  to  borrow  on  such  date,  the
               Borrowing  shall instead accrue interest  at  the  Base
               Rate.
               
     9.4. Illegal Loans

                If,  after  the date of this Agreement, any Regulatory
          Action  makes it unlawful or impossible for a Lender or  its
          Office  to make, maintain or fund its Eurodollar Loans,  and
          the  Lender so notifies the Administrative Agent,  then  the
          Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the other Lenders
          and the Borrowers, whereupon the obligation of the Lender to
          make  or  permit Conversions into Eurodollar Loans shall  be
          suspended.
          
prepayment of illegal Loans

                If  a  Lender  determines that  it  may  not  lawfully
          continue to maintain an outstanding Eurodollar Loan  to  the
          Borrowers  to  the  end of the Eurodollar Loan's  applicable
          Interest  Period  and so specifies in the  notice  it  gives
          pursuant to this Section 9.4, the Administrative Agent shall
          so notify the Borrowers, and the Borrowers shall immediately
          prepay in full the unpaid principal amount of the Eurodollar
          Loan  with accrued interest.  As each such Loan is  prepaid,
          the  Lender shall make a Loan bearing interest at  the  Base
          Rate  to  the  Borrower  in an equal principal  amount  with
          interest  and principal payable contemporaneously  with  the
          related Loans of the other Lenders.

new Loans made as Base Rate Loans

                If the obligation of a Lender to make Eurodollar Loans
          is  suspended pursuant to this Section 9.4, then  until  the
          Lender  or  the Administrative Agent notifies the  Borrowers
          that  the  circumstances giving rise to  the  suspension  no
          longer apply, all Loans that would otherwise be made by  the
          Lender  as Eurodollar Loans shall be made instead  as  Loans
          accruing  interest at the Base Rate (on which  interest  and
          principal  shall  be  payable  contemporaneously  with   the
          related Loans of the other Lenders).

     9.5. Termination of suspension

                When the circumstances giving rise to a suspension  of
          the obligation to make Eurodollar Loans under Section 9.3 or
          Section 9.4 no longer exist, the Administrative Agent  shall
          so  notify  the  Borrowers and the  Lenders,  whereupon  the
          suspension shall terminate.

     9.6. Taxes on payments

                     (a)   Each  Lender shall deliver to each  of  the
              Borrowers and to the Administrative Agent:
                                   
                        -  no  more  than  30 days after  the  date  it
               becomes  a  Lender,  either  a  statement  that  it  is
               incorporated in the United States of America or, if  it
               is  not so incorporated, two duly completed copies  of,
               as applicable, a United States Internal Revenue Service
               Form  1001  or  Form  4224 (including  a  Form  W-9  or
               equivalent) promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code
               (each,  as  applicable to any Person and together  with
               any  successor form, a "Tax Form") indicating that  the
               Lender  is  entitled  to receive  payments  under  this
               Agreement  without deduction or withholding  of  United
               States  federal  income  Taxes  as  permitted  by   the
               Internal Revenue Code,

                        -  such extensions or renewals of the Tax  Form
               as  applicable because of expiration of the Tax Form or
               as  the  Borrowers reasonably request (but only to  the
               extent  the  Lender  determines that  it  may  properly
               effect such extensions or renewals under applicable Tax
               treaties, laws, regulations and directives), and
               
                        -  if a Loan is transferred to an Affiliate  of
               the Lender, a new Tax Form for the Affiliate.
               
               The  Borrowers and the Administrative  Agent may each
               rely on a Tax Form in its possession until the 
               earlier  of  the  expiration date of the  Tax  Form  or
               receipt  of  any revised or successor form pursuant  to
               this Section 9.6.
               
                     (b)   If  a  Tax imposed by the United States  of
               America,   or  any  political  subdivision  or   taxing
               authority  thereof, subjects a Lender or its Office  to
          any  deduction  or withholding on a payment  (including
          fees)  on its Loans to the Borrowers, the Lender  shall
          promptly  notify the Borrowers of the Tax, enclosing  a
          copy   of   the   relevant   statute,   regulation   or
          interpretation  requiring the deduction or  withholding
          and  setting  forth in reasonable detail  the  Lender's
          calculation of the dollar amount of the Tax.  Within 30
          days  after it receives the notice (or a longer  period
          that  complies with the law relating to the Tax without
          subjecting  the  Lender  to  additional  payments  with
          respect  to the Tax), the Borrowers shall, as requested
          by the Lender in the notice,
          
                  -   increase the amount of the payment  so  that
          the  Lender will receive a net amount (after  deduction
          of the Tax) equal to the amount due hereunder,
                  -    pay  the  Tax  to  the  appropriate  taxing
          authority for the Lender's account, and
                  -   as  promptly  as possible, send  the  Lender
          evidence showing payment of the Tax, together with  any
          additional  documentary evidence the Lender  reasonably
          requests.

            The  Borrowers  shall  indemnify  a  Lender  for  any
     incremental  Taxes, interest or penalties  that  may  become
     payable as a result of the Borrowers' failure to comply with
     this Section 9.6.

                (c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  in
          this  Section 9.6, the Borrowers shall not be  required
          to  make  any  payment to a Lender or taxing  authority
          under this Section 9.6 as a result of any deduction  or
          withholding or incremental Tax, interest or penalty

                   -  that  is  caused by the Lender's failure  or
          inability to furnish the Borrowers with a Tax Form,  or
          an  extension  or  renewal thereof,  pursuant  to  this
          Section  9.6  unless such failure or inability  is  the
          result of a change in an applicable law, regulation  or
          Tax  treaty  or  in  the interpretation  thereof  by  a
          regulatory authority that becomes effective  after  the
          date of this Agreement, or
          
                   -  for  any period for which the Lender or  its
          applicable  Office  has furnished a  Tax  Form  to  the
          Borrowers that incorrectly indicates that the Lender or
          its  applicable Office is not subject to such deduction
          or withholding.

9.7. Change of Office

           A  Lender shall designate a different Office  for  its
     Loans  if such designation will avoid the need for giving  a
     notice pursuant to Section 9.4 with respect to suspension of
     Loans,  or  reduce the amount of compensation under  Section
     9.2  (Increased  cost or reduced return),  or  Section  9.6,
     (Taxes on payments), and will not, in the Lender's judgment,
     be disadvantageous to the Lender.
     
9.8. Replacement of Lender

     If

                  -  the obligation of a Lender to make Eurodollar
          Loans is suspended under Section 9.4 (Illegal Loans),

                  -  a  Lender  demands compensation  or  payment
               under  Section 9.2 (Increased cost or reduced  return),
               or Section 9.6 (Taxes on payments), or

                  -  a  Lender's senior unsecured debt  is  rated
               lower than BBB- by S&P, then the Borrowers may, on five
               Business  Days' notice to the Administrative Agent  and
               the  Lender, select a replacement bank or banks  (which
               may  be  one or more of the other Lenders) to  purchase
               the  Lender's  Loans  and assume its  Commitment.   The
               purchase price for the Lender's Loans shall be the  sum
               of  the  unpaid  principal amount of  the  Loans,  with
               accrued  interest, the Lender's share  of  accrued  but
               unpaid  Fees and other amounts due to the Lender  under
               this Agreement (including any amounts due under Section
               1.20  (Funding losses) for each Loan so purchased on  a
               date other than the last day of the Interest Period for
               the  Loan)  less  the  prorated  portion  of  the  Fees
               previously  received by such Lender, from the  date  of
               such  purchase  through the last day of the  applicable
               period  for  which the Fees had been  paid.   Upon  the
               execution  and delivery of an assignment and assumption
               agreement  substantially in the form of  Exhibit  G  by
               such  Lender  and each replacement bank  (and,  if  the
               replacement  bank is not a Lender, with the  subscribed
               consent of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent),
               each  such replacement bank shall be deemed  to  be,  a
               'Lender'  for all purposes of this Agreement,  and  the
               Administrative  Agent shall notify  the  other  Lenders
               accordingly.
               
X.   Miscellaneous

     10.1. Notices

                Except  as  otherwise stated, all  notices,  requests,
          consents  and  other communications to  any  party  to  this
          Agreement shall be in writing.  For purposes of this Section
          10.1  (writing)  shall include writings  in  any  form  that
          provides the recipient, using the systems routinely used  by
          the recipient for communication, with a permanent record and
          a  human-readable  text.  All notices to a  party  shall  be
          given  at the addresses, telecopy number or other electronic
          addresses or by other methods set forth on Schedule 3 or  at
          such  other  addresses, numbers or by such other  reasonable
          methods as such party may specify for the purpose by  notice
          to  the  Administrative  Agent and  the  Borrowers  (each  a
          "Notice Address").

                Each  notice,  request, consent or other communication
          given  under this Agreement shall be effective when received
          at the number or address or by the method specified pursuant
          to  this  Section 10.1.  Any requirement in  this  Agreement
          that a notice or other communication be 'prompt' or be given
          'promptly'   shall   mean  that   such   notice   or   other
          communication shall promptly be transmitted by telephone (if
          oral  notice  is  permitted), bank  wire,  telex,  telecopy,
          computer  link or other means that normally provides  nearly
          instantaneous transmission.

     10.2. No waivers; remedies cumulative; integration; survival

                No  failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or  a
          Lender in exercising a right, power or privilege under  this
          Agreement  shall operate as a waiver thereof,  nor  shall  a
     single  or  partial exercise thereof preclude any  other  or
     further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
     power  or  privilege.  The rights and remedies  provided  in
     this  Agreement  shall be cumulative and  not  exclusive  of
     other  rights  or remedies provided by law.  This  Agreement
     constitutes the entire agreement and understanding among the
     parties   and   supersedes   all   prior   agreements    and
     understandings,  oral or written, relating  to  its  subject
     matter.
     
            All   covenants,   agreements,  representations   and
     warranties  of  the  Borrowers  in  this  Agreement  or   in
     certificates or other documents delivered pursuant  to  this
     Agreement shall be considered to have been relied on by  the
     Lenders   and  shall  survive  the  making  of  any   Loans,
     regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of  the
     Lenders, and shall continue in full force and effect as long
     as  any obligation of the Borrowers under this Agreement  is
     unpaid   or  the  Borrowers'  Borrowing  Rights   have   not
     terminated.

10.3. Expenses; documentary Taxes

           The  Borrowers  shall pay, and shall  be  jointly  and
     severally  liable  for,  the  reasonable  Expenses  of   the
     Administrative Agent in connection with (i) its drafting and
     negotiation  of  this  Agreement,  any  waiver  or   consent
     hereunder  or  any amendment hereof (all of which  documents
     shall  be prepared by counsel for the Administrative  Agent)
     and  (ii) the effectiveness of this Agreement under  Section
     3.1.
     
           If  a  Default by the Borrowers occurs, the  Borrowers
     shall   pay   the  reasonable  Expenses  incurred   by   the
     Administrative  Agent in connection with such  Default.   In
     addition,  if  there  is  a Default by  the  Borrowers,  the
     Borrowers shall pay the reasonable Expenses incurred by  any
     Lender,   including   collection   and   other   enforcement
     proceedings, resulting therefrom.

           The  Borrowers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify
     the   Administrative  Agent  and  the  Lenders  against  all
     transfer, documentary or similar Taxes payable by reason  of
     the  execution and delivery of the Notes and this Agreement,
     and   the  execution,  delivery  and  recordation   of   the
     Mortgages.

10.4. Indemnification

           Each Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent
     and  each Lender and shall hold the Administrative Agent and
     each  Lender jointly and severally harmless from and against
     any  and all liabilities, damages, costs and Expenses of any
     kind   in   connection   with  an   actual   or   threatened
     investigative,   administrative   or   judicial   proceeding
     (whether  or  not the Administrative Agent or  Lender  is  a
     party  thereto)  (collectively, "Claims")  incurred  by  the
     Administrative Agent or Lender to the extent arising out of

                  -  a Borrower's breach of, or any Default under,
          this Agreement,

                  -   any  claim by a Person not a party  to  this
          Agreement  that  either Borrower's, the  Administrative
          Agent's  or a Lender's conduct in connection with  this
          Agreement   is   unlawful  by  a  court  of   competent
          jurisdiction or has or will violate such Person's legal
          rights,  but  only to the extent that the  Lender's  or
          Administrative  Agent's conduct is deemed  unlawful  or
          violative  due  to  some  action  or  inaction  of  the
          Borrowers or either of them,

                  -  an actual or proposed use of Loan proceeds by
          the Borrowers, or

                  -  an  action  initiated  by  either  or  both
          Borrowers against the Administrative Agent or a  Lender
          relating to this Agreement, unless a court of competent
          jurisdiction enters a final non-appealable order on the
          entire  merits  of the controversy in  such  action  in
          favor of the Borrowers.

           Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  this
     Section 10.4, neither the Administrative Agent nor a  Lender
     shall be indemnified for any Claim to the extent such Claim

                   -  is  caused by the Administrative Agent's  or
          Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as
          determined in a final non-appealable order by  a  court
          of competent jurisdiction, or

                   -  results from a Lender's claims against other
          Lenders  not  attributable to a Borrower's actions  and
          for which the Borrowers otherwise have no liability.

10.5. Sharing of set-offs

            If   a  Lender  exercises  a  right  of  set-off   or
     counterclaim or otherwise receives payment of a  portion  of
     the  aggregate amount of principal and interest due  on  its
     Loans to the Borrowers, and such payment is greater than the
     proportion  received by any other Lender  of  the  aggregate
     amount  of principal and interest due on such other Lender's
     Loans   to   the   Borrowers,  the  Lender   receiving   the
     proportionately    greater    payment     shall     purchase
     participations  in the Loans made to the  Borrowers  by  the
     other  Lenders,  and  other adjustments  shall  be  made  as
     required  so that all payments of principal and interest  on
     the  Loans  to the Borrowers shall be shared by the  Lenders
     pro-rata, provided that this Section 10.5 shall not impair a
     Lender's  right  to  exercise, to the  extent  permitted  by
     applicable  law, a right of set-off or counterclaim  and  to
     apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment  of
     indebtedness  of  the Borrowers other than  indebtedness  on
     Loans.   A  Participant in a Loan, whether or  not  acquired
     pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise  rights
     of  set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to
     its  participation  as fully as if the  Participant  were  a
     direct  creditor  of  the Borrowers in the  amount  of  such
     participation.
     
10.6. Amendments and waivers

           An  amendment  to  or waiver of a  provision  of  this
     Agreement must be in writing and signed by the Borrowers and
     Two-Thirds of the Lenders (and, if the rights or  duties  of
     the  Administrative  Agent  are  affected  thereby,  by  the
     Administrative  Agent), provided that each  affected  Lender
     must sign an amendment, waiver or consent that
     
               (a)  increases or decreases the Commitment of such
          Lender   or   subjects   such  Lender   to   additional
          obligations,  except  as contemplated  in  Section  9.8
          (Replacement of Lender),

                (b)  reduces the principal of or rate of interest
          on any Loan or any fees hereunder,

                (c)   postpones the Maturity Date or  other  date
          fixed for payment of principal or interest on a Loan or

          Borrowers' Borrowing Rights,
          
                (d)  changes the percentage of the Commitments or
          of  the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans,
          or  the  Borrowing  Base,  or  the  number  of  Lenders
          required for the Lenders to take any action under  this
          Agreement,
          
               (e)  amends Section 1.19 (Pro-rata treatment),

                 (f)  amends this Section 10.6, or
                                 
                (g)   releases substantially all of the Mortgaged
          Property.

10.7. Successors and assigns

                (a)   The  provisions of this Agreement shall  be
          binding  upon and inure to the benefit of  the  parties
          and  their  respective successors and  assigns,  except
          that neither Borrower may assign, delegate or otherwise
          transfer  any of its rights or obligations  under  this
          Agreement.
          
                 (b)    A  Lender  may  grant  a  bank  or  other
          institution (a "Participant") a participating  interest
          in  its Commitment or some or all of its Loans.   If  a
          Lender   grants   a   participating   interest   to   a
          Participant,  the Lender shall remain  responsible  for
          the   performance   of  its  obligations   under   this
          Agreement,  and  the  Borrowers and the  Administrative
          Agent shall continue to deal solely with the Lender  in
          connection  with this Agreement, regardless of  whether
          the   Lender  has  notified  the  Borrowers   and   the
          Administrative  Agent  of  the  grant.   An   agreement
          granting  such  a participating interest shall  provide
          that  the  Lender  shall  retain  the  sole  right  and
          responsibility  to  enforce  the  obligations  of   the
          Borrowers under this Agreement, including the right  to
          approve  any amendment, modification or waiver  of  any
          provision  of  this  Agreement.   Subject  to   Section
          10.7(e)  (funding losses and changed circumstances),  a
          Participant  shall,  to  the  extent  provided  in  its
          participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits of
          Section  9  (Change in circumstances), with respect  to
          its  participating  interest.  An assignment  or  other
          transfer  that  is  not permitted  by  Section  10.7(c)
          (assignments),  or  10.7(d)  (assignment   to   Federal
          Reserve Bank), shall be given effect only to the extent
          that   it  is  a  participating  interest  granted   in
          accordance with this Section 10.7(b).

                (c)  A Lender may assign to one or more banks  or
          other  institutions  (each  an  "Assignee")  all  or  a
          proportionate part of its rights and obligations  under
          this  Agreement,  and each Assignee shall  assume  such
          rights  and obligations, pursuant to an assignment  and
          assumption  agreement  in  substantially  the  form  of
          Exhibit  G.   The  assignment and assumption  agreement 
          shall  be  signed  by the Assignee and  the  transferor
          Lender,   with   (and   subject  to)   the   subscribed
          acknowledgment and consent of the Administrative  Agent
          and   the  subscribed  consent,  which  shall  not   be
          unreasonably withheld, of the Borrowers, provided  that
          such consents shall not be required if the Assignee  is
          a  Lender  or  a  Federal Reserve  Bank,  and  provided
          further that the consent of the Borrowers shall not  be
          required after and during the continuance of a Default.

      (d)   Upon  the  later of (i) the effective  date
          stated  in  the  assignment  and  assumption  agreement
          (which shall not be earlier than the fifth Business Day
          after  execution of such agreement) or (ii) payment  by
          the  Assignee to the transferor Lender of the  purchase
          price   agreed  between  them,  and  payment   by   the
          transferor Lender or the Assignee to the Administrative
          Agent of a registration and processing fee of $2,500,

                (i)   the  Assignee shall be  a  Lender
     party  to  this Agreement and shall have  all  the
     rights  and  obligations  of  a  Lender  with  the
     Commitment   set  forth  in  the  assignment   and
     assumption agreement,

                (ii)  the  transferor Lender  shall  be
     released from its obligations under this Agreement
     to  a corresponding extent so long as the Assignee
     at  the time of transfer has a net worth at  least
     equal to the net worth of the transferor Lender,
     
                               (iii) The Borrower shall
                    execute   and  deliver  replacement
                    Notes  to the order of the Assignee
                    and,  if  necessary, the  assigning
                    Lender; and

               (iv) no further consent or action by any
     party shall be required.

      (e)   A  Lender may assign all or a proportionate
part  of  its rights under this Agreement to a  Federal
Reserve  Bank, and the Borrowers, if requested  by  the
Lender, shall issue a promissory note to be pledged  to
the  Federal  Reserve  Bank evidencing  the  Borrowers'
obligations  on  the Lender's Loans to  the  Borrowers.
Such assignment shall not release the transferor Lender
from its obligations under this Agreement.

      (f)  No Assignee, Participant or other transferee
of  any Lender's rights may receive any greater payment
under  Section 1.20 (Funding losses), and  Section  9.2
(Increased   cost   and  reduced  return),   than   the
transferor  Lender would have received with respect  to
the  rights transferred, unless such transfer was  made
with the Borrowers' prior consent.

      (g)   The Administrative Agent shall maintain  at
one  of  its offices in Birmingham, Alabama, a copy  of
each  assignment and assumption agreement delivered  to
it  and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses  of the Lenders, and the Commitment  of,  and
principal  amount of the Loans owing  to,  each  Lender
(the "Register").  The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive  in the absence of manifest error,  and  the
          Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may
          treat  each  Person  whose  name  is  recorded  in  the
          Register  as  a  Lender  for  all  purposes   of   this
          Agreement.    The  Register  shall  be  available   for
          inspection by the Borrowers or Lender at any reasonable
          time upon reasonable notice.

                (h)   If an Assignee is not already a Lender,  it
          shall  deliver to the Administrative Agent a  completed
          administrative  questionnaire in the form  required  by
          the  Administrative Agent.  Upon its receipt of (i)  an
          assignment  and  assumption agreement  executed  by  an
          assigning Lender and an Assignee (and, if required,  by
          the   Borrowers),  (ii)  the  completed  administrative
          questionnaire (unless the Assignee is already a Lender)
          and  (iii) the registration and processing fee referred
          to  in  Section 10.7(c), the Administrative Agent shall
          record the information contained in the assignment  and
          assumption  agreement in the Register and  give  prompt
          notice thereof to the Lenders.
          
10.8. Borrowers' liability

          The parties acknowledge that the rights and obligations
     (including   the  representations,  warranties,  agreements,
     breaches,  liabilities, indemnities  and  Defaults)  of  the
     Borrowers under this Agreement are joint and several.

10.9. No reliance on Margin Stock collateral

           Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent and
     the  other  Lenders that it is not relying upon  any  Margin
     Stock  as collateral in the extension or maintenance of  the
     credit provided for in this Agreement.

10.10. Credit decision

          Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and

     deemed  appropriate,  made  its  own  credit  analysis   and
     decision  to  enter into this Agreement.  Each  Lender  also
     acknowledges  that  it  will,  independently   and   without
     reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other  Lender,
     and  based  on such documents and information  as  it  deems
     appropriate  at  the time, continue to make its  own  credit
     decisions  in  taking or not taking any  action  under  this
     Agreement.

10.11. Alabama law

           This  Agreement shall be governed by and construed  in
     accordance with the laws of the State of Alabama.

10.12. Waiver of jury trial

          The Borrowers, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
     hereby  irrevocably and unconditionally waive trial by  jury
     in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
     and for any counterclaim therein.
     
     
     
10.13. Venue of Actions

           As an integral part of the consideration for making of
          the  Loans,  it is expressly understood and agreed  that  no
          suit or action shall be commenced by either Borrower, or  by
          any  successor, personal representative or assignee thereof,
          with  respect  to  the Loans contemplated  hereby,  or  with
          respect   to  this  Agreement  or  any  other  document   or
          instrument  which now or hereafter evidences or secures  all
          or  any  part of the Loans, other than in a state  court  of
          competent jurisdiction in and for the County of the State in
          which  the principal place of business of the Administrative
          Agent  is  situated, or in the United States District  Court
          for the District in which the principal place of business of
          the  Administrative  Agent is situated, and  not  elsewhere.
          Nothing  in  this  paragraph contained  shall  prohibit  the
          Administrative Agent from instituting suit in any  court  of
          competent  jurisdiction for the enforcement  of  its  rights
          hereunder  or  in  any  other document or  instrument  which
          evidences or secures the loan indebtedness.

                 This  Agreement  may  be  executed  in  counterparts.
          Delivery of an executed counterpart signature page  to  this
          Agreement,  including  delivery  by  telecopier,  shall   be
          effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart  of
          this Agreement.

                Section  9  (Change  in circumstances),  Section  10.3

                   FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL TO BORROWERS

                                            _______________, 1998
To the Lenders and the Administrative
     Agent referred to below
c/o AmSouth Bank, as Administrative Agent


Ladies and Gentlemen:

           I  am  Counsel for Mid-America Apartment  Communities,
Inc.,   a   Tennessee   corporation  ("MAAC")   and   Mid-America
Apartments, L.P., a Tennessee limited partnership ("Mid-America")
(jointly,  the  "Borrowers") and have acted as  counsel  for  the
Borrowers in connection with the Revolving Credit Agreement dated
as  of  ________ ___, 1998 (the "Credit Agreement")  between  the
Borrowers,  the  Lenders parties thereto, and  AmSouth  Bank,  as
Administrative Agent.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreements are
used herein as therein defined.

           I  have  examined  originals or copies,  certified  or
otherwise  identified  to  my satisfaction,  of  such  documents,
corporate  records,  certificates of public officials  and  other
instruments and have conducted such other investigations of  fact
and  law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes  of
this  opinion.  I have assumed the due execution and delivery  of
the Credit Agreement by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.

           Upon  the basis of the foregoing, I am of the  opinion
that:

           1.    MAAC  is  a real estate investment  trust,  duly
incorporated,  validly existing and in good  standing  under  the
laws of the State of Tennessee, and has all corporate powers  and
all  material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and
approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted.

            2.     Mid-America  is  a  limited  partnership  duly
incorporated,  validly existing and in good  standing  under  the
laws of the State of Tennessee, and has all corporate powers  and
all  material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and
approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted.

           3.    [Same opinion as 1 for each corporate Subsidiary
and  same  as  2  for  each partnership Subsidiary,  executing  a
Guaranty and a Mortgage on the closing date].

           4.    The execution, delivery and performance  by  the
Borrowers  of the Credit Agreement and the Borrowings  thereunder
are  within each Borrower's corporate or partnership, as the case
may  be,  powers,  have  been duly authorized  by  all  necessary
corporate or partnership, as the case may be, action, require  no
action  by  or  in  respect of, or filing with, any  governmental
body,  agency or official and do not contravene, or constitute  a
default under, any  provision of applicable law or regulation  or
of  the  certificate  of  incorporation, by-laws  or  partnership
agreement  of  either  Borrower or  of  any  material  agreement,
judgment,  injunction, order, decree or other instrument  binding
upon  either Borrower or result in the creation or imposition  of
any Lien on any asset of a Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

           5.   [Same opinion as 4 for each Subsidiary signing  a
Guaranty and a Mortgage on the closing date.]

           6.   The Notes and the Credit Agreement have been duly
executed and delivered by each Borrower and constitute the  valid
and binding agreement of the Borrowers, enforceable in accordance
with  their respective terms except as enforcement may be limited
by  bankruptcy,  insolvency or other similar laws  affecting  the
enforcement of creditors' rights in general.  The enforcement  of
the  Borrowers' obligations under the Credit Agreement is subject
to  general  principles  of equity (regardless  of  whether  such
enforceability  is considered in a proceeding  in  equity  or  at
law.)

           7.    [Same  opinion  as  6 as relates  to  execution,
delivery  and  enforceability of Guaranty and  Mortgage  by  each
Subsidiary.]

           8.    There  is no action, suit or proceeding  pending
against,  or  to the best of my knowledge threatened  against  or
affecting, either Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before  any
court  or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official
in  which  there is a reasonable possibility of a  decision  that
could  materially  adversely  affect the  business,  consolidated
financial  position  or  consolidated results  of  operations  of
either Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries, considered  as
a  whole, or which in any manner draws into question the validity
of the Notes and the Credit Agreement.

           9.    The use of proceeds of any Loan under the Credit
Agreement,  in  the manner contemplated in the Credit  Agreement,
will  not  entail  a  violation  of  any  of  the  provisions  of
Regulation G, U, T or X of the Board of Governors of the  Federal
Reserve System.

          10.  Neither Borrower is an 'investment company' within
the  meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940 or a  'holding
company' within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935.

             I  am  admitted  to practice law  in  the  State  of
Tennessee, and in giving the opinions set forth above, I  express
no  opinion  as to any laws other than the federal  laws  of  the
United States


                                Very truly yours,

other  Lenders  party thereto, as Lenders, and the Administrative

terms  used in this Agreement shall have the meanings given  them
in the Credit Agreement.

           B.    The  Assignor  is  obligated  under  the  Credit
Agreement  to make Loans to the Borrowers in an aggregate  unpaid

           C.    At  the  date of this Agreement,  the  aggregate

           D.    The  Assignor proposes to assign to the Assignee
all  of  the  Assignor's  rights under the  Credit  Agreement  in
respect  of  $[_______________] of its Commitment (the  "Assigned
Commitment Amount") together with a corresponding portion of  its
outstanding Loans, and the Assignee proposes to accept assignment
of   such   rights   and  assume  the  Assignor's   corresponding

                         A G R E E M E N T
                                 
                                 
           The  parties, intending to be legally bound, agree  as
follows:

          1.   Assignment.  The Assignor hereby assigns and sells
to  the  Assignee all of the Assignor's rights under  the  Credit
Agreement  to the extent of the Assigned Commitment  Amount,  and
the Assignee hereby accepts such assignment from the Assignor and
assumes  all  of  the  Assignor's obligations  under  the  Credit
Agreement  to  the  extent  of  the Assigned  Commitment  Amount,
including  the  purchase from the Assignor of  the  corresponding
portion of the unpaid principal amount of the Loans made  by  the
Assignor.   Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement  by
the parties and the payment of the amounts specified in Section 2
required  to  be  paid  on  the date of  this  Agreement,  as  of
[effective date1/:

                (i)  the Assignee shall succeed to the rights and
          be  obligated to perform the obligations  of  a  Lender
          under  the Credit Agreement with a Commitment equal  to
          the Assigned Commitment Amount; and

                (ii)  the  Commitment of the  Assignor  shall  be
          reduced  by  a  like  amount  [like  amounts]  and  the
          Assignor released from its obligations under the Credit
          Agreement  to  the  extent such obligations  have  been
          assumed by the Assignee.

The  assignment provided for in this Agreement shall  be  without
recourse to the Assignor.

           2.   Payments. As consideration for the assignment and
sale  effected in paragraph 1 above, the Assignee shall  pay  the
Assignor  on  the date(s) and in the amount(s) previously  agreed
between  them.   Facility Fees accrued to but not  including  the
date  of  this  Agreement in respect of the  Assigned  Commitment
Amount are for the account of the Assignor and such fees accruing
from and including the date of this Agreement are for the account
of the Assignee.  If the Assignor or Assignee receives any amount
under  the Credit Agreement that is for the account of the other,
it shall promptly pay such other party.

           3.   Consent of the Borrowers2/ and acknowledgment  of
the Administrative Agent.  Pursuant to Section 10.7 of the Credit
Agreement,  each  Borrower consents to,  and  the  Administrative
Agent  acknowledges,  the assignment and assumption  provided  in
this Agreement.

           4.   Non-reliance on Assignor.  The Assignor makes  no
representation or warranty in connection with, and shall have  no
responsibility  with  respect  to,  the  solvency  or   financial
condition  or  statements of the Borrowers or  the  validity  and
enforceability  of  the obligations of the  Borrowers  under  the
Credit  Agreement.   The  Assignee  acknowledges  that  it   has,
independently and without reliance on the Assignor, and based  on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement
and   will  continue  to  be  responsible  for  making  its   own
independent  appraisal  of the business,  affairs  and  financial
condition of the Borrowers.

           5.   Alabama law.  This Agreement shall be governed by
and  construed  in  accordance with the  laws  of  the  State  of

      THIS  GUARANTY  AGREEMENT (this "Guaranty"),  dated  as  of
____________,    199_    (this   "Guaranty"),    is    made    by
__________________________, a ____________ (the "Guarantor"),  of
the  obligations  of Mid-America Apartment Communities,  Inc.,  a
Tennessee  corporation,  and  Mid-America  Apartments,  L.P.,   a
Tennessee  limited partnership (jointly, the "Borrowers"),  under
the Credit Agreement (defined below) among the Borrowers, AmSouth
Bank,  as Administrative Agent (the "Administrative Agent"),  and
the  lenders parties to the Credit Agreement (singly, a  "Lender"
and collectively, the "Lenders").


                            BACKGROUND
                                 
     1.   The Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and the Lenders
have entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of March
16,  1998 (said Credit Agreement, as it may hereafter be  amended
or  otherwise  modified  from time to  time,  being  the  "Credit
Agreement").  The capitalized terms not otherwise defined  herein
have the meanings specified in the Credit Agreement.

      2.    Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers  may,
subject  to the terms of the Credit Agreement, request  that  the
Lenders make Advances.

      3.    It is a condition precedent to the obligation of  the
Lenders  to  make  such  Advances that  the  Guarantor  guarantee
repayment thereof upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.

      4.    The Guarantor is a Subsidiary of one of the Borrowers
and  the  Borrowers  and the Guarantor are members  of  the  same
consolidated group of companies and partnerships and are  engaged
in related businesses.

      5.    The  partners,  members, or board  of  directors,  as
applicable,  of  the  Guarantor  have  determined  that  (i)  the
execution,   delivery,  and  performance  of  this  Guaranty   is
necessary   and   convenient  to  the  conduct,  promotion,   and
attainment of the Guarantor's business and (ii) the Advances  may
reasonably  be  expected to benefit, directly or  indirectly  the
Guarantor.

      6.    The  Guarantor desires to induce the Lenders to  make
such Advances.




                         A G R E E M E N T
                                 
      NOW,  THEREFORE, in consideration of the  premises  and  in
order  to  induce the Lenders to make Advances under  the  Credit
Agreement, the Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:

     1.   Guaranty

           (a)  The Guarantor, jointly and severally with any and
     all  other guarantors of the Advances and the Loans,  hereby
     unconditionally guarantees the full and punctual payment of,
     and  promises to pay, when due, whether at stated  maturity,
     by  mandatory prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise,  the
     Loans,  and  agrees  to pay any and all expenses  (including
     counsel  fees  and  expenses)  incurred  in  enforcement  or
     collection  of  all  or  any  part  thereof,  whether   such
     obligations,  indebtedness  and  liabilities   are   direct,
     indirect,  fixed, contingent, joint, several  or  joint  and
     several, and any rights under this Guaranty.
     
           (b)   Anything  contained  in  this  Guaranty  to  the
     contrary  notwithstanding, the obligations of the  Guarantor
     hereunder  shall  be limited to a maximum  aggregate  amount
     equal  to  the  largest  amount that would  not  render  its
     obligations  hereunder subject to avoidance as a  fraudulent
     transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11 of  the
     United   States   Code  or  any  applicable  provisions   of
     comparable state law (collectively, the "Fraudulent Transfer
     Laws"),  in  each  case after giving  effect  to  all  other
     liabilities of the Guarantor, contingent or otherwise,  that
     are    relevant   under   the   Fraudulent   Transfer   Laws
     (specifically  excluding, however, any  liabilities  of  the
     Guarantor  in  respect of intercompany indebtedness  to  the
     Borrowers  or  other  Affiliates  or  Subsidiaries  of   the
     Borrowers  to  the  extent that such indebtedness  would  be
     discharged  in  an amount equal to the amount  paid  by  the
     Guarantor  hereunder)  and treating as  assets,  subject  to
     Paragraph 4(a) hereof, to the value (as determined under the
     applicable  provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer  Laws)  of
     any  rights to subrogation or contribution of the  Guarantor
     pursuant  to  (i)  Applicable  Law  or  (ii)  any  agreement
     providing  for  an equitable allocation among the  Guarantor
     and  other  Affiliates or Subsidiaries of the  Borrowers  of
     obligations arising under guaranties by such parties.
      2.    Guaranty Absolute.  The Guarantor guarantees that the
Loans  will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of  the
Credit  Agreement,  the  Notes, and  the  other  Loan  Documents,
regardless  of  any Applicable Law, regulation or  order  now  or
hereafter  in effect in any jurisdiction affecting  any  of  such
terms  or  the  rights  of  the  Lenders  with  respect  thereto;
provided,  however,  nothing contained  in  this  Guaranty  shall
require the Guarantor to make any payment under this Guaranty  in
violation  of  any Applicable Law, regulation  or  order  now  or
hereafter  in  effect.  The obligations and  liabilities  of  the
Guarantor  hereunder are independent of the  obligations  of  the
Borrowers under the Credit Agreement and any Applicable Law.  The
liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be  absolute
and unconditional irrespective of:

           (a)  the taking or accepting of any other security  or
     guaranty  for  any  or  all  of  the  Loans,  including  any
     reduction or termination of the Commitments;
     
           (b)  any increase, reduction or payment in full at any
     time or from time to time of any part of the Loans;
     
           (c)   any  lack of validity or enforceability  of  the
     Credit Agreement, the Notes, or any other Loan Documents  or
     other  agreement  or instrument relating thereto,  including
     but  not limited by the unenforceability of all or any  part
     of the Loans by reason of the fact that (i) the Loans and/or
     the  interest paid or payable with respect thereto,  exceeds
     the  amount  permitted by Applicable Law, (ii)  the  act  of
     creating  the  Loans, or any part thereof, is  ultra  vires,
     (iii)  the officers creating same acted in excess  of  their
     authority, or (iv) for any other reason;

           (d)  any lack of corporate or partnership power of the
     Borrowers,  as the case may be, or any other Person  at  any
     time liable for the payment of any or all of the Loans;
     
            (e)    any   applicable  bankruptcy,  reorganization,
     insolvency,    receivership,    liquidation,    arrangement,
     conservatorship,  moratorium,  or  similar  laws,  rules  or
     regulations,   or   principles  of  equity   affecting   the
     enforcement of creditors's rights generally ("Debtor  Relief
     Laws")  involving the Borrowers, the Guarantor or any  other
     Person obligated on any of the Loans;
     
           (f)   any renewal, compromise, extension, acceleration
     or  other change in the time, manner or place of payment of,
     or  in  any  other  term of, all or any of  the  Loans;  any
     adjustment, indulgence, forbearance, or compromise that  may
     be  granted  or  given by any Lender or  the  Administrative
     Agent to the Borrowers, the Guarantor, or any Person at  any
     time  liable for the payment of any or all of the Loans;  or
     any  other  modification, amendment, or  waiver  of  or  any
     consent  to departure from the Credit Agreement, the  Notes,
     or   any  other  Loan  Documents  and  other  agreement   or
     instrument  relating  thereto without  notification  of  the
     Guarantor  (the  right  to  such notification  being  herein
     specifically waived by the Guarantor);
     
          (g)  any exchange, release, sale, subordination, or non-
     perfection of any collateral or Lien therein or any lack  of
     validity   or   enforceability  or   change   in   priority,
     destruction, reduction, or loss or impairment  of  value  of
     any collateral or Lien therein;

           (h)   any release or amendment or waiver of or consent
     to  departure from any other guaranty for all or any of  the
     Loans;
     
           (i)   the  failure by any Lender or the Administrative
     Agent  to  make  any  demand upon or  to  bring  any  legal,
     equitable,  or  other action against the  Borrowers  or  any
     other   Person  (including  without  limitation  any   other
     guarantor),  or the failure or delay by any  Lender  or  the
     Administrative Agent to, or the manner in which  any  Lender
     or the Administrative Agent shall, proceed to exhaust rights
     against any direct or indirect security for the Loans;
     
           (j)  the existence of any claim, defense, set-off,  or
     other  rights which the Borrowers or the Guarantor may  have
     at  any  time  against the Borrowers, the  Lenders,  or  any
     guarantor,  or any other Person, whether in connection  with
     this  Guaranty,  the other Loan Documents, the  transactions
     contemplated thereby, or any other transaction;

           (k)   any  failure of any Lender or the Administrative
     Agent to notify the Guarantor of any renewal, extension,  or
     assignment of the Loans or any part thereof, or the  release
     of  any  security, or of any other action taken or refrained
     from  being taken by any Lender or the Administrative Agent,
     it  being understood that the Lenders and the Administrative
     Agent shall not be required to give the Guarantor any notice
     of  any kind under any circumstances whatsoever with respect
     to or in connection with the Loans;
     
          (l)  any payment by the Borrowers to the Lenders or the
     Administrative  Agent  is  held to constitute  a  preference
     under  any Debtor Relief Law or if for any other reason  the
     Lenders  or the Administrative Agent is required  to  refund
     such payment or pay the amount thereof to another Person; or
     
           (m)   any  other  circumstance which  might  otherwise
     constitute  a defense available to, or a discharge  of,  the
     Borrowers,  the  Guarantor, any  other  guarantor  or  other
     Person liable on the Loans, including without limitation any
     defense by reason of any disability or other defense of  the
     Borrowers, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the
     liability   of  the  Borrowers,  or  any  claim   that   the
     Guarantor's  obligations  hereunder  exceed  or   are   more
     burdensome than those of the Borrowers.
     
     This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or reinstated,
     as the case may be, if any time any payment of any of the Loans
     is  rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Lender or  any
     other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of
     either  Borrower, the Guarantor or otherwise, all as though  such
     payment had not been made.

      3.    Waiver.   To the extent not prohibited by  Applicable
Law,  the  Guarantor  hereby waives:  (a)  promptness,  protests,
diligence,  presentments,  acceptance, performance,  demands  for
performance,  notices  of nonperformance,  notices  of  protests,
notices  of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Guaranty  and
of  the  existence, creation or incurrence of new  or  additional
indebtedness, and any of the events described in Paragraph 2  and
of  any  other occurrence or matter with respect to  any  of  the
Loans, this Guaranty or any of the other Loan Documents; (b)  any
requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Lender  protect,
secure, perfect, or insure any Lien or security interest  or  any
property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any  action
against  the  Borrowers or any other Person or any collateral  or
pursue  any  other remedy in the Administrative  Agent's  or  any
Lender's  power whatsoever; (c) any right to assert  against  the
Administrative Agent or any Lender as a counterclaim, set-off  or
cross-claim, any counterclaim, set-off or claim which it may  now
or  hereafter  have against the Borrowers or either  of  them  or
other  Person  liable  on the Loans; (d) any  right  to  seek  or
enforce any remedy or right that the Administrative Agent or  any
Lender  now  has or may hereafter have against the  Borrowers  or
either  of them (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law);  (e)
any   right  to  participate  in  any  collateral  or  any  right
benefitting the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in respect of
the  Loans;  and (f) any right by which it might be  entitled  to
require suit on an accrued right of action in respect of  any  of
the Loans or require suit against the Borrowers or either of them
or any other Person.

      4.    Subrogation and Subordination.  The Guarantor  hereby
irrevocably waives any claim or other rights which it may have or
hereafter  acquire against the Borrowers or either of  them  that
arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement  of
the  Guarantor's  obligations  under  this  Guaranty,  including,
without  limitation,  any  right of  subrogation,  reimbursement,
exoneration,   contribution,  indemnification,   any   right   to
participate  in  any  claim or remedy of any Lender  against  the
Borrowers  or either of them or any collateral which  any  Lender
now  has or hereafter acquires, whether or not such claim, remedy
or  right arises in equity, or under contract, statutes or common
law,  including without limitation, the right to take or  receive
from the Borrowers or either of them, directly or indirectly,  in
cash  or  other  property or by set-off or in any  other  manner,
payment or security on account of such claim or other rights.  If
any  amount  shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation  of  the
preceding  sentence and the Loans shall not  have  been  paid  in
full,  such  amount  shall be deemed to have  been  paid  to  the
Guarantor  for the benefit of, and held in trust for the  benefit
of,   the   Lenders,  and  shall  forthwith  be   paid   to   the
Administrative Agent to be credited and applied upon  the  Loans,
whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the
Credit  Agreement.   The  Guarantor  acknowledges  that  it  will
receive   direct  and  indirect  benefits  from   the   financing
arrangements  contemplated by the Credit Agreement and  that  the
waiver  set  forth  in  this Paragraph 4  is  knowingly  made  in
contemplation of such benefits.  Notwithstanding anything to  the
contrary  contained in this Paragraph 4, any waiver  and  release
shall  not  be  effective as to any such claim or entitlement  or
such   subrogation  and  other  rights  that  accrue  after   the
indefeasible payment, performance and other satisfaction in  full
of  the Loans, all other amounts payable under this Guaranty  and
termination of the Commitments.

      5.    Representations and Warranties.  The Guarantor hereby
represents and warrants as follows:

           (a)   The  Guarantor  is  a  ___________________  duly

     which  there  is  a  reasonable probability  of  an  adverse
     decision   that  would  materially  adversely   affect   the
     business, financial position or results of operations of the

     validity or enforceability of this Guaranty.

     any  agreement or instrument, including, without limitation,

conditions  and covenants set forth in the Credit  Agreement,  to
the  extent applicable to it, as if it were a signatory  thereto.
The  Guarantor  further covenants and agrees (a)  punctually  and
properly  to perform all of the Guarantor's covenants and  duties

Administrative  Agent  of  any  claim,  action,   or   proceeding
affecting this Guaranty.

      7.   Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this  Guaranty nor consent to any departure by the Guarantor therefrom
shall  in  any event be effective unless the same shall be in  writing
and  signed by the Lenders, and then such waiver or consent  shall  be
effective  only in the specific instance and for the specific  purpose
for which given.

      8.    Addresses for Notices.  Unless otherwise provided  herein,
all  notices, requests, consents and demands shall be in  writing  and

      9.    No  Waiver;  Remedies.  No failure  on  the  part  of  the
Administrative  Agent  or  any Lender to exercise,  and  no  delay  in
exercising,  any  right  hereunder or under  any  of  the  other  Loan
Documents  shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single  or
partial exercise of any right hereunder or under any of the other Loan
Documents  preclude  any  other or further  exercise  thereof  or  the
exercise of any other right.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any
Lender  shall  be  required to (a) prosecute  collection  or  seek  to
enforce  or resort to any remedies against the Borrowers or either  of
them  or  any  other Person liable on any of the Loans, (b)  join  the
Borrowers or either of them or any other Person liable on any  of  the
Loans in any action in which Lender prosecutes collection or seeks  to
enforce  or resort to any remedies against the Borrowers or either  of
them  or  other  Person liable on any of the Loans,  or  (c)  seek  to
enforce or resort to any remedies with respect to any Liens granted to
(or  benefitting, directly or indirectly) the Administrative Agent  or
any  Lender  by  the Borrowers or either of them or any  other  Person
liable on any of the Loans.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor  any
Lender  shall have any obligation to protect, secure or insure any  of
the Liens or the properties or interest in properties subject thereto.
The  remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of  any
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

      10.   Right  of  Set-off.  Upon the occurrence  and  during  the
continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is hereby  authorized
at  any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law,  to  set off and apply any and all deposits (general or  special,
time  or  demand,  provisional or final) at any time  held  and  other
indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit  or
the account of the Guarantor against any and all of the obligations of
the   Guarantor  now  or  hereafter  existing  under  this   Guaranty,
irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any  demand
under  this  Guaranty.   Each Lender agrees  promptly  to  notify  the
Guarantor  after any such set-off and application, provided  that  the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set
off  and  application.  The rights of each Lender under this Paragraph
10  are  in addition to other rights and remedies (including,  without
limitation, other rights of set-off) which such Lender may have.

     11.  Continuing Guaranty; Transfer of Notes.  This Guaranty is an
irrevocable  continuing guaranty of payment and shall  (a)  remain  in
full  force and effect until termination of the Commitments and  final
payment  in full (after the Maturity Date) of the Loans and all  other
amounts  payable  under  this  Guaranty,  (b)  be  binding  upon   the
Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and (c) inure to the benefit of
and  be enforceable by each Lender and its successors, transferees and
assigns.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (c),
to  the extent permitted by Section 10.7 of the Credit Agreement, each
Lender  may  assign or otherwise transfer its rights under the  Credit
Agreement,  the  Notes  or  any of the other  Loan  Documents  or  any
interest  therein to any Person, and such other Person shall thereupon
become  vested  with  all  the  rights or  any  interest  therein,  as
appropriate,  in  respect  thereof granted to  the  Lender  herein  or
otherwise.

      12.  Information.  The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it
shall  have  the sole responsibility for obtaining from the  Borrowers
such  information  concerning each Borrower's financial  condition  or
business operations as the Guarantor may require, and that neither the
Administrative  Agent  nor any Lender has any  duty  at  any  time  to
disclose  to  any Guarantor any information relating to  the  business
operations or financial conditions of the Borrowers.

      13.   GOVERNING  LAW.  THE AGREEMENT SHALL BE  GOVERNED  BY  AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA AND  THE
UNITED  STATES  OF AMERICA.  WITHOUT EXCLUDING ANY OTHER JURISDICTION,
THE  GUARANTOR  AGREES THAT THE STATE AND FEDERAL  COURTS  OF  ALABAMA
LOCATED   IN   BIRMINGHAM,  ALABAMA,  SHALL  HAVE  JURISDICTION   OVER
PROCEEDINGS IN CONNECTION HEREWITH.

      14.   WAIVER  OF  JURY TRIAL.  THE GUARANTOR, THE ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT  AND THE LENDERS HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, IRREVOCABLY  AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHT
TO  TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED  TO  THIS  AGREEMENT  OR ANY OF  THE  LOAN  DOCUMENTS  OR  THE
TRANSACTIONS  CONTEMPLATED  THEREBY.  THIS  PROVISION  IS  A  MATERIAL
INDUCEMENT TO EACH LENDER ENTERING INTO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.

      15.   Ratable Benefit.  This Guaranty is for the ratable benefit
of  the  Lenders,  each  of which shall share  any  proceeds  of  this
Guaranty pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement.

       16.    Guarantor  Insolvency.   Should  the  Guarantor   become
insolvent,  fail  to  pay  its debts generally  as  they  become  due,
voluntarily  seek,  consent to, or acquiesce in the  benefits  of  any

payable  in  full by the Guarantor to such Lender upon  demand,  which
shall be the estimated amount owing in respect of the contingent claim
created hereunder.

                       CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER'S

               in  compliance  with all the terms and  provisions  set
               forth  in the Loan Agreement on its part to be observed
               and  performed,  and no Event of Default  specified  in
               Article Seven of the Loan Agreement, nor any event that

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The undersigned, Mid-America Apartments, L.P. (the
"Partnership") and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (the
"REIT"), hereby agree with you as follows:

     1.   AUTHORIZATION OF ISSUE OF NOTES.  The Partnership has
authorized the issuance of its senior unsecured promissory notes
in the aggregate principal amount of the Converted Loans, to be
dated the date of issuance thereof, to mature on the Conversion
Maturity Date, to bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof
from the date thereof until the principal thereof shall have
become due and payable at the Converted Note Rate, and on overdue
payments at the rate specified therein, and to be substantially
in the form of Schedule 1A attached hereto.  The term "Notes" as
used herein shall include each such senior unsecured promissory
note delivered pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and
each such senior unsecured promissory note delivered in
substitution or exchange for any other Note pursuant to any such
provision.  Other capitalized terms that are used herein are
defined in Section 10 hereof, beginning on page 34.

     2.   PURCHASE AND SALE OF NOTES.  The Partnership hereby
agrees to sell to you and, subject to the terms and conditions
herein set forth, you agree to purchase from the Partnership,
Notes in the aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate
principal amount of the Converted Loans.  The Partnership will
deliver to you, at your offices described above (or at such other
place as you may designate), one or more Notes registered in your
name, evidencing the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be
purchased by you and in such denomination or denominations as may
be acceptable to you, against the payment of the purchase price
of such Notes by delivery of the notes evidencing the Converted
Loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal
amount of Converted Loans on the date of closing of this
transaction, which shall be the Conversion Date (hereinafter also
called the "closing" or the "date of closing").

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
should you suffer a loss of principal on any loan to the
Partnership, the REIT or any Affiliate of either, your obligation
hereunder to purchase the Notes shall automatically terminate and
be of no further force or effect.

     3.   CONDITIONS OF CLOSING.  On the Conversion Date, you
will purchase the Notes and will release your Liens against the
Collateral, subject to the fulfillment, on or prior to the
Conversion Date, of the following conditions.

     3A.  Conversion Issues.

          (i)  No default nor any event which, through the giving
     of notice or the passage of time, would constitute a
     default, (A) shall have occurred on any of your loans with
     the Partnership, the REIT or Affiliates of either, and be
     continuing at the Conversion Date, or (B) will result from
     the conversion of the Converted Loans as provided for
     herein.

          (ii) As more particularly outlined herein, the
     Partnership shall have (A) executed and delivered to you
     such documents evidencing the conversion of the Converted
     Loans into senior, unsecured, fully recourse loans of the
     Partnership as you may require, including, without
     limitation, the Notes,(B) delivered such evidence as you may
     require to evidence the Partnership's authority to enter
     into the conversion transaction, and (C) provided such
     representations and warranties as of the Conversion Date as
     you may reasonably require including matters relating to
     title, environmental matters, possession of agreements,
     permits, easements, trademarks, labor and employee
     relations.

          (iii)     No earlier than sixty (60) days prior to the
     Conversion Date, you shall have received letters from S & P
     and one other Nationally Recognized Rating Agency, stating
     that, based on the assumption that the Liens held by you in
     the Collateral and securing the Converted Loans will be
     released, the Notes and the other senior long term unsecured
     debt of the Partnership have received a rating of at least
     "BBB-" from S&P and the equivalent of S&P's BBB- rating from
     one such other Nationally Recognized Rating Agency.

          (iv) The Partnership and the REIT shall provide written
     evidence satisfactory to you that the covenants in this
     Agreement, except in paragraph 5L hereof, have been
     satisfied during the term of this Agreement, and the
     covenants in paragraph 6A have been strictly satisfied for
     the four (4) consecutive financial quarters immediately
     preceding the date of the Partnership's conversion request.
     Any calculations required to provide such evidence shall
     treat the Converted Loans and any other secured Debt of the
     Partnership and its Subsidiaries that will be converted to
     unsecured contemporaneously with the Converted Loans, as
     having been unsecured for the four (4) consecutive financial
     quarters preceding the request.

          (v)  The Partnership shall provide sixty (60) days
     written notice to you prior to the Conversion Date.  Such
     notice shall include, at minimum, a proposed Conversion
     Date, a list of the Convertible Loans to be converted, and a
     statement that all conditions to the conversion as described
     herein have been satisfied or will be satisfied as of
     closing.

          (vi) The Partnership shall pay your reasonable out-of-
     pocket expenses relating to the conversion, including the
     fees and expenses of your outside legal counsel.

          (vii)     With its conversion notice the Partnership
     shall pay to you a $20,000 non-refundable fee. At closing,
     the Partnership shall pay you an additional fee equal to
     .25% multiplied by the principal amount of the Converted
     Loans, less the $20,000 fee described in the preceding
     sentence.

          (viii)    The (A) market value of the outstanding
     common stock of the REIT on a date within thirty (30) days
     of closing plus (B) the Consolidated Funded Debt of the REIT
     as of that date, shall exceed $1 billion.

          (ix) On the closing date, no more than eighteen percent
     (18%) of the apartment units owned by the Partnership, the
     REIT and their respective Affiliates collectively shall be
     located in one Metropolitan Statistical Area.  For the
     purposes of this determination, the counties in which
     Southhaven, Mississippi, Olive Branch, Mississippi and Horn
     Lake Mississippi are located shall be considered part of the
     Memphis, Tennessee, Metropolitan Statistical Area.

          (x)  All of the Converted Loan Borrowers shall have
     been dissolved and their assets distributed to the
     Partnership pursuant to documentation satisfactory to you.

          (xi) All accrued and unpaid interest on the Converted
     Loans through the Conversion Date shall have been paid to
     you in immediately available federal funds.

     3B.  Execution and Delivery of Documents.  The Partnership
and the REIT shall have delivered, or caused to be delivered, to
you duly executed, original or certified copies of the following
documents, each to be dated the date of Closing unless otherwise
indicated:

          (i)  the Note(s).

          (ii) a favorable opinion of Baker, Donelson, Bearman &
     Caldwell, special counsel to the Partnership and the REIT

     REIT and reasonably acceptable to you) satisfactory to you
     and substantially in the form of Schedule 3B(ii) attached
     hereto and as to such other matters as you may reasonably
     request.  The Partnership and the REIT hereby direct such
     counsel to deliver such opinion, agree that the issuance and
     sale of any Notes will constitute a reconfirmation of such
     direction, and understand and agree that you will and are
     hereby authorized to rely on such opinion.

          (iii)     the Certificate of Limited Partnership of the
     Partnership and the Articles of Incorporation of the REIT,
     each certified as of a date within thirty (30) days of
     Closing by the Secretary of State of the State in which each
     such entity was formed.

          (iv) the limited partnership agreement of the
     Partnership, and the By-Laws of the REIT, certified (as to

          (v)  an incumbency certificate signed by the general
     partner of the Partnership and an incumbency certificate
     signed by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary and one
     other officer (who is not signing any other document or
     agreement in connection herewith) of the REIT, in each case
     certifying as to the names, titles and true signatures of
     the general partners of the Partnership and the officers of
     the REIT authorized to sign this Agreement and the Notes and
     the other documents to be delivered hereunder.

     other Loan Documents, and the execution, delivery and perfor
     mance thereof, and authorizing certain general partners (as
     to the Partnership) and certain officers of the REIT (as to
     the REIT) to execute and deliver the same, and certifying
     that such authority documents were duly and validly adopted
     and such consents and resolutions have not since been
     amended, revoked or rescinded,(B) certifying that no

     Partnership or the REIT have been commenced or are

     closing no Default or Event of Default; (C) no condition,

     Effect has occurred since the date of this Agreement nor is

     Tennessee, Florida, and Georgia and any other State in which
     a Converted Borrower was either organized, incorporated or

     4.   PREPAYMENTS.
     
     4A.  Optional Prepayments.  Notes shall be subject to

multiples of $5,000,000), at the option of the Partnership, at
100% of the principal amount so prepaid plus interest thereon to
the prepayment date and the Prepayment Premium, if any, with
respect to each Note.

     The Partnership shall give the holder of each Note
irrevocable written notice of any prepayment pursuant to this
paragraph 4A not less than 30 days prior to the prepayment date,
specifying such prepayment date and the principal amount of the
Notes, and of the Notes held by such holder, to be prepaid on
such date and stating that such prepaying is to be made pursuant
to this Paragraph 4A.  Notice of prepayments having been given as
aforesaid, the principal amount of the Notes specified in such
notice, together with interest thereon to the prepayment date and

thereto, shall become due and payable on such prepayment date.
The Partnership shall, on or before the day on which it gives
written notice of any prepayment pursuant to this Paragraph 4A,
give telephonic notice of the principal amount of the Notes to be
prepaid and the prepayment date to each Significant Holder which
shall have designated a recipient of such notices by notice in
writing to the Partnership.

     Upon any partial prepayment of the Notes pursuant to this
Section 4A, the principal amount so prepaid shall be allocated to
all Notes at the time outstanding (including, for the purpose of
this Paragraph 4A only, all Notes prepaid or otherwise retired or
purchased or otherwise acquired by the Partnership, the REIT or

respective outstanding principal amounts thereof.

under this Agreement shall be due and payable, except as

Note unless it is accompanied by the Prepayment Premium, all
accrued interest and all other obligations and indebtedness due
under the Loan Documents.  The holders of the Notes shall notify
Partnership of the amount and calculation of the Prepayment
Premium.  Partnership and the REIT agree that, in determining the
Prepayment Premium, (a) the holders of the Notes shall not be
obligated to actually reinvest the amount prepaid in any Treasury
obligation and (b) the Prepayment Premium is directly related to
the damages that the holders will suffer as a result of the
prepayment.   Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, no Prepayment Premium shall be due on
the Notes if they are prepaid during the last fourteen (14) days
prior to the Conversion Maturity Date.

percent (30%) or more of all interests of the Partnership or the

years, Persons who at the beginning of such period constitute the
Partnership's general partners cease for any reason to be general
partners of the Partnership, or (b) during any period of two (2)
consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such
period constitute the REIT's Board of Directors (together with
any new director whose election by the REIT's Board of Directors
or whose nomination for election by the REIT's shareholders was
approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors
then still in office who either were directors at the beginning
of such period or whose election or nomination for election was
previously so approved) cease for any reason to constitute a
majority of the directors then in office;

then (a) if such event is an Event of Default specified in clause
(i) or (ii) of this paragraph 7A which is not cured within any
applicable grace or cure period, the holder of any Note (other
than the Partnership, the REIT or any of their Subsidiaries), the
outstanding principal amount of which at the time exceeds ten
percent (10%) of the outstanding principal amount of all of
Notes, may at its option during the continuance of such Event of
Default, by notice in writing to the Partnership and the REIT,
declare such Note to be, and such Note shall thereupon be and
become, immediately due and payable at par, together with
interest accrued thereon and Prepayment Premium, if any, without
presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby waived by the Partnership and the REIT, (b) if
such event is an Event of Default specified in clause (viii),
(ix) or (x) of this paragraph 7A, all of the Notes at the time
outstanding shall automatically become immediately due and
payable, together with interest accrued thereon and the
Prepayment Premium, if any, and to the extent permitted by law,
with respect to each Note, without presentment, demand, protest
or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the
Partnership and the REIT, and(c) with respect to any other event
constituting an Event of Default, the Required Holder(s) may at
its or their option, by notice in writing to the Partnership,
declare all of the Notes to be, and all of the Notes shall
thereupon be and become, immediately due and payable together
with interest accrued thereon and together with the Prepayment
Premium, if any, with respect to each Note, without presentment,
demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby waived by the Partnership.

     The Partnership and the REIT acknowledge, and the parties
hereto agree, that each holder of a Note has the right to
maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment(except
as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for
payment of the Prepayment Premium by the Partnership or the REIT
in the event that the Notes are prepaid or are accelerated as a
result of an Event of Default, is intended to provide
compensation for the deprivation of such right under such
circumstances.

     Promptly following the acceleration of all of the Notes, the
Computing Holder shall give written notice to the Partnership and
the REIT of the amount of the Prepayment Premium in respect of
the Notes (which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the
computation of such Prepayment Premium and the assumptions made
in connection therewith).  Such notice shall be given within five
(5) Business Days if such Computing Holder has given such notice
of acceleration, and otherwise promptly after such Computing
Holder has knowledge of such acceleration.  If any Note has been
accelerated pursuant to clause (i) of this paragraph 7A, then the
holder which has so accelerated such Note shall give written
notice to the Partnership and the REIT of the Prepayment Premium
in respect of such Note promptly after such acceleration.  The
failure by a Computing Holder to give notice as aforesaid as to
the computation of the Prepayment Premium in respect of any Note
shall not relieve the Partnership or the REIT of the obligation
as of the date of such acceleration to pay such Prepayment
Premium forthwith after such Prepayment Premium is determined
(and in such case the determination of such Prepayment Premium by
the holder of any Note which has been so accelerated shall be
deemed to be conclusive with respect to such Note absent manifest
error).

      7B.  Rescission of Acceleration.  At any time after any or
all of the Notes shall have been declared immediately due and
payable pursuant to paragraph 7A, the Required Holder(s) may, by
notice in writing to the Partnership and the REIT, rescind and
annul such declaration and its consequences if (i) the
Partnership or the REIT shall have paid all overdue interest on
the Notes, the principal of and the Prepayment Premium, if any,
payable with respect to any Notes which have become due otherwise
than by reason of such declaration, and interest on such overdue
interest and overdue principal and the Prepayment Premium at the
rate specified in the Notes, (ii) the Partnership or the REIT
shall not have paid any amounts which have become due solely by
reason of such declaration, (iii) all Defaults and Events of
Default other than non-payment of amounts which have become due
solely by reason of such declaration, shall have been cured or
waived pursuant to paragraph 11C, and (iv) no judgment or decree
shall have been entered for the payment of any amounts due
pursuant to the Notes or this Agreement.  No such rescission or
annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent Default or
Event of Default, or impair any right arising therefrom.
     
      7C.  Notice of Acceleration or Rescission.  Whenever any
Note shall be declared immediately due and payable pursuant to
paragraph 7A or any such declaration shall be rescinded and
annulled pursuant to paragraph 7B, the Partnership shall
forthwith give written notice thereof to the holder of each Note
at the time outstanding.

      7D.  Other Remedies.  If any Event of Default or Default
shall occur and be continuing, the holder of any Note may proceed
to protect and enforce its rights under this Agreement and such
Note by exercising such remedies as are available to such holder
in respect thereof under applicable law, either by suit in equity
or by action at law, or both, whether for specific performance of
any covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement or in
aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Agreement.  No
remedy conferred in this Agreement upon the holder of any Note is
intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every
such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every
other remedy conferred herein or now or hereafter existing at law
or in equity or by statute or otherwise.

     Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding
paragraph, the parties hereto agree that the covenants and
agreements contained herein are of a unique nature, the breach of
which either cannot be adequately compensated by monetary damages
or may not necessarily result in the ability of the aggrieved
party to obtain relief.  The parties therefore agree that the
breach by one party of its covenants or other agreements
contained herein shall entitle the other, aggrieved party to seek
and obtain specific performance or such other equitable relief as
such party deems appropriate, and each party hereto consents to
the availability of such remedies, and agrees and represents that
this Agreement is a material inducement to its entry into this
Agreement.

any contract or agreement or subject to any charter or other
corporate restriction which materially and adversely affects its
business, property or assets, or financial condition.  Neither
the execution nor delivery of this Agreement, the REIT
Guaranties, or the Notes, nor the offering, issuance and sale of
the Notes or the REIT Guaranties, nor fulfillment of nor
compliance with the terms and provisions hereof, the Notes or the
REIT Guaranties will conflict with, or result in a breach of the
terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default
under, or result in any violation of, or result in the creation
of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the

charter documents of the Partnership, the REIT or any of their
Subsidiaries, any award of any arbitrator or any agreement
(including any agreement with stockholders), instrument, order,
judgment, decree, statute, law, rule or regulation to which the

Neither the Partnership, the REIT nor any of their Subsidiaries
is a party to, or otherwise subject to any provision contained
in, any instrument evidencing Indebtedness of the Partnership,
the REIT or such Subsidiary of either, any agreement relating

     8H.  Offering of Notes.  Neither the Partnership, the REIT,

directly or indirectly, offered the Notes or any similar security
of the Partnership for sale to, or solicited any offers to buy
the Notes or any similar security of the Partnership from, or
otherwise approached or negotiated with  respect thereto with,
any Person other than you, and neither the Partnership, the REIT
nor any agent acting on behalf of either has taken or will take
any action which would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes
to the provisions of section 5 of the Securities Act or to the
provisions of any securities or Blue Sky law of any applicable
jurisdiction.

     8I.  Use of Proceeds. Neither the Partnership, the REIT nor
any Subsidiary of either owns or has any present intention of
acquiring any "margin stock" as defined in Regulation G (12 CFR
Part 207) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(herein called "margin stock").  The proceeds of sale of the
Notes will be used to refinance all or a portion of the
Convertible Loans.  None of such proceeds will be used, directly
or indirectly, for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or
ultimate, of purchasing or carrying any margin stock or for the
purpose of maintaining, reducing or retiring any Indebtedness
which was originally incurred to purchase or carry any stock that
is currently a margin stock or for any other purpose which might
constitute this transaction a "purpose credit" within the meaning
of such Regulation G.  Neither the Partnership, the REIT or any
of their Subsidiaries are engaged principally, or as one of their
important activities, in the business of extending credit for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying " margin stock" (within the
meaning of Regulation G of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System), and the aggregate market value of all "margin
stock" owned by the Partnership, the REIT and the Subsidiaries of
both does not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the aggregate
value of the assets thereof, as determined by any reasonable
method.  Neither the Partnership, the REIT nor any agent acting
on behalf of either of them has taken or will take any action
which might cause this Agreement or the Notes to violate
Regulation G, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to violate the
Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may
hereafter be in effect.

     8J.  ERISA.  (i) No accumulated funding deficiency (as
defined in section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code),
whether or not waived, exists with respect to any Plan (other
than a Multiemployer Plan).

     (ii) No liability to the PBGC has been or is expected by the
Partnership, the REIT or any ERISA Affiliate of either to be
incurred with respect to any Plan (other than a Multiemployer
Plan) by the Partnership , the REIT or any Subsidiary of either
or any ERISA Affiliate which is or would be materially adverse to
the business, condition (financial or otherwise) or operations of
the Partnership, the REIT and the Subsidiaries of both, taken as
a whole.

     (iii) Neither the Partnership, the REIT, any Subsidiary
of either, nor any ERISA Affiliate of either of them has incurred
or presently expects to incur any withdrawal liability under
Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Multiemployer Plan which is
or would be materially adverse to the business, condition
(financial or otherwise) or operations of the Partnership, the
REIT and their Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

     (iv) The expected post-retirement benefit obligations
(determined as of the last day of the Partnership's and the
REIT's most recently ended fiscal year in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 106, without
regard to liabilities attributable to continuation coverage
mandated by Section 4980B of the Code) of the Partnership, the
REIT and their Subsidiaries is not material.

     (v)  The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities
under each Plan (other than Multiemployer Plans), determined as
of the end of such Plans' most recently ended Plan year on the
basis of the actuarial assumption specified for funding purposes
in such Plans most recent actuarial valuation report, did not
exceed the aggregate current value of the assets of such plan
allocable to such benefit liabilities.  The term "benefit
liabilities" has the meaning specified as section 4001 of ERISA
and the terms "current value" and "present value" have the
meaning specified in Section 3 of ERISA.
     
     (vi) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
REIT Guaranties, and the issuance and sale of the Notes, will be
exempt from, or will not involve any transaction which is subject
to, the prohibitions of section 406 of ERISA and will not involve
any transaction in connection with which a penalty could be
imposed under section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax could be imposed
pursuant to section 4975 of the Code.  The representation by the
Partnership and the REIT in the next preceding sentence is made
in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of your
representation in paragraph 9B.

     8K.  Governmental Consent.  No circumstance in connection
with the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Notes is

Exchange Commission and/or state Blue Sky authorities) in

whole.

contrary provision herein or in any Note with respect to the
place of payment.  You agree that, before disposing of any Note,
you will make a notation thereon (or on a schedule attached
thereto) of all principal payments previously made thereon and of
the date to which interest thereon has been paid.  Upon written
request of the Partnership made concurrently with or reasonably
promptly after payment or prepayment in full of any Note, you
shall surrender such Note for cancellation, reasonably promptly
after any such request, to the Partnership at its principal
executive office.  The Partnership agrees to afford the benefits
of this paragraph 11A to any Transferee which shall have made the
same agreement as you have made in this paragraph 11A.

     11B. Expenses.  The Partnership and the REIT agree, whether
or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated,
to pay, and save you and any Transferee harmless against
liability for the payment of, all out-of-pocket expenses arising

          Agreement or the issuance of the Notes;

          (ii) document production and duplication charges and
          the reasonable fees and expenses of any special counsel
          engaged by you or such Transferee in connection with
          (A) this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
          hereby (B) and any subsequent proposed waiver,
          amendment or modification of, or proposed consent
          under, this Agreement, whether or not such the proposed
          action shall be effected or granted;

          (iii) the reasonable costs and expenses, including
          attorneys' and financial advisory fees, incurred by you
          or such Transferee in enforcing (or determining whether
          or how to enforce) any rights under this Agreement or
          the Notes or in responding to any subpoena or other
          legal process or informal investigative demand issued
          in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
          contemplated hereby or by reason of your or such
          Transferee's having acquired any Note, including,
          without limitation, costs and expenses incurred in any
          workout, restructuring or renegotiation proceeding or
          bankruptcy case;

          (iv) any judgment, liability, claim, order, decree,
          cost, fee, expense, action or obligation resulting from
          the consummation of the transactions contemplated
          hereby, including the use of the proceeds of the Notes
          by the Partnership; and

          (v) any Environmental Costs and Liabilities

; provided that the Partnership and the REIT shall not be
responsible for (1) any of your expenses or those of a Transferee
incurred solely in connection with any transfer of any Note;
(2) the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for the
holders of the Notes, except to the extent the Required Holders
determine that (a) either legal advice is needed in a
jurisdiction other than that specified in paragraph 11K or
(b) there exists a conflict of interest amongst the holders of
the Notes; and (3) any fees, costs or expenses incurred with
respect to any amendment that is proposed prior to the occurrence
of a Default or Event of Default by a holder of the Notes rather
than the Partnership, unless such holder shall have consulted
with the Partnership and the REIT prior to proceeding with such
amendment.  The obligations of the Partnership and the REIT under
this paragraph 11B shall survive the transfer of any Note or
portion thereof or interest therein by you or any Transferee and
the payment of any Note.

     11C. Consent to Amendments.  This Agreement may be amended,
and the Partnership may take any action herein prohibited, or
omit to perform any act herein required to be performed by it, if
the Partnership shall obtain the written consent to such
amendment, action or omission to act, of the Required Holder(s)
except that, without the written consent of the holder or holders
of all Notes at the time outstanding, no amendment to this
Agreement shall change the maturity of any Note, or change the
principal of, or the rate, method of computation or time of
payment of interest on or any Prepayment Premium payable with
respect to any Note, or affect the time, amount or allocation of
any  prepayments, or change the proportion of the principal
amount of the Notes required with respect to any consent,
amendment, waiver or declaration. Each holder of any Note at the
time or thereafter outstanding shall be bound by any consent
authorized by this paragraph 11C, whether or not such Note shall
have been marked to indicate such consent, but any Notes issued
thereafter may bear a notation referring to any such consent.  No
course of dealing between the Partnership, the REIT and the
holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights
hereunder or under any Note or the REIT Guaranties shall operate
as a waiver of any rights of any holder of such Note or the REIT
Guaranties.  As used herein and in the Notes, the term "this
Agreement" and references thereto shall mean this Agreement as it
may from time to time be amended or supplemented.

     11D. Form, Registration, Transfer and Exchange of Notes;
Lost Notes.  The Notes are issuable as registered notes without
coupons in denominations of at least $1,000,000, except as may be
necessary to (i) reflect any principal amount not evenly
divisible by $1,000,000 or (ii) enable the registration of
transfer by a holder of its entire holding of Notes.  The
Partnership shall keep at its principal office a register in
which the Partnership shall provide for the registration of Notes
and of transfers of Notes.  Upon surrender for registration of
transfer of any Note at the principal office of the Partnership,
the Partnership shall, at its expense, execute and deliver one or
more new Notes of like tenor and of a like aggregate principal
amount, registered in the name of such transferee or transferees.
At the option of the holder of any Note, such Note may be
exchanged for other Notes of like tenor and of any authorized
denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount, upon
surrender of the Note to be exchanged at the principal office of
the Partnership.  Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for
exchange, the Partnership shall, at its expense, execute and
deliver the Notes which the holder making the exchange is
entitled to receive.  Every Note surrendered for registration of
transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by
a written instrument of transfer duly executed, by the holder of
such Note or such holder's attorney duly authorized in writing.
Any Note or Notes issued in exchange for any Note or upon
transfer thereof shall carry the rights to unpaid interest and
interest to accrue which were carried by the Note so exchanged or
transferred, so that neither gain nor loss of interest shall
result from any such transfer or exchange.  Upon receipt of
written notice from the holder of any Note of the loss, theft,
destruction or mutilation of such Note and, in the case of any
such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of such holder's
indemnity agreement (which shall be unsecured if such holder is
an insurance company rated A or better by A.M. Best Company or is
an Institutional Investor whose senior debt securities are rated
BBB- or Baa3 or better by S&P or Moody's, respectively, and,
otherwise, which shall be unsecured unless the Partnership
requests in writing that such indemnity agreement be secured), or
in the case of any such mutilation upon surrender and cancella
tion of such Note, the Partnership will make and deliver a new
Note, of like tenor, in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or
mutilated Note.  The Partnership shall give to any holder of a
Note that is an Institutional Investor promptly upon request
therefor, a complete and correct copy of the names and addresses
of all registered holders of  Notes.

     11E. Persons Deemed Owners; Participations.  Prior to due
presentment for registration of transfer, the Partnership may
treat the Person in whose name any Note is registered as the
owner and holder of such Note for the purpose of receiving
payment of principal of, interest on and any Prepayment Premium
payable with respect to such Note and for all other purposes
whatsoever, whether or not such Note shall be overdue, and the
Partnership shall not be affected by notice to the contrary.
Subject to the preceding sentence, the holder of any Note may
from time to time grant participations in such Note to any Person
on such terms and conditions as may be determined by such holder
in its sole and absolute discretion, provided that any such
participation shall be in a principal amount of at least
$100,000.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon your
sale and transfer from time to time of all or any portion of a
Converted Loan prior to the Conversion Date, such sale shall be
deemed an assignment to and assumption by such purchaser of your
obligation to purchase Notes hereunder in an amount equal to the
principal amount of such Converted Loan so purchased, and you
shall have no further obligation hereunder to purchase those
Notes.

     11F. Survival of Representations and Warranties; Entire
Agreement.  All representations and warranties contained herein
or made in writing by or on behalf of the Company in connection
herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Notes, and the REIT Guaranties, the transfer by
you of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein and the
payment of any Note, and may be relied upon by any Transferee,
regardless of any investigation made at any time by or on behalf
of you or any Transferee.  Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement, the Notes and the REIT Guaranties embody the
entire agreement and understanding between you and the Company
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to
the subject matter hereof. No provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted for or against any party because that party or its
legal representative drafted the provision.

     11G. Successors and Assigns.  All covenants and other
agreements in this Agreement contained by or on behalf of either
of the parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of the
respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto
(including, without limitation, any Transferee) whether so
expressed or not.

     Nothing express or implied in this Agreement is intended,
nor shall be construed, to confer (i) any legal rights, remedies,
obligations, or liabilities, legal or equitable, including the
right to receive funds, on any Person other than the parties to
this Agreement and their permitted successors and assigns, or
(ii) otherwise constitute any Person a third party beneficiary
under or by reason of this Agreement.

such other holder at such address as such other holder shall have

holder shall not have so specified an address to the Partnership,
then addressed to such other holder in care of the last holder of
such Note which shall have so specified an address to the

option of the holder of any Note, be delivered by any other means
either to the Partnership or the REIT at its address specified
above or to any general partner of the Partnership.

     Notice given pursuant to this paragraph 11H shall be deemed

retains a confirmation or similar number, the date specified by
the delivery service as the promised delivery date, in the case
of overnight delivery.

     11I. Payments Due on Non-Business Days.  Anything in this
Agreement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding, any
payment of principal of or interest on any Note that is due on a
date other than a Business Day shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day.  If the date for any payment is extended
to the next succeeding Business Day by reason of the preceding
sentence, the period of such extension shall be included in the
computation of the interest payable on such Business Day.

     11J. Satisfaction Requirement.  If any agreement,
certificate or other writing, or any action taken or to be taken,
is by the terms of this Agreement required to be satisfactory to
you or to the Required Holder(s), the determination of such
satisfaction shall be made by you or the Required Holder(s), as
the case may be, in the sole and exclusive judgment (exercised in
good faith) of the Person or Persons making such determination.

     11K. Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be construed and
enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall
be governed by, the law of the State of Georgia.

     11L. Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver or Immunities.  The
Partnership and the REIT hereby irrevocably submit to the
jurisdiction of any Georgia state or Federal court sitting in
Atlanta, Georgia, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, and the Partnership and the REIT
hereby irrevocably agree that all claims in respect of such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in Georgia state
or Federal court.  The Partnership and the REIT hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent it may effectively do
so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding.  The Partnership and the REIT agree
and irrevocably consent to the service of any and all process in
any such action or proceeding by the mailing, by registered or
certified U.S. mail, or by any other means or mail that requires
a signed receipt, of copies of such process to CT Corporation
System at 1201 Peachtree Street, NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30361.  The
Partnership and the REIT agree that a final judgement in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law.  Nothing in this paragraph 11L shall
affect the right of any holder of the Notes to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by law or affect the right
of any holder of the Notes to bring any action or proceeding
against the Partnership and/or the REIT or their property in the
courts of any other jurisdiction.  To the extent that the
Partnership or the REIT has or hereafter may acquire immunity
from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgement,
attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with
respect to itself or its property, the Partnership and the REIT
hereby irrevocably waive such immunity in respect of its
obligations under this agreement.

     11M. Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions
hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

     11N.  Descriptive Headings.  The descriptive headings of the
several paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience
only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement.

     11O.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but
all of which together shall constitute one instrument.

     11P.  Independence of Covenants.  All covenants hereunder
shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action
or condition is prohibited by any one of such covenants, the fact
that it would be permitted by an exception to, or otherwise be in
compliance within the limitations of, another covenant shall not
(i) avoid the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default if such
action is taken or such condition exists or (ii) in any way
prejudice an attempt by the holders to prohibit (through
equitable action or otherwise) the taking of any action by the
Partnership, the REIT or an Subsidiary of either which would
result in a Default or Event of Default.

     11Q.  Mandatory Arbitration.  The Partnership, the REIT and
you agree that all controversies, claims or disputes between them
arising out of this Agreement or any agreements or instruments
relating hereto or delivered in connection herewith, or relating
to the transaction contemplated by the Agreement, whether
individual, joint or class in nature, including, without
limitation, contract, tort, or other controversies, claims or
disputes shall be arbitrated in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.

     No act to take or dispose of any collateral, or to exercise
any right in connection with collateral, or to seek to obtain
provisional or ancillary relief from a court of competent
jurisdiction before, during or after the pendency of any
arbitration proceeding conducted pursuant to this arbitration
agreement, including, without limitation, by judicial
foreclosure, by power of sale on a deed of trust or mortgage,
obtaining or executing a writ of attachment, or the exercise of
any rights relating to personal property, including, without
limitation, taking or disposing of such property with or without
judicial process pursuant to Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial
Code as codified under applicable law, shall constitute a waiver
of this arbitration agreement.  Either the Partnership, the REIT
or you may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an
injunction, the appointment of a receiver, declaratory relief or
any provisional or ancillary relief referred to in the preceding
sentence.  Any statutes of limitations or doctrines of estoppel,
waiver, laches or similar statutes or doctrines, which would
otherwise be applicable in a judicial action brought by a party
shall be applicable in any arbitration proceeding hereunder.

     Any controversies, claims or disputes concerning the
lawfulness or reasonableness of any act, or the exercise of any
right concerning collateral, including, without limitation any
claim to rescind, reform or otherwise modify any agreements or
instruments relating hereto or delivered in connection herewith,
shall also be arbitrated; provided however, that no arbitrator
shall have the right or power to enjoin or restrain any act of
any party.

     Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction.

     The Federal Arbitration Act, U.S.C. 1-14, shall apply to the
construction and interpretation of this arbitration provision.

     11R. Waiver of Jury Trial.  The Partnership, the REIT and
the holders of the Notes agree to waive their respective rights
to a jury trial of any claim or cause of action based upon or
arising out of this Agreement, the Notes, or any dealings between
them relating to the subject matter of this transaction and the
lender/borrower relationship that is being established.  The
scope of this waiver is intended to be all-encompassing of any
and all disputes that may be filed in any court and that relate
to the subject matter of this transaction, including without
limitation, contract claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims,
and all other common law and statutory claims.  The holders of
the Notes, the Partnership and the REIT each acknowledge that
this waiver is a material inducement to enter into this business
relationship, that each has already relied on the waiver in
entering into this Agreement, and that each will continue to rely
on the waiver in their related future dealings.  The holders of
the Notes, the Partnership and the REIT further warrant and
represent that each has reviewed this waiver with its legal
counsel, and that each knowingly and voluntarily waives its jury
trial rights following consultation with legal counsel.  THIS
WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER
ORALLY OR IN WRITING, AND THE WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY
SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENT, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO
THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES, OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR
AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE NOTES.  In the event of litigation,
this Agreement may be filed as a written consent to a trial by
the court.

     11S.  Reproduction of Documents.  This Agreement and all
documents relating thereto, including, without limitation, (a)
consents, waivers and modifications that may hereafter be
executed, (b) documents received by you at the Closing (except
the Notes themselves), and (c) financial statements, certificates
and other information previously or hereafter furnished to you,
may be reproduced by you by any photographic, photostatic,
microfilm, microcard, miniature photographic or other similar
process and you may destroy any original document so reproduced.
The Partnership and the REIT agree and stipulate that, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, any such reproduction shall
be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial
or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original itself
in any judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the
original is in existence and whether or not such reproduction was
made by you in the regular course of business) and any
enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of such
reproduction shall likewise by admissible in evidence.  This
paragraph 11S shall not prohibit the Partnership, the REIT or any
other holder of Notes from contesting any such reproduction to
the same extent that it could contest the original, or from
introducing evidence to demonstrate the inaccuracy of any such
reproduction.

     11T.  Severalty of Obligations.  The sales of Notes to the
Purchasers are to be several sales, and the obligations of the
Purchasers under this Agreement are several obligations.  No
failure by any Purchaser to perform its obligations under this
Agreement shall relieve any other Purchaser or the Partnership of
any of its obligations hereunder, and no Purchaser shall be
responsible for the obligations of, or any action taken or
omitted by, any other Purchaser hereunder.

     11U. Independent Investigation.  Each Purchaser has made its
own independent investigation of the condition (financial and
otherwise), prospects and affairs of the Partnership, the REIT
and their Subsidiaries in connection with its purchase of the
Notes hereunder and has made and shall continue to make its own
appraisal of the creditworthiness of the Partnership.  No Holder
shall have any duty or responsibility to any other Holder, either
initially or on a continuing basis, to make any such
investigation or appraisal or to provide any credit or other
information with respect thereto.  No Holder is acting as agent
or in any other fiduciary capacity on behalf of any other Holder.

     11V.  Directly or Indirectly.  Where any provision in this
Agreement refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which
such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be
applicable whether the action in question is taken directly or
indirectly by such Person.

     If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign the
