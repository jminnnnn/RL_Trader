                                  PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

General
      The Fairchild Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated in October
1969,  under the laws of the State of Delaware.  The Company is the largest
aerospace fastener manufacturer in the world and an international  supplier
to  the aerospace industry, distributing a wide range of aircraft parts and
related   support   services.  Through  internal   growth   and   strategic
acquisitions, the Company is one of the leading aircraft parts suppliers to
aircraft  manufacturers  such as Boeing, Airbus, Lockheed  Martin,  British
Aerospace  and Bombardier and to airlines such as Delta Air  Lines  and  US
Airways.

      The Company's primary business focus is on the aerospace industry and
its  aerospace  business  consists primarily  of  two  segments:  aerospace
fasteners and aerospace parts distribution. The aerospace fasteners segment
manufactures  and markets high performance fastening systems  used  in  the
manufacturing  and  maintenance  of commercial  and  military  aircraft  by
original  equipment  manufacturers  ("OEMs").  The  aerospace  distribution
segment  stocks  and  distributes  a wide  variety  of  aircraft  parts  to
commercial  airlines and air cargo carriers, other distributors, fixed-base
operators, corporate aircraft operators and other aerospace companies.  The
Company's  aerospace  distribution business is conducted  through  its  83%
owned  subsidiary, Banner Aerospace, Inc. ("Banner").  For a comparison  of
the  sales  of the Company's business segments for each of the  last  three
fiscal  years, see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results
of  Operations  and Financial Condition", which is herein  incorporated  by

Narrative Description of Business Segments

Aerospace Fasteners

      The  Company, through its Aerospace Fasteners segment, is  a  leading
worldwide  manufacturer  and  supplier of fastening  systems  used  in  the
construction  and  maintenance of commercial and  military  aircraft.   The
Aerospace Fasteners segment accounted for 50.9% of total sales for the year
ended June 30, 1998.

  Products

      In  general, aerospace fasteners produced by the Company are used  to
join  materials  in  applications that are not of  themselves  critical  to
flight.  Products  range from standard aerospace screws,  to  more  complex
systems  that  fasten  airframe structures, and sophisticated  latching  or
quick  disconnect mechanisms that allow efficient access to internal  parts
which  require  regular servicing or monitoring.  The  Aerospace  Fasteners
segment  also  manufactures and supplies fastening  systems  used  in  non-
aerospace  industrial  and  electronic niche applications.   The  Aerospace
Fasteners segment produces and sells products under various trade names and
trademarks   including  Voi-Shan  (fasteners  for  aerospace   structures),
Screwcorp    (standard   externally   threaded   products   for   aerospace
applications), RAM (custom designed mechanisms for aerospace applications),
Camloc (components for the industrial, electronic, automotive and aerospace
markets),  and  Tridair and Rosan (fastening systems for  highly-engineered
aerospace, military and industrial applications).

     Principal product lines of the Aerospace Fasteners segment include:

      Standard  Aerospace Airframe Fasteners - These fasteners  consist  of
standard  externally  threaded  fasteners  used  in  non-critical  airframe
applications  on a wide variety of aircraft.  These fasteners  include  Hi-
Torque Speed Drive, Tri-Wing, Torq-Set, Phillips and Hex Heads.

     Commercial Aerospace Structural and Engine Fasteners - These fasteners
consist  of  more highly engineered, permanent or semi-permanent  fasteners
used   in   non-critical  but  more  sophisticated  airframe   and   engine
applications,  which could involve joining more than two materials.   These
fasteners  are  generally engineered to specific customer  requirements  or
manufactured  to specific customer specifications for special applications,
often  involving exacting standards.  These fasteners include Hi-Lok, Veri-
Lite, Eddie-Bolt2 and customer proprietary engine nuts.

      Proprietary  Products  and  Fastening Systems  -  These  very  highly
engineered, proprietary fasteners are designed by the Company for  specific
customer  applications and include high performance structural latches  and
hold  down  mechanisms.  These fasteners are usually proprietary in  nature
and   are  used  primarily  in  either  commercial  aerospace  or  military
applications.  These  fasteners include Visu-Lok, Composi-Lok,  Keen-serts,
Mark IV, Flatbeam and Ringlock.

      Highly  Engineered  Fastening Systems for Industrial  Applications  -
These  highly engineered fasteners are designed by the Company for specific
niche  applications in the electronic, automotive and durable goods markets
and are sold under the Camloc trade name.

  Sales and Markets

      The products of the Aerospace Fasteners segment are sold primarily to
domestic  and  foreign  OEMs of airframes, subcontracors  to  OEMs,  engine
assemblies,  and to the maintenance and repair market through distributors.
Sixty-six percent of its sales are domestic.  Major customers include  OEMs
such  as Boeing, Airbus, and Aerospatiale and their subcontractors, as well
as  major  distributors such as AlliedSignal, Tri-Star Aerospace and  Wesco
Aircraft  Hardware.   Recently,  OEMs have  significantly  increased  their
production levels.  In addition, OEMs have implemented programs  to  reduce
inventories  and pursue just-in-time relationships. This has allowed  parts
distributors to significantly expand their business due to their ability to
better  meet  OEM  objectives.  In response, the  Company,  which  formerly
supplied  the OEMs directly, is expanding efforts to provide parts  through
its  subsidiaries, which are distributors, such as Special-T  Fasteners  in
the Unites States and AS+C GmbH in Europe.  No single customer accounts for
more than 10% of the Company's consolidated sales.

      Products  are marketed by a direct sales force team and  distribution
companies in the United States and Europe.  The direct sales force team  is
organized by customer and region. The internal sales force is organized  by
facility  and  product range and is focused on servicing  customers  needs,
identifying  new  product applications, and obtaining the approval  of  new
products.   All  the  Company's products are marketed  through  centralized
advertising and promotional activities.

     Revenues in the Aerospace Fasteners segment bear a strong relationship
to  aircraft  production.  As OEMs searched for cost cutting  opportunities
during the aerospace industry recession, parts manufacturers, including the
Company,  accepted  lower-priced orders and/or smaller quantity  orders  to
maintain  market  share, at lower profit margins.  However,  during  recent
years, this situation has improved as build rates in the aerospace industry
have increased and resulted in capacity constraints.  All though lead times
have  increased,  the Company has been able to provide its major  customers
with  favorable  pricing,  while  maintaining  or  increasing  margins   by
negotiating  for  larger  minimum  lot sizes  that  are  more  economic  to
manufacture.   In  addition,  the Company has eliminated  "make  and  hold"
contracts  under which large volume buyers would require current production
of  parts  for  long-term unspecified dates of delivery. Overall,  existing
backlog  is anticipated to result in higher margins due to larger and  more
efficient  lot  sizes, combined with the utilization of  recently  acquired
customized production capacity and training programs for all employees.

     Fasteners also have applications in the automotive/industrial markets,
where  numerous special fasteners are required (such as engine bolts, wheel
bolts  and turbo charger tension bolts).  The Company is actively targeting
the  automotive  market as a hedge against any potential  downturn  in  the
aerospace industry.

  Manufacturing and Production

     The  Aerospace  Fasteners  segment  has  eight  primary  manufacturing
facilities,  of which three are located in the United States and  five  are
located  in  Europe.   Each  facility  has  virtually  complete  production
capability,  and  subcontracts  only those production  steps  which  exceed
capacity.  Each plant is designed to produce a specified product  or  group
of   products,   determined  by  the  production   process   involved   and
certification requirements. The Company's largest customers have recognized
its  quality and operational controls by conferring ISO D1-9000A status  at
all  of  its U.S. facilities, and ISO D1-9000 status at all of its European
facilities.  All  of  its  facilities are "preferred  suppliers"  and  have
received all SPC and NADCAP approvals from OEMs.  The Company is the  first
and   only  aerospace  fastener  manufacturing  company  with  all  of  its
facilities holding ISO-9000 approval.

      The Company has a fully operational modern information system at  all
of  its  U.S.  facilities,  which was expanded  to  most  of  its  European
operations in Fiscal 1998.  The Company will expand this information system
to  the  remaining  European operations in Fiscal  1999.   The  new  system
performs  detailed and timely cost analysis of production  by  product  and
facility.  Updated MIS systems also help the Company to better service  its
customers. OEMs require each product to be produced in an OEM-qualified/OEM-
approved facility.

  Competition

      Despite intense competition in the industry, the Company remains  the
dominant  manufacturer  of aerospace fasteners.   The  worldwide  aerospace
fastener  market  is  estimated  to  be $1.7  billion  (before  distributor
resales).   The Company holds approximately 23% of the market and  competes
with  SPS Technologies, Hi-Shear, and Huck, which the Company believes hold
approximately 13%, 11% and 10% of the market, respectively.  In Europe, its
largest competitors are Blanc Aero and Southco Fasteners.

      The  Company  competes  primarily in the highly-engineered  "systems"
segment where its broad product range allow it to more fully serve each OEM
and  distributor.   The  Company's product  array  is  diverse  and  offers
customers  a  large  selection  to address  various  production  needs.  In
addition, roughly 45% of the Company's output is unique or is in  a  market
where the Company has a small number of competitors.  The Company seeks  to
maintain  its  technological  edge  and  competitive  advantage  over   its
competitors,  and  has  historically  demonstrated  innovative   production
methods and new products to meet customer demands at fair price levels.

Aerospace Distribution

      The  Company,  through  Banner (its Aerospace Distribution  segment),
distributes a wide variety of aircraft parts, which it has purchased on the
open  market or acquired from OEMs as an authorized distributor.  No single
distributor  arrangement is material to the Company's financial  condition.
The  Aerospace Distribution segment accounted for 48.3% of total  sales  in
Fiscal 1998.

  Products

      An  extensive  inventory of products and a quick  response  time  are
essential  in  providing service to its customers.  Another key  factor  in
selling  to  its customers is Banner's ability to maintain  a  system  that
traces a part back to the manufacturer.

      Products of the Aerospace Distribution segment are divided  into  two
groups:  rotables  and  engines.  Rotables include flight  data  recorders,
radar  and navigation systems, instruments, landing gear and hydraulic  and
electrical  components.  Engines include jet engines and engine  parts  for
use on both narrow and wide body aircraft and smaller engines for corporate
and  commuter  aircraft.  Banner provides a  number  of  services  such  as
immediate  shipment of parts in aircraft-on-ground situations. Banner  also
buys and sells commercial aircraft from time to time.

      Rotable parts are sometimes purchased as new parts, but are generally
purchased  in the aftermarket which are then overhauled for the Company  by
outside  contractors, including OEMs and FAA-licensed facilities.  Rotables
are  sold  in  a variety of conditions such as new, overhauled, serviceable
and  "as is".  Rotables may also be exchanged instead of sold.  An exchange
occurs when an aircraft part in inventory is exchanged for a part from  the
customer  and the customer is charged an exchange fee plus the actual  cost
to  overhaul  the part.  Engines and engine components are  sold  "as  is",
overhauled or disassembled for resale as parts.

  Sales and Markets

     Subsidiaries of the Aerospace Distribution segment sell their products
in  the United States and abroad to most of the world's commercial airlines
and  to  air  cargo  carriers,  as well as other  distributors,  fixed-base
operators,  corporate  aircraft operators and  other  aerospace  companies.
Approximately 70.7% of its sales are to domestic purchasers, some  of  whom
may represent offshore users.

      The Aerospace Distribution segment conducts marketing efforts through
its  direct  sales  force, outside representatives and,  for  some  product
lines, overseas sales offices.  Sales in the aviation aftermarket depend on
price,   service,  quality  and  reputation.   The  Aerospace  Distribution
segment's  business  does not experience significant seasonal  fluctuations
nor depend on a single customer.  No single customer accounts for more than
10% of the Company's consolidated revenue.

  Competition

      The  rotables  group  competes with AAR Corp., Air  Ground  Equipment
Services  ("AGES"),  Aviation Sales Company, The Memphis  Group  and  other
large  and  small  companies  in  a very fragmented  industry.   The  major
competitors  for  Banner's engine group are OEMs such as  General  Electric
Company and Pratt and Whitney, as well as the engine parts division of  AAR
Corp., AGES, and many smaller companies.

Other Operations

     Other operations include: Nacanco, real estate holdings, and a company
operating  under  the  trade name of Fairchild Gas Springs  Division  ("Gas
Springs").

  Nacanco Paketleme

      Established in 1987, Nacanco is the largest manufacturer of  aluminum
cans for soft drinks and beer in Turkey with an estimated 80% market share.
Nacanco  generated EBITDA of approximately $38 million on annual  sales  of
$101 million for its fiscal year ended December 31, 1997.  The Company owns
31.9%  of  Nacanco's common stock with Pechiney International  SA  and  its
subsidiaries  holding  substantially all of the balance.  The  Company  has
received cash dividends of $5.7 million and $4.8 million in the years ended
June 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

  Real Estate

      The  Company has significant real estate holdings having a book value
of  approximately  $67  million as of June 30, 1998.   The  Company's  real
estate  holdings consist of (i) approximately 80 acres on Long Island,  New
York  which are currently being developed into retail centers; (ii) various
industrial  buildings from which the Company receives  rental  income;  and
(iii)  property to be used as landfills upon receipt of necessary  licenses
and government approvals.

  Gas Springs Division

      A  Fiscal 1995 start-up operation, Gas Springs manufactures gas  load
springs  and  other devices used in raising, lowering or  moving  of  heavy
loads.  Its  products  have numerous consumer and industrial  applications,
including  in  fitness  equipment,  sunbeds,  furniture,  automotive,   and
agricultural  and  construction equipment. Annual sales were  $5.8  million
from Gas Springs in Fiscal 1998.

Note  4  to  the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements,  included  in
"Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data").

Foreign Operations

    The Company's operations are located primarily in the United States and
Europe.  Inter-area sales are not significant to the total revenue  of  any
geographic area.  Export sales are made by U.S. businesses to customers  in
non-U.S.  countries, whereas foreign sales are made by the  Company's  non-
U.S. subsidiaries.  For the Company's sales results by geographic area  and
export   sales,  see  Note  21  of  the  Company's  Consolidated  Financial
Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Backlog of Orders

    Backlog is important for all the Company's operations, due to the long-
term  production requirements of its customers.  The Company's  backlog  of
orders as of June 30, 1998 in the Aerospace Fasteners segment and Aerospace
Distribution  segment  amounted  to  $208.8  million,  and  $15.6  million,
respectively.  The  Company  anticipates that  in  excess  of  91%  of  the
aggregate backlog at June 30, 1998 will be delivered by June 30, 1999.

Suppliers

      The  Company does not consider itself to be materially dependent upon
any  one  supplier,  but is dependent upon a wide range of  subcontractors,
vendors  and  suppliers  of  materials  to  meet  its  commitments  to  its
customers.  From  time  to time the Company enters  into  exclusive  supply
contracts  in return for logistics and price advantages.  The Company  does
not believe that any one of these contracts would impair its operations  if
a supplier were unable to perform.

Personnel

     As  of  June 30, 1998, the Company had approximately 3,900  employees.
Approximately  5% of these employees were covered by collective  bargaining
agreements.  The Company believes that its relations with its employees are
good.

      The  results  of Banner Aerospace, Inc. are included in  the  periods
since  February  25, 1996, when Banner became a majority-owned  subsidiary.
Prior  to  February  25,  1996,  the Company's  investment  in  Banner  was
accounted for using the equity method. Fiscal 1994 includes the gain on the
sale  of Rexnord Corporation stock. Fiscal 1998 includes the gain from  the
Banner  Hardware Group Disposition. The results of the hardware  group  are
included  in  the  periods  from March 1996 through  December  1997,  until
disposition   (see   Note  22  of  the  Company's  Consolidated   Financial
Statements). These transactions materially affect the comparability of  the
information reflected in the selected financial data.

      EBITDA represents the sum of operating income before depreciation and
amortization. Included in EBITDA are restructuring and unusual  charges  of
$25,553  and  $2,319  in  Fiscal 1994 and 1996, respectively.  The  Company
considers  EBITDA  to  be an indicative measure of the Company's  operating
performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived  asset  and
because  such  data  is  considered useful by the investment  community  to
better  understand the Company's results, and can be used  to  measure  the
Company's ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand its
business. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP,  may
not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and
should  not  be  considered as an alternative either to net  income  as  an
indicator  of the Company's operating performance, or to cash  flows  as  a
measure of the Company's liquidity. Cash expenditures for various long-term
assets,  interest expense, and income taxes have been, and will be incurred
which are not reflected in the EBITDA presentation. Furthermore, EBITDA  is
not  available for the discretionary use of management and,  prior  to  the
payment  of  dividends,  the  Company  uses  EBITDA  to  meet  its  capital
expenditures and debt service requirements. EBITDA Margin represents EBITDA
as a percentage of net sales.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
                 FINANCIAL CONDITION

      The Fairchild Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated in October
1969,  under the laws of the State of Delaware.  On November 15, 1990,  the
Company  changed  its name from Banner Industries, Inc.  to  The  Fairchild
Corporation.   The  Company  is the owner of 100%  of  RHI  Holdings,  Inc.
("RHI") and the majority owner of Banner Aerospace, Inc. ("Banner"). RHI is
the  owner  of  100%  of  Fairchild Holding Corp. ("FHC").   The  Company's
principal  operations  are conducted through Banner and  FHC.  The  Company
holds a significant equity interest in Nacanco Paketleme ("Nacanco"),  and,
during  the  period  covered  by this report,  held  a  significant  equity
interest in Shared Technologies Fairchild Inc. ("STFI").  (See Item 8, Note
4  to Financial Statements, as to the disposition of the Company's interest
in STFI.)

GENERAL

      The  Company  is the largest aerospace fastener manufacturer  in  the
world and an international supplier to the aerospace industry, distributing
a  wide  range  of  aircraft  parts and related support  services.  Through
internal  growth  and strategic acquisitions, the Company  is  one  of  the
leading  aircraft parts suppliers to aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing,
Airbus,  Lockheed Martin, British Aerospace and Bombardier and to  airlines
such as Delta Air Lines and US Airways.

      The Company's primary business focus is on the aerospace industry and
its  business  consists primarily of two segments: aerospace fasteners  and
aerospace  parts distribution. The aerospace fasteners segment manufactures
and  markets  high performance fastening systems used in the  manufacturing
and   maintenance  of  commercial  and  military  aircraft.  The  aerospace
distribution  segment  stocks and distributes a wide  variety  of  aircraft
parts  to  commercial airlines and air cargo carriers,  original  equipment
manufacturers ("OEMs"), other distributors, fixed-base operators, corporate
aircraft  operators and other aerospace companies. The Company's  aerospace
distribution  business  is  conducted through  its  83%  owned  subsidiary,
Banner.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT

      Certain  statements  in  the  financial discussion  and  analysis  by
management  contain  forward-looking  information  that  involve  risk  and
uncertainty,   including   current  trend  information,   projections   for
deliveries,  backlog, and other trend projections.  Actual  future  results
may  differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including product
demand;  performance issues with key suppliers; customer  satisfaction  and
qualification  issues;  labor  disputes;  governmental  export  and  import
policies;  worldwide  political stability and economic  growth;  and  legal
proceedings.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

      The  Company has effected a series of transactions designed  to:  (i)
reduce  its total indebtedness and annual interest expense; (ii) focus  its
operations  in  aerospace  manufacturing;  (iii)  increase  the  number  of
publicly  held  shares  of  Class A Common Stock;  and  (iv)  increase  the
Company's operating and financial flexibility.

      On  November  20,  1997, STFI entered into a  merger  agreement  with
Intermedia Communications Inc. ("Intermedia") pursuant to which holders  of
STFI  common  stock received $15.00 per share in cash (the "STFI  Merger").
The  Company was paid approximately $178.0 million in cash (before tax  and
selling  expenses) in exchange for the common and preferred stock  of  STFI
owned by the Company.  In the nine months ended March 29, 1998, the Company
recorded  a  $96.0  million gain, net of tax, on disposal  of  discontinued
operations,  from  the proceeds received from the STFI  Merger,  which  was
completed on March 11, 1998. The results of STFI have been accounted for as
discontinued operations.

      On November 28, 1997, the Company acquired AS+C GmbH, Aviation Supply
+  Consulting  ("AS&C")  in  a  business combination  accounted  for  as  a
purchase.  The  total  cost  of the acquisition was  $13.2  million,  which
exceeded  the  fair  value of the net assets of AS&C by approximately  $7.4
million,  which is preliminarily being allocated as goodwill and  amortized
using  the  straight-line method over 40 years. The Company purchased  AS&C
with cash borrowed. AS&C is an aerospace parts, logistics, and distribution
company primarily servicing the European OEM market.

      On  December 19, 1997, the Company completed a secondary offering  of
public  securities.   The offering consisted of an  issuance  of  3,000,000
shares  of  the  Company's Class A Common Stock at $20.00  per  share  (the
"Offering").

      On December 19, 1997, immediately following the Offering, the Company
restructured its FHC and RHI Credit Agreements by entering into a new  six-
and-a-half-year credit facility to provide the Company with a $300  million
senior  secured credit facility (the "Facility") consisting of  (i)  a  $75
million  revolving loan with a letter of credit sub-facility of $30 million
and  a  $10  million swing loan sub-facility, and (ii) a $225 million  term
loan.

      On  January  13, 1998, certain subsidiaries of Banner  (the  "Selling
Subsidiaries") completed the disposition of substantially all of the assets
and  certain liabilities of its hardware business and PacAero unit  to  two
wholly-owned subsidiaries of AlliedSignal Inc. (the "Buyers"), in  exchange
for  shares of AlliedSignal Inc. common stock with an aggregate value equal
to  $369  million (the "Banner Hardware Group Disposition").  The  purchase
price  received  by the Selling Subsidiaries was based on the  consolidated
net  worth as reflected on an adjusted closing date balance sheet  for  the
assets  (and  liabilities)  conveyed by the  Selling  Subsidiaries  to  the
Buyers.  The assets transferred to the Buyers consist primarily of Banner's
hardware  group, which includes the distribution of bearings, nuts,  bolts,
screws,  rivets  and  other  type  of  fasteners,  and  its  PacAero  Unit.
Approximately $196 million of the common stock received from the Buyers was
used  to repay outstanding loans of Banner's subsidiaries and related fees.
Banner  effected  the Banner Hardware Group Disposition to concentrate  its
efforts  on  the rotables and jet engine businesses and because the  Banner
Hardware  Group  Disposition presented a unique opportunity  to  realize  a
significant return on the disposition of the hardware group.

      On  February  3, 1998, with the proceeds of the Offering,  term  loan
borrowings under the Facility, and a portion of the after tax proceeds  the
Company  received  from the STFI Merger (collectively, the  "Refinancing"),
the  Company  refinanced  substantially all of  its  existing  indebtedness
(other  than  indebtedness of Banner), consisting of (i) $63.0  million  to
redeem  the  11  7/8% Senior Debentures due 1999; (ii)  $117.6  million  to
redeem  the  12% Intermediate Debentures due 2001; (iii) $35.9  million  to
redeem the 13 1/8% Subordinated Debentures due 2006; (iv) $25.1 million  to
redeem  the  13% Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2007; and (vi)  accrued
interest of $10.6 million.

      On  March 2, 1998, the Company consummated the acquisition of Edwards
and  Lock  Management  Corporation, doing business as  Special-T  Fasteners
("Special-T"), in a business combination to be accounted for as a  purchase
(the  "Special-T  Acquisition"). The contractual  purchase  price  for  the
acquisition was valued at approximately $47.3 million, of which  50.1%  was
paid in shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company and 49.9% was paid in
cash  according to terms specified in the acquisition agreement. The  total
cost  of  the  acquisition exceeded the fair value of  the  net  assets  of
Special-T  by approximately $21.6 million, which amount is being  allocated
as  goodwill, and amortized using the straight-line method over  40  years.
Special-T  manages  the  logistics  of worldwide  distribution  of  Company
manufactured  precision fasteners to customers in the  aerospace  industry,
for  government  agencies,  original  equipment  manufacturers,  and  other
distributors.

  On  May  11,  1998,  the  Company commenced an  offer  to  exchange  (the
"Exchange  Offer"),  for each properly tendered share of  Common  Stock  of
Banner, a number of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value
$0.10 per share, equal to the quotient of $12.50 divided by $20.675 up to a
maximum  of  4,000,000 shares of Banner's Common Stock. The Exchange  Offer
expired on June 9, 1998 and 3,659,364 shares of Banner's Common Stock  were
validly  tendered for exchange, and the Company issued 2,212,361 shares  of
Class  A  Common Stock to the tendering shareholders. As a  result  of  the
Exchange Offer, the Company's ownership of Banner Common Stock increased to
83.3%. The Company effected the Exchange Offer to increase its ownership of
Banner to over 80% in order for the Company to include Banner in its United
States consolidated corporate income tax return.

     Fiscal 1997 Transactions

      In  February 1997, the Company completed a transaction (the "Simmonds
Acquisition")  pursuant  to which the Company acquired  common  shares  and
convertible debt representing an 84.2% interest, on a fully diluted  basis,
of  Simmonds S.A. ("Simmonds").  The Company then initiated a tender  offer
to  purchase the remaining shares and convertible debt held by the  public.
By Fiscal year-end, the Company had purchased, or placed sufficient cash in
escrow  to  purchase,  all  the remaining shares and  convertible  debt  of
Simmonds.   The total purchase price of Simmonds, including the  assumption
of  debt,  was approximately $62.0 million, which the Company  funded  with
available  cash.   The  Company  recorded approximately  $20.5  million  in
goodwill  as  a  result of this acquisition.  Simmonds is one  of  Europe's
leading   manufacturers  and  distributors  of  aerospace  and   automotive
fasteners.

      On  June  30,  1997,  the Company sold all the patents  of  Fairchild
Scandinavian   Bellyloading  Company  ("SBC")  to   Teleflex   Incorporated
("Teleflex")  for  $5.0 million, and immediately thereafter  sold  all  the
stock of SBC to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Teleflex for $2.0 million. The
Company  may also receive an additional amount of up to $7.0 million  based
on  future net sales of the patented products and services. In Fiscal 1997,
the  Company recorded a $2.5 million nonrecurring gain as a result of these
transactions.

     Fiscal 1996 Transactions

     The Company, RHI and Fairchild Industries, Inc. ("FII"), the Company's
former subsidiary, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
November  9,  1995  (as  amended,  the  "Merger  Agreement")  with   Shared
Technologies  Inc.  ("STI").  On March 13, 1996,  in  accordance  with  the
Merger  Agreement,  STI  succeeded to the  telecommunications  systems  and
services  business  operated  by  the  Company's  Fairchild  Communications
Services Company ("FCSC"). The transaction was effected by a Merger of  FII
with  and into STI (the "Merger"), with the surviving company renamed STFI.
Prior  to the Merger, FII transferred all of its assets to, and all of  its
liabilities  were assumed by FHC, except for the assets and liabilities  of
FCSC, and $223.5 million of FII's existing debt and preferred stock.  As  a
result  of  the  Merger, the Company received shares of  Common  Stock  and
Preferred  Stock  of  STFI,  representing  approximately  a  41%  ownership
interest in STFI.

      On  February 22, 1996, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated
January 26, 1996, the Company, through its subsidiaries, completed the sale
of  certain  assets,  liabilities and the business  of  the  D-M-E  Company
("DME")  to  Cincinnati  Milacron  Inc.  ("CMI"),  for  a  sales  price  of
approximately  $244.3 million, as adjusted.  The sales price  consisted  of
$74.0  million  in  cash,  and two 8% promissory  notes  in  the  aggregate
principal amount of $170.3 million (together, the "8% CMI Notes").  On July
29, 1996, CMI paid in full the 8% CMI Notes.

      On  January  27,  1996,  FII completed the  sale  of  Fairchild  Data
Corporation  ("Data")  to  SSE Telecom, Inc.  ("SSE")  for  book  value  of
approximately $4.4 million and 100,000 shares of SSE's common stock  valued
at  $9.06 per share, or $0.9 million, at January 26, 1996, and warrants  to
purchase  an additional 50,000 shares of SSE's common stock at  $11.09  per
share.

       Accordingly,  DME  and  Data  were  accounted  for  as  discontinued
operations.  The combined net sales of DME and Data totaled $108.1  million
(through January 26, 1996) and $180.8 million for Fiscal 1995. Net earnings
from  discontinued operations were $9.2 million (through January 26,  1996)
and $14.0 million for Fiscal 1995.

      Effective  February 25, 1996, the Company completed the  transfer  of
Harco,  Inc.  to Banner in exchange for 5,386,477 shares of  Banner  common
stock.  The  exchange increased the Company's ownership  of  Banner  common
stock  from approximately 47.2% to 59.3%, resulting in the Company becoming
the   majority  shareholder  of  Banner.  Accordingly,  the   Company   has
consolidated the results of Banner since February 25, 1996.  In June  1997,
the  Company  purchased $28.0 million of newly issued Series A  Convertible
Paid-in-Kind Preferred Stock of Banner.

</TABLE>

Consolidated Results

      Net  sales  of $741.2 million in 1998 increased by $60.4 million,  or
8.9%,  compared  to  sales  of $680.8 million in  1997.  Sales  growth  was
stimulated  by  the  resurgent commercial aerospace industry  and  business
acquisitions  over  the past 18 months, partially offset  by  the  loss  of
revenues   as   a   result  of  the  Banner  Hardware  Group   Disposition.
Approximately  15.8%  of  the  1998 sales  growth  was  stimulated  by  the
resurgent  commercial  aerospace industry. Recent acquisitions  contributed
approximately 8.7% to the sales growth, while dispositions decreased growth
by  approximately 15.0%. Net sales of $680.8 million in 1997  significantly
improved  by  $331.5  million, or 94.9%, compared to net  sales  of  $349.2
million  in  1996.  Sales growth was stimulated by the improved  commercial
aerospace industry, together with the effects of several strategic business
acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, net sales increased 30.5% and 37.1%  in
1997 and 1998, respectively, as compared to the previous Fiscal periods.

      Gross  Margin as a percentage of sales was 21.2%, 26.6% and 25.2%  in
1996,  1997,  and 1998, respectively. Decreased margins in the Fiscal  1998
period  was  attributable  to  a change in product  mix  in  the  Aerospace
Distribution  segment as a result of the Banner Hardware Group Disposition.
Partially offsetting overall lower margins were improved margins within the
Aerospace  Fasteners segment, resulting from efficiencies  associated  with
increased  production, improved skills of the work force, and reduction  in
the  payment of overtime. The increase in 1997 was attributable  to  higher
revenues combined with continued productivity improvements achieved  during
Fiscal 1997.

     Selling, General & Administrative expense as a percentage of sales was
22.7%,  21.0%, and 19.1% in Fiscal 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively.  The
improvement  in  Fiscal 1998 was attributable primarily  to  administrative
efficiencies allowed by increased sales. The improvement in Fiscal 1997 was
also   positively  affected  by  administrative  efficiencies  allowed   by
increased sales and also benefited from the positive results obtained  from
restructuring and downsizing programs put in place prior periods.

      Other income increased $6.5 million in 1998 as compared to 1997,  due
primarily  to  the  sale of air rights over a portion of the  property  the
Company owns and is developing in Farmingdale, New York.

       Operating  income  of $45.4 million in Fiscal 1998  increased  $11.9
million, or 35.7%, compared to operating income of $33.5 million in  Fiscal
1997.  The  increase in operating income was due primarily to the  improved
results  in the Company's Aerospace Fasteners segment. Operating income  of
$33.5  million in Fiscal 1997 increased $44.8 million compared to operating
loss  of  $11.3  million  in  Fiscal 1996.  The  Fiscal  1997  increase  in
operating  income  was  due  primarily to growth  in  sales  and  increased
operational efficiencies. On a pro forma basis, operating income  increased
$23.7 million in Fiscal 1998, compared to Fiscal 1997, and $24.7 million in
Fiscal 1997, compared to Fiscal 1996.

     Net interest expense decreased 10.4% in Fiscal 1998 compared to Fiscal
1997,  and  decreased  15.5% in Fiscal 1997 compared to  Fiscal  1996.  The
decreases  were due to a series of transactions that significantly  reduced
the Company's total debt. (See Recent Developments and Significant Business
Combinations in this section).

      Investment  income (loss), net, was $4.6 million, $6.7  million,  and
$(3.4)  million in 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively.  The $10.1  decrease
in  1998  was  due to recognition of unrealized losses on the  fair  market
adjustments  of investments previously classified as trading securities  in
the  Fiscal  1998  periods while recording unrealized  gains  from  trading
securities in the Fiscal 1997 periods. Unrealized holding gains (losses) on
available-for-sale   investments  are  marked  to  market   value   through
stockholders'  equity  and  reported separately as  part  of  comprehensive
income  (see discussion below). The 45.4% increase in Fiscal 1997  was  due
primarily to gains realized from the sale of investments in Fiscal 1997.

     Nonrecurring income of $124.0 million in 1998 resulted from the Banner
Hardware  Group Disposition. Nonrecurring income in 1997 includes the  $2.5
million gain from the sale of SBC.

      An income tax provision of $48.7 million in the first nine months  of
Fiscal 1998 represented a 39.4% effective tax rate on pre-tax earnings from
continuing  operations  (excluding equity in  earnings  of  affiliates  and
minority interest) of $123.4 million. The tax provision was slightly higher
than  the  statutory rate because of goodwill associated  with  the  Banner
Hardware  Group  Disposition,  which is not deductible  for  tax  purposes.
Income  taxes included a $5.7 million tax benefit in Fiscal 1997 on a  pre-
tax  loss  of $7.1 million from continuing operations. The tax benefit  was
due primarily to reversing Federal income taxes previously provided due  to
a change in the estimate of the required tax accruals.  In Fiscal 1996, the
tax benefit from the loss from continuing operations was $29.8 million.

      Equity  in  earnings of affiliates decreased $0.6  million  in  1998,
compared  to 1997, and $0.2 million in 1997, compared to 1996. The  current
year's  decrease  is  attributable to losses  recorded  by  small  start-up
ventures. The prior year's decrease was attributable to the lower  earnings
of Nacanco.

      Minority  interest increased by $22.8 million in  Fiscal  1998  as  a
result of the $124.0 million nonrecurring pre-tax gain recognized from  the
Banner Hardware Group Disposition.

      Included  in  earnings (loss) from discontinued  operations  are  the
results  of  Fairchild Technologies ("Technologies") through January  1998,
the  Company's equity in earnings of STFI prior to the STFI Merger, and the
results  of  FCS, DME and Data in Fiscal 1996. Losses increased  in  Fiscal
1998  as  a  result of increased losses recorded at Technologies and  lower
equity   earnings  contributed  by  STFI  (See  Note  4  to  the  Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements).

      In  1998, the Company recorded a $96.0 million gain, net of  tax,  on
disposal  of discontinued operations, from the proceeds received  from  the
STFI  Merger. Offsetting this gain was an after-tax charge of $36.2 million
the  Company recorded in connection with the adoption of a formal  plan  to
enhance the opportunities for disposition of Technologies. Included in this
charge  was  (i)  $28.2  million (net of an income  tax  benefit  of  $11.8
million)  relating to the net losses of Technologies since the  measurement
date,  including  the  write  down of assets for  impairment  to  estimated
realizable  value; and (ii) $8.0 million (net of an income tax  benefit  of
$4.8  million) relating to a provision for operating losses over  the  next
seven  months  at Technologies. The Company's results are affected  by  the
operations  of  Technologies,  which  may  fluctuate  because  of  industry
cyclicality,  the volume and timing of orders, the timing  of  new  product
shipments, customers' capital spending, and pricing changes by Technologies
and  its  competition.  Technologies has experienced  a  reduction  of  its
backlog,  and margin compression during the past year, which combined  with
the   existing  cost  base,  is  likely  to  impact  future  earnings  from
Technologies. While the Company believes that $36.1 million is a reasonable
charge  for  the  expected  losses in connection with  the  disposition  of
Technologies, there can be no assurance that this estimate is adequate.  In
Fiscal  1996,  the  Company recorded a $54.0 million gain  on  disposal  of
discontinued operations resulting from the sale of DME to CMI and a  $163.1
million nontaxable gain resulting from the Merger.

     In 1998, the Company recognized an extraordinary loss of $6.7 million,
net  of  tax,  to write-off the remaining deferred loan fees  and  original
issue  discounts  associated  with early extinguishment  of  the  Company's
indebtedness pursuant to the Public Debt Repayment and refinancing  of  the
FHC and RHI Credit Agreement facilities. In 1996, the Company recognized an
extraordinary  loss of $10.4 million, net of tax, as a result  of  premiums
paid,  redemption costs, consent fees, and the write off of  deferred  loan
fees  associated with the Senior Notes and bank debt extinguished prior  to
maturity.

      Net  earnings  of $101.1 million in 1998, improved by $99.8  million,
compared  to  the  $1.3  million  net  earnings  recorded  in  1997.   This
improvement  is  attributable  to a $11.9  million  increase  in  operating
income, a $124.0 million non-recurring gain from the Banner Hardware  Group
Disposition, and the $59.7 million net gain on the disposal of discontinued
operations. Partially offsetting this increase was a $54.4 million increase
in the income tax provision, a $22.8 million change in minority interest, a
$10.0  decrease  in  investment income, and the $6.7 million  extraordinary
loss.  Net earnings in 1997 improved $28.3 million, compared to 1996, after
excluding   the  $216.7  million  net  gain  on  disposal  of  discontinued
operations in 1996. The 1997 increase reflected a $44.8 million improvement
in operating profit.

     Comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation adjustments
and  unrealized  holding changes in the fair market value of available-for-
sale  investment  securities. The fair market value of  unrealized  holding
securities  increased $20.6 million in 1998, primarily as a  result  of  an
increase in the value of AlliedSignal common stock which was received  from
the Banner Hardware Group Disposition.

Segment Results

Aerospace Fasteners Segment

      Sales  in the Aerospace Fasteners segment increased by $118.2 million
to  $387.2  million,  up  43.9% in Fiscal 1998, compared  to  Fiscal  1997,
reflecting significant growth in the commercial aerospace industry combined
with  the  effect of acquisitions. New orders have continued to  be  strong
resulting  in  a  backlog of $209 million at June 30, 1998,  up  from  $196
million  at  June  30, 1997. Excluding sales contributed  by  acquisitions,
sales  increased approximately 21.9% in Fiscal 1998 compared to  the  prior
year.  Sales in the Aerospace Fasteners segment increased by $51.0  million
to  $269.0  million, up 23.4% in Fiscal 1997, compared to the  Fiscal  1996
period, reflecting significant growth in the commercial aerospace industry,
combined  with  the  Simmonds acquisition. On  a  pro  forma  basis,  sales
increased 43.9% in Fiscal 1998, compared to Fiscal 1997 and 36.5% in Fiscal
1997, compared to Fiscal 1996.

      Operating income improved by $15.3 million, or 88.2%, in Fiscal 1998,
compared   to   Fiscal  1997.  Acquisitions  and  marketing  changes   were
contributors  to  this  improvement.  Excluding  the  results  provided  by
acquisitions, operating income increased by approximately 30.8%  in  Fiscal
1998,  compared  to  the  same  period  in  the  prior  year.  The  Company
anticipates  that manufacturing and productivity efficiencies will  further
improve  operating income in the coming months. Operating  income  improved
from  breakeven  to  $17.4 million during Fiscal 1997, compared  to  Fiscal
1996.  This improvement was achieved as a result of accelerated  growth  in
the  commercial aerospace industry, particularly in the second half of  the
year.  Certain efficiencies achieved during Fiscal 1997 continued  to  have
positive  effects  on  operating income. On a pro  forma  basis,  operating
income increased $15.3 million in Fiscal 1998, as compared to Fiscal  1997,
and $20.0 million in Fiscal 1997, as compared to Fiscal 1996.

     The Company believes that the demand for aerospace fasteners in Fiscal
1999 will remain relatively high, given the forecasted build rates for  new
aircraft.  The Company anticipates that order rates may level off  in  late
calendar  1998. However, production volume should remain at  a  respectable
level  and  production efficiency improvements should allow the Company  to
generate an increase in profits.

Aerospace Distribution Segment

      Sales  in  the  Aerospace  Distribution segment  decreased  by  $53.3
million, or 13.0% in Fiscal 1998, compared to Fiscal 1997. The exclusion of
six  months'  revenues as a result of the Banner Hardware Group Disposition
was  primarily responsible for the decrease in the current year,  in  which
sales  otherwise  reflected  a robust aerospace industry.  Sales  increased
$281.8  million  from reporting twelve months of activity  in  Fiscal  1997
versus four months of activity in Fiscal 1996, when the Company became  the
majority shareholder of Banner and, accordingly, began consolidating  their
results.  On a twelve-month pro forma basis, sales increased $48.9 million,
or  27.4%,  in Fiscal 1998 compared to Fiscal 1997, and $33.4  million,  or
23.0%, in Fiscal 1997 compared to Fiscal 1996.

      Operating income decreased $10.6 million in Fiscal 1998, compared  to
Fiscal 1997, due to the Banner Hardware Group Disposition. Operating income
increased $25.3 million in 1997, compared to 1996, as a result of including
only  four months of activity after consolidation of Banner in 1996.  On  a
twelve-month  pro forma basis, operating income was stable in  Fiscal  1998
compared  to Fiscal 1997, and increased $4.9 million, or 99.5%,  in  Fiscal
1997 compared to Fiscal 1996.

      In  Fiscal  1996,  as a result of the transfer  of  Harco  to  Banner
effective February 25, 1996, the Company recorded four months of sales  and
operating  income  of  Banner, including Harco as  part  of  the  Aerospace
Distribution  segment.  This segment reported $130.0 million in  sales  and
$5.6 million in operating income for this four-month period ended June  30,
1996. In Fiscal 1996, the first eight months of Harco's sales and operating
income were included in the Aerospace Fasteners segment.

Corporate and Other

      The  Corporate  and  Other classification includes  the  Gas  Springs
Division  and corporate activities. The results of SBC, which was  sold  at
Fiscal 1997 year-end, are included in the prior period results.  The  group
reported a decrease in sales of $9.4 million, in 1998, as compared to 1997,
due  to the exclusion of SBC's results in the current year. Sales increased
in  1997  as a result of improved results contributed by SBC. The operating
loss  decreased  by  $7.2 million in 1998, compared to Fiscal  1997,  as  a
result  of  an  increase in other income and a decrease in legal  expenses.
Over the past three years, corporate administrative expense as a percentage
of sales has decreased from 4.5% in 1996 to 2.8% in 1997 to 2.2% in 1998.


FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

      Total  capitalization as of June 30, 1998 and 1997 amounted to $789.6
million  and  $696.7 million, respectively. The changes  in  capitalization
included a decrease in debt of $148.2 million and an increase in equity  of
$241.1  million.  The  decrease in debt was primarily  the  result  of  the
Refinancing and repayment of outstanding term loans with approximately $194
million of AlliedSignal Inc. common stock received from the Banner Hardware
Group  Disposition, partially offset by additional borrowings. The increase
in  equity  was  due to (i) Fiscal 1998 net income of $101.1 million,  (ii)
$53.3  million  in  net  proceeds received from the Offering,  (iii)  $64.5
million  of  Class  A Common Stock issued in connection with  the  Exchange
Offering  and  the  Special-T acquisition, and (iv) the $20.6  million  net
unrealized   gain   recorded  on  the  appreciation  of  available-for-sale
securities.

      The  Company  maintains  a  portfolio of  investments  classified  as
available-for-sale  securities, which had a fair  market  value  of  $238.2
million  at  June 30, 1998. Although the market value of these  investments
appreciated  $20.6  million in Fiscal 1998, there is risk  associated  with
market  fluctuations  inherent to stock investments. Additionally,  because
the  Company's  portfolio is small and predominately consists  of  a  large
position  in  AlliedSignal common stock, large swings in the value  of  the
portfolio should be expected.

      Net  cash used by operating activities for the Fiscal 1998  and  1997
amounted  to  $102.5 million and $100.1 million, respectively. The  primary
use  of  cash  for operating activities in Fiscal 1998 was an  increase  in
inventories from continuing operations of $54.9 million. The primary use of
cash  for  operating activities in fiscal 1997 was an increase in  accounts
receivable  of  $48.7 million and inventories of $36.9  million  which  was
mainly to support the Company's sales growth.

      Net  cash provided from investing activities for Fiscal 1998 and 1997
amounted to $60.9 million and $80.0 million, respectively. In Fiscal  1998,
the  sale  of  discontinued  operations,  including  the  STFI  Disposition
provided the primary source of cash from investing activities amounting  to
$168.0   million,  which  was  slightly  offset  by  the   acquisition   of
subsidiaries  in the amount of $32.8 million. In Fiscal 1997,  the  primary
source  of  cash  from  investing activities was the sale  of  discontinued
operations, including DME, of $173.7 million, which was slightly offset  by
the acquisition of subsidiaries in the amount of $55.9 million.

      Net  cash provided by (used for) financing activities for the  Fiscal
1998  and  1997 amounted to $74.1 million and $(1.5) million, respectively.
Cash  provided by financing activities in fiscal 1998 included the issuance
$53.8  million  of  stock  from the Offering and $275.5  million  from  the
issuance  of additional debt partially offset by the repayment of debt  and
the repurchase of debentures of $258.0 million. The primary use of cash for
financing activities in Fiscal 1997 was cash used for the repayment of debt
and  the repurchase of debentures of $155.6 million offset by proceeds from
the issuance of additional debt of $154.3 million.

      The  Company's  principal  cash requirements  include  debt  service,
capital expenditures, acquisitions, and payment of other liabilities. Other
liabilities  that require the use of cash include post-employment  benefits
for  retirees, environmental investigation and remediation obligations, and
litigation settlements and related costs.  The Company expects that cash on
hand,  cash generated from operations, and cash from borrowings  and  asset
sales will be adequate to satisfy cash requirements.

     With the proceeds of the Offering, borrowings under the Facility and a
portion  of  the  after  tax proceeds the Company received  from  the  STFI
Merger,   the   Company  refinanced  substantially  all  of  its   existing
indebtedness (other than indebtedness at Banner), consisting of the 11 7/8%
Senior  Debentures due 1999, the 12% Intermediate Debentures due 2001,  the
13  1/8%  Subordinated  Debentures due 2006, the  13%  Junior  Subordinated
debentures  due  2007 and its existing bank indebtedness.  The  Refinancing
reduced  the Company's total net indebtedness by approximately $132 million
and reduced the Company's annual interest expense, on a pro forma basis, by
approximately  $21 million. The completion of the STFI Merger  reduced  the
Company's annual interest expense by approximately $3 million. In addition,
a  portion of the proceeds from the Banner Hardware Group Disposition  were
used  to repay all of Banner's outstanding bank indebtedness, which further
reduced the Company's annual interest expense.

      For the Company's fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998, Technologies had
pre-tax  operating losses of approximately $1.5 million, $3.6 million,  and
$48.7  million, respectively. In addition, as a result of the  downturn  in
the   Asian  markets,  Technologies  has  experienced  delivery  deferrals,
reduction in new orders, lower margins and increased price competition.  In
response,  in February 1998, the Company adopted a formal plan  to  enhance
the  opportunities for the disposition of Technologies, while improving the
ability  of  Technologies to operate more efficiently. The plan includes  a
reduction  in production capacity, work force, and the pursuit of potential
vertical and horizontal integration with peers and competitors of  the  two
divisions that constitute Technologies, or the inclusion of those divisions
in  a  spin-off.  If the Company elects to include Technologies in a  spin-
off,  the  Company  believes  that  it  would  be  required  to  contribute
substantial  additional  resources  to  allow  Technologies  the  liquidity
necessary  to  sustain and grow both the Fairchild Technologies'  operating
divisions.

      The  Company  is considering a transaction designed to  separate  the
aerospace fasteners business of the Company from the aerospace distribution
and  other  businesses  of the Company. The transaction  would  consist  of
distributing  (the "Spin-Off") to its shareholders all of the  stock  of  a
subsidiary to be formed ("Spin-Co"), consisting of the Company's  aerospace
fasteners  segment.  The  Spin-Off would result in  the  formation  of  two
publicly  traded  companies,  each of which would  be  able  to  pursue  an
independent  strategic  path. The Company believes  this  separation  would
offer  both  companies  the  opportunity  to  pursue  strategic  objectives
appropriate  to different businesses and to create targeted incentives  for
their  management  and key employees. In addition, the  Spin-Off  would  be
expected  to  offer  each  entity greater financial  flexibility  in  their
respective capital raising strategies.

      The  Company  has conditioned the Spin-Off distribution  upon,  among
other  things,  (i) approval of the Spin-Off by the Company's shareholders;
(ii)  receiving confirmation that the distribution will qualify as  a  tax-
free transaction under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended;  (iii) the transfer of assets and liabilities contemplated  by  an
agreement  to be entered into between the Company and Spin-Co  having  been
consummated in all material respects; (iv) the Spin-Co Class A Common Stock
having been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange; (v) a Form
10  registration  statement with respect to Spin-Co Class  A  Common  Stock
becoming  effective under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as  amended;
and  (vi)  receipt  of  a satisfactory solvency opinion  for  each  entity.
Although  the  Company's ability to effect the Spin-Off is  uncertain,  the
Company  may  effect  the Spin-Off as soon as it is reasonably  practicable
following receipt of the aforementioned items relating to Spin-Co  and  all
necessary  governmental and third party approvals.  In order to effect  the
Spin-Off, approval is required from the board of directors of the  Company.
The  composition of the assets and liabilities to be included  in  Spin-Co,
and  accordingly the ability of the Company to consummate the Spin-Off,  is
contingent, among other things, on obtaining consents and waivers under the
Company's  New  Credit  Facility.  In addition, the Company  may  encounter
unexpected  delays in effecting the Spin-Off, and the Company can  make  no
assurance  as to the timing thereof. In addition, prior to the consummation
of  the Spin-Off, the Company may sell, restructure or otherwise change the
assets and liabilities that will be in Spin-Co, or for other reasons  elect
not  to  consummate  the  Spin-Off. Because circumstances  may  change  and
because provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may be
further  amended from time to time, the Company may, depending  on  various
factors,  restructure or delay the timing of the Spin-Off to  minimize  the
tax consequences thereof to the Company and its shareholders. Consequently,
there can be no assurance that the Spin-Off will ever occur.

Year 2000

      As  the end of the century nears, there is a widespread concern  that
many  existing computer programs that use only the last two digits to refer
to  a  year will not properly recognize a year that begins with the  digits
"20"  instead of "19."  If not corrected, many computer applications  could
fail,  create  erroneous results, or cause unanticipated systems  failures,
among  other problems.  The Company has begun to take appropriate  measures
to  ensure that its information processing systems, embedded technology and
other infrastructure will be ready for the Year 2000.

      The  Company  has  retained both technical  review  and  modification
consultants to help it assess its Year 2000 readiness.  Working with  these
consultants  and  other  advisors, the Company has  formulated  a  plan  to
address Year 2000 issues.  Under this plan, the Company's systems are being
modified  or  replaced, or will be modified or replaced, as  necessary,  to
render them, as far as possible, Year 2000 ready.  Substantially all of the
material systems within the Aerospace Fasteners segment are currently  Year
2000  ready.   Within the Aerospace Distribution segment and  at  Fairchild
Technologies,  the  Company intends to replace  and  upgrade  a  number  of
important  systems that are not Year 2000 compliant, and is  assessing  the
extent to which current product inventories may include embedded technology
that  is  not  Year  2000 ready.  The Company expects to  complete  initial
testing of its most critical information technology and related systems  by
June  30,  1999,  and  anticipates that it  will  complete  its  Year  2000
preparations  by  October  31,  1999.  The  Company  could  be  subject  to
liability to customers and other third parties if its systems are not  Year
2000 compliant, resulting in possible legal actions for breach of contract,
breach  or warranty, misrepresentation, unlawful trade practices and  other
harm.

     In addition, the Company is continually attempting to assess the level
of Year 2000 preparedness of its key suppliers, distributors, customers and
service providers.  To this end, the Company has sent, and will continue to
send,  letters,  questionnaires and surveys  to  its  significant  business
partners  inquiring  about  their  Year 2000  efforts.   If  a  significant
business  partner  of  the  Company fails to be Year  2000  compliant,  the
Company  could  suffer  a  material loss  of  business  or  incur  material
expenses.

      The  Company is also developing and evaluating contingency  plans  to
deal  with  events  affecting the Company or one of its  business  partners
arising  from  significant  Year 2000 problems.   These  contingency  plans
include  identifying  alternative  suppliers,  distribution  networks   and
service providers.

      Although  the  Company's  Year  2000 assessment,  implementation  and
contingency planning is not yet complete, the Company does not now  believe
that  Year  2000  issues will materially affect its  business,  results  of
operations  or  financial  condition.  However,  the  Company's  Year  2000
efforts  may not be successful in every respect.  To date, the Company  has
incurred approximately $0.3 million in costs that are directly attributable
to  addressing Year 2000 issues.  Management currently estimates  that  the
Company  will  incur  between $2.0 million and $3.0 million  in  additional
costs during the next 18 months relating to the Year 2000 problem.


RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement   of   Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  131  ("SFAS   131")
"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." SFAS
131   supersedes  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.   14
"Financial  Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise"  and  requires
that  a  public  company report certain information  about  its  reportable
operating  segments  in annual and interim financial  reports.   Generally,
financial information is required to be reported on the basis that is  used
internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to  allocate
resources to segments.  The Company will adopt SFAS 131 in Fiscal 1999.

      In  February 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 132 ("SFAS 132") "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions  and
Other  Postretirement  Benefits."   SFAS  132  revises  and  improves   the
effectiveness  of  current  note  disclosure  requirements  for  employers'
pensions and other retiree benefits by requiring additional information  to
facilitate financial analysis and eliminating certain disclosures which are
no  longer  useful.  SFAS 132 does not address recognition  or  measurement
issues. The Company will adopt SFAS 132 in Fiscal 1999.

      In  June  1998,  the  FASB issued Statement of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 133 ("SFAS 133") "Accounting for Derivative Instruments  and
Hedging  Activities." SFAS 133 establishes a new model for  accounting  for
derivatives  and hedging activities and supersedes and amends a  number  of
existing  accounting  standards.   It  requires  that  all  derivatives  be
recognized  as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and measured  at
fair  value.   The  corresponding derivative gains or losses  are  reported
based  on the hedge relationship that exists, if any.  Changes in the  fair
value  of hedges that are not designated as hedges or that do not meet  the
hedge  accounting  criteria  in SFAS 133 are required  to  be  reported  in
earnings.   Most  of the general qualifying criteria for  hedge  accounting
under  SFAS  133  were  derived  from, and are  similar  to,  the  existing
qualifying  criteria in SFAS 80 "Accounting for Futures  Contracts."   SFAS
133 describes three primary types of hedge relationships: fair value hedge,
cash  flow  hedge, and foreign currency hedge. The Company will adopt  SFAS
133  in  Fiscal  1999  and is currently evaluating the financial  statement
impact.

                 Report of Independent Public Accountants



To The Fairchild Corporation:

      We  have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of  The
Fairchild   Corporation   (a   Delaware   corporation)   and   consolidated
subsidiaries  as  of  June 30, 1997 and 1998, and the related  consolidated
statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
three  years  in  the  period ended June 30, 1996, 1997  and  1998.   These
financial  statements  are the responsibility of the Company's  management.
Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements
based  on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of  Nacanco
Paketleme  (see  Note  7),  the investment in which  is  reflected  in  the
accompanying  financial statements using the equity method  of  accounting.
The investment in Nacanco Paketleme represents 2 percent of total assets as
of  June 30, 1998 and 1997, and the equity in its net income represents  17
percent, 257 percent, and 9 percent of earnings from continuing operations.
The  statements  of Nacanco Paketleme were audited by other auditors  whose
report  has been furnished to us and our opinion, insofar as it relates  to
the amounts included for Nacanco Paketleme, is based on the report of other
auditors.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.   Those standards require that we plan and perform an  audit  to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of  material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test  basis,
evidence   supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in   the   financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and  significant  estimates made by management, as well as  evaluating  the
overall  financial  statement presentation.  We  believe  that  our  audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors,
the  financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects,   the  financial  position  of  The  Fairchild  Corporation   and
consolidated subsidiaries as of June 30, 1997 and 1998, and the results  of
their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years  in  the
period  ended  June 30, 1996, 1997 and 1998, in conformity  with  generally
accepted accounting principles.

          THE FAIRCHILD CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   (In thousands, except per share data)


1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

      Corporate  Structure:  The Fairchild Corporation (the "Company")  was
incorporated in October 1969, under the laws of the State of Delaware.  The
Company  is  the majority owner of Banner Aerospace, Inc., ("Banner").  RHI
Holdings, Inc. ("RHI") is a direct subsidiary of the Company.  RHI  is  the
owner  of  100% of Fairchild Holding Corp. ("FHC"). The Company's principal
operations are conducted through FHC and Banner.  The Company also holds  a
significant  equity  interest in Nacanco Paketleme  ("Nacanco").  Prior  to
March  10, 1998, the Company held an equity interest in Shared Technologies
Fairchild Inc. ("STFI"). The Company's investment in STFI resulted  from  a
March 13, 1996 Merger of the Communications Services Segment of the Company
with   Shared  Technologies,  Inc.  The  merger  of  STFI  into  Intermedia
Communications  Inc., as discussed in Note 4, completes the disposition  of
the  Communications Services Segment. In February 1998, the Company adopted
a  formal  plan  to  dispose of its interest in the Fairchild  Technologies
segment.   Accordingly,  the  Company's financial  statements  present  the
results   of  the  Communications  Services  Segment,  STFI  and  Fairchild
Technologies as discontinued operations.

      Fiscal Year:  The fiscal year ("Fiscal") of the Company ends June 30.
All  references herein to "1996", "1997", and "1998" mean the fiscal  years
ended June 30, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.

       Consolidation   Policy:  The  accompanying  consolidated   financial
statements  are  prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting
principles  and include the accounts of the Company and all of its  wholly-
owned   and  majority-owned  subsidiaries.   All  significant  intercompany
accounts   and   transactions  have  been  eliminated   in   consolidation.
Investments in companies in which ownership interest range from  20  to  50
percent are accounted for using the equity method (see Note 7).

      Cash  Equivalents/Statements of Cash  Flows:   For  purposes  of  the
Statements  of  Cash  Flows,  the  Company  considers  all  highly   liquid
investments  with original maturity dates of three months or less  as  cash
equivalents.  Total net cash disbursements (receipts) made by  the  Company
for income taxes and interest were as follows:

 Interest                    $66,716 $48,567  $52,737
 Income Taxes                  9,279  (1,926)   (987)
</TABLE>

     Restricted Cash: On June 30, 1997 and 1998, the Company had restricted
cash  of  $4,839  and  $746, respectively, all of which  is  maintained  as
collateral for certain debt facilities.  Cash investments are in short-term
certificates of deposit.

      Investments: Management determines the appropriate classification  of
its   investments   at  the  time  of  acquisition  and  reevaluates   such
determination at each balance sheet date.  Trading securities  are  carried
at  fair  value,  with  unrealized holding gains  and  losses  included  in
earnings.   Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair  value,  with
unrealized  holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported  as  a  separate
component  of  stockholders' equity.  Investments in equity securities  and
limited partnerships that do not have readily determinable fair values  are
stated at cost and are categorized as other investments. Realized gains and
losses are determined using the specific identification method based on the
trade date of a transaction.  Interest on corporate obligations, as well as
dividends on preferred stock, are accrued at the balance sheet date.

      Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost  or  market.
Cost  is  determined  using  the  last-in,  first-out  ("LIFO")  method  at
principal  domestic aerospace fastener manufacturing operations  and  using
the  first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method elsewhere.  If the FIFO  inventory
valuation  method had been used exclusively, inventories  would  have  been
approximately  $4,868  and  $8,706  higher  at  June  30,  1997  and  1998,
respectively.   Inventories  from  continuing  operations  are  valued   as
follows:

</TABLE>

     Properties and Depreciation: The cost of property, plant and equipment
is  depreciated over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The cost
of  leasehold improvements is depreciated over the lesser of the length  of
the   related  leases  or  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  the   assets.
Depreciation  is  computed  using the straight-line  method  for  financial
reporting  purposes and using accelerated depreciation methods for  Federal
income  tax  purposes.  No interest costs were capitalized in  any  of  the
years presented.  Property, plant and equipment consisted of the following:

</TABLE>

     Amortization of Goodwill: Goodwill, which represents the excess of the
cost  of  purchased businesses over the fair value of their net  assets  at
dates  of acquisition, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over  40
years.

      Deferred Loan Costs: Deferred loan costs associated with various debt
issues are being amortized over the terms of the related debt, based on the
amount   of   outstanding  debt,  using  the  effective  interest   method.
Amortization  expense  for these loan costs for 1996,  1997  and  1998  was
$3,827, $2,847 and $2,406, respectively.

      Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: In Fiscal 1997, the Company  adopted
Statement   of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  121  ("SFAS   121"),
"Accounting  for  the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  and  for  Long-Lived
Assets  to Be Disposed Of".  SFAS 121 establishes accounting standards  for
the  impairment of long-lived assets, certain identifiable intangibles, and
goodwill  related to those assets to be held and used, and  for  long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of.  The Company
reviews  its  long-lived assets, including property, plant  and  equipment,
identifiable  intangibles and goodwill, for impairment whenever  events  or
changes  in  circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the  assets
may  not  be fully recoverable.  To determine recoverability of  its  long-
lived assets the Company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted
net  cash  flows  will  be less than the carrying  amount  of  the  assets.
Impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying  amount
of  the assets and fair value.  The implementation of SFAS 121 did not have
a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations.

       Foreign   Currency  Translation:  For  foreign  subsidiaries   whose
functional  currency is the local foreign currency, balance sheet  accounts
are  translated  at exchange rates in effect at the end of the  period  and
income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for  the
period.   The  resulting translation gains and losses  are  included  as  a
separate  component of stockholders' equity.  Foreign currency  transaction
gains  and  losses  are included in other income and were insignificant  in
Fiscal 1996, 1997 and 1998.

      Research  and Development: Company-sponsored research and development
expenditures are expensed as incurred.

     Capitalization of interest and taxes: The Company capitalizes interest
expense and property taxes relating to property being developed.

      Nonrecurring Income: Nonrecurring income of $124,028 in 1998 resulted
from disposition of Banner hardware group (See Note 2). Nonrecurring income
of  $2,528  in  1997  resulted from the gain  recorded  from  the  sale  of
Fairchild  Scandinavian  Bellyloading  Company  ("SBC"),  (See   Note   2).
Nonrecurring  expense in 1996 resulted from expenses incurred  in  1996  in
connection  with  other,  alternative  transactions  considered   but   not
consummated.

      Stock-Based  Compensation: In Fiscal 1997,  the  Company  implemented
Statement   of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  123  ("SFAS   123"),
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation".  SFAS 123 establishes  financial
accounting  standards for stock-based employee compensation plans  and  for
transactions in which an entity issues equity instruments to acquire  goods
or services from non-employees.  As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company will
continue  to use the intrinsic value based method of accounting  prescribed
by  APB  Opinion  No. 25, for its stock-based employee compensation  plans.
Fair market disclosures required by SFAS 123 are included in Note 12.

      Use  of  Estimates:   The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in
conformity   with   generally  accepted  accounting   principles   requires
management  to  make  estimates and assumptions that  affect  the  reported
amounts  of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets  and
liabilities  at  the  date  of the financial statements  and  the  reported
amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses during the reporting  period.   Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

       Reclassifications:  Certain  amounts  in  prior   years'   financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the 1998 presentation.

     Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In June 1997, the Financial
Accounting   Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued  Statement   of   Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131 ("SFAS 131") "Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise  and  Related  Information." SFAS 131  supersedes  Statement  of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 14 "Financial Reporting for Segments  of
a  Business  Enterprise" and requires that a public company report  certain
information  about its reportable operating segments in annual and  interim
financial  reports.  Generally, financial information  is  required  to  be
reported  on  the  basis  that is used internally  for  evaluating  segment
performance  and  deciding  how to allocate  resources  to  segments.   The
Company will adopt SFAS 131 in Fiscal 1999.

      In  February 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 132 ("SFAS 132") "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions  and
Other  Postretirement  Benefits."   SFAS  132  revises  and  improves   the
effectiveness  of  current  note  disclosure  requirements  for  employers'
pensions and other retiree benefits by requiring additional information  to
facilitate financial analysis and eliminating certain disclosures which are
no  longer  useful.  SFAS 132 does not address recognition  or  measurement
issues. The Company will adopt SFAS 132 in Fiscal 1999.

      In  June  1998,  the  FASB issued Statement of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 133 ("SFAS 133") "Accounting for Derivative Instruments  and
Hedging  Activities." SFAS 133 establishes a new model for  accounting  for
derivatives  and hedging activities and supersedes and amends a  number  of
existing  accounting  standards.   It  requires  that  all  derivatives  be
recognized  as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and measured  at
fair  value.   The  corresponding derivative gains or losses  are  reported
based  on the hedge relationship that exists, if any.  Changes in the  fair
value  of derivative that are not designated as hedges or that do not  meet
the  hedge  accounting criteria in SFAS 133 are required to be reported  in
earnings.   Most  of the general qualifying criteria for  hedge  accounting
under  SFAS  133  were  derived  from, and are  similar  to,  the  existing
qualifying  criteria in SFAS 80 "Accounting for Futures  Contracts."   SFAS
133 describes three primary types of hedge relationships: fair value hedge,
cash  flow  hedge, and foreign currency hedge. The Company will adopt  SFAS
133  in  Fiscal  1999  and is currently evaluating the financial  statement
impact.

2.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

      The Company has accounted for the following acquisitions by using the
purchase  method.   The respective purchase price is assigned  to  the  net
assets  acquired based on the fair value of such assets and liabilities  at
the respective acquisition dates.

      In  December 1997, the Company acquired AS+C GmbH, Aviation Supply  +
Consulting ("AS&C") in a business combination accounted for as a  purchase.
The  total  cost  of the acquisition was $13,245, which exceeded  the  fair
value  of  the  net  assets  of  AS&C by  approximately  $7,350,  which  is
preliminarily being allocated as goodwill and amortized using the straight-
line method over 40 years. The Company purchased AS&C with cash borrowings.
AS&C  is  an aerospace parts, logistics, and distribution company primarily
servicing the European OEM market.

      On  March 2, 1998, the Company consummated the acquisition of Edwards
and  Lock  Management  Corporation, doing business as  Special-T  Fasteners
("Special-T"), in a business combination to be accounted for as a  purchase
(the  "Special-T  Acquisition"). The contractual  purchase  price  for  the
acquisition was valued at approximately $47,300, of which 50.1% was paid in
shares  of Class A Common Stock of the Company and 49.9% was paid in  cash.
The total cost of the acquisition exceeded the fair value of the net assets
of  Special-T by approximately $21,605, which amount is preliminarily being
allocated as goodwill, and amortized using the straight-line method over 40
years.   Special-T  manages  the  logistics of  worldwide  distribution  of
Company  manufactured  precision fasteners to customers  in  the  aerospace
industry,  government agencies, original equipment manufacturers ("OEM's"),
and other distributors.

      In  February 1997, the Company completed a transaction (the "Simmonds
Acquisition")  pursuant  to which the Company acquired  common  shares  and
convertible debt representing an 84.2% interest, on a fully diluted  basis,
of Simmonds S.A. ("Simmonds"). The Company then initiated a tender offer to
purchase the remaining shares and convertible debt held by the public.   By
June  30,  1997,  the Company had purchased, or placed sufficient  cash  in
escrow  to  purchase,  all  the remaining shares and  convertible  debt  of
Simmonds. The total purchase price of Simmonds, including the assumption of
debt,  was  approximately $62,000, which the Company funded with  available
cash and borrowings. The Company recorded approximately $20,453 in goodwill
as a result of this acquisition, which will be amortized using the straight-
line   method   over  40  years.  Simmonds  is  one  of  Europe's   leading
manufacturers and distributors of aerospace and automotive fasteners.

       On   January   13,   1998,   certain  subsidiaries   (the   "Selling
Subsidiaries"),  of Banner, completed the disposition of substantially  all
of  the  assets and certain liabilities of the Selling Subsidiaries to  two
wholly-owned subsidiaries of AlliedSignal Inc. (the "Buyers"), in  exchange
for  shares of AlliedSignal Inc. common stock with an aggregate value equal
to  $369,000 (the "Banner Hardware Group Disposition"). The purchase  price
received  by  the  Selling Subsidiaries was based on the  consolidated  net
worth as reflected on an adjusted closing date balance sheet for the assets
(and  liabilities) conveyed by the Selling Subsidiaries to the Buyers.  The
assets  transferred  to the Buyers consist primarily of  Banner's  hardware
group,  which  includes the distribution of bearings, nuts, bolts,  screws,
rivets  and  other  type of fasteners, and its PacAero unit.  Approximately
$196,000  of  the common stock received from the Buyers was used  to  repay
outstanding  term  loans of Banner's subsidiaries  and  related  fees.  The
Company  will  account  for its remaining investment in  AlliedSignal  Inc.
common  stock as an available-for-sale security. Banner effected the Banner
Hardware  Group Disposition to concentrate its efforts on the rotables  and
jet  engine  businesses and because the Banner Hardware  Group  Disposition
presented  a  unique  opportunity to realize a significant  return  on  the
disposition of the hardware group. As a result of the Banner Hardware Group
Disposition  and  the  repayment of outstanding  term  loans,  the  Company
recorded non-recurring income of $124,028 for the year ended June 30, 1998.

      On  June  30,  1997,  the Company sold all the patents  of  Fairchild
Scandinavian   Bellyloading  Company  ("SBC")  to   Teleflex   Incorporated
("Teleflex") for $5,000, and immediately thereafter sold all the  stock  of
SBC  to a wholly owned subsidiary of Teleflex for $2,000.  The Company  may
also  receive additional proceeds of up to $7,000 based on future net sales
of SBC's patented products and services.

3.  MINORITY INTEREST IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

      Effective February 25, 1996, the Company completed a transfer of  the
Company's  Harco  Division ("Harco") to Banner in  exchange  for  5,386,477
shares  of  Banner  common  stock.  The exchange  increased  the  Company's
ownership  of  Banner  common  stock from  approximately  47.2%  to  59.3%,
resulting  in  the  Company becoming the majority  shareholder  of  Banner.
Accordingly,  the  Company has consolidated the  results  of  Banner  since
February  25,  1996.   The Company recorded a $427 nonrecurring  loss  from
outside expenses incurred for this transaction in 1996.

      In May 1997, Banner granted all of its stockholders certain rights to
purchase Series A Convertible Paid-in-Kind Preferred Stock.  In June  1997,
Banner  received  net  proceeds of $33,876 and issued 3,710,955  shares  of
preferred  stock.   The Company purchased $28,390 of  the  preferred  stock
issued by Banner, increasing its voting percentage to 64.0%.

  On  May  11,  1998,  the  Company commenced an  offer  to  exchange  (the
"Exchange  Offer"),  for each properly tendered share of  Common  Stock  of
Banner, a number of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value
$0.10 per share, equal to the quotient of $12.50 divided by $20.675 up to a
maximum  of  4,000,000 shares of Banner's Common Stock. The Exchange  Offer
expired on June 9, 1998 and 3,659,364 shares of Banner's Common Stock  were
validly tendered for exchange and the Company issued 2,212,361 shares Class
A  Common  Stock to the tendering shareholders. As a result of the Exchange
Offer,  the Company's ownership of Banner Common Stock increased to  83.3%.
The Company effected the Exchange Offer to increase its ownership of Banner
to  more than 80% in order for the Company to include Banner in its  United
States consolidated corporate income tax return.

      On  June  30, 1998, the Company had $31,674 of minority interest,  of
which  $31,665 represents Banner.  Minority shareholders hold approximately
16.7% of Banner's outstanding common stock.

      In  connection  with  the Company's December 23,  1993  sale  of  its
interest  in Rexnord Corporation to BTR Dunlop Holdings, Inc. ("BTR"),  the
Company  placed shares of Banner, with a fair market value  of  $5,000,  in
escrow  to secure the Company's remaining indemnification of BTR against  a
contingent  liability.   Once  the contingent liability  is  resolved,  the
escrow will be released.

4.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND NET ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

      The  Company,  RHI  and  Fairchild Industries,  Inc.  ("FII"),  RHI's
subsidiary,  entered  into an Agreement and Plan  of  Merger  dated  as  of
November  9,  1995  (as  amended,  the  "Merger  Agreement")  with   Shared
Technologies  Inc.  ("STI").  On March 13, 1996,  in  accordance  with  the
Merger  Agreement,  STI  succeeded to the  telecommunications  systems  and
services   business   segment   operated   by   the   Company's   Fairchild
Communications Services Company ("FCSC").

     The transaction was effected by a Merger of FII with and into STI (the
"Merger") with the surviving company renamed Shared Technologies Fairchild,
Inc  ("STFI").  Prior to the Merger, FII transferred all of its assets  to,
and  all of its liabilities were assumed by FHC, except for the assets  and
liabilities  of FCSC, and $223,500 of FII debt and preferred stock.   As  a
result  of  the  Merger, the Company received shares of  Common  Stock  and
Preferred Stock of STFI representing approximately a 41% ownership interest
in  STFI.  The  Merger  was  structured as a reorganization  under  section
386(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In 1996, the
Company recorded a $163,130 gain from this transaction.

      On  November  20,  1997, STFI entered into a  merger  agreement  with
Intermedia Communications Inc. ("Intermedia") pursuant to which holders  of
STFI  common  stock received $15.00 per share in cash (the "STFI  Merger").
The Company was paid approximately $178,000 in cash (before tax and selling
expenses) in exchange for the common and preferred stock of STFI  owned  by
the Company.  In the nine months ended March 29, 1998, the Company recorded
a  $95,960  gain, net of tax, on disposal of discontinued operations,  from
the  proceeds received from the STFI Merger, which was completed  on  March
11,  1998.  The  results of STFI have been accounted  for  as  discontinued
operations.

      The  results of FCSC and STFI have been accounted for as discontinued
operations.  The net sales of FCSC totaled, $91,290 in 1996.  Net  earnings
from discontinued operations from FCSC and STFI was $7,901 $3,149, and $648
in 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively.

      For  the  Company's  fiscal  years 1996, 1997,  and  1998,  Fairchild
Technologies ("Technologies") had pre-tax operating losses of approximately
$1.5  million, $3.6 million, and $48.7 million, respectively. In  addition,
as  a  result  of  the  downturn  in the Asian  markets,  Technologies  has
experienced delivery deferrals, reduction in new orders, lower margins  and
increased   price  competition.  In  response,  in  February,   1998   (the
"measurement  date"),  the Company adopted a formal  plan  to  enhance  the
opportunities for disposition of Technologies, while improving the  ability
of  Technologies to operate more efficiently. The plan includes a reduction
in  production capacity and headcount at Technologies, and the  pursuit  of
potential vertical and horizontal integration with peers and competitors of
the  two divisions that constitute Technologies, or the inclusion of  those
divisions in a spin-off. If the Company elects to include Technologies in a
spin-off,  the  Company  believes that it would be required  to  contribute
substantial  additional  resources  to  allow  Technologies  the  liquidity
necessary  to  sustain and grow both the Fairchild Technologies'  operating
divisions.

      In connection with the adoption of such plan, the Company recorded an
after-tax charge of $36,243 in discontinued operations in Fiscal  1998,  of
which,  $28,243 (net of an income tax benefit of $11,772) relating  to  the
net  losses of Technologies since the measurement date, including the write
down  of  assets  for impairment to estimated realizable  value;  and  (ii)
$8,000 (net of an income tax benefit of $4,806) relating to a provision for
operating  losses  over  the next seven months at Technologies.  While  the
Company  believes  that  $36,243 is a reasonable charge  for  the  expected
losses in connection with the disposition of Technologies, there can be  no
assurance that this estimate is adequate.

     Earnings from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended June
30,  1996, 1997, and 1998 includes net losses of $1,475, $3,634 and $4,944,
respectively, from Technologies until the adoption date of a formal plan on
the measurement date.

      On  February 22, 1996, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement  dated
January  26, 1996, the Company, through one of its subsidiaries,  completed
the  sale  of  certain assets, liabilities and the business  of  the  D-M-E
Company  ("DME") to Cincinnati Milacron Inc. ("CMI"), for a sales price  of
approximately $244,331, as adjusted.  The sales price consisted of  $74,000
in  cash, and two 8% promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount  of
$170,331  (together, the "8% CMI Notes").  On July 29, 1996,  CMI  paid  in
full  the 8% CMI Notes. As a result of the sale of DME in 1996, the Company
recorded  a  gain  on disposal of discontinued operations of  approximately
$54,012, net of a $61,929 tax provision.

      On  January  27,  1996,  FII completed the  sale  of  Fairchild  Data
Corporation  ("Data")  to  SSE Telecom, Inc.  ("SSE")  for  book  value  of
approximately  $4,400 and 100,000 shares of SSE's common  stock  valued  at
$9.06 per share, or $906, at January 26, 1996, and warrants to purchase  an
additional 50,000 shares of SSE's common stock at $11.09 per share.

      Accordingly, the results of DME and Data have been accounted  for  as
discontinued  operations.  The combined net sales of DME and  Data  totaled
$108,131  for 1996. Net earnings from discontinued operations  was  $9,186,
net of $5,695 for taxes in 1996.

      Net  assets held for sale at June 30, 1998, includes two  parcels  of
real estate in California, and several other parcels of real estate located
primarily throughout the continental United States, which the Company plans
to   sell,  lease  or  develop,  subject  to  the  resolution  of   certain
environmental matters and market conditions.  Also included in  net  assets
held  for  sale  are  limited partnership interests in (i)  a  real  estate
development joint venture, and (ii) a landfill development partnership.

      Net  assets  held  for sale are stated at the lower  of  cost  or  at
estimated  net realizable value, which consider anticipated sales proceeds,
and  other  carrying  costs  to  be incurred  during  the  holding  period.
Interest is not allocated to net assets held for sale.

5.   PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

      The following unaudited pro forma information for 1996, 1997 and 1998
provides  the  results  of  the  Company's operations  as  though  (i)  the
disposition  of  the Banner Hardware Group, DME, Data,  and  SBC  (ii)  the
Merger  of  FCSC and subsequent disposition of STFI, (iii) the transfer  of
Harco  to  Banner,  resulting  in the consolidation  of  Banner,  and  (iv)
Exchange  Offer had been in effect since the beginning of each period.  The
pro  forma  information is based on the historical financial statements  of
the Company, Banner, DME, FCSC and SBC, giving effect to the aforementioned
transactions.   In  preparing the pro forma data, certain  assumptions  and
adjustments  have been made which (i) reduce interest expense  for  revised
debt  structures, (ii) increase interest income for notes  receivable,  and
(iii)  reduce minority interest from increased ownership in Banner and  the
preferred stock of a former subsidiary being redeemed.

      The  following  unaudited  pro  forma financial  information  is  not
necessarily  indicative of the results of operations  that  actually  would
have occurred if the transactions had been in effect since the beginning of
each  period,  nor is it necessarily indicative of future  results  of  the
Company.

</TABLE>

     The Company maintains credit agreements (the "Credit Agreements") with
a  consortium  of banks, which provide revolving credit facilities  to  the
Company  and  Banner,  and  a  term loan to the Company  (collectively  the
"Credit Facilities").

      On December 19, 1997, immediately following the Offering, the Company
restructured  its  FHC and RHI Credit Agreements by  entering  into  a  new
credit agreement (the "New Credit Agreement") to provide the Company with a
$300,000 senior secured credit facility (the "Facility") consisting of  (i)
a  $75,000  revolving loan with a letter of credit sub-facility of  $30,000
and  a  $10,000  swing  loan sub-facility, and (ii) a $225,000  term  loan.
Advances made under the Facility will generally bear interest at a rate of,
at the Company's option, either (i) 2% over the Citibank N.A. base rate, or
(ii)  3%  over  the  Eurodollar Rate ("LIBOR") for the  first  nine  months
following  closing,  which is subject to change based  upon  the  Company's
financial performance thereafter. The New Credit Agreement is subject to  a
non-use commitment fee of ??% of the aggregate unused availability for  the
first  nine  months post-closing and is subject to change  based  upon  the
Company's financial performance thereafter.  Outstanding letters of  credit
are  subject to fees equivalent to the LIBOR margin rate. A borrowing  base
is  calculated  monthly to determine the amounts available  under  the  New
Credit Agreement.  The borrowing base is determined monthly based upon  (i)
the  EBITDA of the Company's Aerospace Fastener business, as adjusted,  and
(ii)  specified  percentages  of  various marketable  securities  and  cash
equivalents.  The New Credit Agreement will mature on June  18,  2004.  The
term  loan  is  subject to mandatory prepayment requirements  and  optional
prepayments.  The  revolving  loan  is  subject  to  mandatory   prepayment
requirements and optional commitment reductions.

      The  New Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain
financial and non-financial loan covenants, including maintaining a minimum
net worth and maintaining certain interest and fixed charge coverage ratios
at  the end of each Fiscal Quarter.  Additionally, the New Credit Agreement
restricts  annual capital expenditures to $35,000 in 1999  and  $25,000  in
each year thereafter. Substantially all of the Company's assets are pledged
as  collateral  under  the New Credit agreement. The New  Credit  Agreement
restricts  the  payment of dividends to the Company's  shareholders  to  an
aggregate  of  $200 over the life of the agreement. At June 30,  1998,  the
Company  was  in  compliance with all the covenants under  the  New  Credit
Agreement.

      Banner  maintains a credit agreement (the "Banner Credit  Agreement")
which  provides Banner and its subsidiaries with funds for working  capital
and potential acquisitions. On November 25, 1997, Banner amended its credit
agreement to increase its revolving credit facility by $50,000. Immediately
following  this  amendment, the facility under the Banner Credit  Agreement
consisted of (i) a $55,000 six-year term loan ("Banner Term Loan"); (ii)  a
$30,000  seven-year term loan ("Tranche B Loan"); (iii) a $40,000  six-year
term loan ("Tranche C Loan"); and (iv) a $121,500 six-year revolving credit
facility ("Banner Revolver"). On January 13, 1998, in conjunction with  the
Banner  Hardware Group Disposition, the outstanding balances of the  Banner
Term  Loan, Tranche B Loan and Tranche C Loan were fully repaid  (See  Note
2).

      Based  on  the  Company's financial performance, the Banner  Revolver
bears interest at prime plus 1/4% to 1 1/2% or LIBOR plus 1 1/2% to 2  3/4%
and  is  subject  to a nonuse fee of 30 to 50 basis points  of  the  unused
availability.  On  June 30, 1998, Banner's performance  level  resulted  in
borrowings under the Revolver bearing interest at prime plus 1/4% and LIBOR
plus  1  1/2%  and a nonuse fee of 30 basis points for the  quarter  ending
September  30, 1998. The Banner Credit Agreement contains certain financial
and  nonfinancial covenants which Banner is required to meet on a quarterly
basis.  The  financial  covenants include minimum  net  worth  and  minimum
earnings levels, and minimum ratios of interest coverage, fixed charges and
debt  to  earnings  before interest, taxes, depreciation and  amortization.
Banner  also  has certain limitations on the incurring of additional  debt,
and has restrictions which limit dividends and distributions on the capital
stock  of the Company to an aggregate of $150 in any fiscal year.  At  June
30,  1998,  Banner  was in compliance with all covenants under  the  Banner
Credit Agreement. Substantially all of the Company's assets are pledged  as
collateral under the Banner Credit Agreement.

      On  February  3, 1998, with the proceeds of the Offering,  term  loan
borrowings  under  the  Facility, and the after tax  proceeds  the  Company
received  from  the  STFI Merger, the Company redeemed  (collectively,  the
"Public  Debt  Repayment") all of its existing publicly  held  indebtedness
(other  than indebtedness of Banner), consisting of (i) $63,000  to  redeem
the  11  7/8% Senior Debentures due 1999; (ii) $117,600 to redeem  the  12%
Intermediate  Debentures due 2001; (iii) $35,856  to  redeem  the  13  1/8%
Subordinated  Debentures due 2006; (iv) $25,063 to redeem  the  13%  Junior
Subordinated Debentures due 2007; and (v) accrued interest of $10,562.

      The Company recognized an extraordinary loss of $6,730, net of $3,624
tax  benefit,  to write-off the remaining deferred loan fees  and  original
issue  discounts associated with the early extinguishment of the  Company's
indebtedness pursuant to the Public Debt Repayment and refinancing  of  the
FHC and RHI Credit Agreement facilities.


The following table summarizes the Credit Facilities at June 30, 1998:

</TABLE>

      At  June  30, 1998, the Company had letters of credit outstanding  of
$18,658,   which  were  supported  by  a  sub-facility  under  the   Credit
Facilities.  At June 30, 1998, the Company had unused bank lines of  credit
aggregating  $112,042,  at interest rates slightly higher  than  the  prime
rate.   The Company also has short-term lines of credit relating to foreign
operations, aggregating $21,205, against which the Company owed $10,088  at
June 30, 1998.

      The  annual  maturity  of  long-term debt obligations  (exclusive  of
capital  lease  obligations) and bank notes payable for each  of  the  five
years  following June 30, 1998, are as follows:  $20,398 for  1999,  $3,210
for 2000, $3,382 for 2001, $70,972 for 2002 and $107,594 for 2003.

      In  September 1995, Banner entered into several interest  rate  hedge
agreements  ("Hedge  Agreements") to manage its exposure  to  increases  in
interest  rates  on  its variable rate debt.  The Hedge Agreements  provide
interest  rate  protection on $60,000 of debt through  September  2000,  by
providing  an interest rate cap of 7% if the 90-day LIBOR rate exceeds  7%.
If  the  90-day LIBOR rate drops below 5%, Banner will be required  to  pay
interest at a floor rate of approximately 6%.

      In  November 1996, Banner entered into an additional hedge  agreement
("Additional  Hedge  Agreement") with one of its major lenders  to  provide
interest  rate protection on $20,000 of debt for a period of  three  years.
Effectively, the Additional Hedge Agreement provides for a cap of 7 1/4% if
the  90-day  LIBOR  exceeds 7 1/4%.  If the 90-day LIBOR  drops  below  5%,
Banner  will  be required to pay interest at a floor rate of  approximately
6%.   No  cash outlay was required to obtain the Additional Hedge Agreement
as the cost of the cap was offset by the sale of the floor.

     In August 1997, the Company entered into a delayed-start swap interest
rate  lock  hedge  agreement  (the "FHC Hedge  Agreement")  to  reduce  its
exposure  to increases in interest rates on variable rate debt. In December
1997,  the  Company amended the FHC Hedge Agreement. On February 17,  1998,
the  FHC  Hedge  Agreement  began to provide interest  rate  protection  on
$100,000  of  variable  rate  debt  for  ten  years,  with  interest  being
calculated based on a fixed LIBOR rate of 6.715%. On January 14, 1998,  the
FHC Hedge Agreement was further amended to provide interest rate protection
with  interest being calculated based on a fixed LIBOR rate of  6.24%  from
February 17, 1998 to February 17, 2003. On February 17, 2003, the bank will
have  a  one-time  option  to  either (i)  elect  to  cancel  the  ten-year
agreement;  or  (ii) do nothing and proceed with the transaction,  using  a
fixed LIBOR rate of 6.715% for the period February 17, 2003 to February 19,
2008. No costs were incurred as a result of these transactions.

      The  Company recognizes interest expense under the provisions of  the
Hedge  Agreements  and the Additional Hedge Agreement based  on  the  fixed
rate. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance
by the lenders; however, such non-performance is not anticipated.

      The  table  below provides information about the Company's derivative
financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to
changes  in interest rates, which include interest rate swaps. For interest
rate  swaps,  the  table  presents notional amounts  and  weighted  average
interest  rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional  amounts
are  used  to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under  the
contract.  Weighted  average variable rates are based  on  implied  forward
rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.

 9.  PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

     Pensions

      The  Company and its subsidiaries have defined benefit pension  plans
covering  most  of  its employees.  Employees in foreign  subsidiaries  may
participate   in   local  pension  plans,  which  are  in   the   aggregate
insignificant.  The Company's funding policy is to make the minimum  annual
contribution  required  by  applicable regulations.   The  following  table
provides  a  summary  of  the components of net  periodic  pension  expense
(income) for the plans:

</TABLE>

      In  Fiscal 1996, the Company recognized one-time charges of $857 from
the  divestiture of subsidiaries, which resulted in a recognition of  prior
service  costs,  and $84 from the early retirement window  program  at  the
Company's  corporate  office.  The reduction in liabilities  due  from  the
cessation  of  future salary increases is not immediately  recognizable  in
income, but will be used as an offset against existing unrecognized losses.
The  Company  will have a future savings benefit from a lower net  periodic
pension cost due to the amortization of a smaller unrecognized loss.

      The  following  table  sets  forth  the  funded  status  and  amounts
recognized  in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at June  30,  1997
and 1998, for the plans:

      Plan assets include Class A Common Stock of the Company valued  at  a
fair  market  value  of  $26,287 and $16,167 at June  30,  1997  and  1998,
respectively. Substantially all of the plan assets are invested  in  listed
stocks and bonds.

     Postretirement Health Care Benefits

      The Company provides health care benefits for most retired employees.
Postretirement health care expense from continuing operations totaled $779,
$642,  and $804 for 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.  The Company accrual
was  approximately  $34,965  and $33,062 as of  June  30,  1997  and  1998,
respectively,   for   postretirement  health  care  benefits   related   to
discontinued  operations.  This represents the cumulative discounted  value
of  the  long-term  obligation  and includes interest  expense  of  $3,877,
$3,349,  and  $3,714  for the years ended June 30,  1996,  1997  and  1998,
respectively.  The components of expense in Fiscal 1996, 1997 and 1998  are
as follows:
<TABLE>

</TABLE>

      A  one-time  credit  of $3,938, resulting from  the  divestitures  of
subsidiaries,  was  offset by $4,361 from DME's accumulated  postretirement
benefit  obligation for active employees, which was transferred to  CMI  as
part  of  the sale.  The Company recognized the net effect of  $423  as  an
expense in 1996.

      The  following table sets forth the funded status for  the  Company's
postretirement health care benefit plans at June 30:

 Accrued postretirement benefit liability $ 44,697  $42,745
</TABLE>

     In Fiscal 1998, the Company amended a former subsidiary's medical plan
to  increase the retiree's contribution rate to approximately  20%  of  the
negotiated  premium, resulting in a $1,003 decrease to  unrecognized  prior
service costs.

     The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was determined using
a discount rate of 7.0%, and a health care cost trend rate of 6.7% for pre-
age-65  and  post-age-65 employees, respectively, gradually  decreasing  to
5.5% in the year 2003 and thereafter.

      Increasing  the  assumed health care cost trend  rates  by  1%  would
increase  the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of June  30,
1998, by approximately $1,666, and increase the net periodic postretirement
benefit cost by approximately $129 for Fiscal 1998.

10.  INCOME TAXES

     The provision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations is
summarized as follows:

</TABLE>

      The  1996,  1997  and 1998 net tax benefits include  the  results  of
reversing $3,500, $5,335, and $3,905 respectively, of federal income  taxes
previously  provided for due to a change in the estimate  of  required  tax
accruals.

      Domestic  income taxes, less available credits, are provided  on  the
unremitted income of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies, to  the
extent the Company intends to repatriate such earnings.  No domestic income
taxes  or  foreign  withholding  taxes are provided  on  the  undistributed
earnings  of  foreign  subsidiaries and affiliates,  which  are  considered
permanently  invested,  or which would be offset by allowable  foreign  tax
credits.   At  June  30, 1998, the amount of domestic  taxes  payable  upon
distribution of such earnings was not significant.

     In the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for all
income  taxes  and  interest, and any liability that may  arise  for  prior
periods  will  not  have  a material effect on the financial  condition  or
results of operations of the Company.

11.  EQUITY SECURITIES

      On  December 19, 1997, the Company completed a secondary offering  of
public  securities.   The offering consisted of the issuance  of  3,000,000
shares  of  the  Company's Class A Common Stock at $20.00  per  share  (the
"Offering").

     In accordance with the terms of the Special-T Acquisition, the Company
issued 1,072,605 restricted shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock in
Fiscal  1998. Additionally, the Company established an employee stock  plan
to issue up to 44,900 additional shares of Class A Common Stock to Special-
T employees.

      On March 13, 1998, the Company issued 47,283 restricted shares of the
Company's  Class  A  Common Stock resulting from  a  cashless  exercise  of
100,000 warrants by Dunstan Ltd.

      On  May  11,  1998, the Company commenced an offer to  exchange  (the
"Exchange  Offer"),  for each properly tendered share of  Common  Stock  of
Banner, a number of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value
$0.10 per share, equal to the quotient of $12.50 divided by $20.675 up to a
maximum  of  4,000,000 shares of Banner's Common Stock. The Exchange  Offer
expired  on  June  9, 1998 and approximately 3,659,364 shares  of  Banner's
Common  Stock  were  validly tendered for exchange and the  Company  issued
approximately  2,212,361  shares Class A  Common  Stock  to  the  tendering
shareholders. As a result of the Exchange Offer, the Company's ownership of
Banner  Common Stock increased to 83.3%. The Company effected the  Exchange
Offer to increase its ownership of Banner to more than 80% in order for the
Company  to  include  Banner  in its United States  consolidated  corporate
income tax return.

      The  Company  had  20,428,591 shares of  Class  A  common  stock  and
2,624,716  shares  of Class B common stock outstanding at  June  30,  1998.
Class  A  common  stock is traded on both the New York  and  Pacific  Stock
Exchanges.  There is no public market for the Class B common stock.  Shares
of  Class  A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and cannot  be
exchanged  for  shares of Class B common stock.  Shares of Class  B  common
stock  are  entitled to ten votes per share and can be  exchanged,  at  any
time,  for  shares of Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis.   In
Fiscal 1998, 141,259 shares of Class A Common Stock were issued as a result
of the exercise of stock options and shareholders converted 7,800 shares of
Class B common stock into Class A common stock.

      During  Fiscal 1998, the Company issued 36,626 deferred  compensation
units  ("DCU's) pursuant to the Company's stock option deferral plan  as  a
result  of  a  cashless  exercise of 45,000 stock  options.   Each  DCU  is
represented by one share of the Company's Treasury Stock and is convertible
into a share of the Company's Class A Common Stock after a specified period
of time.

12.  STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

     Stock Options

      The Company's 1986 Non-Qualified and Incentive Stock Option Plan (the
"1986 Plan"), authorizes the issuance of 4,541,000 shares of Class A Common
Stock upon the exercise of stock options issued under the 1986 Plan. At the
1998 Annual Meeting, stockholders will be asked to approve an amendment  to
increase  the number of shares authorized under the 1986 Plan to  5,141,000
shares  of  Class  A  Common Stock.  The purpose of the  1986  Plan  is  to
encourage  continued employment and ownership of Class A  Common  Stock  by
officers and key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, and provide
additional incentive to promote the success of the Company.  The 1986  Plan
authorizes the granting of options at not less than the market value of the
common stock at the time of the grant. The option price is payable in  cash
or,  with  the  approval  of the Company's Compensation  and  Stock  Option
Committee  of the Board of Directors, in shares of common stock, valued  at
fair  market value at the time of exercise.  The options normally terminate
five  years from the date of grant, subject to extension of up to 10  years
or for a stipulated period of time after an employee's death or termination
of  employment.  The 1986 plan expires on April 9, 2006; however, all stock
options  outstanding as of April 9, 2006 shall continue to  be  exercisable
pursuant to their terms.

      The  Company's ten year 1996 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan
(the "1996 NED Plan") authorizes the issuance of 250,000 shares of Class  A
Common  Stock upon the exercise of stock options issued under the 1996  NED
Plan.   The 1996 NED Plan authorizes the granting of options at the  market
value  of  the common stock on the date of grant.  An initial stock  option
grant for 30,000 shares of Class A Common Stock will be made to each person
who becomes a new non-employee Director, on such date, with the options  to
vest  25%  each  year from the date of grant.  On the date of  each  annual
meeting,  each  person elected as a non-employee Director at  such  meeting
will  be granted an option for 1,000 shares of Class A Common Stock,  which
will vest immediately.  The exercise price is payable in cash or, with  the
approval  of the Stock Option Committee, in shares of Class A  or  Class  B
Common  Stock,  valued at fair market value at the date of  exercise.   All
options  issued under the 1996 NED Plan will terminate five years from  the
date  of grant or a stipulated period of time after a Non-Employee Director
ceases  to  be  a  member of the Board.  The 1996 NED Plan is  designed  to
maintain  the Company's ability to attract and retain highly qualified  and
competent persons to serve as outside directors of the Company.

     On November 17, 1994, the Company's stockholders approved the grant of
stock  options  of 190,000 shares to outside Directors of  the  Company  to
replace expired stock options.  These stock options expire five years  from
the date of the grant.

      A  summary of stock option transactions under the 1986 Plan, the 1996
NED Plan, and prior plans are presented in the following tables:

      The  weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during
1996, 1997, and 1998 was $1.95, $6.90, and $11.18, respectively.  The  fair
value of each option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-
Scholes  option pricing model.  The following significant assumptions  were
made in estimating fair value:

      The  Company recognized compensation expense of $104 as a  result  of
stock  options  that  were modified in 1998. The Company  is  applying  APB
Opinion  No. 25 in accounting for its stock option plans.  Accordingly,  no
compensation cost has been recognized for the granting of stock options  in
1996,  1997 or 1998. If stock options granted in 1996, 1997 and  1998  were
accounted for based on their fair value as determined under SFAS  123,  pro
forma earnings would be as follows:

      The pro forma effects of applying SFAS 123 are not representative  of
the  effects on reported net earnings for future years.  The effect of SFAS
123 is not applicable to awards made prior to 1996 and additional awards in
future years are expected.

     Stock Option Deferral Plan

On  February  9,  1998,  the Board adopted a Stock  Option  Deferral  Plan,
subject  to  approval  by  the shareholders at  the  1998  Annual  Meeting.
Pursuant  to  the  Stock Option Deferral Plan, certain officers  (at  their
election)  may  defer  payment  of the "Compensation"  they  receive  in  a
particular  year  or  years  from the exercise of  Company  stock  options.
"Compensation" means the excess value of a stock option, determined by  the
difference between the fair market value of shares issueable upon  exercise
of  a stock option, and the option price payable upon exercise of the stock
option.   An  officer's  deferred Compensation shall  be  in  the  form  of
"Deferred Compensation Units," representing the number of shares of  Common
Stock that the officer shall be entitled to receive upon expiration of  the
deferral period. (The number of Deferred Compensation Units issueable to an
officer  is  determined by dividing the amount of the deferred Compensation
by  the  fair  market  value of the Company's  stock  as  of  the  date  of
deferral.)

     Stock Warrants

      On  April  25, 1997, the Company issued warrants to purchase  100,000
shares  of  Class A Common Stock, at $12.25 per share, to Dunstan  Ltd.  as
incentive  remuneration for the performance of certain  investment  banking
services.   The warrants were earned on a pro-rata basis over  a  six-month
period  ending  October  31,  1997.  The  warrants  became  exercisable  on
November  1,  1997,  and  on  March 13, 1998,  the  Company  issued  47,283
restricted shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock resulting from  the
cashless exercise of these warrants.  The Company recorded expenses of $191
and $300 in 1997 and 1998, respectively, for stock warrants earned based on
a grant date fair value of $5.46.

       Effective  as  of  February  21,  1997,  the  Company  approved  the
continuation  of  an existing warrant to Stinbes Limited (an  affiliate  of
Jeffrey  Steiner) to purchase 375,000 shares of the Company's  Class  A  or
Class B Common Stock at $7.67 per share. The warrant was modified to extend
the exercise period from March 13, 1997, to March 13, 2002, and to increase
the  exercise price per share by $.002 for each day subsequent to March 13,
1997,  but fixed at $7.80 per share after June 30, 1997.  In addition,  the
warrant  was  modified  to provide that the warrant may  not  be  exercised
except within the following window periods:  (i) within 365 days after  the
merger  of  STFI with AT&T Corporation, MCI Communications, Worldcom  Inc.,
Teleport  Communications  Group, Inc., or Intermedia  Communications  Inc.;
(ii)  within 365 days after a change of control of the Company, as  defined
in  the Company's Credit Agreement; or (iii) within 365 days after a change
of  control  of  Banner,  as defined in the Banner Credit  Agreement.   The
payment  of  the  warrant price may be made in cash or  in  shares  of  the
Company's Class A or Class B Common Stock, valued at fair market  value  at
the  time of exercise, or combination thereof.  In no event may the warrant
be  exercised  after March 13, 2002. As a result of the  STFI  Disposition,
these  warrants became exercisable through March 9, 1999. Accordingly,  the
Company recognized a charge of $5,606 in 1998.

      On  November 9, 1995, the Company issued warrants to purchase 500,000
shares  of  Class  A Common Stock, at $9.00 per share, to Peregrine  Direct
Investments Limited ("Peregrine"), in exchange for a standby commitment  it
received on November 8, 1995, from Peregrine.  The Company elected  not  to
exercise  its  rights  under the Peregrine commitment.   The  warrants  are
immediately exercisable and will expire on November 8, 2000.

      On  February 21, 1996, the Company issued warrants to purchase 25,000
shares  of Class A Common Stock, at $9.00 per share, to a non-employee  for
services  provided in connection with the Company's various  dealings  with
Peregrine.  The warrants issued are immediately exercisable and will expire
on November 8, 2000.

      The  Company recorded nonrecurring expenses of $1,148 for  the  grant
date  fair value of the stock warrants issued in 1996.  The warrants issued
in 1996 were outstanding at June 30, 1998.

13.  EARNINGS PER SHARE

      Effective  December  28,  1997,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share" ("SFAS  128").
This  statement replaces the previously reported primary and fully  diluted
earnings (loss) per share with basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share.
Unlike  primary earnings (loss) per share, basic earnings (loss) per  share
excludes any diluted effects of options. Diluted earnings (loss) per  share
is  very  similar to the previously reported fully diluted earnings  (loss)
per  share. All earnings (loss) per share have been restated to conform  to
the requirements of SFAS 128.

      The  following table illustrates the computation of basic and diluted
earnings (loss) per share:

continuing operations per share       $ (1.98)  $  0.11  $  2.66
</TABLE>

      The computation of diluted earnings (loss) from continuing operations
per  share  for  1996  excluded  the effect of  incremental  common  shares
attributable to the potential exercise of common stock options  outstanding
and  warrants  outstanding,  because  their  effect  was  antidilutive.  No
adjustments  were made to earnings per share calculations for  discontinued
operations and extraordinary items.

14.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

      Statement  of  Financial Accounting Standards No. 107  ("SFAS  107"),
"Disclosures   about   Fair  Value  of  Financial  Instruments",   requires
disclosures of fair value information about financial instruments,  whether
or  not  recognized  in the balance sheet, for which it is  practicable  to
estimate  that  value.   In  cases  where  quoted  market  prices  are  not
available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or  other
valuation techniques.  Those techniques are significantly affected  by  the
assumptions  used,  including discount rate and estimates  of  future  cash
flows.   In  that  regard,  the  derived fair  value  estimates  cannot  be
substantiated  by  comparison to independent markets and,  in  many  cases,
could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument.  SFAS  107
excludes  certain  financial instruments and all non-financial  instruments
from  its  disclosure requirements.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair  value
amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company.

      The  following  methods and assumptions were used by the  Company  in
estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

      The  carrying  amount reported in the balance sheet approximates  the
fair  value  for cash and cash equivalents, short-term borrowings,  current
maturities  of long-term debt, and all other variable rate debt  (including
borrowings under the Credit Agreements).

     Fair values for equity securities, and long-term public debt issued by
the Company are based on quoted market prices, where available.  For equity
securities  not actively traded, fair values are estimated by using  quoted
market  prices  of  comparable instruments or, if  there  are  no  relevant
comparable  instruments,  on  pricing  models  or  formulas  using  current
assumptions.   The  fair value of limited partnerships, other  investments,
and  notes  receivable  are estimated by discounting expected  future  cash
flows using a current market rate applicable to the yield, considering  the
credit quality and maturity of the investment.

      The  fair value for the Company's other fixed rate long-term debt  is
estimated  using  discounted cash flow analyses,  based  on  the  Company's
current   incremental  borrowing  rates  for  similar  types  of  borrowing
arrangements.

      Fair  values  for  the Company's other off-balance-sheet  instruments
(letters of credit, commitments to extend credit, and lease guarantees) are
based  on  fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements,  taking
into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counter parties'
credit  standing.   The fair value of the Company's other off-balance-sheet
instruments at June 30, 1998 was not material.

      The  carrying  amounts  and fair values of  the  Company's  financial
instruments at June 30, 1997 and 1998 are as follows:

15.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

      In  Fiscal  1996, the Company recorded restructuring charges  in  the
Aerospace  Fasteners  segment in the categories  shown  below.   All  costs
classified as restructuring were the direct result of formal plans to close
plants, to terminate employees, or to exit product lines. Substantially all
of these plans have been executed.  Other than a reduction in the Company's
existing   cost  structure  and  manufacturing  capacity,   none   of   the
restructuring  charges  resulted  in  future  increases  in   earnings   or
represented   an   accrual  of  future  costs.   The  costs   included   in
restructuring  were predominately nonrecurring in nature and  consisted  of
the following significant components:

(b)  Includes  lease  settlements,  write-off  of  leasehold  improvements,
     maintenance, restoration and clean up costs.
</TABLE>

16.   EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS

     In Fiscal 1998 the Company recognized an extraordinary loss of $6,730,
net  of  tax,  to write-off the remaining deferred loan fees  and  original
issue  discounts  associated  with early extinguishment  of  the  Company's
indebtedness pursuant to the Public Debt Repayment and refinancing  of  the
FHC and RHI Credit Agreement facilities (See Note 8).

      During Fiscal 1996, the Company used the Merger transaction and  cash
available  to  retire fully all of the FII's 12 1/4% senior notes  ("Senior
Notes"),  FII's  9 3/4% subordinated debentures due 1998,  and  bank  loans
under  a  credit  agreement  of a former subsidiary  of  the  Company,  VSI
Corporation. The redemption of the Senior Notes at a premium, consent  fees
paid  to  holders of the Senior Notes, the write off of the original  issue
discount  on FII 9 3/4% subordinated debentures and the write  off  of  the
remaining  deferred  loan fees associated with the  issuance  of  the  debt
retired,  resulted  in  an extraordinary loss of  $10,436,  net  of  a  tax
benefit, in 1996.

17.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

      The  Company  and its subsidiaries are all parties to a  tax  sharing
agreement  whereby  the  Company files a consolidated  federal  income  tax
return.  Each subsidiary makes payments to the Company based on the  amount
of  federal income taxes, if any, the subsidiary would have paid if it  had
filed a separate tax return.

     The Company and Banner paid for a chartered aircraft used from time to
time for business related travel.  The owner of the chartered aircraft is a
company  51%  owned by an immediate family member of Mr.  Jeffrey  Steiner.
Cost  for such flights charged to the Company and Banner are comparable  to
those  charged  in  arm's  length transactions between  unaffiliated  third
parties.

      The  Company and Banner prepaid hours for a chartered helicopter used
from  time to time for business related travel.  The owner of the chartered
helicopter  is a company controlled by Mr. Jeffrey Steiner. Cost  for  such
flights  charged to the Company and Banner are comparable to those  charged
in arm's length transactions between unaffiliated third parties.

      Prior  to  the  consolidation of Banner on  February  25,  1996,  the
Aerospace Fasteners segment had sales to Banner of $3,663 in 1996.

18. LEASES

      The Company holds certain of its facilities and equipment under long-
term leases.  The minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating
leases  with lease-terms in excess of one year, for each of the five  years
following June 30, 1998, are as follows: $3,174 for 1999, $4,145 for  2000,
$3,400  for  2001, $2,217 for 2002 and $1,526 for 2003.  Rental expense  on
operating leases from continuing operations for Fiscal 1996, 1997 and  1998
was  $6,197,  $4,928, and $8,610, respectively.  Minimum commitments  under
capital leases for each of the five years following June 30, 1998, are $322
for  1999, $275 for 2000, $238 for 2001, $164 for 2002, and $143 for  2003,
respectively.  At  June  30,  1998, the  present  value  of  capital  lease
obligations was $923. At June 30, 1998, capital assets leased, included  in
property, plant, and equipment consisted of:

19.  CONTINGENCIES

     Government Claims

      The  Corporate Administrative Contracting Officer (the "ACO"),  based
upon  the  advice of the United States Defense Contract Audit  Agency,  has
made  a  determination that Fairchild Industries, Inc.  ("FII"),  a  former
subsidiary  of  the  Company,  did  not  comply  with  Federal  Acquisition
Regulations  and Cost Accounting Standards in accounting for (i)  the  1985
reversion  to  FII of certain assets of terminated defined benefit  pension
plans,  and  (ii)  pension  costs upon the closing  of  segments  of  FII's
business.   The  ACO  has  directed FII to prepare  cost  impact  proposals
relating  to  such  plan terminations and segment closings  and,  following
receipt  of  such cost impact proposals, may seek adjustments  to  contract
prices.   The  ACO alleges that substantial amounts will  be  due  if  such
adjustments are made, however, an estimate of the possible loss or range of
loss from the ACO's assertion cannot be made.  The Company believes it  has
properly  accounted for the asset reversions in accordance with  applicable
accounting standards.  The Company has held discussions with the government
to attempt to resolve these pension accounting issues.

     Environmental Matters

      The  Company's operations are subject to stringent Government imposed
environmental  laws  and regulations concerning, among  other  things,  the
discharge  of materials into the environment and the generation,  handling,
storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials.   To
date,  such  laws  and regulations have not had a material  effect  on  the
financial  condition,  results of operations, or  net  cash  flows  of  the
Company,  although the Company has expended, and can be expected to  expend
in  the  future,  significant  amounts for investigation  of  environmental
conditions   and   installation   of  environmental   control   facilities,
remediation   of  environmental  conditions  and  other  similar   matters,
particularly in the Aerospace Fasteners segment.

      In  connection with its plans to dispose of certain real estate,  the
Company  must investigate environmental conditions and may be  required  to
take  certain  corrective action prior or pursuant to any such disposition.
In   addition,  management  has  identified  several  areas  of   potential
contamination  at or from other facilities owned, or previously  owned,  by
the  Company, that may require the Company either to take corrective action
or to contribute to a clean-up.  The Company is also a defendant in certain
lawsuits  and  proceedings  seeking to  require  the  Company  to  pay  for
investigation or remediation of environmental matters and has been  alleged
to  be  a  potentially  responsible party  at  various  "Superfund"  sites.
Management  of the Company believes that it has recorded adequate  reserves
in  its  financial statements to complete such investigation and  take  any
necessary  corrective  actions  or  make any  necessary  contributions.  No
amounts  have been recorded as due from third parties, including  insurers,
or  set off against, any liability of the Company, unless such parties  are
contractually obligated to contribute and are not disputing such liability.

      As  of June 30, 1998, the consolidated total recorded liabilities  of
the   Company   for  environmental  matters  approximated   $8,659,   which
represented  the  estimated probable exposures for these  matters.   It  is
reasonably  possible that the Company's total exposure  for  these  matters
could be approximately $14,995.

     Other Matters

      The  Company  is  involved  in  various  other  claims  and  lawsuits
incidental to its business, some of which involve substantial amounts.  The
Company, either on its own or through its insurance carriers, is contesting
these  matters.  In the opinion of management, the ultimate  resolution  of
the  legal  proceedings, including those aforementioned, will  not  have  a
material  adverse effect on the financial condition, or future  results  of
operations or net cash flows of the Company.

20.  BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

      The Company reports in two principal business segments. The Aerospace
Fasteners  segment  includes the manufacture of high performance  specialty
fasteners  and  fastening  systems.   The  Aerospace  Distribution  segment
distributes a wide range of aircraft parts and related support services  to
the  aerospace  industry. The results of Fairchild Technologies,  which  is
primarily  engaged in the designing and manufacturing of capital  equipment
and   systems   for  recordable  compact  disc  and  advance  semiconductor
manufacturing,  were previously reported under Corporate and  Other,  along
with the results of two smaller operations.  Fairchild Technologies is  now
recorded in discontinued operations.

     The Company's financial data by business segment is as follows:

ITEM 5.  OTHER INFORMATION

      Articles have appeared in the French press reporting an inquiry by  a
French  magistrate  into certain allegedly improper  business  transactions
involving  Elf Acquitaine, a French petroleum company, its former  chairman
and various third parties, including Maurice Bidermann.  In connection with
this  inquiry,  the  magistrate has made inquiry  into  allegedly  improper
transactions between Mr. Steiner and that petroleum company.   In  response
to the magistrate's request that Mr. Steiner appear in France as a witness,
Mr.  Steiner  submitted written statements concerning the transactions  and
appeared in person before the magistrate and others.  Mr. Steiner, who  has
been put under examination (mis en examen), by the magistrate, with respect
to this matter, has not been charged.

      Mr.  Steiner  has  been  cited by a French prosecutor  to  appear  on
November  7,  1998,  before the Tribunal de Grande Instance  de  Paris,  to
answer  a  charge  of knowingly benefiting in 1990, from a  misuse  by  Mr.
Bidermann of corporate assets of Societe Generale Mobiliere et Immobiliere,
a  French  corporation in which Mr. Bidermann is believed to have been  the
sole shareholder.

of July 7, 1998

     THIS REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made
and entered into as of July 7, 1998, by and between The Fairchild

Aerospace, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Banner").


R E C I T A L S:
                                
     On  July 7, 1998, Banner announced its intention to purchase
up  to  2.5 million shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company
through open market purchases (the "Subject Shares").
  
     In connection therewith, the Company has agreed to grant
demand registration rights agreement in favor of Banner for the
registration and sale of such shares.


      NOW,  THEREFORE,  the parties to this  Agreement  agree  as
follows:

ceased to be outstanding.



                           ARTICLE III
                                
                       REGISTRATION RIGHTS
                                
     3.1  Demand Registration.

           (a)   Request for Registration.  At any time, a Holder
     of  Registrable Common Stock may make a written request  for
     registration under the Securities Act of all or part of  its
     Registrable Common Stock (a "Demand Registration").   Except
     as set forth below, there shall be no limit on the number of
     Demand Registrations that may be requested by Banner or  its
     Permitted Transferees, as the case may be.

           Such  requests for a Demand Registration will  specify
     the  aggregate number of shares proposed to be sold and will
     also  specify  the  intended method of disposition  thereof.
     The  Company  will  use  its best  efforts  to  effect  such
     registration; provided, however, that the Company shall  not
     be   obligated  to  take  any  action  to  effect  any  such
     registration, qualification or compliance pursuant  to  this
     Agreement: (i) within sixty (60) days immediately  following
     the effective date of a Registration Statement pertaining to
     a public offering of securities of the Company (other than a
     registration  relating  solely to employee  benefit  plans);
     (ii)  if at the time of the request to register the Holder's
     Registrable  Common Stock, the Company gives  notice  within
     thirty (30) days of such request that it intends to initiate
     within  sixty  (60)  days  thereafter  a  registered  public
     offering  (other  than  a registration  relating  solely  to
     employee  benefit plans); or (iii) if at  the  time  of  the
     request, the Holder could sell all of the Registrable Common
     Stock  requested to be registered under Rule 144 during  the
     three-month  period following such request, or  if,  in  the
     opinion  of  counsel for the Company reasonably satisfactory
     to  the  Holder, the proposed sale of its Registrable Common
     Stock  is  otherwise  exempt  from  registration  under  the
     Securities Act.

            (b)    Effective   Registration  and   Expenses.    A
     Registration   Statement  will  not  count   as   a   Demand
     Registration until it has become effective.  Except  as  set
     forth below in Section 3.1(d), in any registration initiated
     as   a   Demand   Registration,  Banner  or  its   Permitted
     Transferee, as the case may be, will pay or cause to be paid
     all  Registration Expenses in connection therewith,  whether
     or not the Registration Statement becomes effective.

          (c)  Underwriting.  If the Holder intends to distribute
     the Registrable Common Stock covered by its request by means
     of  an underwritten offering, it shall so advise the Company
     as  a  part of its request made pursuant to Section  3.1(a).
     The  Holder of the Registrable Common Stock to be registered
     thereunder  may select and obtain the investment  banker  or
     investment  bankers  and  manager  or  managers   that  will
     administer  the  offering;  provided,  however,  that   such
     investment   bankers   and  managers  must   be   reasonably
     satisfactory to the Company.

            (d)    Priority  on  Demand  Registration.   If   the
     Underwriter does not limit the number of Registrable  Common
     Stock  to  be  underwritten  in a Demand  Registration,  the
     Company  may include securities for its own account  or  the
     account  of  others in such registration if the underwriters
     so agree and if the number of Registrable Common Stock which
     would otherwise have been included in such registration  and
     underwriting will not thereby be limited.  In the event that
     the Company elects to include securities for its own account
     or  the  account of others pursuant to this Section  3.1(d),
     then  notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the  Company
     will pay or cause to be paid, the pro rata portion of:   (i)
     any  filing fees for such securities to be registered by the
     Company;   (ii)   underwriting  discounts  and   commissions
     applicable  to  the  Company's  securities;  and  (iii)  any
     additional  incremental costs, including without limitation,
     printing  expenses  attributable  to  the  offer,  sale  and
     registration  of  the Company's securities  in  such  Demand
     Registration.

     3.2  Piggy-Back Registration.

           (a)   If  at any time or from time to time during  the
     five-year period commencing from the date of this Agreement,
     the  Company proposes to file a Registration Statement under
     the  Securities Act with respect to an offering for its  own
     account or for the account of others of any class of  equity
     security  (other  than  a registration  relating  solely  to
     employee benefit plans or a registration on any registration
     form   which   dos  not  include  substantially   the   same
     information  as  would  be required  to  be  included  in  a
     Registration  Statement  covering the  sale  of  Registrable
     Common  Stock),  then the Company shall in  each  case  give
     written  notice  of such proposed filing to  the  Holder  of
     Registrable Common Stock at least sixty (60) days before the
     anticipated   filing  date  (the  "Piggy-Back   Registration
     Notice"),  and  such  notice  shall  offer  the  Holder  the
     opportunity  to  register such Registrable Common  Stock  as
     such  Holder  may request in writing to the  Company  within
     twenty   (20)   days  after  the  date  of  the   Piggy-Back
     Registration Notice (a "Piggy-Back Registration").

           (b)   Underwriting.  If the registration of which  the
     Company  gives  notice is for a registered  public  offering
     involving  an underwriting, the Company shall so advise  the
     Holder  as part of the Piggy-Back Registration Notice.   The
     Company  shall  have  the right to  select  and  obtain  the
     services of the investment banker or investment bankers  and
     manager or managers that will administer the offering.   The
     right of a Holder to registration shall be conditioned  upon
     such  Holder's  participating in such underwriting  and  the
     inclusion of such Holder's Registrable Common Stock  in  the
     underwriting to the extent provided herein.

           (c)  Subject to the provisions of Section 3.2(d),  the
     Company  shall  use its best efforts to cause  the  managing
     underwriter  or  underwriters  of  a  proposed  underwritten
     offering to commit to the Holder of Registrable Common Stock
     who  has requested within twenty (20) days of receipt of the
     Company's notice to be included in the registration for such
     offering   (the   "Requesting  Holder")  to   include   such
     Registrable Common Stock in such offering on the same  terms
     and  conditions  as any similar securities  of  the  Company
     included therein; provided, however, that the Company  shall
     not  be  required  to effect any such registration  for  any
     Holder if at the time of the request such Holder could  sell
     all of the Registrable Common Stock specified in its request
     under  Rule 144, or in any other transaction that is  exempt
     from registration under the Securities Act, during the three-
     month period following such request.

             (d)     Priority    on   Piggy-Back    Registration.
     Notwithstanding any other division of this Section  3.2,  if
     the  underwriter  for  the Company  determines  that  market
     factors require a limitation of the number of shares  to  be
     underwritten,  the  underwriter  may  exclude  some  or  all
     Registrable   Common  Stock  from  such   registration   and
     underwriting.   The Company shall so advise the  Holder  and
     the  number  of  shares of Registrable Common  Stock  to  be
     offered   by   the   Holder  pursuant  to   the   Piggy-Back
     Registration  will  be reduced to the  extent  necessary  to
     reduce  the  total number of shares of Common  Stock  to  be
     included in such offering to the number recommended  by  the
     underwriter(s).

            (e)   Expenses.   In  connection  with  a  Piggy-Back
     Registration,  the Company will pay all of the  Registration
     Expenses, except for the pro rata portion of: (i) any filing
     fees  attributable to the Holder's Registrable Common Stock;
     (ii)  underwriting discounts and commissions  applicable  to
     the   Holder's  Registrable  Common  Stock;  and  (iii)  any
     additional incremental costs, including, without limitation,
     printing  expenses  attributable  to  the  offer,  sale  and
     registration  of  the Holder's Registrable Common  Stock  in
     such Piggy-Back Registration.

     3.3  Holdback Agreements.

           (a)  Registrations on Public Sale or Distribution.  To
     the  extent not inconsistent with applicable law, the Holder
     agrees  not  to  effect any public sale or  distribution  of
     Registrable Common Stock, including a sale pursuant to  Rule
     144  under  the  Securities Act during the  sixty  (60)  day
     period  prior  to,  and during the ninety  (90)  day  period
     beginning on, the effective date of a Registration Statement
     in   which  shares  of  its  Registrable  Common  Stock  are
     registered (except as part of such registration), if and  to
     the extent requested by the Company or by the underwriter(s)
     in the case of an underwritten public offering.

           (b)  Stop Orders; Suspension of Effectiveness.  If, in
     the  case  of  either a Demand Registration or a  Piggy-Back
     Registration,  a stop order is imposed or if for  any  other
     reason the effectiveness of either a Demand Registration  or
     Piggy-Back Registration is suspended, then the Holder agrees
     to   stop   distribution  of  its  Common  Stock  thereunder
     immediately upon written notice thereof from the Company.

      3.4   Registration  Procedures.  Whenever  the  Holder  has
requested   that  any  Registrable  Common  Stock  be  registered
pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will use its best efforts
to  effect the registration of such Registrable Common  Stock  in
accordance with the intended method of distribution therefore  as
quickly as is reasonably practicable, and in connection with  any
such request, the Company will:

           (a)   in connection with a request pursuant to Section
     3.1,  prepare and file with the Commission, not  later  than
     ninety  (90)  days  after receipt of a  request  to  file  a
     Registration  Statement with respect to  Registrable  Common
     Stock,  a  Registration Statement on any form for which  the
     Company  then  qualifies and which counsel for  the  Company
     shall deem appropriate and which form shall be available for
     the  registration  of  such  Registrable  Common  Stock   in
     accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof,
     and   use  its  best  efforts  to  cause  such  Registration
     Statement to become effective; provided that if the  Company
     shall furnish to the Holder certified resolutions signed  by
     the  Chief Executive Officer of the Company stating that  in
     the  good faith judgement of the Board of Directors it would
     be  significantly  disadvantageous to the  Company  and  its
     stockholders for such a Registration Statement to  be  filed
     on  or before the date filing would be required, the Company
     shall have an additional period of not more than sixty  (60)
     days within which to file such Registration Statement;

           (b)   in  connection with a registration  pursuant  to
     Section  3.1,  prepare  and file with  the  Commission  such
     amendments  and  supplements to such Registration  Statement
     and  the prospectus used in connection therewith as  may  be
     necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective  for
     a  period of not less than one hundred eighty (180) days  or
     such   shorter   period  which  will  terminate   when   all
     Registrable   Common  Stock  covered  by  such  Registration
     Statement  have been sold (but not before the expiration  of
     the  ninety (90) day period referred to in Section  4(3)  of
     the  Act and Rule 174 thereunder, if applicable), and comply
     with  the  provisions of the Securities Act with respect  to
     the  disposition of all Registrable Common Stock covered  by
     such Registration Statement during such period in accordance
     with the intended methods of disposition by the Holders  set
     forth in such Registration Statement;

           (c)   furnish  to  each seller of  Registrable  Common
     Stock,  prior to filing a Registration Statement, copies  of
     such  Registration Statement as proposed to  be  filed,  and
     thereafter  such  number  of  copies  of  such  Registration
     Statement,  each amendment and supplement thereto  (in  each
     case   including  all  exhibits  thereto),  the   prospectus
     included  in  such  Registration Statement  (including  each
     preliminary  prospectus) and such other  documents  as  such
     seller  may  reasonably request in order to  facilitate  the
     disposition  of the Registrable Common Stock owned  by  such
     seller;

           (d)   use its best efforts to register or qualify such
     Registrable Common Stock under such other securities or blue
     sky  laws  of  such  jurisdiction as any  seller  reasonably
     requests and do any and all other acts and things which  may
     be  reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such  seller
     to  consummate the disposition in such jurisdiction  of  the
     Registrable  Common  Stock owned by such  seller;  provided,
     that  the  Company  will  not be  required  to  (i)  qualify
     generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it  would
     not  otherwise be required to qualify but for this paragraph
     (d),   (ii)   subject  itself  to  taxation  in   any   such
     jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of  process
     in any such jurisdiction;

           (e)   notify  each  seller of the  Registrable  Common
     Stock,  at  any time when a prospectus relating  thereto  is
     required  to be delivered under the Securities Act,  of  the
     happening  of any event as a result of which the  prospectus
     included  in such Registration Statement contains an  untrue
     statement of a material fact or omits to state any  material
     fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make  the
     statements therein misleading.  The Company will  prepare  a
     supplement  or  amendment  to  such  prospectus  as  may  be
     appropriate  and  use  its  best  efforts  to   cause   such
     supplement  or  amendment to become effective  so  that,  as
     thereafter  delivered to the purchasers of such  Registrable
     Common  Stock,  such prospectus will not contain  an  untrue
     statement  of a material fact or omit to state any  material
     fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make  the
     statements therein not misleading;

           (f)   enter  into customary agreements  (including  an
     underwriting  agreement in customary  form)  and  take  such
     other  actions  as  are  reasonably  required  in  order  to
     expedite  or  facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
     Common Stock;

           (g)   make  available for inspection by any seller  of
     Registrable  Common Stock, any underwriter participating  in
     any disposition pursuant to such Registration Statement, and
     any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by any such
     seller or underwriter (collectively, the "Inspectors"),  all
     financial  and other records, pertinent corporate  documents
     and  properties of the Company (collectively, the "Records")
     as  shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise
     their  due diligence responsibility, and cause the Company's
     officers,  directors and employees to supply all information
     reasonably  requested by any such Inspectors  in  connection
     with such Registration Statement.  Records which the Company
     determines, in good faith, to be confidential and  which  it
     notifies  the  Inspectors  are  confidential  shall  not  be
     disclosed  by  the Inspectors unless (i) the  disclosure  of
     such records is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement
     or  omission  in  the  Registration Statement  or  (ii)  the
     release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or
     other  order  from a court of competent jurisdiction.   Each
     seller of Registrable Common Stock agrees that it will, upon
     learning  that  disclosure of such Records is  sought  in  a
     court  of competent jurisdiction, give notice to the Company
     and  allow  the  Company,  at  the  Company's  expense,   to
     undertake  appropriate action to prevent disclosure  of  the
     Records deemed confidential.

           (h)   in  the  event  such  sale  is  pursuant  to  an
     underwritten offering, use its best efforts to obtain (i)  a
     "cold  comfort" letter from the Company's independent public
     accountants in customary form and covering such  matters  of
     the  type  customarily covered by "cold comfort" letters  as
     the  Holder  or the managing underwriter reasonably  request
     and  (ii) an opinion or opinions of counsel for the  Company
     in customary form;

           (i)  otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all
     applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make
     available  to  its security holders, as soon  as  reasonably
     practicable,  an  earnings statement covering  a  period  of
     twelve (12) months, beginning within three months after  the
     effective  date of the Registrable Statement, which  earning
     statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section  11(a)  of
     the Securities Act; and

           (j)   cause  all such Registrable Common Stock  to  be
     listed  on  each  securities exchange  or  market  on  which
     similar  securities issued by the Company are  then  listed,
     provided  that  the  applicable  listing  requirements   are
     satisfied.

      The  Company may require each seller of Registrable  Common
Stock  as to which any registration is being effected to  furnish
to  the  Company  such information regarding the distribution  of
such  securities as the Company may from time to time  reasonably
request in writing.

      The Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the
Company  of  the happening of any event of the kind described  in
Section  3.4(e)  hereof, such Holder will  forthwith  discontinue
disposition   of  Registrable  Common  Stock  pursuant   to   the
Registration  Statement  covering such Registrable  Common  Stock
until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented  or
amended prospectus contemplated by Section 3.4(e) hereof, and, if
so  directed  by  the  Company such Holder will  deliver  to  the
Company  (at  the  Company's  expense)  all  copies,  other  than
permanent  file copies then in such Holder's possession,  of  the
prospectus covering such Registrable Common Stock at the time  of
receipt of such notice.

     3.5  Indemnification and Contribution.

           (a)   Indemnification  by the  Company.   The  Company
     agrees  to  indemnify, to the extent permitted by  law,  the
     Holder,  its officers, directors and agents and each  Person
     who  controls such Holder (within the meaning of Section  15
     of  the  Securities Act or Section 20 of the  Exchange  Act)
     from  and  against any losses, claims, damages,  liabilities
     and expenses resulting from any untrue statement of material
     fact contained in any Registration Statement, prospectus  or
     preliminary  prospectus or any omission of a  material  fact
     required  to  be  stated therein or necessary  to  make  the
     statements  therein  (in the case of a  prospectus,  in  the
     light  of the circumstances under which they were made)  not
     misleading,  except insofar as the same  are  caused  by  or
     contained  in any information or affidavit with  respect  to
     such  Holder furnished in writing to the Company by,  or  on
     behalf  of,  such  Holder, expressly for  inclusion  in  any
     Registration Statement or prospectus.

          (b)  Indemnification by Holder.  In connection with any
     Registration Statement in which the Holder is participating,
     such  Holder  will furnish to the Company  in  writing  such
     information  and affidavits with respect to such  Holder  as
     the  Company reasonably requests for use in connection  with
     any such Registration Statement or prospectus and agrees  to
     indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, the Company,  its
     directors  and  officers and each Person  who  controls  the
     Company  (within the meaning of Section 14 of the Securities
     Act  or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) from and against any
     losses,  claims, damages, liabilities and expenses resulting
     from any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission
     or a material fact required to be stated in the Registration
     Statement or preliminary, final or summary prospectus or any
     amendment  thereof or supplement thereto,  or  necessary  to
     make  the  statements therein (in the case of a preliminary,
     final   or   summary  prospectus,  in  the  light   of   the
     circumstances under which they were made) not misleading  to
     the  extent,  but  only  to  the extent,  that  such  untrue
     statement  or  omission is contained in any  information  or
     affidavit  with  respect  to such  Holder  so  furnished  in
     writing  by,  or  on  behalf of, such Holder  expressly  for
     inclusion in any Registration Statement or prospectus.

           (c)   Conduct  of  Indemnification  Proceedings.   Any
     person entitled to indemnification hereunder agrees promptly
     to  give written notice to the indemnifying party after  the
     receipt  of  such  person  of  any  written  notice  of  the
     commencement   of   any   action,   suit,   proceeding    or
     investigation  or threat thereof made in writing  for  which
     such  person  will  claim  indemnification  or  contribution
     pursuant  to  this Agreement and, unless in  the  reasonable
     judgment  of  such indemnified party a conflict of  interest
     may   exist   between  such  indemnified   party   and   the
     indemnifying  party with respect to such claim,  permit  the
     indemnifying party to participate in and assume the  defense
     of  such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to  such
     indemnified  party.   If  the  indemnifying  party  is   not
     entitled  to,  or  elects not to, assume the  defense  of  a
     claim, it will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses
     of  more than one counsel with respect to such claim, unless
     in  the  reasonable  judgment of such  indemnified  party  a
     conflict  of  interest  may exist between  such  indemnified
     party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect
     to  such claim, in which event the indemnifying party  shall
     be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
     additional counsel or counsels.  The indemnifying party will
     not  be  subject  to any liability for any  settlement  made
     without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
     withheld.

          (d)  Contribution.  If the indemnification provided for
     in   this  Section  3.5  from  the  indemnifying  party   is
     unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect  to
     any   losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities  or   expenses
     referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu  of
     indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the
     amount paid or payable to such indemnified party as a result
     of  such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in
     such  proportion as is appropriate to reflect  the  relative
     fault  of the indemnifying party and indemnified parties  in
     connection  with the actions which resulted in  such  losses
     claims,  damages, liabilities or expenses, as  well  as  any
     other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault
     of  such indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be
     determined by reference to, among other things, whether  any
     action  in question, including any untrue or alleged  untrue
     statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
     to  state  a material fact, has been made by, or related  to
     information  supplied  by,  such  indemnifying   party   and
     indemnified  parties,  and  the  parties'  relative  intent,
     knowledge, access to information and opportunity to  correct
     or  prevent  such action.  The amount paid or payable  by  a
     party   as   a  result  of  the  losses,  claims,   damages,
     liabilities and expenses referred to above shall  be  deemed
     to  include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section
     3.5(c),  any  legal  or  other fees or  expenses  reasonably
     incurred  by such party in connection with any investigation
     or proceeding.

           The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
     equitable  if  contribution pursuant to this Section  3.5(d)
     were  determined  by pro rata allocation  or  by  any  other
     method  of  allocation which does not take  account  of  the
     equitable  considerations referred  to  in  the  immediately
     preceding   paragraph.   No  person  guilty  of   fraudulent
     misrepresentation (within the meaning of  Section  11(f)  of
     the  Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution  from
     any person.

      3.6   Participation  in  Underwritten  Registrations.   The
Holder  may  not  participate  in any  underwritten  registration
hereunder  unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell its  Registrable
Common   Stock   on  the  basis  provided  in  any   underwriting
arrangements  approved  by  the  persons  entitled  hereunder  to
approve  such  arrangements and (b) completes  and  executes  all
questionnaires,  powers  of  attorney, indemnities,  underwriting
agreements  and  other documents reasonably  required  under  the
terms of such underwriting arrangements.

      3.7  Rule 144.  The Company covenants that it will file the
reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act and the
rules  and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder;  and
it  will  take  such further action as any Holder may  reasonably
request,  all to the extent required from time to time to  enable
such Holder to sell Registrable Common Stock without registration
under  the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided  by (a) Rule 144, or (b) any similar rule or  regulation
hereafter  adopted by the Commission.  Upon the  request  of  any
Holder,  the  Company  will  deliver to  such  Holder  a  written
statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

                           ARTICLE IV
                                
                          MISCELLANEOUS
                                
       4.1   Inconsistent  Agreements.   The  Company  will   not
hereafter enter into any agreement with respect to its securities
which  is inconsistent with this Agreement.  The Company has  not
previously entered into any agreement with respect to any of  its
securities granting any registration rights to any person.

      4.2   Amendments and Waivers.  Except as otherwise provided
herein,  the  provisions of this Agreement may  not  be  amended,
modified  or supplemented, and waivers or consents to  departures
from  the  provisions hereof may not be given unless the  Company
has  obtained  the  written consent of  Holders  of  at  least  a
majority   of  the  Registrable  Common  Stock  which  are   then
outstanding affected by such amendment, modification, supplement,
waiver or departure.

      4.3   Notices.   All notices, requests, demands  and  other
communications under this Agreement must be in writing  and  will
be deemed duly given, unless otherwise expressly indicated to the
contrary, (i) when personally delivered, (ii) upon receipt  of  a
