ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
- -----------------

(a)  General Development of Business

     The Fairchild Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated under the
laws of the State of Delaware in October 1969.  The Company changed its name
from Banner Industries, Inc. to The Fairchild Corporation on November 15,
1990.  The Company is a holding company which owns all of the issued and
outstanding stock of RHI Holdings, Inc. ("RHI"), and through RHI all of the
issued and outstanding common stock of Fairchild Industries, Inc. ("FII").

     The Company conducts its operations through RHI and VSI Corporation
("VSI"), a wholly owned subsidiary of FII, in three business segments: 
Aerospace Fasteners, Industrial Products, and Communications Services.  The
Aerospace Fasteners segment designs, manufactures and markets high
performance, specialty fastening systems, primarily for aerospace
applications.  The Industrial Products segment designs, manufactures and
markets tooling and electronic control systems for the plastic injection
molding and die casting industries and wet processing tools, equipment and
systems required for the manufacture of semiconductor chips and related
products.  The Communications Services segment furnishes telecommunications
services and equipment to tenants of commercial office buildings.  For a
comparison of the sales of each of the Company's three business segments for
each of the last three fiscal years, see "Management Discussion and Analysis
of Results of Operations and Financial Condition".

     Through RHI, the Company is the largest stockholder of Banner Aerospace,
Inc. ("Banner"), which is a leading international distributor to the
aerospace industry.  On December 23, 1993, the Company, through RHI,
completed a sale of its 43.9% stock interest in Rexnord Corporation, a
manufacturer of mechanical power transmission components and related
products.

Fiscal 1994 Developments
- ------------------------

     Aerospace Fasteners Restructuring
     ---------------------------------

     In recent years, the Company has undertaken measures designed to reduce
costs and improve operating efficiencies, increase earnings, and maintain its
market position in the Aerospace Fasteners segment.  These measures have
included closing and consolidating certain of the Aerospace Fasteners
segment's facilities.

     As a result of the sustained soft worldwide demand for aircraft, and the
resulting decline in new order rates and prices for aerospace fasteners, in
Fiscal 1994, the Company has undertaken further restructuring actions to
downsize, reduce costs, reduce cycle times and improve margins.  These
restructuring efforts have included discontinuance of certain aircraft engine
bolt product lines, increased cellularization of manufacturing processes,
relocation of its New Jersey operations to California and re-engineering of
certain manufacturing processes and methods to meet increased customer
quality standards.  In connection with these moves, in Fiscal 1994, the
Company recorded restructuring charges of $18.9 million.  The Company
believes the reduction of the capacity of the Aerospace Fasteners segment,
and the reorganization of its remaining manufacturing operations, will
continue to improve operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs.

      The foregoing measures represent a continuation of actions commenced in
Fiscal 1992 and continued in Fiscal 1993, which included the consolidation of
a major manufacturing facility, the elimination of over 410 manufacturing
personnel and 100 other personnel of the Aerospace Fasteners segment, a wage
and salary freeze and certain other actions to improve manufacturing
efficiencies and streamline operations.

     The Company continues to examine its manufacturing, selling, general and
administrative costs and expenses and intends to further reduce such costs
and expenses in Fiscal 1995 and, to this end may incur additional
restructuring costs related to the elimination of product lines and further
personnel reductions.

(b)  Financial Information about Business Segments

     Financial information regarding the Company's business segments are
hereby incorporated by reference from Note 20 of the Company's consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business Segments

Aerospace Fasteners
- -------------------

     The Company, through its Aerospace Fasteners segment, is a leading
worldwide manufacturer and supplier of fastening systems used in the
construction and maintenance of commercial and military aircraft.  The
Aerospace Fasteners segment accounted for 45.8% of total Company sales for
the year ended June 30, 1994.

     Products
     --------

     In general, aerospace fasteners produced by the Company are used to join
materials in applications which are not critical to flight.  Products range
from standard aerospace screws to more complex systems that fasten airframe
structures, and sophisticated latching or quick disconnect mechanisms that
allow efficient access to internal parts that need to be serviced regularly
or monitored.  The Aerospace Fasteners segment also manufactures and supplies
fastening systems used in non-aerospace industrial and electronic niche
applications.  The Aerospace Fasteners segment produces and sells products
under various trade names and trademarks including Voi-Shan (fasteners for
aerospace structures), Screwcorp (standard externally threaded products for
aerospace applications), RAM (custom designed mechanisms for aerospace
applications), Camloc (components for the industrial, electronic, automotive
and aerospace markets), Tridair and Rosan (fastening systems for highly-
engineered aerospace, military and industrial applications).  In addition to
these manufacturing operations, the Aerospace Fasteners segment includes
HARCO, which is a leading stocking distributor of self-locking nuts in the
aerospace fasteners industry.

     Principal product lines of the Aerospace Fasteners segment include:

     Standard Aerospace Airframe Fasteners - These fasteners consist of
standard externally threaded fasteners used in non-critical airframe
applications on a wide variety of aircraft.  These fasteners include Hi-
Torque Speed Drive, Tri-Wing, Torq-Set, Phillips and Hex Heads.

     Commercial Aerospace Structural and Engine Fasteners - These fasteners
consist of more highly engineered, permanent or semi-permanent fasteners used
in non-critical but more sophisticated airframe and engine applications which
could involve joining more than two materials.  These fasteners are generally
engineered to specific customer requirements or manufactured to specific
customer specifications for special applications, often involving exacting
standards.  These fasteners include Hi-Lok, Veri-Lite, Eddie-Bolt2 and
customer proprietary engine nuts.

     Proprietary Products and Fastening Systems - These very highly
engineered, proprietary fasteners are designed by the Company for specific
customer applications and include high performance structural latches and
hold down mechanisms.  These fasteners are usually proprietary in nature and
are primarily used in either commercial aerospace or military applications. 
These fasteners include Visu-Lok, Composi-Lok, Keen-serts, Mark IV, Flatbeam
and Ringlock.

     Highly Engineered Fastening Systems for Industrial Applications - These
highly engineered fasteners are designed by the Company for specific niche
applications in the electronic, automotive and durable goods markets and are
sold under the Camloc trade name.

     Gas Springs for Automotive and Industrial/Commercial Applications -
These are designed to assist in the raising, lowering or moving of heavy
loads such as the tailgate of a vehicle, sunbeds, printer canopies, acoustic
hoods and like items.

     Sales and Markets
     -----------------

     The products of the Aerospace Fasteners segment are sold primarily to
domestic and foreign original equipment manufacturers, the maintenance and
repair market through distributors and the United States government.  78.9%
of its sales are domestic.  The products of the Aerospace Fasteners segment
are marketed by a direct sales force and technical engineering support
personnel who are responsible for identifying new product applications,
obtaining the approval of new products and maintaining ongoing relationships
with customers in order to meet their requirements.  Major customers include
Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Airbus, Lockheed and Northrop and their
subcontractors as well as major distributors such as Burbank Aircraft.  No
single customer accounts for more than 10% of consolidated sales.

     The Company anticipates that non-aerospace and commercial aerospace
applications as a percentage of sales will increase over time as the Company
brings to market new products and military spending declines.

     Research and Development
     ------------------------

     Research and development and its engineering related support functions
are an important part of the Company's strategy of providing its customers
quality products, prompt service and overall value.  Company sponsored
research and development expense in the Aerospace Fasteners segment for the
years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992 amounted to $1,435,000, $2,204,000
and $3,197,000, respectively.

     Manufacturing and Production
     ----------------------------

     The Aerospace Fasteners segment has seven major manufacturing
facilities, of which four are located in the United States and three are
located in Europe.  Each facility has virtually complete production
capability, and subcontracts only those orders which exceed capacity.  Each
plant is oriented to produce a specified product or group of products,
depending on the production process involved.

     On January 17, 1994, the Aerospace Fasteners' Chatsworth, California
manufacturing facility suffered extensive damage from the Southern California
earthquake.  As a result, the Company relocated the Chatsworth manufacturing
operations to its other Southern California facilities.  See Note 17 of the
Company's consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.

     The Company is continuing to extensively re-engineer the way it produces
fasteners, shifting from a process orientation to a product orientation by
forming focused discrete work groups with each having broader
responsibilities.

     Competition
     -----------

     The Aerospace Fasteners segment's major competitors include Hi-Shear,
Inc., Monogram, Inc., Air Industries, Inc., SPS, Inc., Kaynar, Valley Todeco,
and Huck International, with regard to aerospace fasteners, and Southco,
Inc., with regard to specialized industrial applications.  In addition,
competition comes from stocking distributors who may offer reduced lead times
to customers as a result of their inventory investment.

Industrial Products
- -------------------

     The Industrial Products segment operates under the trade name D-M-E
Company ("DME"), Fairchild Data Corporation ("Data") and recently added
Convac GmbH ("Convac").  DME is a leading manufacturer and supplier of
tooling and electronic control products for the plastic injection molding
industry worldwide.  The principal end-users of DME's products are the
transportation, packaging, communications, housewares, commercial and
industrial products, medical products, toy, appliance, furniture and building
industries.  77.5% of DME's sales for the year ended June 30, 1994, were in
North America and 22.5% were attributable to sales outside North America.

     Data is a supplier of modems for use in high-speed digitized voice and
data communications.  No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the
Company's consolidated sales.  

     In June 1994, as part of the Company's strategy of diversifying into
new, high growth industries, the Company, through RHI, acquired 100% of the
outstanding common stock of Convac, a German corporation.  Convac is a
leading designer and manufacturer of wet processing tools, equipment and
systems in multiple modular design, required for the manufacture of
semiconductor chips and related products, and for compact and optical storage
discs and liquid crystal displays.  See Note 3 of the Company's consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.

     The Industrial Products segment accounted for 37.5% of total Company
sales for the year ended June 30, 1994.

     Products
     --------

     DME provides an extensive line of standardized and special order
products as well as electronic control systems.  Principal product lines
include:

          Mold Bases - Mold bases are used to retain the cavity and core of
a plastic mold.  These products are individually stacked high alloy,
precision-machined steel plates available either as a standard dimensioned
catalog product or as a specially machined mold base made to customer
specifications.

          Mold Components - Mold components are utilized within a mold base
to facilitate the mechanical action of the individual steel plates.  These
products include such items as leader pins and bushings to guide and align
the plates, ejector pins and sleeves to eject the finished plastics product
from the mold, and other specialized products such as collapsible cores to
mold complex geometries involving difficult under-cuts and threads.

          Moldmaking Tools/Supplies - Tooling and miscellaneous supplies
allow the moldmaker to manufacture and "finish" the actual cavity and core of
a plastic mold.  These products range from ultrasonic polishing equipment and
abrasives to specialized tooling for the milling and drilling of steel.

          Runnerless Molding/Process Control - DME's internally and
externally heated runnerless molding systems with thermal and/or mechanical
gate shut-off devices produce high quality plastic products while minimizing
labor content and reducing scrap in the manufacturing process.  DME's

Statistical Process Control (SPC) of their entire molding cycle.

          CAD/CAM - DME offers a unique line of Computer Aided Design (CAD)
and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) hardware and software for the plastics
industry.  DME sells computer hardware as a value-added reseller for some of
the industry's best known computer suppliers.  Additionally, DME has
developed copyrighted software programs which are specific to the plastics
industry.  These systems enable mold designers to design mold bases utilizing
a combination of most of the popular products offered by DME, including
runnerless systems.

     Data is a supplier of modems for use in high-speed digitized voice and
data communications.

     The four primary product groups of Convac include wafer track
systems/cluster, photomask processing equipment, liquid crystal display
process equipment and compact disc coating equipment.

     Sales and Markets
     -----------------

     DME's sales efforts in North America are led by direct field sales
representatives and regional managers, who call directly on key mold makers,
molders and designers.  In addition, a telemarketing group supplements the
sales representatives' efforts and reaches the smaller or low activity
accounts.  Additionally, DME utilizes distributors in key product market
segments to focus on sales of items such as temperature controls.  Sales of
highly technical products, such as complete runnerless manifold systems, are
aided by technical service people located in the sales regions.

     Internationally, sales are handled by direct sales representatives in
England, France, Belgium and Germany.  In a number of countries in Europe and
Asia, joint venture partners sell DME products through both full-time sales
people and secondary distribution outlets.  DME utilizes stocking
distributors to serve the rest of the world.

     Manufacturing and Production
     ----------------------------

     Local production facilities are a strategic advantage to sales in the
custom mold base markets DME serves.  Accordingly, DME maintains regional
production facilities in North America and Europe to service customers of its
custom-manufactured products. DME owns ten manufacturing facilities in the
United States, Canada, Mexico, Belgium and Germany and licenses four other
companies to manufacture products in Brazil, Hungary, Japan and Korea.

     Competition
     -----------

     DME competes with different companies with respect to each of its major
product categories.  DME's competition principally consists of small
privately-held manufacturers operating primarily in local markets.

     The Company believes it is the leading manufacturer of mold bases.  DME
is one of six major competitors in North America and one of four major
competitors in Europe in the runnerless molding/process controls market.  The
Company believes the runnerless molding/process controls market is a growth
market with competition based primarily on product technology and service. 
A significant portion of DME's research and development is aimed at this
market.  DME faces competition from various companies with respect to each of
the individual products in the other resale products category.  Competition
in this category is based primarily on price and delivery time.

Communications Services
- -----------------------

     Fairchild Communications Services Company provides telecommunications
equipment and services to tenants of commercial office buildings, under the
trade name Telecom 2000 Services.  The Company believes it is the largest
provider of comprehensive telecommunications services exclusively to multi-
tenant office buildings in the United States.  Fairchild Communications was
founded as a start-up venture in 1985 and has grown rapidly through
expansions and acquisitions.  Sales have grown from $1.4 million in Fiscal
1986 to $74.2 million in Fiscal 1994.  Approximately $48 million of such
increase was attributable to acquisitions (determined on an annualized basis
at the date of acquisition), primarily the acquisition of the
telecommunication assets of Amerisystems.  The Communications Services
segment accounted for 16.7% of total Company sales for the year ended June
30, 1994.

     Services
     --------

     Fairchild Communications negotiates long-term telecommunications
franchises with owners or developers of office buildings, typically during
the latter stages of building construction.  Under these arrangements,
Fairchild Communications installs switching equipment, cable and telephone
equipment.  Fairchild Communications then contracts directly with individual
tenants in the buildings to provide multi-year, single point-of-contact
telecommunications services.  The services provided by Fairchild
Communications include access to services provided by regulated
communications companies, including local, long distance, international and
"800" telephone services.  In addition, Fairchild Communications provides
telecommunications equipment as well as voice mail, telephone calling cards,
local area networks and voice and data cable installation.  Fairchild
Communications also provides customized billing services to assist customers
in controlling their telecommunications expense.  Fairchild Communications
typically provides telecommunications services at rates equal to or below
those which a customer could otherwise obtain, in part due to discounts
Fairchild Communications commands as a high volume purchaser of telephone
services.

     Customers
     ---------

     Customers typically consist of small to medium size businesses and
branches of larger organizations.  As of June 30, 1994, Fairchild
Communications served approximately 4,500 customers at 275 buildings located
in 23 major metropolitan areas, providing approximately 62,000 full service
lines and 9,000 long distances only lines.  Contract terms typically provide
for a lease of three to five years with an automatic renewal provision.

     Competition
     -----------

     Fairchild Communications competes with regulated major carriers that may
provide a portion of the services that Fairchild Communications provides, but
are typically not structured to provide all of a customer's
telecommunications requirements.  Fairchild Communications also competes with
small independent operators serving local markets.  In some cases Fairchild
Communications competes with other communications services providers in order
to secure franchises with office building owners for the provision of
telecommunications services within their buildings.  Principal competitors
include Realcom and Shared Technologies, as well as smaller, more localized,
companies.  Once a franchise has been obtained, Fairchild Communications
competes with equipment manufacturers and distributors for the provision of
telephone and other telecommunications equipment and services to the
building's tenants.  Principal equipment competitors include manufacturers
such as NEC, Intecom, AT&T and some of the local Bell operating companies
acting as manufacturer's distributors, as well as numerous smaller equipment
distributors.

     Growth
     ------

     Management believes that future growth in the Communications Services
segment will come primarily from four sources:  acquisitions of smaller
companies operating in the same or related businesses; new customers as a
result of increased occupancy of space currently vacant in office buildings
already under franchise; additional franchise agreements with newly
constructed office buildings; and additional services to the existing
customer base.

Foreign Operations
- ------------------

     The Company's operations are located primarily in the United States and
Europe.  Inter-area sales are not significant to the total revenue of any
geographic area.  Export sales are made by U.S. subsidiaries and divisions to
customers in non-U.S. countries, whereas foreign sales are made by the
Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries.  For the Company's sales results by
geographic area and export sales, see Note 21 of the Company's consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.

Major Customers
- ---------------

     No single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in
any of the Company's business segments for the year ended June 30, 1994.

Backlog of Orders
- -----------------

    Backlog is significant in the Company's Aerospace Fasteners segment due
to long-term production requirements of its customers.  Backlog of unfilled
orders is not material in the Industrial Products segment, where most orders
for products are placed and filled within a few weeks.  Backlog is not
applicable to the Communications Services segment.

     The Company's backlog of orders as of June 30, 1994 in the Aerospace
Fasteners and Industrial Products segments amounted to $113.4 million and
$5.6 million, respectively.  The Company anticipates that approximately 87.8%
of the aggregate backlog at June 30, 1994 will be delivered by June 30, 1995.

Suppliers
- ---------

     The Company does not consider itself to be materially dependent upon any
one supplier, but is dependent upon a wide range of subcontractors, vendors
and suppliers of materials to meet its commitments to its customers.

Research and Patents
- --------------------

     The Company's research and development activities have included: 
applied research; development of new products; testing and evaluation of, and
improvements to, existing products; improvements in manufacturing techniques
and processes; development of product innovations designed to meet government
safety and environmental requirements; and development of technical services
for manufacturing and marketing.  The Company's sponsored research and
development expenditures amounted to $3,940,000, $3,262,000 and $4,140,000
for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The Company
owns patents relating to the design and manufacture of certain of its
products and is a licensee of technology covered by the patents of other
companies.  The Company does not believe that any of its business segments
are dependent upon any single patent or upon the rights and licenses it
possesses under any single patent owned by others.

Personnel
- ---------

    As of June 30, 1994, the Company had approximately 3,500 employees. 
Approximately 4% of these employees were covered by collective bargaining
agreements.  The Company believes that its relations with its employees are
good.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------

     See discussion of Environmental Matters under Item 3 "Legal Proceedings"
below.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES
- --------------------

     As of June 30, 1994, the Company owned or leased properties totalling
approximately 1,805,000 square feet, approximately 1,210,000 square feet of
which was owned and 595,000 square feet of which was leased.  The Aerospace
Fasteners segment's properties consisted of approximately 697,000 square
feet, with principal operating facilities of approximately 454,000 square
feet concentrated in southern California.  The Industrial Products segment's
properties consisted of approximately 828,000 square feet, with principal
operating facilities of approximately 393,000 square feet located in Arizona, 
Michigan, Pennsylvania and Belgium.

     The Company owns its corporate headquarters at Washington-Dulles
International Airport.

     The Company has several parcels of property which it is attempting to
market, lease and/or develop:  (i) an 88 acre parcel located in Farmingdale,
New York, (ii) a 12 acre parcel located in City of Commerce, California,
(iii) a 6 acre parcel in Temple City, California, and (iv) an 8 acre parcel
in Chatsworth, California.  In addition to the above, certain other
properties of the Company are being marketed.

     On January 17, 1994, the Aerospace Fasteners' Chatsworth, California
manufacturing facility suffered extensive damage from the Southern California
earthquake.  As a result, the Company relocated the Chatsworth manufacturing
operations to its other Southern California facilities.  See Note 17 of the
Company's consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.

     The following table sets forth the location of the larger physical
properties used in the continuing operations of the Company, their square
footage, the business segment or groups they serve and their primary use. 
Each of the properties owned or leased by the Company is, in management's
opinion, generally well maintained, is suitable to support the Company's
business and is adequate for the Company's present needs.  All of the
Company's occupied properties are maintained and updated on a regular basis.

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
- ---------------------------

CL Motor Freight Litigation
- ---------------------------

     The Workers Compensation Bureau of the State of Ohio is seeking
reimbursement from the Company for approximately $5,400,000 for CL workers
compensation claims which were insured under a self-insured workers
compensation program of CL.  The Company has contested a significant portion
of this claim.

Government Claims
- -----------------

     In 1989, the Company learned through its own quality assurance
procedures, and voluntarily disclosed to its customers and the Department of
Defense, that certain units of VSI had not performed certain production lot
tests mentioned in the military specifications for some limited product
lines.  The Company does not believe that VSI's level of testing resulted in
shipment of unsafe products or that purchasers were otherwise damaged, and
the government subsequently reduced certain test requirements.  In May 1994,
VSI settled this matter with the government by payment of $330,000.

     Following an investigation by the Inspector General of NASA, the civil
division of the United States Department of Justice alleged improprieties in
years 1982 and 1984 through 1986, in indirect costs rates and labor charging
practices of a former subsidiary of the Company.  The Company entered into
settlement discussions with the Department of Justice to attempt to resolve
these claims and has reached an agreement in principle with the government to
settle this matter for $5,000,000, payable in six equal semi-annual
installments, with interest at 6% per year.  The unpaid balance will likely
be collateralized by certain excess real estate.  If the settlement is not
consummated, the government may initiate suit under the False Claims Act,
seeking treble damages and penalties, and under the Truth in Negotiation Act,
seeking a price reduction on certain contracts and subcontracts.

     The Corporate Administrative Contracting Officer (the "ACO"), based upon
the advice of the United States Defense Contract Audit Agency, has made a
determination that FII did not comply with Cost Accounting Standards in
accounting for (i) the 1985 reversion to FII of certain assets of terminated
defined benefit pension plans, and (ii) pension costs upon the closing of
segments of FII's business.  The ACO has directed FII to prepare a cost
impact proposal relating to such plan terminations and segment closings and,
following receipt of such cost impact proposals, may seek adjustments to
contract prices.  The ACO alleges that substantial amounts will be due if
such adjustments are made.  The Company believes it has properly accounted
for the asset reversions in accordance with applicable accounting standards. 
The Company has entered into discussions with the government to attempt to
resolve these pension accounting issues.

Civil Litigation
- ----------------

     Maurice Bidermann Litigation
     ----------------------------

     The Company commenced an action in the United States District for the
Southern District of New York, following the breach by Maurice Bidermann
("Bidermann") of an agreement under which Bidermann was to have paid the
Company an aggregate sum of approximately $22,500,000, of which Bidermann
paid $10,000,000.  Additional installments, of $5,000,000 each, were due from
Bidermann on December 31, 1992, and June 30, 1993, both of which Bidermann
failed to pay.  On July 7, 1993, the United States District Court ordered
Bidermann to pay the Company the full amount of its claim, $12,947,000, plus
interest.  Following receipt of the Court's order, Bidermann filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; however,
subsequent to the 1994 fiscal year end, on motion of the Company, the
Bankruptcy Court dismissed Bidermann's Chapter 11 proceedings.  Prior to
Bidermann's filing for protection under Chapter 11, and continuing subsequent
to the Bankruptcy Court's dismissal of those proceedings, the Company
attached substantially all assets of Bidermann.  In addition, the Company
holds shares and warrants of Bidermann Industries, USA, Inc., all of which
shares and warrants Bidermann had originally agreed to purchase from the
Company for $22,500,000.  The collectibility of this judgement, which has
been affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals, will depend in part upon
the Company's ability to realize sufficient amounts from its attachments, and
the value of the shares and warrants held.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------

     The Company and other aerospace fastener and industrial product
manufacturers are subject to stringent Federal, state and local environmental
laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of
materials into the environment and the generation, handling, storage,
transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials.  To date, such
laws and regulations have not had a material effect on the financial
condition of the Company, although the Company has expended, and can be
expected to expend in the future, significant amounts for investigation of
environmental conditions and installation of environmental control
facilities, remediation of environmental conditions and other similar
matters, particularly in the Aerospace Fasteners segment.

     In connection with its plans to dispose of certain real estate, the
Company must investigate environmental conditions and may be required to take
certain corrective action prior or pursuant to any such disposition.  In
addition, management has identified several areas of potential contamination
at or from other facilities owned, or previously owned, by the Company, that
may require the Company either to take corrective action or to contribute to
a clean-up.  The Company is also a defendant in certain lawsuits and
proceedings seeking to require the Company to pay for investigation or
remediation of environmental matters and has been alleged to be a potentially
responsible party at various "Superfund" sites.  Management of the Company
believes that it has recorded adequate reserves in its financial statements
to complete such investigation and take any necessary corrective actions or
make any necessary contributions.  No amounts have been recorded as due from
third parties, including insurers, or set off against, any liability of the
Company, unless such parties are contractually obligated to contribute and
are not disputing such liability.

Other Matters
- -------------

     The Company is involved in various other claims and lawsuits incidental
to its business, some of which involve substantial amounts.  The Company,
either on its own or through its insurance carriers, is contesting these
matters.

     In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of the legal
proceedings, including those discussed above, will not have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition or the future operating results of
the Company.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
         FINANCIAL CONDITION
         -------------------

     The Fairchild Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated under the
laws of the State of Delaware in October, 1969.  The Company changed its name
from Banner Industries, Inc. to The Fairchild Corporation on November 15,
1990.  RHI Holdings, Inc. ("RHI") is a direct subsidiary of the Company.  RHI
is the owner of all of the common stock of Fairchild Industries, Inc. ("FII")
which, in turn, is the 100% owner of VSI Corporation ("VSI").  The Company's
operations are conducted primarily through VSI.  RHI also holds a significant
equity interest in Banner Aerospace, Inc. ("Banner").

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     On December 23, 1993, the Company consummated the sale of its 43.9%
stock interest in Rexnord Corporation ("Rexnord"), consisting of 8,083,248
shares, for $22.50 per share, to BTR Dunlop Holdings, Inc.  The Company
received $181.9 million in proceeds and realized a pre-tax gain of $129.1
million, net of expenses, in the second quarter of Fiscal 1994.

    During the first quarter of Fiscal 1994, the Company adopted Statements
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions", and No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes", and elected to take one-time non-cash charges totaling $10.9
million, of which $8.0 million was for postretirement benefits and $2.9
million for change in accounting for income taxes.  These charges are
reflected in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, and represent cumulative
effects on prior years of the accounting changes.  For the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1994, the effect of the changes on pretax income from continuing
operations was not material.

     On June 10, 1994, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of
Convac GmbH for approximately $4,700,000.  Convac GmbH ("Convac") is a
leading designer and manufacturer of high precision state-of-the-art wet
processing tools, equipment and systems required for the manufacture of semi-
conductor chips and related products and for compact and optical storage
discs and liquid crystal displays.  The results of operations will be
reported as part of the Industrial Products segment in the future and were
immaterial in Fiscal 1994.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The Company currently operates in three principal business segments: 
Aerospace Fasteners, Industrial Products and Communications Services.  The
following table illustrates the historical sales and operating income of the
Company's continuing operations for the past three years.

</TABLE>
FISCAL 1994 VERSUS FISCAL 1993

General
- -------

     Overall sales declined by 4.2% for Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993,
primarily caused by price erosion due to excess capacity in the aerospace
fasteners industry, reduced order rates from commercial and military
aerospace customers in the Aerospace Fasteners segment and lower revenues due
to the disruption caused by the earthquake.  Reduced order rates were
principally due to reductions in defense spending and reduced build rates of
commercial airplane original equipment manufacturers, due to conditions in
the airline industry.  The decline in sales at the Aerospace Fasteners
segment was partially offset by significant sales increases at the Industrial
Products and Communication Services segments in the Fiscal 1994 period.  The
Industrial Products segment included sales in the current period by Fairchild
Data Corporation which had been classified as a discontinued operation in the
prior periods.

     Operating income decreased by $13.5 million in Fiscal 1994, compared to
Fiscal 1993.  A restructuring charge of $18.9 million was recorded in Fiscal
1994 to further implement the Aerospace Fasteners segment restructuring plan.
A $4.0 million charge for earthquake damage and related business interruption
also affected this segment in Fiscal 1994.  Operating income was up in the
Industrial Products and Communications Services business segments for Fiscal
1994, however, in the Aerospace Fasteners segment operating income declined
$16.8 million for Fiscal 1994, compared to the prior year.  Other corporate
income also decreased in Fiscal 1994.  (See discussion below.)

Aerospace Fasteners
- -------------------

     Sales in the Aerospace Fasteners segment decreased 17.7% in Fiscal 1994,
compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to the reduced order rates.  Ordering
activity remained at low levels at original equipment manufacturers, and in
the replacement markets.  In addition, customers are rescheduling orders to
take later delivery in line with reduced aircraft build rates.

     The operating loss in the Aerospace Fasteners segment increased by $16.8
million in Fiscal 1994, compared to the Fiscal 1993 period.  During the
Fiscal 1994 period, as a result of the sustained soft worldwide demand for
aircraft, aircraft engines and the resulting decline in new order rates and
prices for aerospace fasteners, the Company has continued to undertake
further restructuring actions to further downsize, reduce costs, reduce cycle
times and improve margins.  These restructuring efforts include
discontinuance of certain aircraft engine bolt and other product lines,
increased cellularization of manufacturing processes, including relocation of
its New Jersey operations into California and re-engineering certain
manufacturing processes and methods to meet increased customer quality
standards.

     The Company recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $18.9 million in
Fiscal 1994 to cover the cost of the above mentioned restructuring
activities, including the write down of goodwill and surplus assets related
to certain product lines, severance benefits and the nonrecurring costs
associated with the cellularization and reengineering of manufacturing
processes and methods.  Depending on future demand and prices of aerospace
fasteners, the Company may take further restructuring actions in the future
and may record additional restructuring charges to cover the cost of these
activities.  The Fiscal 1993 period included a restructuring charge of $15.5
million relating to further downsizing fastener operations in Europe and
California, and severance and early retirement benefits for terminated
employees.

     On January 17, 1994, the Company's Chatsworth, California Aerospace
Fasteners manufacturing facility suffered extensive damage from the Southern
California earthquake.  As a result, the Company has relocated the Chatsworth
manufacturing operations to its other Southern California facilities.  This
disruption has caused increased costs and reduced revenues in Fiscal 1994 and
will likely negatively affect Fiscal 1995 as well.  While the Company carries
insurance for both business interruption and property damage caused by
earthquakes, the policy has a 5% deductible.  The Company has recorded an
unusual pretax loss in Fiscal 1994 of $4.0 million to cover the currently
estimated net cost of the damages and business interruption caused by the
earthquake.  Included in prepaids and other current assets is an insurance
claim receivable of $5.9 million for recoverability of costs related to
business interruption and property damage.

     Operating income in Fiscal 1994 was also affected by (1) reduced demand
and price erosion; and (2) higher quality control costs resulting from
customers' intensified quality requirements.  A large customer's disapproval
in the third quarter of Fiscal 1993, of the quality system at one of the
Aerospace Fasteners segment's plants negatively affected sales and operating
income in Fiscal 1994.  The disapproval resulted in the plant being
ineligible to receive new orders, delayed shipments due to on-site customer
inspection of finished product, and increased quality costs.  The segment has
implemented a program to comply with the customer's quality requirements and
the plant's quality system was requalified by the customer during the first
quarter of Fiscal 1994.  The quality improvement program requires that the
plant reinspect its inventories and modify certain manufacturing processes
and quality procedures at all major facilities.  This program has resulted in
one time start-up costs and increased recurring quality costs, each of which
negatively affected the Fiscal 1994 operating results, and will likely
negatively affect the future profit margins of this segment.

Industrial Products
- -------------------

     Sales in the Industrial Products segment increased 12.2% in Fiscal 1994
compared to Fiscal 1993.  The inclusion of Fairchild Data Corporation sales
in Fiscal 1994 accounted for 76.5% of the increased sales in this segment. 
The increase in sales in the current period reflects customer response to  
D-M-E Company's ("DME") fast delivery programs, new products, and growth of
the domestic economy.  Domestic demand for tooling for plastics has been
strong while foreign demand has been sluggish in certain countries,
reflecting the economic conditions abroad.  However, expansion into selected
foreign markets is being pursued and appears to have potential.

     Operating income in the Industrial Products segment increased 10.2% in
Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993.  The inclusion of Fairchild Data
Corporation operating income in Fiscal 1994 accounted for 48.9% of the
increase in operating income in this segment.  The improved results in the
current period resulted from a higher sales volume and improved operating
margins.  In recent years the Industrial Products segment has implemented
several cost savings steps, including overhead reduction and improved
inventory management programs, which have contributed to the higher operating
margins.  The improvements in inventory management and delivery systems
resulted in faster deliveries, reduction in inventory, and higher inventory
turnover.  In addition, DME has continued to implement improved manufacturing
methods that have reduced cycle times and costs.

Communications Services
- -----------------------

     Sales in the Communications Services segment increased 9.0% in Fiscal
1994, compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to the inclusion of sales from
acquisitions, the addition of telecommunications franchises in new office
buildings, and growth at existing sites.

     Operating income in the Communications Services segment increased 12.2%
in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to increased sales
resulting from the reasons given above and related economies of scale. 
Operating income as a percent of sales in Fiscal 1994 was slightly higher
than Fiscal 1993.

Other Expenses/Income
- ---------------------

     Corporate Administrative Expense - Corporate administrative expense
decreased by 13.5% in Fiscal 1994, as compared to Fiscal 1993.  This decline
resulted primarily from cost controls, including a reduction in work force
and wage and salary caps that were in effect for most corporate employees and
the sale of the Company airplane during Fiscal 1994.  Excluding severance
payouts, corporate administrative expense declined over 15.9% in Fiscal 1994
compared to Fiscal 1993.

     Other Corporate Income - Other corporate income decreased $3.1 million
in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to the absence of
amortization of over accrued retiree health care expense in Fiscal 1994 and
the write down of a corporate facility held for sale.

     Net Interest Expense - Net interest expense decreased 1.0% in Fiscal
1994, compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to higher interest income in the
Fiscal 1994 period as a result of higher cash balances.

     Investment Income - Investment income was higher by $3.5 million in
Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily as a result of gains realized
on the liquidation of investments in Fiscal 1994.  Also included in Fiscal
1994 were $2.8 million of dividends realized on participating pension annuity
contracts.

     Equity in Earnings of Affiliates - Equity in earnings of affiliates
decreased $12.1 million in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993, due to the
lower earnings of Banner, after recording nonrecurring charges for
discontinued operations, and of Rexnord prior to the Company selling its
interest in Rexnord.  Consequently, the current year period includes no
earnings for Rexnord subsequent to the sale date.

     Minority Interest - Minority interest includes dividend expense on FII's
Series C Preferred Stock, issued August 22, 1992 by FII.

     Non-Recurring Income - Non-recurring income in Fiscal 1994 includes the
net pre-tax gain of $129.1 million on the Company's 43.9% stock interest in
Rexnord, which was sold to BTR Dunlop Holdings, Inc. for $22.50 per share on
December 23, 1993.

     Income Taxes - For Fiscal 1994, the Company provided an income tax
provision at a rate of 47.4%.  The provision tax rate was higher than the
statutory rate, largely due to the write off and amortization of goodwill,
which is not deductible for tax purposes.  

Accounting Changes:

     1)  Postretirement Benefits - Using the immediate recognition method,
the after-tax charge to earnings representing the cumulative effect of the
accounting change was $.5 million.  The unamortized portion of an overstated
liability of $10.4 million for discontinued operations substantially offset
the transition obligation of $10.9 million for active employees and retirees
of continuing operations.  In addition, a $7.5 million charge, net of the
Company's related tax benefit, was recorded for the Company's share of
Rexnord's cumulative charge resulting from this change in accounting.

     2)  Accounting for Income Taxes - The Company elected the immediate
recognition method and recorded a $2.4 million charge representing the
cumulative effect on prior years.  This charge represents deferred taxes
related primarily to differences between the tax basis and book basis of
fixed assets, prepaid pension expense, and inventory.  In addition, a $.5
million charge was recorded for the Company's share of Rexnord's cumulative
charge resulting from this accounting change.

     Extraordinary items - net included in Fiscal 1993 is an extraordinary
charge of $11.8 million, net of tax, which is 42% of the Rexnord
extraordinary charge related to premiums paid to repurchase debt and the
write off of deferred loan costs.  In addition, FII recorded a charge of $.8
million, net of tax, for deferred loan fees written off from the portion of
the term loan repaid.

     Net Earnings (Loss) - The $71.9 million increase in the Fiscal 1994 net
earnings compared to Fiscal 1993 was primarily due to the $129.1 million gain
on the sale of shares of Rexnord, offset partially by a $13.5 million drop in
operating income, decreased equity earnings of $12.0 million, an $11.0
million charge, net of tax, for the cumulative effect of changes in
accounting principles, and increased taxes on the higher level of income.

FISCAL 1993 VERSUS FISCAL 1992
- ------------------------------

General
- -------

     Overall sales declined by 5.4% for Fiscal 1993, compared to Fiscal 1992,
primarily caused by price erosion due to excess capacity in the aerospace
fasteners industry and reduced order rates from commercial and military
aerospace customers in the Aerospace Fasteners segment.  The decline in sales
at the Aerospace Fasteners segment was partially offset by significant sales
increases at the Industrial Products and Communication Services segments in
the Fiscal 1993 period.  Operating income decreased 83.9% for Fiscal 1993,
compared to Fiscal 1992.  Operating income was up in the Industrial Products
and Communications Services business segments for Fiscal 1993; however, in
the Aerospace Fasteners segment, operating income declined $31.1 million for
Fiscal 1993, compared to the prior year.  Both twelve month periods ended
June 30, 1993, and June 30, 1992, included restructuring charges in the
Aerospace Fasteners segment.  Corporate administrative expense declined and
other corporate income also improved in Fiscal 1993.  (See discussion below.)

Aerospace Fasteners
- -------------------

     Sales in the Aerospace Fasteners segment decreased 17.4% in Fiscal 1993,
compared to Fiscal 1992, primarily due to the reduced order rates mentioned
above.  Ordering activity remained at low levels at commercial airplane
original equipment manufacturers, engine manufacturers, in defense related
procurement, and in the replacement markets served by distributors.  In
addition, customers rescheduled orders to take later delivery in line with
reduced aircraft build rates.

     Operating income in the Aerospace Fasteners segment decreased $31.1
million in Fiscal 1993, in relation to the comparable Fiscal 1992 period. 
During the Fiscal 1993 period, the Company continued to implement
restructuring plans and included restructuring charges of $15.5 million to
further downsize fastener operations in Europe and California and close and
consolidate its New Jersey operations into California.  This resulted in
severance costs, plant closing and relocation costs, and the write off of
excess assets.  The Fiscal 1992 period included restructuring charges of $2.5
million related to severance and early retirement benefits for terminated
employees.  Operating income in Fiscal 1993 also was negatively affected by
(1) reduced demand and price erosion; (2) higher quality control costs
resulting from customers' intensified quality requirements; and (3) increased
provisions for excess and slow moving inventory, which amounted to $7.4
million in Fiscal 1993 versus $5.1 million in Fiscal 1992.

Industrial Products
- -------------------

     Sales in the Industrial Products segment increased 12.3% in Fiscal 1993
compared to Fiscal 1992.  The increase in sales in Fiscal 1993 reflected
customer response to D-M-E's fast delivery programs, new products, and
moderation of the impact of the economic recession which adversely affected
results in Fiscal 1992.  Domestic demand for tooling for plastics was strong
while foreign demand was weak. 

     Operating income in the Industrial Products segment increased 25.1% in
Fiscal 1993, compared to Fiscal 1992.  The improved results in Fiscal 1993
resulted from a higher sales volume and improved operating margins.  Early in
Fiscal 1992, the Industrial Products segment implemented several cost savings
steps, including overhead reduction and improved inventory management
programs, which have contributed to the higher operating margins.  

Communications Services
- -----------------------

     Sales in the Communications Services segment increased 16.8% in Fiscal
1993, compared to Fiscal 1992, primarily due to the inclusion of sales from
acquisitions, the addition of telecommunications franchises in new office
buildings, and growth at existing sites.

     Operating income in the Communications Services segment increased 9.6%
in Fiscal 1993 compared to Fiscal 1992, primarily due to increased sales. 
Operating income as a percent of sales declined in Fiscal 1993 to 21.6% from
23.0% in Fiscal 1992.  The decline was due to lower long distance margins
partially offset by lower selling general and administrative expenses as a
percent of sales.

Other Expenses/Income
- ---------------------

     Corporate Administrative Expense - Corporate administrative expense
decreased by 11.2% in Fiscal 1993 as compared to Fiscal 1992.  This decline
resulted primarily from cost controls including salary reductions and wage
and salary freezes that were in effect for most corporate employees in Fiscal
1993.

     Other Corporate Income - Other corporate income includes royalty income,
rental income, and the reversal of excess reserves no longer deemed
necessary.  Other corporate income increased $1.7 million in Fiscal 1993
compared to Fiscal 1992, primarily due to the adjustment of overstated health
care liabilities of $2.7 million no longer deemed necessary in Fiscal 1993.

     Net Interest Expense - Net interest expense increased 1.2% in Fiscal
1993, compared to Fiscal 1992, primarily due to lower interest income in the
Fiscal 1993 as a result of lower cash balances.  Interest expense was lower
in Fiscal 1993 as a result of lower interest rates.

     Investment Income - Investment income was lower by $6.8 million in
Fiscal 1993 compared to Fiscal 1992, primarily as a result of reduced
dividends received on participating pension annuity contracts, and lower
gains on securities sold as a result of a smaller investment portfolio. 

     Equity in Earnings of Affiliates - Equity in earnings of affiliates
improved $3.9 million in Fiscal 1993, primarily due to better performance of
Rexnord in Fiscal 1993 compared to Fiscal 1992, partially offset by lower
earnings of Banner.

     Minority Interest - Minority interest increased in Fiscal 1993 since it
included dividend expense on the Series C Preferred Stock issued by FII early
in Fiscal 1993.

     Income Taxes - For Fiscal 1993, the Company recorded an income tax
benefit.  This benefit represents the realizable portion of the tax effect of
the current years operating loss net of foreign and state tax provisions. 
The benefit tax rate was lower than the statutory rate, largely due to
permanent differences between financial reporting and tax accounting, the
majority of which resulted from the acquisition of FII by the Company in
1989.  The most significant differences were depreciation related to the
write-up to fair value of property, plant and equipment and amortization of
goodwill, neither of which is deductible for tax purposes.  In addition, the
benefit also included a change in tax accruals of $4 million no longer
required. 

     Extraordinary Items - Net - Extraordinary items - net in Fiscal 1993
includes an extraordinary charge of $11.8 million net of tax which was the
Company's share of the Rexnord extraordinary charge related to premiums paid
to repurchase debt and the write off of deferred loan costs, plus $.8 million
for the write off of deferred loan costs at FII related to the portion of the
term loan repaid.  In Fiscal 1992, after-tax gains were recognized on the
early extinguishment of RHI's Senior Subordinated Debentures.

     Net Earnings (Loss) - The $33.3 million increase in the Fiscal 1993 net
loss compared to Fiscal 1992 was primarily due to the $21.8 million decline
in operating income, the $6.8 million drop in investment income, and the
$12.9 million increase in the extraordinary charges.  However, reducing this
loss was an additional tax benefit of $4.3 million with no impact from
discontinued operations in Fiscal 1993 compared to $3.0 million from
discontinued operations in Fiscal 1992.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Working capital at June 30, 1994 was $145.8 million which was $78
million higher than at June 30, 1993.  Cash increased $32.3 million resulting
from the sale of shares of Rexnord, and current debt decreased by $51.8
million.  Offsetting this increase was an increase in the income tax payable
account reflecting taxes recorded on the sale of shares of Rexnord.  An
increase in accounts receivable of $9.8 million was substantially offset by
an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, which was
largely due to the acquisition of Convac in June 1994.

     The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from
operations and borrowings under the Credit Agreement.  As a result of certain
amendments to its Credit Agreement, and the issuance of FII's Senior Secured
Notes due 1999, $50 million of VSI's revolving credit facility has been
extended from 1994 to 1997.

     The Company also expects to generate cash from the sale of certain
assets and liquidation of investments.  Net assets held for sale at June 30,
1994 had a book value of $36.4 million and included several parcels of real
estate in California and an 88 acre parcel of real estate located in
Farmingdale, New York, which the Company plans to sell,lease or develop,
subject to the resolution of environmental matters and market conditions. 
Included in long-term investments at June 30, 1994 is a contractual
obligation for the Company to receive $12.9 million from an individual which
has a net carrying amount of $9.3 million.  The obligation in part, may be
satisfied by 7.1% of the outstanding common stock of Bidermann Industries
USA, Inc., a closely held company, held by the Company.  In addition, the
Company has attached substantially all of the individual's property.  The
individual filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code
on July 7, 1993.  However, subsequent to the 1994 fiscal year end, on a
motion by the Company, the Bankruptcy Court dismissed the Chapter 11
proceedings.  The Company believes that liquidation of assets held or
attached by the Company will be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of
this investment.  (See Note 19 to the Financial Statements).

     The Company's principal cash requirements include debt service, capital
expenditures, acquisitions, payment of other liabilities and payment of
dividends on preferred stock.

     The level of the Company's capital expenditures varies from year to
year, depending upon the timing of capital spending for new production
equipment, periodic plant and facility expansion, acquisition of building
telecommunication assets, as well as cost reduction and labor efficiency
programs.  For Fiscal 1994, capital expenditures including the cost of
acquisitions were $18.2 million.  Capital expenditures for Fiscal 1993 and
Fiscal 1992 were $22.9 million and $35.9 million, respectively.  The Company
anticipates that capital expenditures in Fiscal 1995 will approximate $19.6
million.

     During Fiscal 1994, goodwill was reduced by $7.0 million as a result of
the restructuring charge which included a write down of goodwill related to
certain aerospace fasteners product lines which are in the process of being
discontinued.

     Investments and advances - affiliated companies decreased $58.4 million,
primarily due to the sale of the Company's stock interest in Rexnord,
combined with accounting changes and restructuring charges recorded by
Rexnord during the first half of Fiscal 1994 and charges for discontinued
operations recorded at Banner in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 1994.

     Long term debt decreased $44.1 million during Fiscal 1994 as a result of
the Company repurchasing some of its senior debt.

     Other liabilities that require the use of cash include post-employment
benefits for retirees, environmental investigation and remediation
obligations, litigation settlements and related costs.

     The Company expects that cash generated from operations, borrowings,
asset sales and the ability to refinance portions of its debt will be
adequate to satisfy cash requirements.

     The Company's Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with
certain financial covenants including, achieving cumulative earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, ("EBITDA Covenant"), and
maintaining certain coverage ratios.  The Company was in compliance with the
Credit Agreement as of the end of Fiscal 1994.  The Company has negotiated an
amendment to the Credit Agreement (i) to accommodate the unusual loss from
the January 17, 1994 Southern California earthquake, and (ii) to reduce by
$5.0 million the Company's minimum requirement under the EBITDA Covenant for
the duration of the Credit Agreement.  To comply with the minimum EBITDA
Covenant requirements (as amended), the Company's subsidiary, VSI, must earn
for the cumulative total of the trailing four quarters, EBITDA as follows: 
$68.6 million for the first quarter of Fiscal 1995, $70.4 million for the
second quarter of Fiscal 1995, $72.1 million for the third quarter of Fiscal
1995, and $75.0 millon for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 1995.  VSI's ability
to meet the minimum requirement under the EBITDA covenant in Fiscal 1995 is
uncertain, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able in the
future to comply with the minimum requirements under the EBITDA Covenant and
other financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.  Noncompliance with any
of the financial covenants, without cure, or waiver would constitute an event
of default under the Credit Agreement.  An event of default resulting from a
breach of a financial covenant may result, at the option of lenders holding
a majority of the loans, in acceleration of the principal and interest
outstanding, and termination of the revolving credit line.  If necessary,
management believes a waiver can be obtained.

     FII may transfer available cash as dividends to RHI if the purpose of
such dividends is to provide the Company with funds necessary to meet its
debt service requirements under specified notes and debentures.  All other
dividends to RHI are subject to certain limitations under the Credit
Agreement.  As of June 30, 1994, FII was unable to provide dividends to RHI. 
The Credit Agreement also restricts all additional borrowings under the
Credit Facilities for the payment of any dividends.

IMPACT OF FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES


Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan
- ------------------------------------------------

     On July 1, 1994 the Company implemented SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" ("SFAS No. 114").  SFAS No. 114 is a
change in accounting principle that requires the Company, as a creditor, to
evaluate for impairment (i) the collectibility of the contractual principal
and interest of accounts receivable and notes receivable with terms longer
than one year, and (ii) all loans restructured in a troubled debt
restructuring.  Accordingly, any loan impairment shall be recognized in the
financial statements.  The effect of implementing SFAS No. 114, by the
Company, was not material.

Accounting for Certain Investments and Debt and Equity Securities
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

     On July 1, 1994 the Company adopted SFAS No. 115 "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS No. 115").  SFAS No. 115
provides new rules on accounting and reporting for investments in equity
securities that have readily determinable fair values and for all investments
in debt securities.  The effect of implementing SFAS No. 115, by the Company,
was not material.<PAGE>

            THE FAIRCHILD CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
     ------------------------------------------

     Corporate Structure:  The Fairchild Corporation (the "Company") was
incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in October, 1969.  RHI
Holdings, Inc. ("RHI") is a direct subsidiary of the Company.  RHI is the
owner of all of the common stock of Fairchild Industries, Inc. ("FII") which,
in turn, is the 100% owner of VSI Corporation ("VSI").  The Company's
operations are conducted primarily through VSI.  The Company also holds a
significant equity interest in Banner Aerospace, Inc. ("Banner").

     Fiscal Year:  The fiscal year ("Fiscal") of the Company ends June 30. 
All references herein to "1994", "1993", and "1992" mean the fiscal years
ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

     Principles of Consolidation:  The consolidated financial statements are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. 
Investments in companies owned between 20 percent and 50 percent are recorded
at cost, adjusted for equity in undistributed earnings or losses since the
date of acquisition (see Note 7).  All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

     Statements of Cash Flows:  For purposes of the statements of cash flows,
the Company considers all temporary investments with original maturity dates
of three months or less as cash equivalents.  Total net cash disbursements
(receipts) made by the Company for income taxes and interest were as follows:

</TABLE>

     Restricted Cash:  On June 30, 1994, the Company had restricted cash of
$4,745,000 all of which is maintained as collateral for certain debt
facilities.  Cash investments are in high grade, short-term certificates of
deposit.

     Inventories:  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market,
with cost determined primarily on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. 
Inventories from continuing operations are valued as follows:

</TABLE>
     For inventories valued on the LIFO method, the excess of current FIFO
value over stated LIFO value was approximately $7,924,000 and $8,981,000 at
June 30, 1994 and 1993.  The LIFO decrement was immaterial for Fiscal 1994.

     Properties and Depreciation:  Properties are stated at cost and
depreciated over estimated useful lives, generally on a straight-line basis. 
For Federal income tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are used. 
No interest costs were capitalized in any of the years presented.  Property,
plant and equipment consisted of the following:

</TABLE>
     Amortization of Goodwill:  The excess of the cost of purchased
businesses over the fair value of their net assets at acquisition dates
(goodwill) is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years.

     Deferred Loan Costs:  Deferred loan costs associated with various debt
issues are being amortized over the terms of the related debt, based on the
amount of outstanding debt, using the effective interest method. 
Amortization expense for these loan costs for Fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992 was
$4,253,000, $3,355,000 and $3,772,000, respectively.

     Impairment of Long Lived Assets:  The Company reviews its long lived
assets, including property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangibles and
goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.  To determine
recoverability of its long lived assets the Company evaluates the probability
that undiscounted future net cash flows, without interest charges, will be
less than the carrying amount of the assets.

     Despite two consecutive years of operating losses in the Company's
Aerospace Fasteners segment, the Company believes that future net cash flows
from this segment will be sufficient to permit recovery of the segment's long
lived assets, including the remaining goodwill, after a $7,000,000 reduction
of goodwill in Fiscal 1994 relating to certain aerospace product lines which
are in the process of being discontinued.

     Foreign Currency Translation:  All balance sheet accounts of foreign
subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the
accounting period.  Income statement items are translated at average currency
exchange rates.  The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a
separate component of stockholders' equity.  Transaction gains and losses
included in other income were not significant in Fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992.

     Research and Development:  Company-sponsored research and development
expenditures are expensed as incurred.

     Non-Recurring Items:  Non-recurring income for Fiscal 1994 consists of
the net pretax gain of $129,082,000 on the sale of Rexnord Corporation
("Rexnord") stock (see Note 2).

     Extraordinary items:  The Company recognized extraordinary gains and
losses, net of write-offs of deferred debt issue costs and debt discounts,
from the early extinguishment of debt resulting from the repurchases of its
debentures on the open market or in negotiated transactions.  Total
repurchases made by the Company were $33,658,000 face value purchased for
$34,016,000 in Fiscal 1994, $559,000 face value purchased for $495,000 in
Fiscal 1993, and $4,746,000 face value purchased for $4,085,000 in Fiscal
1992.  The Company recorded extraordinary income (loss), net of taxes, of
$(643,000), $18,000, and $329,000 relating to these repurchases in Fiscal
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

     The Company also recognized an extraordinary loss of $11,804,000, net of
tax, in Fiscal 1993 relating to the recapitalization of Rexnord prior to the
Company selling its significant equity ownership (see Note 4).

     Earnings Per Share:  Primary and fully diluted earnings per share are
computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of shares and share equivalents outstanding during
the period.  To compute the incremental shares resulting from stock options
and warrants for primary earnings per share, the average market price of the
Company's stock during the period is used.  To compute the incremental shares
resulting from stock options and warrants for fully diluted earnings per
share, the greater of the ending market price or the average market price of
the Company's stock is used.  In computing earnings per share for Fiscal
1994, 1993 and 1992, the conversion of options and warrants was not assumed,
as the effect was anti-dilutive.

     Reclassifications:  Certain amounts in prior years' financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the 1994 presentation.


2.   SALE OF REXNORD CORPORATION
     ---------------------------

     On December 23, 1993, the Company completed a sale of its 43.9% stock
interest in Rexnord to BTR Dunlop Holdings, Inc. ("BTR"), for $22.50 per
share.  The Company received $181,873,000 in gross proceeds and realized for
Fiscal 1994, a $129,082,000 net pre-tax gain on the sale.  In connection with
the sale of its interest in Rexnord, the Company agreed to place shares of
Banner, with a fair market value of $25,000,000, in escrow to secure the
Company's indemnification of BTR against a contingent liability.  Once the
contingent liability is resolved, the escrow will be released.  The financial
statements include the Company's equity earnings from Rexnord, until the date
of the sale.  (See Note 7).

3.   ACQUISITIONS
     ------------

     On June 10, 1994, RHI acquired 100% of the Common Stock of Convac GmbH
for approximately $4,700,000.  Convac GmbH is a leading designer and
manufacturer of high precision state-of-the-art wet processing tools,
equipment and systems required for the manufacture of semiconductor chips and
related products, for compact and optical storage discs and liquid crystal
displays.

     Fairchild Communications Services Company ("Fairchild Communications"),
a partnership whose partners are indirect subsidiaries of the Company, has,
within the last few years, completed the acquisition of several small
companies involved in the building telecommunications business. In Fiscal
1993, Fairchild Communications acquired all the telecommunication assets of
Office Networks, Inc. for approximately $7,300,000.

     The cost of Fiscal 1992 acquisitions by Fairchild Communications totaled
approximately $4,960,000.  These purchases included:  Bramtel, Inc. purchased
August 1991 for $1,800,000; Hansen Communications purchased September 1991
for $160,000; certain assets of Telshare Associates Limited Partnership
purchased April 1992 for approximately $1,100,000; and the stock of Teletech
Resources Corporation purchased May 1992 for approximately $1,900,000,
subject to certain adjustments.

4.   REXNORD RECAPITALIZATION
     ------------------------

     On July 9, 1992, Rex-PT Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Rexnord Corporation, completed a recapitalization (the "Rexnord
Recapitalization").  The Rexnord Recapitalization included (i) a Public
Offering of $172,500,000 of new Senior Notes due 2002, (ii) an increase in
the amount of borrowing available under its credit agreement, and (iii) an
Initial Public Offering (the "Rexnord IPO") of 9,200,000 shares of Rexnord
Corporation Common Stock $0.01 par value, at $17 per share.  Immediately
prior to the Rexnord IPO, Rexnord Corporation (i) redeemed 4,878,582 shares
of its Series A Preferred Stock and paid $5,093,000 as the redemption price,
and (ii) merged with and into Rex-PT Holdings, Inc., which was the surviving
corporation.  Pursuant to the merger, Rex-PT Holdings,Inc. changed its name
to Rexnord Corporation.

     In conjunction with the Rexnord IPO, the Company exercised an option to
purchase 1,794,530 shares of Rexnord common stock from Zaria Inc. for
approximately $18,600,000, and converted all classes of Rexnord's Preferred
Stock held by the Company into Common Shares of Rexnord at a conversion price
of $22 per share.  Subsequent to the completion of the Rexnord IPO, the
Company owned approximately 44.7% of Rexnord's common stock.  As a result of
the Rexnord Recapitalization, in the first quarter of Fiscal 1993, the
Company recorded an extraordinary charge of $11,804,000, 42.0% (its previous
ownership percentage share) of the Rexnord's extraordinary charge related to
premiums paid to repurchase debt and to write off deferred loan costs.  Also,
the gain on the conversion, which is immaterial, was recorded as an increase
to paid-in capital.

5.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND NET ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
     ----------------------------------------------------

     In Fiscal 1990, the Company adopted a plan to dispose of Thompson
Aircraft Tire Company ("Thompson"), an aircraft tire retreading and
distribution operation.  On April 15, 1992, the Company completed the sale of
the U.S. operations of Thompson and received approximately $5,300,000 in
cash.  As a result of the sale, in Fiscal 1992, the Company recorded an
after-tax loss on disposal of discontinued operation of $1,452,744.  In
addition, the Company recorded a loss on disposal of two small subsidiaries,
and a write-down on other assets not related to continuing operations.  

     The net assets of these businesses were reflected in net assets held for
sale and their results of operations have been reclassified as discontinued
operations in the statements of earnings and related footnotes for the
periods presented.

     Presented below is a table summarizing discontinued operations.

(a)  SC-BI Partners L.P. is an investment company partnership which invests
in merger arbitrage and may involve significant risks.  Pursuant to an
agreement among the partners, effective March 31, 1992, the general partner
agreed to liquidate or distribute the assets of the partnership no later than
March 31, 1994, which period could be and was extended for one year as a
defined minimum distribution was achieved.  Furthermore, the general partner
has the option to purchase the then remaining interest of the limited partner
(RHI) or the assets of the partnership at a specified purchase price.

(b)  Represents a former plant site in Redondo Beach, California, which was
contributed to a joint venture with a developer that has built and partially
leased a retail center.

(c)  The Company is a judgement creditor of Maurice Bidermann ("Bidermann"). 
On July 7, 1993, Bidermann filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code.  However, subsequent to the 1994 fiscal year end, on a
motion by the Company, the Bankruptcy Court dismissed Bidermann's Chapter 11
proceedings.  The Company believes that between its ownership of shares of
Bidermann Industries USA, Inc., and the value of assets of Bidermann which
have been attached by the Company, that the book value will be recovered. 
The Company has classified this investment as long-term since the timing of
recovery is uncertain.

increased to generally bear interest at 3.75% over LIBOR and the commitment

</TABLE>
     At June 30, 1994, the Company had unused short-term bank lines of credit
aggregating $52,490,000 at interest rates approximating the prime rate.  The
Company also has short-term lines of credit relating to foreign operations
aggregating $12,147,000 against which the Company owed $3,592,000 at June 30,
1994.

     At June 30, 1994, the Company had outstanding letters of credit of
$11,910,000, which were supported by the Credit Agreement and other bank
facilities on an unsecured basis.

     On August 5, 1992, FII completed a public offering and issued at par
$125,000,000 of 12.25% Senior Secured Notes due 1999 (the "Notes").  The
Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at FII's option on or after August
1, 1997, at 102% of their aggregate principal amount, and thereafter,
beginning August 1, 1998, at 100% of their aggregate principal amount plus
accrued interest.  The Notes are senior secured obligations of FII ranking
"pari passu" with FII's existing and future senior indebtedness.  The
proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used to (i) repay $55,000,000 of
FII's term loans under the Credit Agreement, (ii) repay $50,000,000 of loans
under an VSI's revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement (which
amounts will be available for future borrowings), including $30,000,000 which
FII paid as a portion of dividends (the "Dividends") to its parent, RHI, and
(iii) as part of the Dividends, repay $20,000,000 of loans under RHI's
revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement.

     As a result of the issuance of the Notes, certain amendments to FII's
bank credit agreement (the "Bank Amendments") became effective on August 5,

     Under the most restrictive covenants of the above indentures, the
Company's consolidated net worth must not be less than $35,000,000 and RHI's
consolidated net worth must not be less than $125,000,000.  At the present
time, none of the Company's consolidated retained earnings are available for
capital distributions due to a cumulative earnings restriction.  The
indentures also provide restrictions on the amount of additional borrowings
by the Company.

     The Company and its subsidiaries are each subject to certain covenants
under the Credit Agreement, including a material adverse change clause, and
restrictions on dividends, capital expenditures, capital leases, operating
leases, investments and indebtedness.  It requires the Company to comply with
certain financial covenants including achieving cumulative earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA covenant"), and
maintaining certain coverage ratios.  The Company was in compliance with the
Credit Agreement at June 30, 1994.

     The Company has negotiated an amendment to the Credit Agreement (i) to
accommodate the unusual loss from the January 17, 1994 Southern California
earthquake, and (ii) to reduce by $5,000,000 the Company's minimum
requirement under the EBITDA Covenant for the duration of the Credit
Agreement.  To comply with the minimum EBITDA Covenant requirement (as
amended), the Company's subsidiary, VSI, must earn for the cumulative total
of the trailing four quarters, EBITDA as follows:  $68,600,000 for the first
quarter of Fiscal 1995, $70,360,000 for the second quarter of Fiscal 1995,
$72,120,000 for the third quarter of Fiscal 1995, and $75,000,000 for the
fourth quarter of Fiscal 1995.  VSI's ability to meet the minimum requirement
under the EBITDA Covenant in Fiscal 1995 is uncertain, and there can be no
assurance that the Company will be able in the future to comply with the
minimum requirement under the EBITDA Covenant and other financial covenants
under the Credit Agreement.  Noncompliance with any of the financial
covenants, without cure, or waiver would constitute an event of default under
the Credit Agreement.  An event of default resulting from a breach of a
financial covenant may result, at the option of lenders holding a majority of
the loans, in an acceleration of the principal and interest outstanding, and
a termination of the revolving credit line.  If necessary, management
believes a waiver can be obtained.

     FII may transfer available cash as dividends to RHI if the purpose of
such dividends is to provide the Company with funds necessary to meet its
debt service requirements under specified notes and debentures.  All other
dividends to RHI are subject to certain limitations under the Credit
Agreement.  As of June 30, 1994, FII was unable to provide dividends to RHI. 
The Credit Agreement also restricts all additional borrowings under the
Credit Facilities for the payment of any dividends.

     For FII's operating subsidiary, VSI, capital expenditures are limited
during the remaining term of the Credit Agreement to the lower of (i) an
annual ceiling of $25,200,000 to $26,500,000 per year, or (ii) 30% of the
prior fiscal year's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization.  Capital expenditure reductions can be offset by cash
contributions from the Company.  Capital expenditures can also be increased
if cash proceeds are received from the sale of other property, subject to
approval by the senior lenders under the Credit Agreement.  FII's sale of
property, plant, and equipment is limited during the remaining term of the
Credit Agreement.  VSI is subject to maximum sales for a fair market value of 
$2,000,000 per fiscal year and $5,000,000 over the life of the Credit
Agreement.  FII (other than its subsidiary, VSI) is subject to maximum sales
for a fair market value of $1,000,000 per fiscal year.  However, certain
specified assets can be sold and are not subject to these limitations.

     Annual maturities of long-term debt obligations (exclusive of capital
lease obligations) for each of the five years following June 30, 1994, are as
follows:  $8,818,000 for 1995, $41,509,000 for 1996, $87,648,000 for 1997,
$23,627,000 for 1998 and $215,637,000 for 1999.

9.   PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
     ------------------------------------

     Pensions
     --------

     The Company and its subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans
covering substantially all employees.  Employees in foreign subsidiaries may
participate in local pension plans which are in the aggregate insignificant
and are not included in the following disclosures.  The Company's funding
policy is to make the minimum annual contribution required by applicable
regulations.

     The tables which follow present net pension expense (income) and a
reconciliation of the funded status of the plans for continuing operations
and certain discontinued operations.

     The following table provides a summary of the components of net periodic

     Postretirement Health Care Benefits
     -----------------------------------

     Effective July 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106 ("SFAS 106"), "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions".  The new standard requires that
the expected cost of postretirement benefits be accrued and charged to
expense during the years the employees render the service.  This is a
significant change from the Company's previous policy of expensing these
costs for active employees when paid.

     The Company elected the immediate recognition method of adoption of SFAS
106.  The unamortized portion of the overstated liability for discontinued
operations was $10,370,000, net of tax, which substantially offset a
$10,904,000, net of tax, charge relating to the transition obligation for
active employees and retirees of continuing operations.  The charge to net
earnings as the cumulative effect of this accounting change was $534,000, net
of tax.  For the Fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, the effect of the changes
on pretax income from continuing operations was not material.

     As a result of Rexnord's adoption of SFAS 106, effective July 1, 1993,
the Company recorded an after-tax charge of $7,481,000 to net earnings, which
represents the Company's share of Rexnord's cumulative effect of this change
in accounting, net of the related tax benefits from the charge.

     The Company provides health care benefits for most retired employees. 
Postretirement health care expense from continuing operations totaled
$1,948,000, $1,366,000 and $840,000 for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993
and 1992, respectively.  The Company has accrued approximately $35,386,000 as
of June 30, 1994, for postretirement health care benefits related to
discontinued operations.  This represents the cumulative discounted value of
the long-term obligation and includes interest expense of $3,011,000,
$4,866,000 and $5,099,000 for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  The components of expense in 1994 are as follows:

</TABLE>
     The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was determined using
a discount rate of 8.5%, and a health care cost trend rate of 9.5% and 6.5%
for pre-age-65 and post-age-65 employees, respectively, gradually decreasing
to 4.5% and 5.0%, respectively, in the year 2003 and thereafter.

     Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by 1% would increase
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of June 30, 1994, by
approximately $2,122,000, and increase the net periodic postretirement
benefit cost by approximately $245,000 for Fiscal 1994.

10.  INCOME TAXES
     ------------

     Effective July 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"), "Accounting
for Income Taxes". 

     Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws
that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.  Prior
to the adoption of SFAS 109, income tax expense was determined using the
deferred method.  Deferred tax expense was based on items of income and
expense that were reported in different years in the financial statements and
tax returns and were measured at the tax rate in effect in the year the
difference originated.

     As permitted under SFAS 109, prior years' financial statements have not
been restated.  The Company elected the immediate recognition method and
recorded a $2,412,000 charge representing the prior years' cumulative effect. 
This charge represents deferred taxes that had to be recorded related
primarily to fixed assets, prepaid pension expenses, and inventory basis
differences.

     As a result of Rexnord's adoption of SFAS 109 effective July 1, 1993,
the Company recorded an after-tax charge to net earnings of $523,000, which
represented the Company's share of Rexnord's cumulative effect for this
change in accounting.

     The provision for income taxes from continuing operations is summarized
as follows:

     For tax purposes, the Company had available, at June 30, 1994, net
operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards for regular Federal income tax purposes
of approximately $32,000,000, which will expire as follows:  $23,000,000 in
year 2003, $2,000,000 in year 2008, and $7,000,000 in year 2009.  The Company
also had general business credit carryforwards for tax purposes of
approximately $3,000,000, which will expire during the years 2000 through
2001.

     Domestic income taxes, less available credits, are provided on the
unremitted income of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies, to the
extent that such earnings are intended to be repatriated.  No domestic income
taxes or foreign withholding taxes are provided on the undistributed earnings
of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which are considered permanently
invested, or which would be offset by allowable foreign tax credits.  At June
30, 1994, the amount of domestic taxes payable upon distribution of such
earnings was not significant.

     On July 19, 1993, the Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") completed
an examination of the Federal income tax returns for fiscal years ending
October 31, 1985 and 1986, and February 28, 1987 for Rexnord Inc., which the
Company acquired in 1987.  Federal income tax on the adjustments originally
proposed by the Service amounted to $15,600,000, excluding interest.  In
February, 1994, the Service reduced the adjustments and now proposes tax of
approximately $10,700,000, excluding interest.  The most significant
adjustments involve treatment of professional fees incurred by Rexnord Inc.
with respect to a proposed recapitalization of Rexnord Inc.  The Company has
protested the adjustments through the appeals process of the Service.  The
Company believes these adjustments will be reduced through the appeals
process.

     In the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for all
income taxes and interest, and any liability that may arise for prior
periods, as a result of the proposed adjustments, will not have a material
effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

11.  MINORITY INTEREST IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
     ----------------------------------------------

     The Company is carrying $23,981,000 and $24,015,000 of minority interest
represented by the Series C Preferred Stock of FII in its balance sheet at
June 30, 1994 and June 30, 1993, respectively.  The Series C Preferred Stock
has an annual dividend requirement of $4.25 per share through July 21, 1999,
and $7.00 per share thereafter.

     RHI purchased 800 shares of FII's Series C Preferred Stock in Fiscal
1994.  There were 557,560 and 558,360 shares outstanding at June 30, 1994 and
1993, respectively.

12.  REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SUBSIDIARY
     ----------------------------------------

     The Company has classified the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock of FII, a wholly-owned subsidiary, as a long-term liability.  In
January 1989, annual mandatory redemptions of 165,564 shares began at $45.00
per share plus any dividend in arrears.  FII has the option of redeeming any
or all of its shares, at $45.00 per share.  Due to the merger of FII in
August 1989 with a subsidiary of the Company, holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock are entitled, at their option, but subject to compliance with
certain covenants under FII's Credit Agreement, to redeem their shares for
$27.18 in cash.

     On August 21, 1992, FII closed on an offer to exchange (the "Exchange
Offer") on a one-for-one basis, up to 90% of the outstanding shares of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock of FII for shares of Series C Cumulative
Preferred Stock of FII.  The Exchange Offer resulted in an increase in FII's
stockholders' equity of $25,126,000 (prior to fees and expenses) due to the
Series C Preferred Stock not being mandatorily redeemable or convertible to
cash.  Approximately 56.8% of the outstanding shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock were exchanged for shares of the Series C Preferred Stock. 
The Series C Preferred Stock has an annual dividend requirement of $4.25 per
share through July 21, 1999, and $7.00 per share thereafter.  FII's
requirement to redeem annually shares of Series A Preferred Stock has been
reduced by the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock exchanged for
Series C Preferred Stock, i.e., by 558,360 shares.  Both the Series A
Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock are listed on the New York
Stock Exchange.

     The Company purchased 4,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock in
Fiscal 1994.  The Company did not purchase any Series A Preferred Stock in
Fiscal 1993.  There were 420,701 and 424,701 shares outstanding at June 30,
1994 and June 30, 1993, respectively.

     Annual maturity redemption requirements for redeemable preferred stock,
as of June 30, 1994, are as follows:  $0 for 1995, $4,031,000 for 1996,
$7,450,000 for 1997, and $7,450,000 for 1998.

13.  EQUITY SECURITIES
     -----------------

     The Company had 13,406,109 shares of Class A common stock and 2,696,886
shares of Class B common stock outstanding at June 30, 1994.  Class A common
stock is traded on both the New York and Pacific Stock Exchange.  There is no
public market for the Class B common stock.  Shares of Class A common stock
are entitled to one vote per share and cannot presently be exchanged for
shares of Class B common stock.  Shares of Class B common stock are entitled
to ten votes per share and can be exchanged, at any time, for shares of Class
A common stock on a share-for-share basis.  During Fiscal 1994, 2,400 shares
of Class B common stock were converted by shareholders into Class A common
stock.

     RHI holds an investment in the Company's Class A common stock of
approximately $44,606,000.  The Company accounts for the Class A common stock
held by RHI as Treasury Stock.

14.  STOCK OPTIONS, WARRANTS, AND DEFERRED PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN
     ----------------------------------------------------------------

     The Company has reserved 4,320,000 shares of Class A common stock for
issue to key employees under the Company's 1986 Stock Option Plan.  This plan
authorizes the granting of options over a ten-year period at not less than
the market value of the common stock at the time of the grant.  The option
price is payable in cash or, with the approval of the stock option committee
of the Board of Directors, in shares of common stock, valued at fair market
value at the time of exercise.  The options normally terminate five years
from their date of grant, subject to extension of up to 10 years or for a
stipulated period of time after an employee's death or termination of
employment.

     Stock Options Granted to Directors
     ----------------------------------

     On May 19, 1988, the Board of Directors approved the grant of 180,000
shares of stock options to six outside Directors of the Company at an
exercise price of $6.04.  In Fiscal 1990 and 1991, the Company granted and
approved 75,000 and 60,000 options, respectively, to certain Directors. 
These stock options expire five years from the date of the grant.  The Board
of Directors authorized the grant of stock options of 190,000 shares to
outside Directors of the Company to replace expired stock options, subject to
shareholder approval at the Company's next annual meeting.

     Stock option transactions are summarized below:

     Warrants
     --------

     At June 30, 1994, the Company had outstanding warrants to purchase
375,000 shares of the Company's common stock for $7.67 per share.  The
warrants can be used to purchase either Class A or B common stock and will
expire on March 13, 1995.

     Deferred Performance Incentive Plan
     -----------------------------------

     On December 12, 1986, stockholders approved a deferred performance
incentive plan to promote the financial interest of the Company and its
stockholders.  The plan awards performance incentive units which can convert
into cash or equity awards, subject to certain limitations, which have a term
of six years from the date of grant, based on the incremental increase in
earnings per share over the base of Fiscal 1986 earnings per share,
compounded annually by 15 percent.

     During Fiscal 1989, the Board of Directors authorized 250,000 units for
grants which were subsequently approved by stockholders.  At June 30, 1994,
there were 220,000 incentive units outstanding and 50,000 incentive units
available for grant.  No expense was recognized in Fiscal 1994, 1993 or 1992
based on provisions of the plan.

15.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
     -----------------------------------

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, ("SFAS No. 107")
"Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments", requires disclosures
of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not
recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that
value.  In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values
are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. 
Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used,
including discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.  Certain of the
derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to
independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate
settlement of the instrument.  SFAS No. 107 excludes certain financial
instruments and all non-financial instruments from its disclosure
requirements.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not
represent the underlying value of the Company.

     The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in
estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

     Cash and Cash Equivalents:  The carrying amount reported in the balance
sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates the fair value.

     Investment Securities:  Fair values for equity securities and
investments in affiliates (including investments in affiliates accounted for
under the equity method and not required to be presented under Statement 107)
are based on quoted market prices, where available.  For equity securities
and investments in affiliates not actively traded, fair values are estimated
by using quoted market prices of comparable instruments or, if there are no
relevant comparables, on pricing models or formulas using current
assumptions.  The fair value of limited partnerships and other investments
are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a current
market rate applicable to the yield, credit quality, and maturity of the
investment.

     Notes Receivable:  Fair values of notes receivable are estimated by
using discounted cash flow analyses, using a current market rate applicable
to the yield, credit quality, and maturity of the investment.

     Short-term Borrowings:  The carrying amounts of the Company's short-term
borrowings approximate their fair values.

     Long-term Borrowings and Notes Payable:  The carrying amounts of
borrowings under the Company's bank Credit Agreement and current maturities
of long-term debt approximate their fair value.  The fair value of the
Company's subordinated debentures and senior notes are based on quoted market
prices, where available.  For subordinated debentures not actively traded,
fair values are estimated by using quoted market prices of comparable
instruments.  The fair value for the Company's other long-term debt is
estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company's current
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

     Minority Interest:  The fair value for preferred stock of a subsidiary
is based on the quoted market price.

     Redeemable Preferred Stock:  The fair value for redeemable preferred
stock of a subsidiary is based on the quoted market price.

     Off-balance-sheet Instruments:  Fair values for the Company's off-
balance-sheet instruments (letters of credit, commitments to extend credit,
and lease guarantees) are based on fees currently charged to enter into
similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements
and the counter parties' credit standing.  The current period's fair value of
the Company's off-balance-sheet instruments is immaterial.

     The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial
instruments at June 30, 1994 and June 30, 1993 are as follows:

16.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
     ---------------------

     During the Fiscal 1994 period, as a result of the sustained soft
worldwide demand for aircraft, aircraft engines and the resulting decline in
new order rates and prices for aerospace fasteners, the Company has continued
to undertake additional restructuring actions to further downsize, reduce
costs, reduce cycle times and improve margins.  These restructuring efforts
include discontinuance of certain aircraft engine bolt and other product
lines, increased cellularization of manufacturing processes, relocation of
its New Jersey operations into California and re-engineering certain
manufacturing processes and methods to meet increased customer quality
standards.

     The Company recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $18,860,000 in
Fiscal 1994 to cover the cost of the above mentioned restructuring
activities, including the write down of goodwill and surplus assets related
to certain product lines, severance benefits and the nonrecurring costs
associated with the cellularization and reengineering of manufacturing
processes and methods.  Depending on future demand and prices of aerospace
fasteners, the Company may take further restructuring actions in the future
and may record additional restructuring charges for the cost of these
activities.

     The Company recorded restructuring charges of $15,469,000 and $2,500,000
in Fiscal 1993 and 1992, respectively, relating to the downsizing of fastener
operations in Europe and California, and severance and early retirement
benefits for terminated employees.

17.  UNUSUAL ITEMS
     -------------

     On January 17, 1994, the Company's Chatsworth, California Aerospace
Fasteners manufacturing facility suffered extensive damage from the Southern
California earthquake.  As a result, the Company relocated the Chatsworth
manufacturing operations to its other Southern California facilities.  This
disruption has caused increased costs and reduced revenues in the Fiscal 1994
third and fourth quarters.  While the Company carries insurance for both
business interruption and property damage caused by earthquakes, the policy
has a 5% deductible.  The Company has recorded an unusual pretax loss of
$4,000,000 in Fiscal 1994 in the Aerospace Fasteners segment to cover the
estimated net cost of the damages and related business interruption caused by
the earthquake.  An insurance claim of $5,900,000 has been recorded for
recoverability of costs related to business interruption and property damage. 
In addition, the Company recorded a write down of $2,000,000 relating to this
real estate which is now included in net assets held for sale.

18.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
     --------------------------

     Corporate office administrative expense recorded by FII was billed to
the Company on a monthly basis during 1994, 1993 and 1992.  These costs
represent the cost of services incurred on behalf of affiliated companies. 
Each of these affiliated companies has reimbursed FII for such services.

     The Company and its subsidiaries are all parties to a tax sharing
agreement whereby the Company files a consolidated federal income tax return
and the subsidiaries make payments to the Company based on the amount of
federal income taxes, if any, the subsidiary would have paid if it had filed
a separate tax return.

     The Aerospace Fasteners segment had sales to Banner Aerospace, Inc. a
47.2% affiliate of RHI, of $5,680,000, $8,750,000 and $10,941,000 in 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively.

19.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     Rental expense on operating leases for the years ended June 30, 1994,
1993, and 1992 was $7,193,000, $9,575,000 and $10,410,000, respectively.

     In connection with the sale of Metro Credit Corporation, the Company
remained contingently liable as a guarantor of the payment and performance of
obligations of third party lessees under aircraft leases, which call for
aggregate annual base lease payments of approximately $3,454,000 in 1995, and
approximately $11,397,000 over the remaining 5-year guaranty period.  In each
case, the Company has been indemnified by the purchasers and lessors from any
losses related to such guaranties.

CL Motor Freight Litigation
- ---------------------------

     The Workers Compensation Bureau of the State of Ohio is seeking
reimbursement from the Company for approximately $5,400,000 for CL workers
compensation claims which were insured under a self-insured workers
compensation program of CL.  The Company has contested a significant portion
of this claim.

Government Claims
- -----------------

     In 1989, the Company learned through its own quality assurance
procedures, and voluntarily disclosed to its customers and the Department of
Defense, that certain units of VSI had not performed certain production lot
tests mentioned in the military specifications for some limited product
lines.  The Company does not believe that VSI's level of testing resulted in
shipment of unsafe products or that purchasers were otherwise damaged, and
the government subsequently reduced certain test requirements.  In May 1994,
VSI settled this matter with the government by payment of $330,000.

     Following an investigation by the Inspector General of NASA, the civil
division of the United States Department of Justice alleged improprieties in
years 1982 and 1984 through 1986, in indirect costs rates and labor charging
practices of a former subsidiary of the Company.  The Company entered into
settlement discussions with the Department of Justice to attempt to resolve
these claims and has reached an agreement in principle with the government to
settle this matter for $5,000,000, payable in six equal semi-annual
installments, with interest at 6% per year.  The unpaid balance will likely
be collateralized by certain excess real estate.  If the settlement is not
consummated, the government may initiate suit under the False Claims Act,
seeking treble damages and penalties, and under the Truth in Negotiation Act,
seeking a price reduction on certain contracts and subcontracts.

     The Corporate Administrative Contracting Officer (the "ACO"), based upon
the advice of the United States Defense Contract Audit Agency, has made a
determination that FII did not comply with Cost Accounting Standards in
accounting for (i) the 1985 reversion to FII of certain assets of terminated
defined benefit pension plans, and (ii) pension costs upon the closing of
segments of FII's business.  The ACO has directed FII to prepare a cost
impact proposal relating to such plan terminations and segment closings and,
following receipt of such cost impact proposals, may seek adjustments to
contract prices.  The ACO alleges that substantial amounts will be due if
such adjustments are made.  The Company believes it has properly accounted
for the asset reversions in accordance with applicable accounting standards. 
The Company has entered into discussions with the government to attempt to
resolve these pension accounting issues.

Civil Litigation
- ----------------

     Maurice Bidermann Litigation
     ----------------------------

     The Company commenced an action in the United States District for the
Southern District of New York, following the breach by Maurice Bidermann
("Bidermann") of an agreement under which Bidermann was to have paid the
Company an aggregate sum of approximately $22,500,000, of which Bidermann
paid $10,000,000.  Additional installments, of $5,000,000 each, were due from
Bidermann on December 31, 1992, and June 30, 1993, both of which Bidermann
failed to pay.  On July 7, 1993, the United States District Court ordered
Bidermann to pay the Company the full amount of its claim, $12,947,000, plus
interest.  Following receipt of the Court's order, Bidermann filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; however,
subsequent to the 1994 fiscal year end, on motion of the Company, the
Bankruptcy Court dismissed Bidermann's Chapter 11 proceedings.  Prior to
Bidermann's filing for protection under Chapter 11, and continuing subsequent
to the Bankruptcy Court's dismissal of the proceedings, the Company attached
substantially all assets of Bidermann.  In addition, the Company holds shares
and warrants of Bidermann Industries, USA, Inc., all of which shares and
warrants Bidermann had originally agreed to purchase from the Company for
$22,500,000.  The collectibility of this judgement, which has been affirmed
by the United States Court of Appeals, will depend in part upon the Company's
ability to realize sufficient amounts from its attachments, and the value of
the shares and warrants held.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------

     The Company and other aerospace fastener and industrial product
manufacturers are subject to stringent Federal, state and local environmental
laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of
materials into the environment and the generation, handling, storage,
transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials.  To date, such
laws and regulations have not had a material effect on the financial
condition of the Company, although the Company has expended, and can be
expected to expend in the future, significant amounts for investigation of
environmental conditions and installation of environmental control
facilities, remediation of environmental conditions and other similar
matters, particularly in the Aerospace Fasteners segment.

     In connection with its plans to dispose of certain real estate, the
Company must investigate environmental conditions and may be required to take
certain corrective action prior or pursuant to any such disposition.  In
addition, management has identified several areas of potential contamination
at or from other facilities owned, or previously owned, by the Company, that
may require the Company either to take corrective action or to contribute to
a clean-up.  The Company is also a defendant in certain lawsuits and
proceedings seeking to require the Company to pay for investigation or
remediation of environmental matters and has been alleged to be a potentially
responsible party at various "Superfund" sites.  Management of the Company
believes that it has recorded adequate reserves in its financial statements
to complete such investigation and take any necessary corrective actions or
make any necessary contributions.  No amounts have been recorded as due from
third parties, including insurers, or set off against, any liability of the
Company, unless such parties are contractually obligated to contribute and
are not disputing such liability.

Other Matters
- -------------

     The Company is involved in various other claims and lawsuits incidental
to its business, some of which involve substantial amounts.  The Company,
either on its own or through its insurance carriers, is contesting these
matters.

     In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of the legal
proceedings, including those discussed above, will not have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition or the future operating results of
the Company.

20.  BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

     Earnings (loss) from continuing operations includes charges to reflect
the cost of restructuring the Company's Aerospace Fasteners Segment, of
$9,903,000 and $8,957,000 in the second and fourth quarters of Fiscal 1994,
respectively, and $1,500,000, $932,000 and $13,037,000 in the second, third
and fourth quarters of Fiscal 1993, respectively.  The Company recorded an
unusual loss in the third and fourth quarter of Fiscal 1994 of $3,200,000 and
$3,493,000, respectively, to cover the estimated net cost of the damages and
related business interruption caused by an earthquake and the write down of
real estate and other assets.

     The second quarter of Fiscal 1994 includes non-recurring income of
$129,094,000, net pre-tax, from the gain on the sale of the Company's 43.9%
stock interest in Rexnord.

     Extraordinary items includes an extraordinary charge of $11,804,000, net
of tax, in the first quarter of Fiscal 1993 relating to the Company's share
of Rexnord's extraordinary charge associated with the Rexnord
Recapitalization.  Other extraordinary items relate to the early
extinguishment of debt by the Company.

     The Fiscal 1994 first and second quarter data presented vary from the
amounts previously reported in Form 10-Q due to the Company's decision not to
sell a division which was included in net assets held for sale, and not
included in the results of operations.  Sales from the division were
$4,141,000 and $3,438,000 in the first and second quarters, respectively, of
Fiscal 1994.   Earnings from the division had no material effect during these
periods.

To The Fairchild Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Fairchild
Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and
1993, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992. 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of The Fairchild Corporation
and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years ended June 30, 1994, 1993 and
1992, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
effective July 1, 1993, the Company changed its methods of accounting for
postretirement benefits other than pensions, and income taxes.

                  Dated as of December 23, 1993
                               to
              RESTATED AND AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT
                    Dated as of July 27, 1992


          This Consent and Amendment No. 3 ("Amendment No. 3")
dated as of December 23, 1993, is entered into among RHI
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("RHI"), the "Senior
Lenders" (as defined in the Credit Agreement referred to below)
of RHI, Citicorp North America, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Citicorp") and The Bank of Nova Scotia, a Canadian chartered
bank ("Scotiabank") as agents for the Senior Lenders (Citicorp
and Scotiabank being sometimes hereinafter collectively referred
to as the "Agents"), and Citicorp, as administrative agent for
the Senior Lenders (the "Administrative Agent").

          PRELIMINARY STATEMENT. VSI Corporation, a Delaware
corporation, Fairchild Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
RHI, the Senior Lenders, the Agents, and the Administrative Agent
are parties to that certain Restated and Amended Credit Agreement
dated as of July 27, 1992, as amended, (the "Credit Agreement"). 
Capitalized terms used herein without definition are used herein
as defined in the Credit Agreement.  RHI has entered into a
certain Purchase Agreement dated as of December 2, 1993 with The
Fairchild Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("TFC") and BTR
Dunlop Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("BTR Dunlop")
(such Purchase Agreement being herein referred to as the
"Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, RHI
has agreed to sell all of the capital stock of Rexnord
Corporation owned by RHI (the "Rexnord Shares") to BTR Dunlop and
to indemnify BTR Dunlop and Rexnord Corporation with respect to
certain environmental liabilities.

          In connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement, TFC, RHI and Rexnord Corporation have entered
into a certain Tax Agreement dated as of December 2, 1993 with
BTR Dunlop (the "Tax Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other
things, (a) the Amendment to and Restatement of Tax Agreement
dated May 15, 1992, as amended on August 5, 1993, will be
terminated in its entirety and the Tax Agreement will supersede
the same in its entirety as of the time described therein and (b)
TFC and RHI will become obligated under certain indemnities
specified in the Tax Agreement with respect to certain tax
obligations of Rexnord Corporation.

          In connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement, TFC and RHI entered into an Escrow Agreement
dated as of December 2, 1993 with BTR Dunlop and Cahill Gordon &
Reindel, as "Escrow Agent", (the "Escrow Agreement") pursuant to
which, among other things, TFC and RHI are required (a) to
deposit, on the date the transactions described in the Purchase
Agreement close, into the escrow established pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement, for the benefit of BTR Dunlop, shares of common
stock of Aerospace having a market price of $25,000,000, as
calculated pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, as of the date of
such deposit and (b) to make or receive supplemental deposits or
withdrawals thereafter of cash and/or common stock of Aerospace
into such escrow under certain circumstances, such deposits to be
held by the Escrow Agent until the obligations of TFC and RHI
expire with respect to the indemnities for federal and state
taxes described in the Tax Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
In connection with the establishment of such escrow arrangement,
RHI has requested that its Requisite Senior Lenders consent to
the release of certain of the stock of Aerospace pledged to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to the Special Increase II Pledge
Agreement in an amount sufficient to fund the escrow arrangement
on the date upon which the transactions described in the Purchase
Agreement are consummated.

         It is contemplated that the transactions described in
the Purchase Agreement with respect to the sale of the Rexnord
Shares by RHI to BTR Dunlop will occur on the second Business Day
following the date on which all applicable waiting periods under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, and under the law relating to filings with the German
Federal Cartel office referenced in the Purchase Agreement, shall
expire or be terminated.

          It is further contemplated that the proceeds of the
sale of the Rexnord Shares by RHI to BTR Dunlop under the
Purchase Agreement will be used as follows:


     (i)  a portion thereof to repurchase or derease certain of
     RHI's Subordinated Indebtedness (the "Subordinated Debt
     Repayment");

     (ii) a portion thereof to make dividends, distributions or
     other advances to TFC to the extent permitted under the
     terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement;

     (iii) approximately $5,000,000 thereof to repay the
     Rexnord/Holdings Mortgage Indebtedness; and

     (iv)  a portion thereof to repay the obligations of RHI
     under Facility A in an amount sufficient to permanently
     reduce the Facility Outstandings under Facility A to an
     amount less than or equal to the "Facility Commitments" with
     respect to "Facility A" (as each such term is hereinafter
     defined in Section 1 of this Amendment No. 3).

          Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, RHI
and its Senior Lenders have agreed to further amend the Credit
Agreement as hereinafter set forth and to consent to the
transactions described in Section 2 hereof.


          SECTION 1.  Amendments to the Credit Agreement.

          Effective as of the later to occur of (i) the
effectiveness of Amendment No. 3 pursuant to Section 3 hereof and
(ii) the Rexnord Sale Effective Date, and subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3
below, the Credit Agreement is hereby amended as follows:

          of the price at which the last trade of Aerospace
          common stock occurred on the immediately preceding
          Business Day on the New York Stock Exchange, which
          shall be the close quotation for such Business Day as
          reported by The Wall Street Journal (or in the event
          publication of The Wall Street Journal is permanently
          or temporarily suspended, such other national domestic
          daily business journal as may be designated by the
          Administrative Agent) for the date of determination, or
          if there is no such close quotation, the average 
          between the high and low quotations for such Business
          Day, or if there are no such quotations for such
          Business Day, the close quotation for the immediately
          preceding Business Day, multiplied by the number of
          Aerospace shares pledged as security under the Special
          Increase II Pledge Agreement (the "Pledged Share
          Value") minus (B) the sum of the amount equal to sixty
          percent (60%) of the Pledged Share Value and $500,000;
          and

               (ii)  the maximum amount permitted to be loaned
          against the Aerospace shares pledged as security under
          the Special Increase II Pledge Agreement under
          Regulations G and U."

          "'Rexnord Sale Effective Date' shall mean the date upon
          which the sale of all of the Rexnord Shares owned by
          RHI to BTR Dunlop Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
          corporation (('BTR Dunlop') is consummated pursuant to
          that certain Purchase Agreement dated as of December 2,
          1993 by and among RHI, TFC and BTR Dunlop."

               "'Rexnord Shares' shall mean all of the issued and
          outstanding shares of Rexnord Corporation owned by
          RHI."

          1.2  For purposes of determining the Facility A
Commitment of each of the Facility A Lenders and the Facility A
Commitments, the definitions of "Facility Commitment" and

     the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which such Facility G
     Senior Lender became a Facility G Senior Lender hereunder in
     accordance with the provisions of Section 16.02, as such

     permanently) from time to time pursuant to the terms of this
     Agreement, including any reduction resulting from the
     assignment of all or a portion of such Facility G Senior
     Lender's Facility G Commitment in accordance with Section
     16.02 and (ii) with respect to Facility A and each Facility
     A Lender, the  amount set forth below such Facility A Senior

     Agreement, including any reduction resulting from the
     assignment of all or a portion of such Facility A Senior

     Re:  Amendment and Waiver for VSI Corporation ("VSI")

Dear Colin,

     Pursuant to the Restated and Amended Credit Agreement dated
as of July 27, 1992, as amended, we request the following
covenant changes for VSI:

     (i)   EBITDA covenant for the quarter ending June 30, 1994
           and each of the remaining quarters to be reduced by
           $5.0 million.

     (ii)  Earthquake related losses (insurance deductible and
           non-reimbursable expenses) up to $4.0 million in
           aggregate to be excluded from EBITDA (whether cash or
           non-cash) for covenant calculation purposes for the
           1994 Third Fiscal Quarter requirement and each of the
           next three quarters; and the same amount to also be
           excluded from the net worth covenant calculation.

     (iii) Fairchild Data Corporation, a direct subsidiary of
           Fairchild Industries, Inc. ("FII"), is to be
           contributed to VSI and consolidated from July 1,
           1993 for covenant purposes.  It has been included as
           a discontinued operation at FII but will now be
           classified as continuing.  Either the transfer of
           Fairchild Data Corporation will be credited to paid-
           in capital or common stock of VSI will be issued and
           transferred to the Collateral Trustee as security for
           the FII 12-1/4% Senior Secured Notes.  The January 30,
           1994 financial statements for Fairchild Data
           Corporation are enclosed for your information.

     Given the historically volatile earnings of the Aerospace
Fastener Division, we are requesting the $5.0 million adjustment
through the remaining Credit Agreement term.  The detailed
projections for fiscal years 1994-1997 will be furnished next
week.  They show that the EBITDA covenant will be met comfortably
in fiscal years 1996-1997; however, we believe our request is
still reasonble because, despite all current evidence of
improving AFD earnings, they have been volatile.  In our opinion,
this is a conservative approach.

     We agree to pay the approving banks a 1/4% upon the
remaining revolver commitment and term loan outstandings
applicable to each bank when the amendment is approved by the
Requisite Senior Lenders.

     We request that the waiver be effective on or before April
1, 1994 for the third fiscal quarter of 1994.

     Please call me regarding any questions.

Sincerely,




KLS/ss
Enclosure
