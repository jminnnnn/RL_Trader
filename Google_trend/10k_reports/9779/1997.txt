ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
- -----------------

(a)  General Development of Business

     The Fairchild Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated in October
1969, under the laws of the State of Delaware.  The Company changed its name
from Banner Industries, Inc. to The Fairchild Corporation on November 15,
1990.  The Company is a holding company which owns all of the issued and
outstanding stock of RHI Holdings, Inc. ("RHI"), and through RHI all of the
issued and outstanding stock of Fairchild Holding Corporation  ("FHC").
Through RHI, the Company is the majority stockholder of Banner Aerospace,
Inc. ("Banner").

     The Company's principal operations are primarily conducted in three
distinct business units: Aerospace Fasteners, Aerospace Distribution, and
Technology Products.  The Aerospace Fasteners unit designs, manufactures and
markets high performance, specialty fastening systems, primarily for
aerospace applications.  The Aerospace Distribution unit is a leading
international distributor which provides a wide range of aircraft parts and
related support services. The Technology Products unit designs, manufactures,
and markets high performance production equipment and systems required for
the manufacture of semiconductor chips, compact discs, and flat panel
displays. For a comparison of the sales of each of the Company's business
segments for each of the last three fiscal years, see Item 7, "Management's

from "Recent Developments and Significant Business Combinations" included in
Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition".

(b)  Financial Information about Business Segments

     The Company's business segment information is incorporated herein by
reference from Note 21 of the Company's consolidated financial statements
included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data".

(c)  Narrative Description of Business Segments

Aerospace Fasteners
- -------------------

     The Company, through its Aerospace Fasteners segment, is a leading
worldwide manufacturer and supplier of fastening systems used in the
construction and maintenance of commercial and military aircraft.  The
Aerospace Fasteners segment accounted for 36.4% of total Company sales for
the year ended June 30, 1997.

     Products
     --------

     In general, aerospace fasteners produced by the Company are used to join
materials in applications that are not of themselves critical to flight.
Products range from standard aerospace screws, to more complex systems that
fasten airframe structures, and sophisticated latching or quick disconnect
mechanisms that allow efficient access to internal parts which require
regular servicing or monitoring.  The Aerospace Fasteners segment also
manufactures and supplies fastening systems used in non-aerospace industrial
and electronic niche applications.  The Aerospace Fasteners segment produces
and sells products under various trade names and trademarks including Voi-
Shan7 (fasteners for aerospace structures), Screwcorp7 (standard externally
threaded products for aerospace applications), RAM7 (custom designed
mechanisms for aerospace applications), Camloc7 (components for the
industrial, electronic, automotive and aerospace markets), and Tridair7 and
Rosan7 (fastening systems for highly-engineered aerospace, military and
industrial applications).

     Principal product lines of the Aerospace Fasteners segment include:

     Standard Aerospace Airframe Fasteners - These fasteners consist of
standard externally threaded fasteners used in non-critical airframe
applications on a wide variety of aircraft.  These fasteners include Hi-
Torque Speed Drive7, Tri-Wing7, Torq-Set7, Phillips7 and Hex Heads7.

     Commercial Aerospace Structural and Engine Fasteners - These fasteners
consist of more highly engineered, permanent or semi-permanent fasteners used
in non-critical but more sophisticated airframe and engine applications,
which could involve joining more than two materials.  These fasteners are
generally engineered to specific customer requirements or manufactured to
specific customer specifications for special applications, often involving
exacting standards.  These fasteners include Hi-Lok7, Veri-Lite7, Eddie-
Bolt72 and customer proprietary engine nuts.

     Proprietary Products and Fastening Systems - These very highly
engineered, proprietary fasteners are designed by the Company for specific
customer applications and include high performance structural latches and
hold down mechanisms.  These fasteners are usually proprietary in nature and
are used primarily in either commercial aerospace or military applications.
These fasteners include Visu-Lok7, Composi-Lok7, Keen-serts7, Mark IVJ,
FlatbeamJ and RinglockJ.

     Highly Engineered Fastening Systems for Industrial Applications - These
highly engineered fasteners are designed by the Company for specific niche
applications in the electronic, automotive and durable goods markets and are
sold under the Camloc7 trade name.

     Sales and Markets
     -----------------

     The products of the Aerospace Fasteners segment are sold primarily to
domestic and foreign original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), and to the
maintenance and repair market through distributors.  Sixty-six percent of its
sales are domestic.  Major customers include original equipment manufacturers
("OEMs") such as Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus, and their
subcontractors, as well as major distributors such as Burbank Aircraft
Supply, Special-T and Wesco.  Recently, OEMs have significantly increased
their production levels.  In addition, OEMs have implemented programs to
reduce inventories and pursue just-in-time relationships.  This has allowed
parts distributors to significantly expand their business due to their
ability to better meet OEM objectives.  In response, the Company, which
formerly supplied the OEMs directly, is expanding efforts to provide parts
through distributors, by establishing master distributorship agreements, with
Special-T, Wesco and others.  No single customer accounts for more than 10%
of the Company's consolidated sales.

     Products are marketed by a direct sales force team, which coordinates
efforts with an internal technical sales force team.  The direct sales force
team is organized by customer and region. The internal sales force is
organized by facility and product range and is focused on servicing customers
needs, identifying new product applications, and obtaining the approval of
new products.  All the Company's products are marketed through centralized
advertising and promotional activities.

     Revenues in the Aerospace Fasteners segment bear a strong relationship
to aircraft production.  As OEMs searched for cost cutting opportunities
during the aerospace industry recession, parts manufacturers, including the
Company, accepted lower-priced and/or smaller orders to maintain market
share, at lower profit margins.  However, during the last two years, this
situation has improved as build rates in the aerospace industry have
increased and resulted in capacity constraints.  As lead times have
increased, the Company has been able to negotiate contracts with its major
customers at more favorable pricing as well as larger minimum lot sizes that
are more economic to manufacture. In addition, the Company has eliminated
"make and hold" contracts under which large volume buyers would require
current production of parts for long-term unspecified dates of delivery.
Overall, existing backlog is anticipated to result in higher margins due to
larger and more efficient lot sizes.

     Fasteners also have applications in the automotive/industrial markets,
where numerous special fasteners are required (such as engine bolts, wheel
bolts and turbo charger tension bolts).  The Company is actively targeting
the automotive market as a hedge against any potential downturn in the
aerospace industry.

     Manufacturing and Production
     ----------------------------

    The Aerospace Fasteners segment has seven primary manufacturing
facilities, of which three are located in the United States and four are
located in Europe.  Each facility has virtually complete production
capability, and subcontracts only those orders which exceed capacity.  Each
plant is designed to produce a specified product or group of products,
determined by production process involved and certification requirements. The
Company's largest customers have recognized its quality and operational
controls by conferring D1-9000A status at all of its U.S. facilities, and D1-
9000 status at all of its European facilities. All of its facilities are
"preferred suppliers" and have received all SPC and NADCAP approvals from
OEMs.  The Company is the first and only aerospace fastener manufacturing
company with all facilities holding ISO-9000 approval.

     The Company has a fully operational modern information system at all of
its U.S. facilities and will expand this information system to all its
European operations in Fiscal 1998.  The new system performs detailed and
timely cost analysis of production by product and facility. Updated MIS
systems also help the Company to better service its customers. OEMs require
each product to be produced in a OEM-qualified/OEM-approved facility.

     Competition
     -----------

     Despite intense competition in the industry, the Company remains the
dominant manufacturer of aerospace fasteners.  The worldwide aerospace
fastener market is estimated to be $1.3 billion (before distributor resales). 
The Company holds approximately 20% of the market and competes with SPS
Technologies, Hi-Shear, and Huck, which the company believes hold
approximately 13%, 11% and 10% of the market, respectively.  In Europe, its
largest competitors are Blanc Aero and Southco Fasteners.

     The Company competes primarily in the highly-engineered "systems"
segment where its broad product range allow it to more fully serve each OEM
and distributor.  The Company's product array is diverse and offers customers
a large selection to address various production needs. In addition, roughly
45% of the Company's output is unique or is in a market where the Company has
a small number of competitors.  The Company seeks to maintain its
technological edge and competitive advantage over its competitors, and has
historically demonstrated its innovative production methods and new products
to meet customer demands at fair price levels.

Aerospace Distribution
- ----------------------

     The Company increased its ownership of Banner to a majority interest
level in February 1996.  The Company, through Banner (its Aerospace
Distribution segment), distributes a wide variety of aircraft parts, which it
carries in inventory.  In addition to selling products that it has purchased
on the open market, Banner also acts as a non-exclusive, authorized
distributor of many different aerospace related product lines. No single
distributor arrangement is material to the Company's financial condition.
Through Banner, the Aerospace Distribution segment accounted for 55.8% of
total Company sales in Fiscal 1997.

     Products
     --------

     Banner believes it is the world's largest independent stocking
distributor of aircraft hardware, including bearings, nuts, bolts, screws,
rivets and other types of fasteners that are used on aircraft. Banner
purchases its inventory of hardware principally from manufacturers.  An
extensive inventory of products and a quick response time are essential in
providing service to its customers.  Another key factor in selling to its
customers is Banner's ability to maintain a system that provides traceable
parts back to the manufacturer.

     Products of the Aerospace Distribution segment are divided into three
groups: hardware, rotables and engines.  Hardware includes bearings, nuts,
bolts, screws, rivets and other types of fasteners.  Rotables include flight
data recorders, radar and navigation systems, instruments, landing gear and
hydraulic and electrical components.  Engines include jet engines and engine
parts for use on both narrow and wide body aircraft and smaller engines for
corporate and commuter aircraft.  Banner provides a number of services such
as immediate shipment of parts in aircraft-on-ground situations. The
Aerospace Distribution segment also provides products to OEMs in the
aerospace industry under just-in-time and inventory management programs. 
Banner also buys and sells commercial aircraft from time to time. 

     Hardware is purchased new from manufacturers, but may also be purchased
from other distributors.  Hardware is sold only in new condition.  Rotable
parts are sometimes purchased as new parts, but are generally purchased as
used parts which are then overhauled for the Company by outside contractors,
including the original manufacturers and FAA-licensed facilities.  Rotables
are sold in a variety of conditions such as new, overhauled, serviceable and
"as is".  Rotables may also be exchanged instead of sold.  An exchange occurs
when an overhauled aircraft part in inventory is exchanged for a used part
from the customer and the customer is charged an exchange fee plus the actual
cost to overhaul the part.  Engines and engine components are sold "as is",
overhauled or disassembled for resale as parts.

     Sales and Markets
     -----------------

     Subsidiaries of the Aerospace Distributions segment sell their products
in the United States and abroad to most of the world's commercial airlines
and to air cargo carriers, as well as many OEMs, other distributors, fixed-
base operators, corporate aircraft operators and other aerospace and non-
aerospace companies.  Approximately 70.7% of its sales are to domestic
purchasers, some of whom may represent offshore users.

     The Aerospace Distributions segment markets its products and services
through direct sales forces, outside representatives and, for some product
lines, overseas sales offices.  Sales in the aviation aftermarket depend on
price, service, quality and reputation.  The Aerospace Distribution segment's
business does not experience significant seasonal fluctuations nor depend on
a single customer.  No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the
Company's consolidated revenue.

     Competition
     -----------

     The hardware product group competes with OEMs such as Boeing, which
supports the fleet of Boeing-produced aircraft; fastener manufacturers, as
well as independent distributors such as Wesco Aircraft Hardware Corp., M&M
Aerospace Hardware, Tri-Star Aerospace, Inc. and many other large and small
companies.  Banner believes it generally has a price advantage over
manufacturers in the smaller quantities that it usually deals, and can
generally provide more expeditious service.  In the rotable group, the major
competitors are AAR Corp., Air Ground Equipment Services ("AGES"), Aviation
Sales Company, The Memphis Group and other large and small companies in a
very fragmented industry.  The major competitors for Banner's engine group
are OEMs such as General Electric Company and Pratt and Whitney, as well as
the engine parts division of AAR Corp., AGES, and many smaller companies.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
         FINANCIAL CONDITION
         -------------------

     The Fairchild Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated in October
1969, under the laws of the State of Delaware.  On November 15, 1990, the
Company changed its name from Banner Industries, Inc. to The Fairchild
Corpration.  RHI Holdings, Inc. ("RHI") is a direct subsidiary of the
Company.  RHI is the owner of 100% of Fairchild Holding Corp. ("FHC") and the
majority owner of Banner Aerospace, Inc. ("Banner").  The Company's principal
operations are conducted through RHI and FHC.  The Company also holds
significant equity interests in Shared Technologies Fairchild Inc. ("STFI")
and Nacanco Paketleme ("Nacanco").

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT

     Certain statements in the financial discussion and analysis by
management contain forward-looking information that involves risk and
uncertainty, including current trend information, projections for deliveries,
backlog, and other trend projections.  Actual future results may differ
materially depending on a variety of factors, including product demand;
performance issues with key suppliers; customer satisfaction and
qualification issues; labor disputes; governmental export and import
policies; worldwide political stability and economic growth; and legal
proceedings.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

     In January 1997, Banner, through its subsidiary, Dallas Aerospace, Inc.,
acquired PB Herndon Company ("PB Herndon") in a business combination
accounted for as a purchase.  PB Herndon is a distributor of specialty
fastener lines and similar aerospace related components.  The total cost of
the acquisition was $16.0 million, which exceeded the fair value of the net
assets of PB Herndon by approximately $3.5 million.  The excess is being
amortized using the straight-line method over 40 years.

     In February 1997, the Company completed a transaction (the "Simmonds
Acquisition") pursuant to which the Company acquired common shares and
convertible debt representing an 84.2% interest, on a fully diluted basis, of
Simmonds S.A. ("Simmonds").  The Company initiated a tender offer to purchase
the remaining shares and convertible debt held by the public.  By Fiscal
year-end, the Company had purchased, or placed sufficient cash in escrow to
purchase, all the remaining shares and convertible debt of Simmonds.  The
total purchase price of Simmonds, including the assumption of debt, was
approximately $62.0 million, which the Company funded with available cash. 
The Company recorded approximately $13.0 million in goodwill as a result of
this acquisition.  Simmonds is one of Europe's leading manufacturers and
distributors of aerospace and automotive fasteners.

     On June 30, 1997, the Company sold all the patents of Fairchild
Scandinavian Bellyloading Company ("SBC") to Teleflex Incorporated
("Teleflex") for $5.0 million, and immediately thereafter sold all the stock
of SBC to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Teleflex for $2.0 million.  The
Company may also receive an additional amount of up to $7.0 million based on
future net sales of the patented products and services. In Fiscal 1997, the
Company recorded a $2.5 million nonrecurring gain as a result of these
transactions.

     The Company, RHI and Fairchild Industries, Inc. ("FII"), the Company's
former subsidiary, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
November 9, 1995 (as amended, the "Merger Agreement") with Shared
Technologies Inc. ("STI").  On March 13, 1996, in accordance with the Merger
Agreement, STI succeeded to the telecommunications systems and services
business operated by the Company's Fairchild Communications Services Company
("FCSC"). The transaction was effected by a Merger of FII with and into STI
(the "Merger") with the surviving company renamed STFI. Prior to the Merger,
FII transferred all of its assets to, and all of its liabilities were assumed
by FHC, except for the assets and liabilities of FCSC, and $223.5 million of
FII's existing debt and preferred stock. As a result of the Merger, the
Company received shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock of STFI,
representing approximately a 41% ownership interest in STFI.

     On February 22, 1996, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated
January 26, 1996, the Company, through its subsidiaries, completed the sale
of certain assets, liabilities and the business of the D-M-E Company ("DME")
to Cincinnati Milacron Inc. ("CMI"), for a sales price of approximately
$244.3 million, as adjusted.  The sales price consisted of $74.0 million in
cash, and two 8% promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $170.3
million (together, the "8% CMI Notes").  On July 29, 1996, CMI paid in full
the 8% CMI Notes.

     On January 27, 1996, FII completed the sale of Fairchild Data
Corporation ("Data") to SSE Telecom, Inc. ("SSE") for book value of
approximately $4.4 million and 100,000 shares of SSE's common stock valued at
$9.06 per share, or $.9 million, at January 26, 1996, and warrants to
purchase an additional 50,000 shares of SSE's common stock at $11.09 per
share.

     Accordingly, DME and Data have been accounted for as discontinued
operations. The combined net sales of DME and Data totaled $108.1 million
(through January 26, 1996) and $180.8 million for Fiscal 1995. Net earnings
from discontinued operations were $9.2 million (through January 26, 1996) and
$14.0 million for Fiscal 1995.
 
     Effective February 25, 1996, the Company completed the transfer of Harco
to Banner in exchange for 5,386,477 shares of Banner common stock. The
exchange has increased the Company's ownership of Banner common stock from
approximately 47.2% to 59.3%, resulting in the Company becoming the majority
shareholder of Banner. Accordingly, the Company has consolidated the results
of Banner since February 25, 1996.  In June 1997, the Company purchased $28.0
million of newly issued Series A Convertible Paid-in-Kind Preferred Stock of
Banner.  The Company now controls 64.0% of Banner's voting stock. Banner is
a leading international supplier to the aerospace industry as a distributor,
providing a wide range of aircraft parts and related support services.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The Company currently reports in two principal business segments:
Aerospace Fasteners and Aerospace Distribution.  The Company consolidated pre
March 13, 1996 operating results from the Communications Services segment
and, effective February 25, 1996, began to consolidate the operating results
of the Aerospace Distribution segment.  The results of Fairchild Technologies
("FT"), together with the results of Gas Springs and SBC are included in
Corporate and Other. The following table illustrates the historical sales
and operating income of the Company's operations for the past three years.

Consolidated Results
- --------------------

     Net sales of $738.5 million in Fiscal 1997 improved significantly by $237.7
million, or 47.5%, compared to sales of $500.8 million in Fiscal 1996. Sales
growth was stimulated by the resurgent commercial aerospace industry, together
with the effects of several strategic business combinations over the past 18
months.  Net sales in Fiscal 1996 were up 37.0% from Fiscal 1995 reflecting
strong sales performances from the Aerospace Fasteners segment and FT,
included in the Corporate and Other business segment, and the inclusion of
four months of sales from the Aerospace Distribution segment. On a pro forma
basis, net sales increased 23.6% and 23.9% in Fiscal 1997 and 1996,
respectively, as compared to the previous Fiscal periods.
 
     Gross Margin as a percentage of sales was 27.8%, 23.3%, and 18.0% in Fiscal
1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.  The increase in the current year was
attributable to higher revenues combined with continued productivity
improvements achieved during Fiscal 1997.  The increase in Fiscal 1996 compared
to Fiscal 1995 was due to consolidation of plants, elimination of product lines,
substantial downsizing and new productivity programs put in place.

     Selling, General & Administrative expense as a percentage of sales was
21.8%, 21.0%, and 20.5% in Fiscal 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.  The
increase in the current year was attributable primarily to the increase in
selling and marketing costs incurred to support the increase in sales.   The
decrease in Fiscal 1996 compared to Fiscal 1995 was due primarily to the
positive results obtained from restructuring and downsizing programs put in
place earlier.

     Operating income of $30.5 million in Fiscal 1997 increased $25.1 million,
or 461%, compared to operating income of $5.4 million in Fiscal 1996.  The
increase in operating income was due primarily to the current year's growth in
sales and increased operational efficiencies.  Operating income in Fiscal 1996
improved by $18.9 million over Fiscal 1995 due primarily to improved cost
efficiencies applied in the Aerospace Fasteners segment and the sales increase
from FT in the Corporate and Other business segment.  On a pro forma basis,
operating income increased $30.6 million in Fiscal 1997, as compared to Fiscal
1996, and $26.7 million in Fiscal 1996, as compared to Fiscal 1995.

     Net interest expense decreased 19.0% in Fiscal 1997 compared to Fiscal
1996, and decreased 12.8% in Fiscal 1996 compared to Fiscal 1995. The decreases
are due to lower borrowings as a result of the sale of DME and the Merger, both
of which significantly reduced the Company's total debt.

     Investment income, net, was $6.7 million, $4.6 million and $5.7 million in
Fiscal 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. The 45.4% increase in Fiscal 1997 is
due primarily to realized gains from the sale of investments in Fiscal 1997. The
19.8% decrease in Fiscal 1996 resulted from losses realized on the write-off of
two foreign investments.

     Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $2.9 million in Fiscal 1997,
compared to Fiscal 1996, and increased $3.3 million in Fiscal 1996, compared to
Fiscal 1995.  The current year's increase is attributable to the amortization
of undervalued investments in STFI as a result of the Merger. The prior year's
increase was due primarily to higher earnings from Nacanco, which improved the
Company's equity in earnings by $2.6 million.

     Nonrecurring income in Fiscal 1997 includes the $2.5 million gain from the
sale of SBC.  Nonrecurring income in Fiscal 1996 includes a $163.1 million
nontaxable gain resulting from the Merger.
 
     Income Taxes included a $5.2 million tax benefit in Fiscal 1997 on a pre-
tax loss of $3.9 million from continuing operations.  The tax benefit was due
primarily to reversing Federal income taxes previously provided due to a change
in the estimate of the required tax accruals.  In Fiscal 1996, the tax benefit
from the loss from continuing operations, excluding the nontaxable nonrecurring
gain, was $22.1 million.

     Earnings from discontinued operations, net, include the earnings, net of
tax, from DME and Data in Fiscal 1996 and 1995.

     The $53.6 million gain on disposal of discontinued operations resulted
primarily from the sale of DME to CMI in Fiscal 1996.

     Extraordinary items, net, resulted from premiums paid for, and redemption
costs and consent fees associated with, the retirement of the Senior Notes and
the write off of deferred loan fees, related primarily to Senior Notes and bank
debt extinguished prior to maturity.  This totaled $10.4 million, net of a tax
benefit, in Fiscal 1996.

     Net earnings in Fiscal 1997, compared to Fiscal 1996, after excluding the
nonrecurring merger gain of $163.1 million and the $53.6 million gain on sale
of discontinued operations in 1996, improved $28.3 million, reflecting a $25.1
million improvement in operating profit. The net earnings increased $223.5
million in Fiscal 1996, compared to Fiscal 1995, due primarily to the $163.1
million nonrecurring pre-tax gain recorded from the Merger, and the $53.6
million gain, net of tax, from the sale of discontinued operations.

Segment Results
- ---------------

Aerospace Fasteners Segment
- ---------------------------

     Sales in the Aerospace Fasteners segment increased by $51.0 million to
$269.0 million, up 23.4% in Fiscal 1997, compared to the Fiscal 1996 period,
reflecting significant growth in the commercial aerospace industry combined with
the Simmonds acquisition.  New orders have been strong in recent months
resulting in a backlog of $195.7 million at June 30, 1997, up from $109.9
million at June 30, 1996.  Sales increased slightly in Fiscal 1996 compared to
Fiscal 1995. The Harco division was transferred to the Aerospace Distribution
segment on February 25, 1996.  On a pro forma basis, excluding Harco's sales,
sales increased 36.5% in Fiscal 1997, compared to Fiscal 1996 and 3.6% in Fiscal
1996, compared to Fiscal 1995.

     Operating income improved from breakeven to $17.4 million during Fiscal
1997, compared to Fiscal 1996. This improvement was achieved as a result of
accelerated growth in the commercial aerospace industry, particularly in the
second half of the year. Certain efficiencies achieved during Fiscal 1997
continued to have positive effects on operating income. Operating income was
positive in the Aerospace Fasteners segment, which was an $11.6 million
improvement in the Fiscal 1996 period over the corresponding Fiscal 1995 period.
During Fiscal 1996, operating losses decreased significantly in the Aerospace
Fasteners segment, due primarily to the cost of management changes,
consolidation of plants, eliminating unprofitable product lines, pricing
adjustments, substantial work force downsizing and new productivity, quality and
marketing programs. A restructuring charge of $2.3 million was recorded in
Fiscal 1996, primarily for severance pay to employees terminated as a result of
further downsizing. On a pro forma basis, excluding Harco, operating income
increased $20.0 million in Fiscal 1997, as compared to Fiscal 1996, and $13.1
million in Fiscal 1996, as compared to Fiscal 1995.

Aerospace Distribution Segment
- ------------------------------
     Aerospace Distribution sales were up $281.8 million and operating income
was up $25.3 million, primarily the result of reporting twelve months in Fiscal
1997 versus four months in Fiscal 1996. On a twelve-month pro forma basis sales
were up $69.3 million, or 20.2%, and operating income was up $13.4 million, or
77.0%. Sales increases in all three groups, hardware, rotables and engines
contributed to these strong results. This segment has benefited from the
extended service lives of existing aircraft, growth from acquisitions and
internal growth, which has increased market share.

     In Fiscal 1996, as a result of the transfer of Harco to Banner effective
February 25, 1996, the Company recorded four months of sales and operating
income of Banner, including Harco as part of the Aerospace Distribution
segment. This segment reported $130.0 million in sales and $5.6 million in 
operating income for this four-month period ended June 30, 1996. In Fiscal
1996, the first eight months of Harco's sales and operating income were
included in the Aerospace Fasteners segment.

Communications Services Segment
- -------------------------------

     As a result of the Merger of the Communications Services segment on March
13, 1996, the Company is accounting for its current investment in STFI, the
merged company, using the equity method.  Sales of $91.3 million were reported
for the Communications Services segment in Fiscal 1996 for 8 1/2 months,
compared to a full 12 months sales of $108.7 million in Fiscal 1995. Operating
income of $14.6 million was reported for the Communications Services segment in
Fiscal 1996 for the 8 1/2 months prior to the Merger, as compared to $18.5
million in Fiscal 1995.

Corporate and Other
- -------------------

     The Corporate and Other segment includes Fairchild Technologies, Camloc Gas
Springs Division and Fairchild Scandinavian Bellyloading Co. AB (SBC) (formerly
the Technology Products segment). Sales were up at SBC and stable at the other
operations.  The group reported an increase in sales of 8.2% in Fiscal 1997, as
compared to Fiscal 1996, and 62.3% in Fiscal 1996, as compared to Fiscal 1995.
Operating loss increased by $2.9 million in Fiscal 1997, compared to Fiscal
1996. Operating income increased $5.5 million in Fiscal 1996, as compared to
Fiscal 1995.  SBC was sold at Fiscal 1997 year-end. Over the past three years,
corporate administrative expense as a percentage of sales has decreased from
3.6% in 1995 to 2.9% in 1996 to 2.2% in 1997.
<PAGE>
FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Working capital at June 30, 1997, was $346.1 million, which was $6.7
million lower than at June 30, 1996.  The principal reasons for this change
included a $175.5 million decrease in cash, investments and notes receivable,
offset by a $71.6 million increase in inventory, a $69.5 million increase in
accounts receivable, a $14.4 million increase in prepaid and other current
assets, and a $13.3 million decrease in current liabilities.

     The Company's principal cash requirements include debt service, capital
expenditures, acquisitions, and payment of other liabilities. Other liabilities
that require the use of cash include post-employment benefits for retirees,
environmental investigation and remediation obligations, and litigation
settlements and related costs.  The Company expects that cash on hand, cash
generated from operations, and cash from borrowings and asset sales will be
adequate to satisfy cash requirements.

     The Company maintains credit agreements with a consortium of banks, which
provide revolving credit facilities to RHI, FHC and Banner, and term loans to
Banner. At June 30, 1997, $54 million was available to be borrowed from the
Company's credit agreements. As of June 30, 1997, the Company and Banner were
in compliance with all covenants under their respective credit agreements. The
Company's management intends to take appropriate action to refinance portions
of its debt, if necessary, to meet cash requirements. On July 18, 1997, the FHC
Credit Agreement was restructured to provide FHC with a $150 million senior
credit facility consisting of (i) up to $75 million in revolving loans, with a
letter of credit sub-facility of $12 million, and (ii) a $75 million term loan.
(See Note 10 in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).

     The Company also expects to generate cash from the sale of certain assets
and liquidation of investments.  At June 30, 1997, net assets held for sale had
a carrying value of $26.1 million and included two parcels of real estate in
California, two landfill limited partnership projects in Pennsylvania, a real
estate joint venture in California, and several other parcels elsewhere, which
the Company plans to sell, lease or develop, subject to market conditions or,
with respect to certain of the parcels, the resolution of environmental matters.
The Company has reclassified its Farmingdale property, with a book value of
$28.9 million, from net assets held for sale to other assets as the Company has
established and pursued a plan to develop this property as commercial real
estate.

     Property, plant and equipment increased $40.8 million from June 30, 1996,
primarily as a result of the Simmonds Acquisition.  Goodwill increased by $14.6
million as a result of the Company's acquisitions in the current Fiscal year.

     On July 16, 1997, STFI entered into a definitive merger agreement (the
"STFI/Tel-Save Merger") with Tel-Save Holdings, Inc. ("Tel-Save"), pursuant to
which Tel-Save will acquire STFI in a business combination accounted for as a
pooling of interests.  Upon consummation of the STFI/Tel-Save Merger, the
Company will receive shares of Tel-Save's common stock, in exchange for its
shares of STFI common stock and STFI cumulative convertible preferred stock, as
well as approximately $22.0 million cash in redemption of its shares of STFI
special preferred stock.  As a result of the transaction, the Company will
recognize an estimated gain in excess of $100 million. (See Note 24 in Item 8,
"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data").

     Management believes it has successfully restructured and repositioned the
Company from a diversified industrial company to a focused Aerospace Industry
player. As worldwide airlines and aircraft manufacturers increase capacity to
meet demand, the Company plans to benefit through internal growth, external
growth, and improved productivity. This bodes well for additional improvement
of the Company's net income. 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
- -----------------------------------------

     In October 1996, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position 96-1 ("SOP 96-1") "Environmental Remediation
Liabilities". SOP 96-1 provides authoritative guidance on specific accounting
issues related to the recognition, measurement, and display and disclosure of
environmental remediation liabilities.  The Company is required to implement SOP
96-1 in Fiscal 1998.  The Company's present policy is similar to the policy
prescribed by SOP 96-1, therefore, there will be no effect from implementation.

     In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
two pronouncements, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 ("SFAS
128") "Earnings Per Share", and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
129 ("SFAS 129") "Disclosure of Information about Capital Structure".  SFAS 128
establishes accounting standards for computing and presenting earnings per share
("EPS").  SFAS 128 is effective for periods ending after December 15, 1997,
including interim periods, and requires restatement of all prior period EPS data
presented.  Results from the calculation of simple and diluted earnings per
share, as prescribed by SFAS 128, would not be materially different from the
calculations for primary and fully diluted earnings per share for years ending
June 30, 1997 and June 30, 1996.  SFAS 129 establishes standards for disclosure
of information about the Company's capital structure and becomes effective for
periods ending after December 15, 1997.

     In June 1997, FASB issued two pronouncements, Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130 ("SFAS 130") "Reporting Comprehensive Income",
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 ("SFAS 131")
"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information".  SFAS
130 establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income
and its components in the financial statements.  SFAS 131 supersedes
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 14 "Financial Reporting for
Segments of a Business Enterprise" and requires that a public company report
certain information about its operating segments in annual and interim
financial reports.  The Company will adopt SFAS 130 and SFAS 131 in Fiscal
1998.<PAGE>

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
     ------------------------------------------

     Corporate Structure:  The Fairchild Corporation (the "Company") was
incorporated in October 1969, under the laws of the State of Delaware.  RHI
Holdings, Inc. ("RHI") is a direct subsidiary of the Company.  RHI is the  owner
of 100% of Fairchild Holding Corp. ("FHC") and the majority owner of Banner
Aerospace, Inc., ("Banner").  The Company's principal operations are conducted
through FHC and Banner.  The Company also holds  significant equity interests
in Shared Technologies Fairchild Inc. ("STFI") and Nacanco Paketleme
("Nacanco").

     Fiscal Year:  The fiscal year ("Fiscal") of the Company ends June 30. All
references herein to "1997", "1996", and "1995" mean the fiscal years ended June
30, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

     Consolidation Policy: The accompanying consolidated financial statements
are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned and majority-
owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.  Investments in companies in which ownership
interest range from 20 to 50 percent are accounted for using the equity method
(see Note 9).  

     Cash Equivalents/Statements of Cash Flows:  For purposes of the Statements
of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturity dates of three months or less as cash equivalents. Total net cash
disbursements (receipts) made by the Company for income taxes and interest were
as follows:
<TABLE>

Interest.......................    $ 48,684   $ 66,843   $ 66,262
Income Taxes...................      (1,926)     9,279     (3,056)
</TABLE>

     Restricted Cash:  On June 30, 1997 and 1996, the Company had restricted
cash of $4,839 and $8,224, respectively, all of which is maintained as
collateral for certain debt facilities.  Cash investments are in short-term
certificates of deposit.

     Investments:  Management determines the appropriate classification of its
investments at the time of acquisition and reevaluates such determination at
each balance sheet date.  Trading securities are carried at fair value, with
unrealized holding gains and losses included in earnings.  Available-for-sale
securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses,
net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. 
Investments in equity securities and limited partnerships that do not have
readily determinable fair values are stated at cost and are categorized as other
investments. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific
identification method based on the trade date of a transaction.  Interest on
corporate obligations, as well as dividends on preferred stock, are accrued at
the balance sheet date.

     Inventories:  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost
is determined using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method at principal domestic
aerospace manufacturing operations and using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO")
method elsewhere.  If the FIFO inventory valuation method had been used
exclusively, inventories would have been approximately $4,868 and $4,756 higher
at June 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  Inventories from continuing operations
are valued as follows:

     Properties and Depreciation:  The cost of property, plant and equipment is
depreciated over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The cost of
leasehold improvements is depreciated over the lesser of the length of the
related leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and
using accelerated depreciation methods for Federal income tax purposes.  No
interest costs were capitalized in any of the years presented.  Property, plant
and equipment consisted of the following:

</TABLE>
     Amortization of Goodwill:  Goodwill, which represents the excess of the
cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their net assets at dates
of acquisition, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years.

     Deferred Loan Costs:  Deferred loan costs associated with various debt
issues are being amortized over the terms of the related debt, based on the
amount of outstanding debt, using the effective interest method.  Amortization
expense for these loan costs for 1997, 1996 and 1995 was $2,847, $3,827, and
$3,794, respectively.

     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: In Fiscal 1997, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 ("SFAS 121"), "Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of".  SFAS 121 establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long-lived
assets, certain identifiable intangibles, and goodwill related to those assets
to be held and used, and for long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles to be disposed of.  The Company reviews its long-lived assets,
including property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangibles and goodwill,
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  To determine
recoverability of its long-lived assets the Company evaluates the probability
that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount
of the assets.  Impairment is measured based on the difference between the
carrying amount of the assets and fair value.  The implementation of SFAS 121
did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of
operations.

     Foreign Currency Translation:  For foreign subsidiaries whose functional
currency is the local foreign currency, balance sheet accounts are translated
at exchange rates in effect at the end of the period and income statement
accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period.  The resulting
translation gains and losses are included as a separate component of
stockholders' equity.  Foreign transaction gains and losses are included in
other income and were insignificant in Fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995.

     Research and Development:  The Company capitalizes software development
costs upon the establishment of technological feasibility.  The establishment
of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of recoverability
require considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external
factors, including anticipated future revenues, estimated economic life and
changes in software and hardware technologies.  Software development costs are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of five years or the expected
life of the product.  All other Company-sponsored research and development
expenditures are expensed as incurred.  Capitalized software development costs
were $3,651 at June 30, 1997.

     Capitalization of interest and taxes:  The Company capitalizes interest
expense and property taxes relating to property being developed.

     Nonrecurring Income:  Nonrecurring income in 1997 resulted from the $2,528
gain recorded from the sale of Fairchild Scandinavian Bellyloading Company
("SBC"), (See Note 2).  Nonrecurring income for 1996 was $161,406 and includes
a $163,130 nontaxable gain resulting from the merger of Fairchild Communications
Services Company into Shared Technologies Inc.  (See Note 3).  Expenses incurred
in 1996 in connection with other, alternative transactions considered but not
consummated were netted against the above gain in 1996.

     Earnings Per Share:  Primary and fully diluted earnings per share are
computed by dividing net income available to holders of the Company's common
stock, by the weighted average number of shares and share equivalents
outstanding during the period.  To compute the incremental shares resulting from
stock options and warrants for primary earnings per share, the average market
price of the Company's stock during the period is used.  To compute the
incremental shares resulting from stock options and warrants for fully diluted
earnings per share, the greater of the ending market price or the average market
price of the Company's stock is used.  In computing primary and fully diluted
earnings per share for 1997 and in computing fully diluted earnings per share
for 1996, the conversion of options and warrants was assumed, as the effect was
dilutive.  In computing primary earnings per share for Fiscal 1996, only the
dilutive effect from the conversion of options was assumed, as the effect from
the conversion of warrants alone was antidilutive.  In computing primary and
fully diluted earnings per share for Fiscal 1995, the conversion of options and
warrants was not assumed, as the effect was antidilutive.

     Stock-Based Compensation:  In Fiscal 1997, the Company implemented
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 ("SFAS 123"), "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation".  SFAS 123 establishes financial accounting
standards for stock-based employee compensation plans and for transactions in
which an entity issues equity instruments to acquire goods or services from non-
employees.  As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company will continue to use the
intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, for
its stock-based employee compensation plans.  Fair market disclosures required
by SFAS 123 are included in Note 15.

     Use of Estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     Reclassifications:  Certain amounts in prior years' financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the 1997 presentation.

     Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:  In October 1996, the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 96-1
("SOP 96-1") "Environmental Remediation Liabilities".  SOP 96-1 provides
authoritative guidance on specific accounting issues related to the recognition,
measurement, and the display and disclosure of environmental remediation
liabilities.  The Company is required to implement SOP 96-1 in Fiscal 1998.  The
Company's present policy is similar to the policy prescribed by SOP 96-1;
therefore there will be no effect from implementation.

     In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
two pronouncements, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 ("SFAS
128") "Earnings Per Share", and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
129 ("SFAS 129") "Disclosure of Information about Capital Structure".  SFAS 128
establishes accounting standards for computing and presenting earnings per share
("EPS").  SFAS 128 is effective for periods ending after December 15, 1997,
including interim periods, and requires restatement of all prior period EPS data
presented.  Results from the calculation of simple and diluted earnings per
share, as prescribed by SFAS 128, would not differ materially from the
calculations for primary and fully diluted earnings per share for the years
ending June 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995.  SFAS 129 establishes standards for
disclosure of information about the Company's capital structure and becomes
effective for periods ending after December 15, 1997.

     In June 1997, FASB issued two pronouncements, Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130 ("SFAS 130") "Reporting Comprehensive Income", and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 ("SFAS 131") "Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information".  SFAS 130 establishes
standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components
in the financial statements.  SFAS 131 supersedes Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 14 "Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business
Enterprise" and requires that a public company report certain information about
its operating segments in annual and interim financial reports.  The Company
will adopt SFAS 130 and SFAS 131 in Fiscal 1998.

2.   ACQUISITIONS
     ------------

     The Company's acquisitions described in this section have been accounted
for using the purchase method.  The purchase prices assigned to the net assets
acquired were based on the fair value of such assets and liabilities at the
respective acquisition dates.

     In January 1997, Banner, through its subsidiary, Dallas Aerospace, Inc.,
acquired PB Herndon Company ("PB Herndon") in a business combination accounted
for as a purchase. PB Herndon is a distributor of specialty fastener lines and
similar aerospace related components.  The total cost of the acquisition was
$16,000, which exceeded the fair value of the net assets of PB Herndon by
approximately $3,451. The excess is being amortized using the straight-line
method over 40 years. The Company purchased PB Herndon with available cash.

     In February 1997, the Company completed a transaction (the "Simmonds
Acquisition") pursuant to which the Company acquired common shares and
convertible debt representing an 84.2% interest, on a fully diluted basis, of
Simmonds S.A. ("Simmonds").  The Company initiated a tender offer to purchase
the remaining shares and convertible debt held by the public.  By Fiscal year-
end, the Company had purchased, or placed sufficient cash in escrow to purchase,
all the remaining shares and convertible debt of Simmonds.  The total purchase
price of Simmonds, including the assumption of debt, was approximately $62,000,
which the Company funded with available cash.  The Company recorded
approximately $13,000 in goodwill as a result of this acquisition.  Simmonds is
one of Europe's leading manufacturers and distributors of aerospace and
automotive fasteners.

     In September 1994, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock
of Fairchild Scandinavian Bellyloading Company AB ("SBC") for the assumption of
a minimal amount of debt.  SBC is a designer and manufacturer of a patented
cargo loading system, which is installed in the cargo area of commercial
aircraft.  On June 30, 1997, the Company sold all the patents of SBC to Teleflex
Incorporated ("Teleflex") for $5,000, and immediately thereafter sold all the
stock of SBC to a wholly owned subsidiary of Teleflex for $2,000.  The Company
may also receive an additional amount of up to $7,000 based on future net sales
of SBC's patented products and services. In Fiscal 1997, the Company recorded
a $2,528 nonrecurring gain as a result of these transactions.

     On November 28, 1994, the Company's former Communications Services segment
completed the acquisition of substantially all of the telecommunications assets
of JWP Telecom, Inc. ("JWP") for approximately $11,000, plus the assumption of
approximately $3,000 of liabilities.  JWP is a telecommunications system
integrator, specializing in the distribution, installation and maintenance of
voice and data communications equipment.

     Pro forma information is not required for these acquisitions.

3.  MERGER AGREEMENT
    ----------------

     The Company, RHI and Fairchild Industries, Inc. ("FII"), RHI's subsidiary,
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of November 9, 1995 (as
amended, the "Merger Agreement") with Shared Technologies Inc. ("STI").  On
March 13, 1996, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, STI succeeded to the
telecommunications systems and services business operated by the Company's
Fairchild Communications Services Company ("FCSC").

     The transaction was effected by a Merger of FII with and into  STI (the
"Merger") with the surviving company renamed STFI.  Prior to the Merger, FII
transferred all of its assets to, and all of its liabilities were assumed by
FHC, except for the assets and liabilities of FCSC, and $223,500 of the FII's
existing debt and preferred stock.  As a result of the Merger, the Company
received shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock of STFI representing
approximately a 41% ownership interest in STFI.

     The Merger was structured as a reorganization under section 386(a)(1)(A)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In 1996, the Company recorded
a $163,130 nonrecurring gain from this transaction.

4.   MAJORITY INTEREST BUSINESS COMBINATION
     --------------------------------------

     Effective February 25, 1996, the Company completed a transfer of the
Company's Harco Division ("Harco") to Banner in exchange for 5,386,477 shares
of Banner common stock.  The exchange increased the Company's ownership of
Banner common stock from approximately 47.2% to 59.3%, resulting in the Company
becoming the majority shareholder of Banner. Accordingly, the Company has
consolidated the results of Banner since February 25, 1996.  The Company
recorded a $427 nonrecurring loss from outside expenses incurred for this
transaction in 1996.  Banner is a leading international supplier to the
aerospace industry as a distributor, providing a wide range of aircraft parts
and related support services.  Harco is a distributor of precision fasteners to
the aerospace industry.

     In May 1997, Banner granted all of its stockholders certain rights to
purchase Series A Convertible Paid-in-Kind Preferred Stock.  In June 1997,
Banner received net proceeds of $33,876 and issued 3,710,955 shares of preferred
stock.  The Company purchased $28,390 of the preferred stock issued by Banner,
increasing its voting percentage to 64.0%.

     In connection with the Company's December 23, 1993 sale of its interest in
Rexnord Corporation to BTR Dunlop Holdings, Inc. ("BTR"), the Company placed
shares of Banner, with a fair market value of $5,000, in escrow to secure the
Company's remaining indemnification of BTR against a contingent liability.  Once
the contingent liability is resolved, the escrow will be released.

5.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND NET ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
     ----------------------------------------------------

     On February 22, 1996, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated January
26, 1996, the Company, through one of its subsidiaries, completed the sale of
certain assets, liabilities and the business of the D-M-E Company ("DME") to
Cincinnati Milacron Inc. ("CMI"), for a sales price of approximately $244,331,
as adjusted.  The sales price consisted of $74,000 in cash, and two 8%
promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $170,331 (together, the
"8% CMI Notes").  On July 29, 1996, CMI paid in full the 8% CMI Notes.

     As a result of the sale of DME in 1996, the Company recorded a gain on
disposal of discontinued operations of approximately $54,012, net of a $61,929
tax provision.

     On January 27, 1996, FII completed the sale of Fairchild Data Corporation
("Data") to SSE Telecom, Inc. ("SSE") for book value of approximately $4,400 and
100,000 shares of SSE's common stock valued at $9.06 per share, or $906, at
January 26, 1996, and warrants to purchase an additional 50,000 shares of SSE's
common stock at $11.09 per share.

     Accordingly, the results of DME and Data have been accounted for as
discontinued operations.  The  combined net sales of DME and Data totaled
$108,131 and $180,773 for 1996 and 1995, respectively.  Net earnings from
discontinued operations was $9,186, net of $5,695 for taxes in 1996, and
$13,994, net of $10,183 for taxes in 1995.

     Net assets held for sale at June 30, 1997, includes two parcels of real
estate in California, and several other parcels of real estate located primarily
throughout the continental United States, which the Company plans to sell, lease
or develop, subject to the resolution of certain environmental matters and
market conditions.  Also included in net assets held for sale are limited
partnership interests in (i) a real estate development joint venture, and (ii)
a landfill development partnership.

     Net assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or at estimated
net realizable value, which reflect anticipated sales proceeds, and other
carrying costs to be incurred during the holding period.  Interest is not
allocated to net assets held for sale.

6.   PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
     -----------------------------------------

     The following unaudited pro forma information for the twelve months ended
June 30, 1996 and June 30, 1995, provides the results of the Company's
operations as though (i) the disposition of DME and Data, (ii) the Merger of
FCSC, and (iii) the transfer of Harco to Banner, resulting in the consolidation
of Banner, had been in effect since the beginning of each period.  The pro forma
information is based on the historical financial statements of the Company, DME,
FCSC and Banner, giving effect to the aforementioned transactions.  In preparing
the pro forma data, certain assumptions and adjustments have been made which (i)
reduce interest expense for revised debt structures, (ii) increase interest

7.   EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS
     -------------------

     During Fiscal 1996, the Company used the Merger transaction and cash
available to retire fully all of the FII's 12 1/4% senior notes ("Senior
Notes"), FII's 9 3/4% subordinated debentures due 1998, and bank loans under a
credit agreement of a former subsidiary of the Company, VSI Corporation.  The
redemption of the Senior Notes at a premium, consent fees paid to holders of the
Senior Notes, the write-off of the original issue discount on FII 9 3/4%
subordinated debentures and the write off of the remaining deferred loan fees
associated with the issuance of the debt retired, resulted in an extraordinary
loss of $10,436, net of a tax benefit, in 1996.

     During Fiscal 1995, the Company recognized extraordinary gains and losses
from the early extinguishment of debt resulting from repurchases of
its debentures on the open market or in negotiated transactions, and the write-
offs of certain deferred costs associated with the issuance of securities
repurchased.  Early extinguishment of the Company's debt resulted in an
extraordinary gain of $355, net of a tax provision, in 1995.

</TABLE>
     Bank Credit Agreements:  The Company maintains credit agreements (the
"Credit Agreements") with a consortium of banks, which provide revolving credit
facilities to RHI, FHC and Banner, and term loans to Banner (collectively the
"Credit Facilities").

     On July 26, 1996, the Company amended and restated the terms and provisions
of FHC's credit agreement, in their entirety (the "FHC Credit Agreement").  The
FHC Credit Agreement extends to July 28, 2000, the maturity of FHC's revolving
credit facility (the "FHC Revolver").  The FHC Revolver has a borrowing limit
of $52,000, however, availability is determined monthly by calculation of a
borrowing base comprised of specified percentages of FHC's accounts receivable,
inventories and the appraised value of equipment and real property.  The FHC
Revolver generally bears interest at a base rate of 1 1/2% over the greater of
(i) Citibank New York's base rate, or (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1 1/2%
for domestic borrowings and at 2 1/2% over Citibank London's base rate for
foreign borrowings. FHC's Revolver is subject to a non-use commitment fee of
1/2% on the average unused availability; and outstanding letters of credit are
subject to fees of 2 3/4% per annum.  The FHC Credit Agreement was further
amended on February 21, 1997 to permit the Simmonds Acquisition.  Terms modified
by the February 21, 1997 amendment included a provision in which the borrowing
rate on the FHC Revolver will increase by 1/4% on each of September 30, 1997 and
December 31, 1997, in the event that the FHC Credit Agreement is not
restructured or refinanced by such date.

     The FHC Credit Agreement requires FHC to comply with certain financial and
non-financial loan covenants, including maintaining a minimum net worth of
$150,000 and maintaining certain interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at
the end of each Fiscal Quarter.  Additionally, the FHC Credit Agreement
restricts annual capital expenditures of FHC to $12,000. Substantially all of
FHC's assets are pledged as collateral under the FHC Credit Agreement.  At June
30, 1997, FHC was in compliance with all the covenants under the FHC Credit
Agreement.  FHC may transfer available cash as dividends to the Company. 
However, the FHC Credit Agreement restricts the Company from paying any
dividends to stockholders.

      On July 18, 1997, the FHC Credit Agreement was restructured to provide FHC
with a $150,000 senior secured credit facility (the "FHC Facility") consisting
of (i) up to $75,000 in revolving loans, with a letter of credit sub-facility
of $12,000, and (ii) a $75,000 term loan.  Advances made under the FHC Facility
would generally bear interest at a rate of, at the Company's option, (i) 2% over
the Citibank N.A. base rate, or (ii) 3 1/4% over the Eurodollar Rate ("LIBOR"). 
The FHC Facility is subject to a non-use commitment fee of 1/2% of the aggregate
unused availability; and outstanding letters of credit are subject to fees of
3 1/2% per annum.  A borrowing base is calculated monthly to determine the
amounts available under the FHC Facility.  The borrowing base is determined
monthly based upon specified percentages of (i) FHC's accounts receivable,
inventories, and the appraised value of equipment and real property, and (ii)
assets pledged by RHI to secure the facility.  The FHC Facility matures on July
28, 2000.  The FHC Facility provides that on December 31, 1998, the Company must
repay the term loan, in full, together with an amount necessary to reduce the
outstanding revolving loans to $52,000, if the Company has not complied with
certain financial covenant requirements as of September 30, 1998.

     The Credit Agreements provide RHI with a $4,250 revolving credit facility
(the "RHI Credit Agreement") which (i) generally bears a base interest rate of
1/2% over the prime rate, (ii) requires  a commitment fee of 1/2%, and (iii)
matures on August 12, 1998.  RHI's Credit Agreement requires RHI to comply with
specified covenants and maintain a consolidated net worth of $175,000. 
Additionally, RHI's capital expenditures are restricted, except for certain
leasehold improvements, to $2,000 per annum  plus the selling price of fixed
assets for such Fiscal Year.  The Company was in compliance with all the
covenants under RHI's Credit Agreement at June 30, 1997.

     Banner has a credit agreement (the "Banner Credit Agreement") which
provides Banner and its subsidiaries with funds for working capital and
potential acquisitions. The facilities under the Banner Credit Agreement consist
of (i) a $55,000 six-year term loan (the "Banner Term Loan"), (ii) a $30,000
seven-year term loan (the "Tranche B Loan"), (iii) a $40,000 six-year term loan
(the "Tranche C Loan"), and (iv) a $71,500 revolving credit facility (the
"Banner Revolver").  The Banner Credit Agreement requires certain semiannual
term loan payments.  The Banner Term Loan and the Banner Revolver bear interest
at prime plus 1 1/4% or LIBOR plus 2 1/2% and may increase by 1/4% or decrease
by up to 1% based upon certain performance criteria. As a result of Banner's
performance level through March 31, 1997, borrowings under the Banner Term Loan
and the Banner Revolver bore an interest rate of prime plus 3/4% and LIBOR plus
2% for the quarter ending June 30, 1997.  The Tranche B Loan bears interest at
prime plus 1 3/4% or LIBOR plus 3%.  The Tranche C Loan initially bears interest
at prime plus 1 1/2% or LIBOR plus 2 3/4% and may decrease by 1/4% based upon
certain performance criteria.  The Banner Credit Agreement requires that loans
made to Banner can not exceed a defined borrowing base, which is based upon a
percentage of eligible inventories and accounts receivable.  Banner's revolving
credit facility is subject to a non-use fee of 55 basis points of the unused
availability.

     The Banner Credit Agreement requires quarterly compliance with various
financial and non-financial loan covenants, including maintenance of minimum net
worth, and minimum ratios of interest coverage, fixed charge coverage, and debt
to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Banner also
has certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt.  As of June 30,
1997, Banner was in compliance with all covenants under the Banner Credit
Agreement.  Substantially all of Banner's assets are pledged as collateral under
the Banner Credit Agreement.

     In September 1995, Banner entered into several interest rate hedge
agreements ("Hedge Agreements") to manage its exposure to increases in interest
rates on its variable rate debt.  The Hedge Agreements provide interest rate
protection on $60,000 of debt through September 2000, by providing an interest
rate cap of 7% if the 90-day LIBOR rate exceeds 7%.  If the 90-day LIBOR rate
drops below 5%, Banner will be required to pay interest at a floor rate of
approximately 6%.

     In November 1996, Banner entered into an additional hedge agreement
("Additional Hedge Agreement") with one of its major lenders to provide interest
rate protection on $20,000 of debt for a period of three years.  Effectively,
the Additional Hedge Agreement provides for a cap of 7 1/4% if the 90-day LIBOR
exceeds 7 1/4%.  If the 90-day LIBOR drops below 5%, Banner will be required to
pay interest at a floor rate of approximately 6%.  No cash outlay was required
to obtain the Additional Hedge Agreement as the cost of the cap was offset by
the sale of the floor.

     The Company recognizes interest expense under the provisions of the Hedge
Agreements and the Additional Hedge Agreement based on the fixed rate. The
Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the
lenders; however, such non-performance is not anticipated.

Agreements at June 30, 1997:<PAGE>

     Under the most restrictive covenants of the above indentures, the Company's
consolidated net worth, as defined, must not be less than $35,000. RHI's
consolidated net worth must not be less than $125,000.  At June 30, 1997,
consolidated net worth was $229,625 at the Company and $438,830 at RHI. At the
present time, none of the Company's consolidated retained earnings are available
for capital distributions due to a cumulative earnings restriction. The
indentures also provide restrictions on the amount of additional borrowings by
the Company.

     The annual maturity of long-term debt obligations (exclusive of capital
lease obligations) for each of the five years following June 30, 1997, are as
follows:  $31,207 for 1998, $93,544 for 1999, $42,288 for 2000, $77,407 for
2001, and $77,772 for 2002.

11.  PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
     ------------------------------------

     Pensions
     --------

     The Company and its subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans
covering most of its employees.  Employees in foreign subsidiaries may
participate in local pension plans, which are in the aggregate insignificant.
The Company's funding policy is to make the minimum annual contribution required
by applicable regulations.  The following table provides a summary of the
components of net periodic pension expense (income) for the plans:

</TABLE>
     In Fiscal 1996, the Company recognized one-time charges of $857 from the
divestiture of subsidiaries, which resulted in a recognition of prior service
costs, and $84 from the early retirement window program at the Company's
corporate office.  The reduction in liabilities due from the cessation of future
salary increases is not immediately recognizable in income, but will be used as
an offset against existing unrecognized losses.  The Company will have a future
savings benefit from a lower net periodic pension cost due to the amortization
of a smaller unrecognized loss.

     The following table sets forth the funded status and amounts recognized in
the Company's consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 1997, and 1996, for the
plans:

     Postretirement Health Care Benefits
     -----------------------------------

     The Company provides health care benefits for most retired employees. 
Postretirement health care expense from continuing operations totaled $642,
$779, and $701 for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  The Company has accrued
approximately $34,965 and $36,995 as of June 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively,
for postretirement health care benefits related to discontinued operations. 
This represents the cumulative discounted value of the long-term obligation and
includes interest expense of $3,349, $3,877, and $3,872 for the years ended June
30, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  The components of expense in Fiscal
1997, 1996 and 1995 are as follows:

     A one-time credit of $3,938, resulting from the divestitures of
subsidiaries, was offset by $4,361 from DME's accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation for active employees, which was transferred to CMI as part of the
sale.  The Company recognized the net effect of $423 as an expense in 1996.

postretirement health care benefit plans at June 30,:

     The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was determined using a
discount rate of 7.75%, and a health care cost trend rate of 7.0% for pre-age-65
and post-age-65 employees, respectively, gradually decreasing to 5.5% in the
year 2003 and thereafter.

     Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by 1% would increase
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of June 30, 1997, by
approximately $1,871, and increase the net periodic postretirement benefit cost
by approximately $132 for Fiscal 1997.<PAGE>

     The 1997, 1996 and 1995 net tax benefits include the results of
reversing $5,335, $3,500 and $5,000, respectively, of federal income taxes
previously provided for due to a change in the estimate of required tax
accruals.

     Domestic income taxes, less available credits, are provided on the
unremitted income of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies, to the
extent that such earnings are intended to be repatriated.  No domestic income
taxes or foreign withholding taxes are provided on the undistributed earnings
of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which are considered permanently
invested, or which would be offset by allowable foreign tax credits.  At June
30, 1997, the amount of domestic taxes payable upon distribution of such
earnings was not significant.

     In the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for all
income taxes and interest, and any liability that may arise for prior periods
will not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of
operations of the Company.

13.  MINORITY INTEREST IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
     ----------------------------------------------

     Included in the Company's $68,309 of minority interest at June 30, 1997,
is $67,649, representing approximately 40.7% of Banner's common stock
effectively outstanding on a consolidated basis.

14.  EQUITY SECURITIES
     -----------------

     The Company had 13,992,283 shares of Class A common stock and 2,632,516
shares of Class B common stock outstanding at June 30, 1997.  Class A common
stock is traded on both the New York and Pacific Stock Exchanges.  There is
no public market for the Class B common stock.  Shares of Class A common
stock are entitled to one vote per share and cannot be exchanged for shares
of Class B common stock.  Shares of Class B common stock are entitled to ten
votes per share and can be exchanged, at any time, for shares of Class A
common stock on a share-for-share basis.  In Fiscal 1997, 234,935 shares of
Class A Common Stock were issued as a result of the exercise of stock options
and shareholders converted 1,188 shares of Class B common stock into Class A
common stock.

     RHI holds an investment of 4,319,423 shares of the Company's Class A
common stock.  At June 30, 1997, RHI's market value was approximately
$78,649.  The Company accounts for the Class A common stock held by RHI as
Treasury Stock.

15.  STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS
     --------------------------

     Stock Options
     -------------
 
     The Company's 1986 Non-Qualified and Incentive Stock Option Plan (the
"1986 Plan"), authorizes the issuance of 4,320,000 shares of Class A Common
Stock upon the exercise of stock options issued under the 1986 Plan.  The
purpose of the 1986 Plan is to encourage continued employment and ownership
of Class A Common Stock by officers and key employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries, and provide additional incentive to promote the success of the
Company.  At the Company's 1996 annual meeting, the Company's stockholders
approved an extension of the expiration date of the 1986 Plan from April 9,
1996 to April 9, 2006.  The 1986 Plan authorizes the granting of options at
not less than the market value of the common stock at the time of the grant.
The option price is payable in cash or, with the approval of the Company's
Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Board of Directors, in shares
of common stock, valued at fair market value at the time of exercise.  The
options normally terminate five years from the date of grant, subject to
extension of up to 10 years or for a stipulated period of time after an
employee's death or termination of employment.

     At the Company's 1996 annual meeting, the Company's stockholders
approved the 1996 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (the "1996 NED
Plan").  The ten year 1996 NED Plan authorizes the issuance of 250,000 shares
of Class A Common Stock upon the exercise of stock options issued under the
1996 NED Plan.  The 1996 NED Plan authorizes the granting of options at the
market value of the common stock on the date of grant.  An initial stock
option grant for 30,000 shares of Class A Common Stock will be made to each
person who becomes a new non-employee Director, on such date, with the
options to vest 25% each year from the date of grant.  On the date of each
annual meeting, each person elected as a non-employee Director at such
meeting will be granted an option for 1,000 shares of Class A Common Stock,
which will vest immediately.  The exercise price is payable in cash or, with
the approval of the Stock Option Committee, in shares of Class A or Class B
Common Stock, valued at fair market value at the date of exercise.  All
options issued under the 1996 NED Plan will terminate five years from the
date of grant or a stipulated period of time after a Non-Employee Director
ceases to be a member of the Board.  The 1996 NED Plan is designed to
maintain the Company's ability to attract and retain highly qualified and
competent persons to serve as outside directors of the Company.

      On November 17, 1994, the Company's stockholders approved the grant of
stock options of 190,000 shares to outside Directors of the Company to
replace expired stock options.  These stock options expire five years from
the date of the grant.

     The Company applies APB Opinion 25 in accounting for its stock option
plans.  Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the stock
option plans in 1997 or 1996. If stock options granted in 1997 and 1996 were
accounted for based on their fair value as determined under SFAS 123, pro

     Stock Warrants
     --------------

     On April 25, 1997, the Company issued warrants to purchase 100,000
shares of Class A Common Stock, at $12.25 per share, to Dunstan Ltd. as
incentive remuneration for the performance of certain investment banking
services.  The warrants may be earned on a pro-rata basis over a six-month
period ending October 31, 1997.  The warrants become exercisable on November
1, 1997 and expire on November 8, 2000.  The Company recorded a selling,
general & administrative expense of $191 in 1997 for stock warrants earned in
1997 based on a grant-date fair value of $5.46.

     Effective as of February 21, 1997, the Company approved the continuation
of an existing warrant to purchase 375,000 shares of the Company's Class A or
Class B Common Stock at $7.67 per share.  The warrant was modified to extend
the exercise period from Mach 13, 1997, to March 13, 2002, and to increase
the exercise price per share by $.002 for each day subsequent to March 13,
1997, but fixed at $7.80 per share after June 30, 1997.  In addition, the
warrant was modified to provide that the warrant may not be exercised except
within the following window periods:  (i) within 365 days after the merger of
STFI with AT&T Corporation, MCI Communications, Worldcom Inc., Tel-Save
Holdings, Inc., or Teleport Communications Group,Inc.; (ii) within 365 days
after a change of control of the Company, as defined in the FHC Credit
Agreement; or (iii) within 365 days after a change of control of Banner,
as defined in the Banner Credit Agreement.  In no event may the warrant be
exercised after March 13, 2002.

     On November 9, 1995, the Company issued warrants to purchase 500,000
shares of Class A Common Stock, at $9.00 per share, to Peregrine Direct
Investments Limited ("Peregrine"), in exchange for a standby commitment it
received on November 8, 1995, from Peregrine.  The Company elected not to
exercise its rights under the Peregrine commitment.  The warrants are
immediately exercisable and will expire on November 8, 2000.

     On February 21, 1996, the Company issued warrants to purchase 25,000
shares of Class A Common Stock, at $9.00 per share, to a non-employee for
services provided in connection with the Company's various dealings with
Peregrine.  The warrants issued are immediately exercisable and will expire
on November 8, 2000.

     The Company recorded nonrecurring expenses of $1,148 for the grant date
fair value of the stock warrants issued in 1996.  The warrants issued in 1996
were outstanding at June 30, 1997.

16.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
     -----------------------------------

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, ("SFAS 107")
"Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments", requires disclosures
of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not
recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that
value.  In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values
are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. 
Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used,
including discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.  In that regard,
the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to
independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate
settlement of the instrument.  SFAS 107 excludes certain financial
instruments and all non-financial instruments from its disclosure
requirements.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not
represent the underlying value of the Company.

     The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in
estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

     The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet approximates the fair
value for cash and cash equivalents, short-term borrowings, current
maturities of long-term debt, and all other variable rate debt (including
borrowings under the Credit Agreements).

     Fair values for equity securities, and long-term public debt issued by
the Company are based on quoted market prices, where available.  For equity
securities not actively traded, fair values are estimated by using quoted
market prices of comparable instruments or, if there are no relevant
comparable instruments, on pricing models or formulas using current
assumptions.  The fair value of limited partnerships, other investments, and
notes receivable are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows
using a current market rate applicable to the yield, considering the credit
quality and maturity of the investment.

     The fair value for the Company's other fixed rate long-term debt is
estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company's current
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

     Fair values for the Company's off-balance-sheet instruments (letters of
credit, commitments to extend credit, and lease guarantees) are based on fees
currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the
remaining terms of the agreements and the counter parties' credit standing. 
The fair value of the Company's off-balance-sheet instruments at June 30,
1997, was not material.

     The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial
instruments at June 30, 1997 and 1996, are as follows:

17.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
     ---------------------

     In Fiscal 1996, the Company recorded restructuring charges in the
Aerospace Fasteners segment in the categories shown below.  All costs
classified as restructuring were the direct result of formal plans to close
plants, to terminate employees, or to exit product lines.  Substantially all
of these plans have been executed.  Other than a reduction in the Company's
existing cost structure and manufacturing capacity, none of the restructuring
charges resulted in future increases in earnings or represented an accrual of
future costs.  The costs included in restructuring were predominately
nonrecurring in nature and consisted of the following significant components:

Includes lease settlements, write-off of leasehold improvements, maintenance,
 restoration and clean up costs.

18.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
     --------------------------

     Corporate office administrative expense recorded by FHC and its
predecessors was billed to the Company on a monthly basis during 1997, 1996
and 1995.  These costs represent the cost of services incurred on behalf of
affiliated companies.  Each of these affiliated companies has reimbursed FHC
for such services.

     The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are all parties to a tax
sharing agreement whereby the Company files a consolidated federal income tax
return.  Each subsidiary makes payments to the Company based on the amount of
federal income taxes, if any, the subsidiary would have paid if it had filed
a separate tax return.

     Prior to the consolidation of Banner on February 25, 1996, the Aerospace
Fasteners segment had sales to Banner of $3,663 and $5,494 in Fiscal 1996,
and 1995, respectively.

19. LEASES
    ------

     The Company holds certain of its facilities and equipment under long-
term leases.  The minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating
leases with lease-terms in excess of one year, for each of the five years
following June 30, 1997, are as follows: $5,182 for 1998, $4,127 for 1999,
$2,937 for 2000, $2,271 for 2001, and $1,732 for 2002.  Rental expense on
operating leases from continuing operations for Fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995
was $4,928, $6,197, and $6,695, respectively.  Minimum commitments under
capital leases for each of the five years following June 30, 1997, was $651
for 1998, $693 for 1999, $262 for 2000, $210 for 2001, and $137 for 2002,
respectively. At June 30, 1997, the present value of capital lease
obligations was $1,897. At June 30, 1997, capital assets leased, included in
property, plant, and equipment consisted of:

20.  CONTINGENCIES         
     -------------

     CL Motor Freight ("CL") Litigation
     ----------------------------------

     The Workers Compensation Bureau of the State of Ohio is seeking
reimbursement from the Company for up to $5,400 for CL workers compensation
claims which were insured under a self-insured program of CL.  The Company
has contested a significant portion of this claim and believes that the
ultimate disposition of this claim will not be material.

     Government Claims
     -----------------

     The Corporate Administrative Contracting Officer (the "ACO"), based upon
the advice of the United States Defense Contract Audit Agency, has made a
determination that FII did not comply with Federal Acquisition Regulations
and Cost Accounting Standards in accounting for (i) the 1985 reversion to FII
of certain assets of terminated defined benefit pension plans, and (ii)
pension costs upon the closing of segments of FII's business.  The ACO has
directed FII to prepare cost impact proposals relating to such plan
terminations and segment closings and, following receipt of such cost impact
proposals, may seek adjustments to contract prices.  The ACO alleges that
substantial amounts will be due if such adjustments are made.  The Company
believes it has properly accounted for the asset reversions in accordance
with applicable accounting standards.  The Company has held discussions with
the government to attempt to resolve these pension accounting issues.

     Environmental Matters
     ---------------------

     The Company's operations are subject to stringent Federal, state and
local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the
discharge of materials into the environment and the generation, handling,
storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials.  To
date, such laws and regulations have not had a material effect on the
financial condition, results of operations, or net cash flows of the Company,
although the Company has expended, and can be expected to expend in the
future, significant amounts for investigation of environmental conditions and
installation of environmental control facilities, remediation of
environmental conditions and other similar matters, particularly in the
Aerospace Fasteners segment.

     In connection with its plans to dispose of certain real estate, the
Company must investigate environmental conditions and may be required to take
certain corrective action prior or pursuant to any such disposition.  In
addition, management has identified several areas of potential contamination
at or from other facilities owned, or previously owned, by the Company, that
may require the Company either to take corrective action or to contribute to
a clean-up.  The Company is also a defendant in certain lawsuits and
proceedings seeking to require the Company to pay for investigation or
remediation of environmental matters and has been alleged to be a potentially
responsible party at various "Superfund" sites.  Management of the Company
believes that it has recorded adequate reserves in its financial statements
to complete such investigation and take any necessary corrective actions or
make any necessary contributions.  No amounts have been recorded as due from
third parties, including insurers, or set off against, any liability of the
Company, unless such parties are contractually obligated to contribute and
are not disputing such liability.

     As of June 30, 1997, the consolidated total recorded liabilities of the
Company for environmental matters approximated $8,420, which represented the
estimated probable exposures for these matters.  It is reasonably possible
that the Company's total exposure for these matters could be approximately
$13,200 on an undiscounted basis.

     Other Matters
     -------------

     The Company is involved in various other claims and lawsuits incidental
to its business, some of which involve substantial amounts.  The Company,
either on its own or through its insurance carriers, is contesting these
matters.  In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of the legal
proceedings, including those aforementioned, will not have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition, or future results of operations or net
cash flows of the Company.

21.  BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION
     ----------------------------

     The Company reports in two principal business segments. The Aerospace
Fasteners segment includes the manufacture of high performance specialty
fasteners and fastening systems.  The Aerospace Distribution segment
distributes a wide range of aircraft parts and related support services to
the aerospace industry. The results of Fairchild Technologies, which is
primarily engaged in the designing and manufacturing of capital equipment and
systems for recordable compact disc and advance semiconductor manufacturing,
are reported under Corporate and Other, along with results two smaller
operations.  Prior to the Merger on March 13, 1996, the Company operated in
the Communications Services segment.

24.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
     -----------------

     On July 16, 1997, STFI entered into a definitive merger agreement (the
"STFI/Tel-Save Merger") with Tel-Save Holdings, Inc. ("Tel-Save"), pursuant
to which Tel-Save plans to acquire STFI in a business combination accounted
for as a pooling of interests.  Upon consummation of the STFI/Tel-Save
Merger, the Company will receive shares of Tel-Save's common stock in
exchange for its shares of STFI common stock and STFI cumulative convertible
preferred stock.  The price to be paid by Tel-Save is $11.25 for each share
of STFI.  This price may increase depending on the price of Tel-Save prior to
the effective date of the merger. In addition, the Company will receive
approximately $22,000 cash in redemption for its shares of STFI special
preferred stock. The Company expects the merger to be consummated prior to
December 31, 1997.  As a result of the transaction, the Company will
recognize an estimated gain in excess of $100,000. <PAGE>

To The Fairchild Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Fairchild
Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1997 and
1996, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for the years ended June 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995. 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of The Fairchild Corporation
and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years ended June 30, 1997, 1996 and
1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Mr. Colin M. Cohen
2105 Keim Drive
Naperville, Illinois  60565

Dear Colin:

      This will confirm the terms and conditions under which The Fairchild
Corporation is offering to employ you as a Senior Vice President - Business
Development and Finance, until such time as the current Chief Financial Officer
resigns as Chief Financial Officer, at which time you will become Chief
Financial Officer and retain your title as Senior Vice President - Business
Development and Finance.  This agreement is subject to the approval of the
Board of Directors and the Compensation and Stock Option Committee of The
Fairchild Corporation.

Parties:     The Fairchild Corporation ("Fairchild") and Colin M. Cohen.  All
references to "you" shall mean Colin M. Cohen.

Position:     Your position will be Senior Vice President - Business Development
and Finance, and Chief Financial Officer, reporting directly to the Chief
Executive Officer.

Compensation:     Your base salary ("base salary") will be at a rate not less
than $225,000 per year, payable bi-weekly in accordance with Fairchild's usual
payroll policies.  Commencing as of July 1, 1996, you will be eligible to
participate in Fairchild's Executive Incentive Compensation Plan, and to receive
additional compensation ("incentive bonus") at a factor of 50% of your base
salary, your base salary as of the first day of each fiscal year being the
benchmark for such computation for the entire fiscal year, irrespective of any
increase in base salary during such fiscal year.  Subject to


Compensation
[Cont.]:      termination for cause, your incentive bonus for fiscal 1997 shall
in no event be less than $112,500, irrespective of whether targets are met.  In
addition to the incentive bonus, you will be entitled to receive such special
bonuses as shall be approved from time to time by Fairchild's Stock Option and
Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee").

Your base salary will be reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee, and
increases, if any, to your base salary will be at the discretion of the Board of
Directors.

Stock Options:     You will be granted an option to acquire up to 50,000 shares
of Class A Common Stock of Fairchild, in accordance with the 1986 Non-Qualified
and Incentive Stock Option Plan of Fairchild, as amended (the "1986 Stock Option
Plan), subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee, Fairchild's Board
of Directors and the approval of its shareholders of the extension of the 1986
Stock Option Plan; provided, however, that notwithstanding the provisions of the
1986 Stock Option Plan, options to acquire 25,000 shares shall be deemed vested
immediately upon grant, 12,500 shall be deemed vested upon the first anniversary
of grant, and 12,500 shall be deemed vested on the second anniversary of grant.

Additional

Stock Options:     While you are in the employ of Fairchild, you may be granted
additional stock option awards under the 1986 Stock Option Plan, as determined
from time to time by the Compensation Committee.

Lost Compensation
Reimbursement:    Fairchild acknowledges that in accepting Fairchild employment
at this time, you will be forfeiting substantial compensation to which you would
otherwise be entitled.  To recompense you

Lost Compensation
Reimbursement
[Cont.]:    for such compensation, Fairchild shall pay you $150,000 upon
commencement of the Initial Term (hereinafter defined).  The obligations of
Fairchild under this section are absolute and unconditional, and will survive
your death or disability, or the termination of your Fairchild employment, for
any reason (whether such termination is during or after the term of your
employment).

Automotive
Allowance:     You will be eligible to participate in the Fairchild Executive
Automobile Ownership Plan at a reimbursement rate ($650 per month) equal to that
of other senior officers of Fairchild, other than the Chief Executive Officer.

Reimbursement
Of Business
Expenses:     Fairchild will reimburse you for reasonable business-related
expenses that you incur in connection with the performance of your duties to
Fairchild.  Reimbursement for travel expenses shall be consistent with
Fairchild's policies, with such exceptions as the Chief Executive Officer may,
from time to time, approve.

Supplementary
Executive
Retirement Plan:     You shall be entitled to participate in Fairchild's
Supplementary Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP").  Notwithstanding the
provisions of the SERP, for purposes of determining years of service with
Fairchild, you shall be credited with two years of service for each of the first
ten years you remain an active Fairchild employee, but the foregoing shall not
affect vesting requirements which shall remain in accordance with the SERP.

     Other Benefits:     You will be eligible to participate in all Fairchild
employee benefit plans including Fairchild's Group Health Insurance Plan,
Fairchild's Pension Plan, Fairchild's Retiree Medical Plan, Fairchild's


Other Benefits
[Cont.]:     Long Term Disability Plan, and Fairchild's Savings Plan (401(k)),
and to receive Fairchild paid group life insurance (up to three times base
salary), and to participate in Fairchild's Executive Life Insurance Plan,
pursuant to which you will have the option to obtain additional insurance on
terms and conditions no less favorable to you than the terms and conditions on
which any other executive, other than the Chief Executive Officer, has obtained
such insurance.

Physical
Examination:     You will be entitled to go to the Greenbrier Clinic for an
annual physical examination at Fairchild expense.

Vacation:
You will be entitled to not less than four weeks vacation per year,
in accordance with the Fairchild vacation policy, as the same shall be amended
from time to time.  In no event, however, will any such amendment diminish the
aggregate amount of vacation to which you are entitled in each year to less than
four weeks.  Fairchild agrees that, for the calendar year 1996, you shall be
entitled to receive up to three weeks of vacation, which may be taken at any
time after the commencement of the Initial Term.

Board
Nomination:     You will be nominated to serve on the Board of Directors of
Fairchild and such other subsidiaries and affiliates of Fairchild as you deem
appropriate for the performance of your duties.

Relocation:     You will be entitled to participate in the Fairchild Relocation
Plan, under which, so long as you are a Fairchild employee at the time you incur
any of the relocation expenses  contemplated by this section, Fairchild will (i)
reimburse you for reasonable moving expenses from Naperville, Illinois, to an
area reasonably proximate to Fairchild's corporate offices in Chantilly,
Virginia, i.e. the Greater Washington D.C. Metropolitan area ("Fairchild's
Environs"), which reasonable moving expenses will include all


Relocation
[Cont.]:     expenses in respect of the packing and transporting of all of your
family's household effects and two automobiles from your current residence (the
"Naperville House") to your new residence in Fairchild's Environs, (ii) provide
you with a "drapery allowance", (iii) pending your family's move from the
Naperville House to Fairchild's Environs, but in no event beyond April 30, 1997,
reimburse you for temporary living/travel expenses incurred by you and your
immediate family, (iv) if you acquire a new residence in Fairchild's Environs
prior to selling the Naperville House, Fairchild will make utility, monthly
mortgage and real estate tax payments on the Naperville House until you sell the
Naperville House, but not for more than seven months, (v) reimburse you for
reasonable closing costs (including brokerage, commission and reasonable
attorneys' fees) in connection with the sale of the Naperville House, and (vi)
reimburse you for reasonable title closing and financing closing costs
(including mortgage origination fees or discounts, i.e. "points", so called,
not to exceed one point) in connection with your purchase of a primary
residence in Fairchild's Environs.  If any amount paid or reimbursed to you
pursuant to this section is subject to income tax, Fairchild will pay you an
additional amount such that the net amount received by you, after the payment
of such taxes (and additional taxes attributable to such payment), are the
amounts set forth in this section; subject to confirmation by Fairchild's
Tax Counsel and/or Tax Auditors, your determination of the additional amount
required to be paid to you pursuant to this sentence will be conclusive.
Fairchild agrees to withhold from any reimbursement of relocation expenses
that may constitute taxable income to you, such amount as may be required by
law.

Term:     The initial term of your employment shall commence as of the date you
are formally placed on Fairchild's payroll (which date is anticipated to be
October 1, 1996), and ending September 30,

Term [Cont.]:     1999 (the "Initial Term").  Unless sooner terminated pursuant
to the terms hereof, commencing on October 1, 1999, and on each anniversary
thereafter, the term of your employment shall automatically be extended for one
additional year ("extended term") unless, not later than 180 days preceding such
date, you or Fairchild shall give written notice to the other that you or it
does not wish to extend the term of employment for such additional one year
period.

Termination:     If at any time during the Initial Term, Fairchild shall
terminate your employment for reasons other than Cause (hereinafter defined), or
if you terminate your employment for Good Reason (hereinafter defined), you or
your estate will be entitled post-termination to a continuation of your base
salary, at its then current rate, through and until the later of (i) the end of
the Initial Term, or (ii) a period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of
the notice of termination (which date of the notice shall be deemed and
hereinafter referred to as the "effective date of termination").  Further, you
will be entitled to the incentive bonus, if any, which you would have been paid
(but for such termination), during the period post the effective date of
termination during which your base salary is continued, pro rated for any
partial fiscal year.

If Fairchild elects not to extend the term of your employment for any additional
one year period for any reason other than Cause, or if your employment shall be
terminated during any extended term, either by Fairchild for any reason other
than Cause, or by you for Good Reason, you or your estate shall be entitled to
receive as severance, the continuation of your base salary for a period of
twenty-four months from the effective date of termination, and shall be entitled
to the incentive bonus, if any, during the period post the effective date of
termination during which your base salary is continued, pro rated for any
partialfiscal year.


Termination

Cause, or by you for Good Reason, you will be entitled to continue to
participate in Fairchild's Group Health Insurance Plan, and Fairchild's
Group Life Insurance Plan, for a period of one year after the effective date
of termination. Thereafter, you will be eligible for COBRA benefits.

These termination payments and benefits shall be in full settlement of any claim
you may have to compensation in any form, except for your Relocation Expenses
and Lost Compensation Reimbursement.

Change of
Control:     As a senior officer of Fairchild, you will be covered by a "Change
in Control" provision including the same "triggers", and at the same level as
other senior officers of Fairchild, other than the CEO, a copy of which is
attached as Schedule A.  Following a Change of Control, if you are the
prevailing party in a suit or proceeding against Fairchild, or its
successors, to enforce your rights under this Agreement, you shall be
entitled to recover from Fairchild, your reasonable attorneys' fees and
other costs and expenses in connection with such suit or proceeding.

Parachute
Payments:     In no event shall any amounts payable pursuant to this letter
agreement which are deemed to constitute "parachute payments" (as defined in
Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Service Code, as amended (the "Code"), when
added to any other payments which are deemed to constitute "parachute payments",
as defined in the Code, exceed 2.99 times your "base amount" (as defined in the
Code).

Duties:     As Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President - Business
Development and Finance, you shall perform such duties, reasonably


Duties [Cont.]:     consistent with your position as Chief Financial Officer and
Senior Vice President - Business Development and Finance, as you shall be
directed to perform by the Chief Executive Officer and/or the Board of
Directors. These duties shall include, but not be limited to, administrative
direction of financial and strategic business operations conducted from
Fairchild's facility in Chantilly, Virginia, having direct authority over

planning and, subject to the overriding authority of the Chief Executive
Officer, strategic development functions of Fairchild and participation
in the development of new projects for Fairchild.  You acknowledge that your
office will require your fulltime efforts and attention, and that you shall
not, during the Initial Term or any extension, engage in any other business
activity, whether or not such other business activity is for your own behalf
or for any other person, firm, corporation or other entity (together, a
"Person") and whether or not such other Person is in competition with
Fairchild.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall be allowed
to manage and oversee passive investments in noncompeting businesses, provided
that such management and oversight does not interfere with the performance of
your duties for Fairchild.  In addition, you shall have discretion to perform
such other duties as are required by law.

Confidentiality:     You shall enter into a Confidentiality Agreement and an
Agreement to Assign to Fairchild inventions and designs, whether patentable or
not, conceived or improved by you during the Initial Term or during any
extension thereof.

dishonesty, conviction of any felony, or conviction of any lesser crime or

undertaken without Cause: (i) breach by Fairchild of any material provision of
this Agreement, unless such breach is remedied with reasonable promptness,
following written notice from you; (ii) failure by the Board of Directors, at
any time, to elect you to, or your removal at any time from, the office of Chief
Financial Officer, or the office of Senior Vice President - Business Development
and Finance; (iii) diminution in the material duties of your office, or
interference in the performance of your material duties with Fairchild, unless
the same is remedied, following written notice from you.

affiliates and subsidiaries.

Governing Law:     Our understandings shall be governed by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Virginia, exclusive of its choice of law provisions.

Fairchild and its successors, including any successor by merger or
consolidation, and any entity or entities that acquire all, or substantially
all, of Fairchild's assets.  This Agreement will inure to the benefit of,
and be enforceable by you and your heirs, legatees, executors, and personal
representatives and, to the extent that they are entitled to receive any
compensation, benefit or payment or reimbursement under any provision of
this Agreement, your spouse and any other beneficiary; provided, however,
that after your acceptance of this Agreement, you will have the right at
any time to amend, modify or terminate this Agreement and any provision
hereof (including any provision of this Agreement granting any
rights to your spouse or any other beneficiary), without the consent or approval
of your spouse or any other beneficiary.
If the foregoing is acceptable to you, please sign and return a copy to me.
Welcome aboard!

Very truly yours,

     If a "change of control" (as defined in the attached Exhibit A) of
Fairchild occurs during a three year period from the date of this letter while
you are still an employee of Fairchild, you shall be entitled to receive a sum
equal to two times your then current total annual compensation (including base
salary and incentive compensation target, earned or unearned), payable one-half
on the date of change of control (the "first change of payment") and, as long
as your employment continues, one-half over a one year period in four equal
quarterly installments, commencing three months after the date of change of
control (the "second change payments"), except that in the event of your
employment is terminated without cause during said one year period (or, in the
event you terminate your employment during said one year period for "good
reason", as defined below), you shall be entitled to receive immediately the
first change payment (if not already paid), any second change payments accrued
to date of termination but not yet paid, and the severance payment, if
applicable, referred to in the section of this letter entitled "Termination",

and payable.  For purposes of this section only, "good reason" includes any
action by Fairchild (or a successor company) which results in a reduction in
your compensation, position, authority, duties or responsibilities, such that
your senior management opportunities are substantially lessened, or which
results in your primary place of employment being relocated more than 35
miles from the current Dulles Airport location.  No sum payable to you upon
change of control shall limit or affect your entitlement to base salary or
incentive compensation for all periods during which you are employed by
Fairchild.

d)  Thereafter, base salary for CDI services will be reviewed annually by
the Fairchild Board of Directors (Compensation Committee), and adjustments
(if any) to Moskovic's base salary will be at the discretion of the Fairchild

of Fiscal Year 1995.

Agreement remains in full force and effect.  References in the Original

                AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF LOANS


     2.01.  Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facilities.  (a)
Revolving Loans.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, each Revolving Lender hereby severally and not
jointly agrees to make revolving loans, in Dollars (each
individually, a "Revolving Loan" and, collectively, the "Revolving
Loans") to the Borrower from time to time during the period from
the Effective Date to the Business Day next preceding the Revolving
Credit Termination Date, in an amount not to exceed such Lender's
Revolving Credit Pro Rata Share of the amount equal to
Availability.  All Revolving Loans comprising the same Borrowing
under this Agreement shall be made by the Lenders simultaneously
and proportionately to their then respective Revolving Credit Pro
Rata Shares, it being understood that no Lender shall be
responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its
obligation to make a Loan hereunder nor shall the Revolving Credit
Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of
any such failure.  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the
Borrower may repay any outstanding Revolving Loan on any day which
is a Business Day and any amounts so repaid may be reborrowed, up
to the amount available under this Section 2.01(a) at the time of
such Borrowing, until the Business Day next preceding the Revolving
Credit Termination Date; provided, however, the Borrower shall,
without notice or demand of any kind, immediately make such
repayments of the Revolving Loans and Term Loans, pro rata based on
the respective outstanding principal balances thereof, to the
extent necessary to reduce the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the Loans to an amount no greater than the difference
between the Availability as of any given time and the Letter of
Credit Obligations as of such time and the Term Loans so repaid may
not be reborrowed.  Each requested Borrowing of Revolving Loans
funded on any Funding Date therefor shall be (i) if Base Rate
Loans, in a principal amount of at least $100,000 and in integral
multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount and (ii) if
Eurodollar Rate Loans, in a principal amount of at least $1,000,000
and in integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount.

     (b)  Term Loans.  Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, each Term Lender hereby severally and not
jointly agrees to make term loans, in Dollars (each individually,
a "Term Loan" and, collectively, the "Term Loans") to the Borrower
on the Effective Date in the amount of its Term Loan Commitment.
All Term Loans shall be made by the Term Lenders simultaneously, it
being understood that no Lender shall be responsible for any
failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make a
Term Loan hereunder nor shall the Term Loan Commitment of any
Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any such failure.

     2.02.  General Terms.  (a)  Notice of Borrowing.  When the
Borrower desires to borrow under Section 2.01, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent a Notice of Borrowing, signed
on behalf of the Borrower, (i) on the Effective Date, in the case
of a Borrowing on the Effective Date, (ii) no later than 11:00 a.m.
(New York time) on the proposed Funding Date therefor, in the case
of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans after the Effective Date, and
(iii) no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) at least three (3)
Business Days in advance of the proposed Funding Date therefor, in
the case of a Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans after the
Effective Date.  Such Notice of Borrowing shall specify (i) the
proposed Funding Date (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) the
amount of the proposed Borrowing and whether the Borrowing is of
Term Loans or Revolving Loans, (iii) the Availability as of the
date of such Notice of Borrowing, (iv) whether the proposed
Borrowing will be of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, (v)
in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the requested Eurodollar
Interest Period, (vi) the instructions for the disbursement of the
proceeds of the proposed Borrowing, and (vii) the portion of the
proposed Borrowing, if any, which will be used to pay a dividend on
the Borrower's Capital Stock or to make a loan or other advance to
any Affiliate of the Borrower. The Loans made on the Effective Date
shall initially be Base Rate Loans and thereafter may be continued
as Base Rate Loans or converted into Eurodollar Rate Loans, in the
manner provided in Section 5.01(c) and subject to the conditions
therein set forth and in Section 5.02.  In lieu of delivering such
a Notice of Borrowing (except with respect to a Borrowing of Loans
on the Effective Date), the Borrower may give the Administrative
Agent telephonic notice of any proposed Borrowing by the time
required under this Section 2.02(a), if the Borrower confirms such
notice by delivery of the required Notice of Borrowing to the
Administrative Agent by facsimile transmission promptly, but in no
event later than 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the same day, the
original of which facsimile copy shall be delivered to the
Administrative Agent within fourteen (14) days after the date of
such transmission.  Any Notice of Borrowing (or telephonic notice
in lieu thereof) given pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) shall be
irrevocable.

     (b)  Making of Loans.  (i)  Promptly after receipt of a Notice
of Borrowing under Section 2.02(a) (or telephonic notice in lieu
thereof), the Administrative Agent shall notify each Term  Lender
or each Revolving Lender, as applicable, by telecopy, or other
similar form of transmission, of the proposed Borrowing.  Each
Lender obligated to make a Loan with respect to the requested
Borrowing shall deposit an amount equal to its Term Loan Pro Rata
Share or Revolving Credit Pro Rata Share, as applicable, of the
respective Term Loan or Revolving Loan amount requested with the
Administrative Agent at its office in New York, New York, in
immediately available funds not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York
time) on the applicable Funding Date therefor.  Subject to the
fulfillment of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 6.01
or Section 6.02, as applicable, the Administrative Agent shall make
the proceeds of such amounts received by it with respect to Loans
available to the Borrower at the Administrative Agent's office in
New York, New York on such Funding Date (or on the date received if
later than such Funding Date) and shall disburse such proceeds in
accordance with the Borrower's disbursement instructions set forth
in the applicable Notice of Borrowing. The failure of any Lender to
deposit the amount described above with the Administrative Agent on
the applicable Funding Date shall not relieve any other Lender of
its obligations hereunder to make its Loan on such Funding Date. In
the event the conditions precedent set forth in Section 6.01  or
6.02, as applicable, are not fulfilled as of the proposed Funding
Date for any Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly
return, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount
deposited by each Lender to such Lender.

     (ii)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified
by any Lender (A) on the Business Day immediately preceding the
applicable Funding Date in respect of any Borrowing of Loans which
are Eurodollar Rate Loans or (B) prior to the time of funding
thereof as specified in Section 2.02(a) in respect of any Borrowing
of Loans which are Base Rate Loans, that such Lender does not
intend to fund its Loan requested to be made on such Funding Date,
the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has funded its
Loan and is depositing the proceeds thereof with the Administrative
Agent on the Funding Date therefor, and the Administrative Agent,
in its sole discretion may, but shall not be obligated to, disburse
a corresponding amount to the Borrower on the applicable Funding
Date.  If the Loan proceeds corresponding to that amount are
advanced to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent but are not in
fact deposited with the Administrative Agent by such Lender on or
prior to the applicable Funding Date, such Lender agrees to pay,
and in addition the Borrower agrees to repay, to the Administrative
Agent, forthwith on demand such corresponding amount, together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
disbursed to or for the benefit of the Borrower until the date such
amount is paid or repaid to the Administrative Agent (A) in the
case of the Borrower, at the interest rate applicable to such
Borrowing and (B) in the case of such Lender, at the Federal Funds
Rate for the first Business Day after the applicable Funding Date,
and thereafter at the interest rate applicable to such Borrowing. 
If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent the
corresponding amount, the amount so paid shall constitute such
Lender's Loan, and if both such Lender and the Borrower shall pay
and repay such corresponding amount, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly pay to the Borrower such corresponding amount.  This
Section 2.02(b) does not relieve any Lender of its obligation to
make its Loan on any applicable Funding Date.  

     (c)  Revolving Credit Termination Date.  The Revolving Credit
Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving Credit Termination
Date. Each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans
shall terminate on the Business Day next preceding the Revolving
Credit Termination Date. All outstanding Obligations shall be paid
in full (or, in the case of unmatured Letter of Credit Obligations,
provision for payment in cash shall be made to the satisfaction of
the Issuing Banks and the Requisite Lenders) (i) if the Revolving
Credit Commitments are terminated pursuant to Section 4.01, on the
date such termination is effective, and (ii) otherwise, on the
earlier to occur of (A) July 28, 2000 or, if not a Business Day,
the next preceding Business Day, and (B) the date of acceleration
of the Obligations pursuant to Section 12.02.

     
     2.03.  Authorized Officers and Administrative Agent.  On the
Effective Date the Borrower shall deliver, and from time to time
thereafter the Borrower may deliver, to the Administrative Agent an
Officer's Certificate setting forth the names of the officers,
employees and agents authorized to request Loans and Letters of
Credit and to request a conversion/continuation of any Loan, in
each instance containing a specimen signature of each such officer,
employee or agent.  The officers, employees and agents so
authorized shall also be authorized to act for the Borrower in
respect of all other matters relating to the Loan Documents.  The
Administrative Agent, Lenders and Issuing Banks shall be entitled
to rely conclusively on such officer's, employee's, or agent's
authority to request such Loan or Letter of Credit or such conver-
sion/continuation until the Administrative Agent, Lenders and
Issuing Banks receive written notice to the contrary.  None of the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders, or the Issuing Banks shall have
any duty to verify the authenticity of the signature appearing on
any such Officer's Certificate, written Notice of Borrowing or
Notice of Conversion/Continuation, or any other document, and, with
respect to an oral request for such a Loan or Letter of Credit or
such conversion/continuation, the Administrative Agent shall have
no duty to verify the identity of any person representing himself
or herself as one of the officers, employees or agents authorized
to make such request or otherwise to act on behalf of the Borrower. 
None of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank
shall incur any liability to the Borrower or any other Person in
acting upon any telephonic or facsimile notice referred to above
which the Administrative Agent, such Lender, or such Issuing Bank
believes to have been given by a duly authorized officer or other
person authorized to borrow on behalf of the Borrower.

     2.04.  Use of Proceeds of Loans.  The proceeds of the Loans
shall be used for working capital in the ordinary course of the
respective businesses of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or for
other lawful general corporate purposes not prohibited by the terms
of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the payment of
dividends, but excluding, in accordance with the provisions of
Section 10.11, the purchasing or carrying of Margin Stock within
the meaning of Regulation U and Regulation G.

Lender in its capacity as an Issuing Bank), and the Administrative
Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank such amounts received
by it, and any other amounts received by the Administrative Agent
for the Issuing Bank's account, pursuant to this Section 3.01(e).
All amounts so paid to the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to
constitute Borrower Loans. If a Lender does not make its Revolving
Credit Pro Rata Share of the amount of such payment available to
the Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank, forthwith
on demand, such amount together with interest thereon, for the
first Business Day after the date such payment was first due at the
Federal Funds Rate, and thereafter at the interest rate then
applicable to Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section 5.01(a). 
The failure of any Lender to make available to the Administrative
Agent for the account of an Issuing Bank its Revolving Credit Pro
Rata Share of any such payment shall neither relieve any other
Lender of its obligation hereunder to make available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank such
other Lender's Revolving Credit Pro Rata Share of any payment on
the date such payment is to be made nor increase the obligation of
any other Lender to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 

     (iii)  Whenever an Issuing Bank receives a payment on account
of a Reimbursement Obligation, including any interest thereon, as
to which the Administrative Agent has previously received payments
from any Revolving Lender for the account of such Issuing Bank
pursuant to this Section 3.01(e), such Issuing Bank shall promptly
pay to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly pay to such Lender an amount equal to such Lender's
Revolving Credit Pro Rata Share thereof.  Each such payment shall
be made by such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the
case may be, on the Business Day on which such Person receives the
funds paid to such Person pursuant to the preceding sentence, if
received prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on such Business Day,
and otherwise on the next succeeding Business Day.  

     (iv)  Upon the request of any Lender, an Issuing Bank shall
furnish such Lender copies of any Letter of Credit or Letter of
Credit Reimbursement Agreement to which such Issuing Bank is party
and such other documentation as reasonably may be requested by such
Lender. 

     (v)  The obligations of a Lender to make payments to the
Administrative Agent for the account of any Issuing Bank with
respect to a Letter of Credit shall be irrevocable, shall not be
subject to any qualification or exception whatsoever except willful
misconduct or gross negligence of such Issuing Bank, and shall be
honored in accordance with this Article III (irrespective of the
satisfaction of the conditions described in Sections 6.01 and 6.02,
as applicable) under all circumstances, including, without
limitation, any of the following circumstances:

     (A)  any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents; 

     (B)  the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other
right which the Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary
named in a Letter of Credit or any transferee of a beneficiary
named in a Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such
transferee may be acting), the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank, any Lender, or any other Person, whether in connection with
this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated
herein or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying
transactions between the account party and beneficiary named in any
Letter of Credit);

     (C)  any draft, certificate or any other document presented
under the Letter of Credit having been determined to be forged,
fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement
therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

     (D)  the surrender or impairment of any security for the
performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Loan
Documents;

    (E)  any failure by that Issuing Bank to make any reports
required pursuant to Section 3.01(h) or the inaccuracy of any such
report; or

    (F)  the occurrence of any Event of Default or Potential Event
of Default. 

     (f)  Payment of Reimbursement Obligations.  (i)  The Borrower
unconditionally agrees to pay, or cause its Subsidiary for whose
account a Letter of Credit is issued to pay, to each Issuing Bank,
in Dollars, the amount of all Reimbursement Obligations, interest
and other amounts payable to such Issuing Bank under or in
connection with the Letters of Credit when such amounts are due and
payable, irrespective of any claim, setoff, defense or other right
which the Borrower may have at any time against any Issuing Bank or
any other Person. 

    (ii)  In the event any payment by the Borrower or such
Subsidiary received by an Issuing Bank with respect to a Letter of
Credit and distributed by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving
Lenders on account of their participations is thereafter set aside,
avoided or recovered from such Issuing Bank in connection with any
receivership, liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding, each such
Lender which received such distribution shall, upon demand by such
Issuing Bank, contribute such Lender's Revolving Credit Pro Rata
Share of the amount set aside, avoided or recovered together with
interest at the rate required to be paid by such Issuing Bank upon
the amount required to be repaid by it.

     (g)  Issuing Bank Charges.  The Borrower shall pay, or cause
its Subsidiary for whose account a Letter of Credit is issued to
pay, to each Issuing Bank, solely for its own account, the standard
charges assessed by such Issuing Bank in connection with the
issuance, administration, amendment and payment or cancellation of
Letters of Credit and such compensation in respect of such Letters
of Credit for the Borrower's or such Subsidiary's account, as
applicable, as may be agreed upon by the Borrower and such Issuing
Bank from time to time.

     (h)  Issuing Bank Reporting Requirements.  Each Issuing Bank
shall, no later than the first (1st) Business Day following the
last day of each calendar month, provide to the Administrative
Agent, the Borrower, and, if requested by a Lender, such Lender
separate schedules for Commercial Letters of Credit and Standby
Letters of Credit issued as Letters of Credit, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,
setting forth the aggregate Letter of Credit Obligations
outstanding to it at the end of each day during such month and, to
the extent not otherwise provided in accordance with the provisions
of Section 3.01(c)(ii), any information requested by the
Administrative Agent or the Borrower relating to the date of issue,
account party, amount, expiration date and reference number of each
Letter of Credit issued by it.  

     (i)  Indemnification; Exoneration.  (i)  In addition to all
other amounts payable to an Issuing Bank, the Borrower hereby
agrees to defend, indemnify, and save the Administrative Agent,
each Issuing Bank and each Lender harmless from and against any and
all claims, demands, liabilities, penalties, damages, losses (other
than loss of profits), costs, charges and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees but excluding taxes) which the
Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender may incur or
be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (A) the
issuance of any Letter of Credit other than as a result of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank, as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or (B) the failure
of the Issuing Bank issuing a Letter of Credit to honor a drawing
under such Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission,
whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or
de facto government or Governmental Authority. 

    (ii)  As between the Borrower and any of its Subsidiaries for
whose account a Letter of Credit is issued on the one hand and the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks on the
other hand, the Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and
omissions of, or misuse of Letters of Credit by, the respective
beneficiaries of the Letters of Credit.  In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, subject to the provisions of the
Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreements, the Issuing Banks and
the Lenders shall not be responsible for:  (A) the form, validity,
legality, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any
document submitted by any party in connection with the application
for and issuance of the Letters of Credit, even if it should in
fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient,
inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (B) the validity, legality or
sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights
or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part,
which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (C)
failure of the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit to comply duly
with conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of
Credit; (D) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in
transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable,
telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher;
(E) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (F) any loss or
delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in
order to make a drawing under any Letter of Credit or of the
proceeds thereof; (G) the misapplication by the beneficiary of a
Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter
of Credit; and (H) any consequences arising from causes beyond the
control of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks or the
Lenders.  

     3.02.  Transitional Provisions.  Schedule 3.02 contains a
schedule of certain Letters of Credit issued prior to the Effective
Date by Citibank for the account of the Borrower or for the account
of a Subsidiary of the Borrower and on which the Borrower is
jointly and severally liable for reimbursement of amounts drawn
thereunder. Such Letters of Credit shall continue to be Letters of
Credit issued pursuant to this Agreement and be subject to the
provisions hereof.

     3.03.  Obligations Several.  The obligations of each Issuing
Bank and each Lender under this Article III are several and not
joint, and no Issuing Bank or Lender shall be responsible for the
obligation to issue Letters of Credit or participation obligation
hereunder, respectively, of any other Issuing Bank or Lender.

                  PAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS

     4.01.  Prepayments; Reductions in Commitments.


      (a)  Voluntary Prepayments/Commitment Reductions.  (i)
Prepayments.  The Borrower may prepay the Revolving Loans in whole
or in part, at any time and from time to time, subject to the right
to reborrow the same in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.01(a). The Borrower may permanently prepay the Revolving Loans
and Term Loans in whole or in minimum amounts of $1,000,000 and
integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount at any
time upon at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice as
provided in clause (ii) below.


     (ii)  Voluntary Commitment Reductions.  The Borrower, upon at
least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent from the Borrower (which the Administrative
Agent shall promptly transmit to each Lender), shall have the
right, at any time and from time to time, to terminate in whole or
permanently reduce in part the Revolving Credit Commitments;
provided that, the Borrower shall have made whatever payment may be
required to reduce the outstanding principal amount of the
Revolving Loans by the aggregate amount required such that the
Revolving Credit Obligations, after giving effect to such payment,
will equal an amount less than or equal to the Revolving Credit
Commitments as reduced or terminated.  Any partial reduction of the
Revolving Credit Commitments shall be in an aggregate minimum
amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess
of that amount. Each reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments
shall reduce the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Revolving
Lender proportionately in accordance with its Revolving Credit Pro
Rata Share.  Any notice of termination or reduction given to the
Administrative Agent under this Section 4.01(a)(ii) shall specify
the date (which shall be a Business Day) of such termination or
reduction and, with respect to a partial reduction, the aggregate
principal amount thereof.  When notice of termination or reduction
is delivered as provided herein, the principal amount of the
Revolving Loans specified in the notice shall become due and
payable on the date specified in such notice.


     (iii)  Prepayment Fee.  The prepayments and payments in
respect of reductions and terminations described in this Section
4.01 may be made without premium or penalty (except as provided in
Article XIV).


     (b)  Mandatory Prepayments/Commitment Reductions. 

     (i)  Net Cash Proceeds of Sale.  The Borrower shall make or
cause to be made a mandatory prepayment of the Obligations in an
amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Net Cash Proceeds
of Sale received by the Borrower, RHI, or any of Borrower's
Subsidiaries within (A) three (3) Business Days after such Person's
receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds of Sale with respect to sales,
assignments, or other dispositions of assets within the U.S. and
(B) fourteen (14) days after such Person's receipt of Net Cash
Proceeds of Sale with respect to sales, assignments, or other
dispositions of assets outside of the U.S. 

     (ii)  Net Cash Proceeds of Issuance of Equity Securities. 
Immediately upon TFC's, RHI's, any Subsidiary of RHI's, the
Borrower's or any Subsidiary of the Borrower's receipt of any Net
Cash Proceeds of Issuance of Equity Securities, the Borrower shall
make or cause to be made a mandatory prepayment in an amount equal
to one hundred percent (100%) of such Net Cash Proceeds of Issuance
of Equity Securities.

     (iii)  Net Cash Proceeds of Issuance of Indebtedness. 
Immediately upon TFC's, RHI's, any Subsidiary of RHI's, the
Borrower's or any Subsidiary of the Borrower's receipt of any Net
Cash Proceeds of Issuance of Indebtedness, the Borrower shall make
or cause to be made a mandatory prepayment in an amount equal to
one hundred percent (100%) of such Net Cash Proceeds of Issuance of
Indebtedness.

     (iv)  Performance Tests.  In the event of any failure in
compliance, as of September 28, 1998, with any of the requirements
set forth in Section 11.06, the Borrower shall make a mandatory
prepayment on December 31, 1998 in the amount equal to the sum of
the then outstanding balance of the Term Loans and all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon plus the amount by which the outstanding
principal balance of the Revolving Credit Obligations exceeds
$52,000,000. The payment required under this clause (iv) with
respect to Revolving Loans shall be allocated and applied to the
Revolving Loans which are Base Rate Loans until paid in full and
then to Revolving Loans which are Eurodollar Rate Loans and shall
permanently reduce the respective Revolving Credit Commitments of
each Revolving Lender proportionately in accordance with its
Revolving Credit Pro Rata Share.

     (v)  Exceptions to Mandatory Prepayments; No Waiver or
Consent.  Notwithstanding the provisions of clauses (i) through
(iii) hereinabove, no mandatory prepayment need be made due to the
receipt of the first $2,000,000 in any Fiscal Year of Net Cash
Proceeds of Sale, Net Cash Proceeds of Issuance of Equity
Securities, and Net Cash Proceeds of Issuance of Indebtedness with
respect to sales or dispositions of assets, including, without
limitation, Capital Stock of a Person held by the selling or
disposing Person, or issuance of equity Securities or issuance of
debt Securities which is otherwise in compliance with the terms of
this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 4.01(b) shall be construed
to constitute the Lenders' consent to any transaction referenced in
clauses (i) and (iii) above which is not expressly permitted by
Article X.

     (vi)  Notice.  The Borrower shall give the Administrative
Agent prior written notice or telephonic notice promptly confirmed
in writing (each of which the Administrative Agent shall promptly
transmit to each Lender), when a Designated Prepayment will be made
(which date of prepayment shall be no later than the date on which
such Designated Payment becomes due and payable pursuant to this
Section 4.01(b)).

     (vii)  Application of Designated Prepayments.  Designated
Prepayments shall be allocated and applied to the Obligations as
follows:

     (A)  in the event both Term Loans and Revolving Loans are
outstanding as of the date a Designated Prepayment is required to
be made, the amount of such Designated Prepayment shall be applied
in equal amounts to the outstanding principal balances of the Term
Loans and Revolving Loans, with each application being made first
to the respective Term Loans and Revolving Loans which are Base
Rate Loans until paid in full and then to the respective Term Loans
and Revolving Loans which are Eurodollar Rate Loans until the
outstanding balance of the Revolving Loans is paid in full and the
respective Revolving Credit Commitments of each Revolving Lender
shall be permanently reduced by the amount of such Designated
Prepayment applied to its Revolving Loans until such time as the
Revolving Credit Commitments are reduced to $52,000,000; and

     (B)  following the payment in full of the Revolving Loans or
in the event there are no Revolving Loans outstanding as of the
date a Designated Prepayment is required to be made, the remaining
balance of (or entire amount of, in the event there are no
Revolving Loans outstanding as of such required payment date) each
Designated Prepayment shall be applied solely to the outstanding
balances of the Term Loans in the order described in clause (A)
above until paid in full.

     4.02.  Payments.  (a)  Manner and Time of Payment.  All
payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and
Reimbursement Obligations and other Obligations (including, without
limitation, fees and expenses) which are payable to the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any Issuing Bank shall be made
without condition, setoff, or reservation of right, and, with
respect to payments made other than from application of deposits in
a Concentration Account, in immediately available funds, delivered
to the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of Reimbursement
Obligations, to the pertinent Issuing Bank), not later than 11:00
a.m. (New York time) on the date and at the place due, to such
account of the Administrative Agent (or such Issuing Bank) as it
may designate; in each instance, for the account of the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case
may be. Funds received by the Administrative Agent, including,
without limitation, funds in respect of any Loans to be made on
that date, not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on any given
Business Day shall be credited against payment to be made that day
and funds received by the Administrative Agent after that time
shall be deemed to have been paid on the next succeeding Business
Day.  Payments actually received by the Administrative Agent for
the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, or any of them,
shall be paid to them by the Administrative Agent promptly after
receipt thereof.

     (b)  Pre-Default Apportionment of Payments. Subject to the
provisions of Section 4.01 and Section 4.02(f), all payments of
principal and interest in respect of outstanding Loans, all
payments in respect of Reimbursement Obligations, all payments of
fees and all other payments in respect of any other Obligations,
shall be allocated among such of the Lenders and Issuing Banks as
are entitled thereto, and, if Lenders, in proportion to their
respective Revolving Credit Pro Rata Shares or Term Loan Pro Rata
Shares, as applicable, or otherwise as provided herein.  Except as
provided in Section 4.02(c) with respect to payments and proceeds
of Collateral received after the occurrence of an Event of Default,
all other payments, proceeds of Collateral, and other amounts
received by the Administrative Agent from or for the benefit of the
Borrower shall be applied

     (i)  first, to pay principal of and interest on any portion of
the Loans which the Administrative Agent may have advanced on
behalf of any Lender (other than Citicorp if the Administrative
Agent is Citicorp) for which the Administrative Agent has not then
been reimbursed by such Lender or the applicable Borrower,

     (ii)  second, to pay principal of and interest on any
Protective Advance for which the Administrative Agent has not then
been paid by the Borrower or reimbursed by the Lenders,

     (iii) third, to pay the principal of the Loans then due and
payable in the order described hereinbelow and interest on such
Loans then due and payable, ratably, based on the then outstanding
balances of the such Loans,

     (iv)  fourth, to pay all other Obligations then due and
payable, ratably, and

     (v)  fifth, as the Borrower so designates.

All such principal and interest payments in respect of Loans shall
be applied first, to repay outstanding Base Rate Loans and then to
repay outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans with those Eurodollar Rate
Loans which have earlier expiring Eurodollar Interest Periods being
repaid prior to those which have later expiring Eurodollar Interest
Periods.

       (c) Post-Default Apportionment of Payments.  After the
occurrence of an Event of Default and while the same is continuing,
the Administrative Agent shall apply all payments in respect of any
Obligations and all proceeds of Collateral in the following order: 

     (i)first, to pay principal of and interest on any portion of
the Loans which the Administrative Agent may have advanced on
behalf of any Lender (other than Citicorp if the Administrative
Agent is Citicorp) for which the Administrative Agent has not then
been reimbursed by such Lender or the Borrower;

     (ii)  second, to pay principal of and interest on any
Protective Advance for which the Administrative Agent has not then
been paid by the Borrower or reimbursed by the Lenders;

     (iii)  third, to pay Obligations in respect of any fees,
expense reimbursements or indemnities then due to the
Administrative Agent; 

     (iv)  fourth, to pay Obligations in respect of any fees,
expense reimbursements or indemnities then due to the Lenders and
the Issuing Banks;

     (v)  fifth, to pay interest due in respect of the Loans,
ratably, in accordance with the Lenders' respective Revolving
Credit Pro Rata Shares and Term Loan Pro Rata Shares, as
applicable;

     (vi)  sixth, to the ratable payment or prepayment of principal
outstanding on all Loans, Hedge Agreements to which any of the
Lenders or any Affiliate of any of the Lenders is a party, and
principal of and interest on Letter of Credit Obligations (or, to
the extent Letter of Credit Obligations are contingent, deposited
in the Cash Collateral Account to provide Cash Collateral in
respect of such Obligations), in accordance with the Lender's
respective Revolving Credit Loan Pro Rata Shares and Term Loan Pro
Rata Shares, as applicable; and

     (vii)  seventh, to the ratable payment of all other
Obligations.

For purposes of clause (vi) above, Obligations with respect to
Hedge Agreements to which an Affiliate of a Lender is a party, such
Obligations shall be attributable to such Lender.

     (d)  Administrative Agent Authority to Apply Funds.  The
Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion subject only to the
terms of this Section 4.02(d), may pay from the proceeds of Loans
made to the Borrower hereunder, whether made following a request by
the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.02 or a deemed request as
provided in this Section 4.02(d), all amounts payable by the
Borrower hereunder, including, without limitation, amounts payable
with respect to payments of principal, interest, Reimbursement
Obligations and fees and all reimbursements for expenses pursuant
to Section 15.02.  The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the
Revolving Lenders to make Revolving Loans to it, which Revolving
Loans shall be Base Rate Loans upon notice from the Administrative
Agent as described in the following sentence for the purpose of
paying principal, interest, Reimbursement Obligations and fees due
from the Borrower, reimbursing expenses pursuant to Section 15.02
and paying any and all other amounts due and payable by the
Borrower hereunder or under the Notes, and agrees that all such
Loans so made shall be deemed to have been requested by it pursuant
to Section 2.02 as of the date of the aforementioned notice.  The
Administrative Agent shall request Loans on behalf of the Borrower
as described in the preceding sentence by notifying the Lenders by
telecopy, telegram or other similar form of transmission (which
notice the Administrative Agent shall thereafter promptly transmit
to the Borrower), of the amount and Funding Date of the proposed
Borrowing and that such Borrowing is being requested on the
Borrower's behalf pursuant to this Section 4.02(d).  On the
proposed Funding Date for such Loan, the Lenders shall make the
requested Loans in accordance with the procedures and subject to
the conditions specified in Section 2.02.

     (e)  Priorities and Distributions of Payments.  The orders of
priority set forth in Sections 4.02(b) and (c) and the related
provisions of this Agreement are set forth solely to determine the
rights and priorities of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the
Issuing Banks and other Holders as among themselves.  Subject to
Section 4.02(f), the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute
to each Lender and Issuing Bank at its primary address set forth on
the appropriate signature page hereof or the signature page to the
Assignment and Acceptance by which it became a Lender or Issuing
Bank, or at such other address as a Lender, an Issuing Bank or
other Holder may request in writing, such funds as such Person may
be entitled to receive, subject to the provisions of Article XIV; 
provided that the Administrative Agent shall under no circumstances
be bound to inquire into or determine the validity, scope or
priority of any interest or entitlement of any Holder and may
suspend all payments or seek appropriate relief (including, without
limitation, instructions from the Requisite Lenders or an action in
the nature of interpleader) in the event of any doubt or dispute as
to any apportionment or distribution contemplated hereby.  

     (f)  Defaulting Lenders.  In the event that any Lender fails
to fund its Revolving Credit Pro Rata Share of any Revolving Loan
or its Term Loan Pro Rata Share of any Term Loan requested by the
Borrower which such Lender is obligated to fund under the terms of
this Agreement (the funded portion of such Loan being hereinafter
referred to as a "Non Pro Rata Loan"), until the earlier of such
Lender's cure of such failure and the termination of the Revolving
Credit Commitments, the proceeds of all amounts thereafter repaid
to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower and otherwise required
to be applied to such Lender's share of all other Obligations
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be advanced to the
Borrower by the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Lender to
cure, in full or in part, such failure by such Lender, but shall
nevertheless be deemed to have been paid to such Lender in
satisfaction of such other Obligations.  Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary:

     (i)  the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.02(f) shall
apply only with respect to the proceeds of payments of Obligations
and shall not affect the conversion or continuation of Loans
pursuant to Section 5.01(c);

     (ii)  a Lender shall be deemed to have cured its failure to
fund its Revolving Credit Pro Rata Share or Term Loan Pro Rata
Share of any Loan at such time as an amount equal to such Lender's
original Revolving Credit Loan Pro Rata Share or Term Loan Pro Rata
Share of the requested principal portion of such Loan is fully
funded to the Borrower, whether made by such Lender itself or by
operation of the terms of this Section 4.02(f), and whether or not
the Non Pro Rata Loan with respect thereto has been repaid,
converted or continued;

     (iii)  amounts advanced to the Borrower to cure, in full or in
part, any such Lender's failure to fund its Revolving Loan Pro Rata
Share of any Revolving Loan ("Cure Loans") shall bear interest at
the rate in effect from time to time pursuant to Section 5.01 and
for all other purposes of this Agreement shall be treated as if
they were Base Rate Loans; and

     (iv)  regardless of whether or not an Event of Default has
occurred or is continuing, and notwithstanding the instructions of
the Borrower as to its desired application, all repayments of
principal which, in accordance with the other terms of this Section
4.02, would be applied to the outstanding Loans which are Base Rate
Loans shall be applied first, ratably to all such Base Rate Loans
constituting Non Pro Rata Loans, second, ratably to such Base Rate
Loans other than those constituting Non Pro Rata Loans or Cure
Loans and, third, ratably to such Base Rate Loans constituting Cure
Loans.

     (g)  Payments on Non-Business Days.  Whenever any payment to
be made by the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes is stated to
be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the payment shall
instead be due on the next succeeding Business Day (except as set
forth in Section 5.02(b)(iii) with respect to payments due on the
next preceding Business Day), and any such extension of time shall
be included in the computation of the payment of interest and fees
hereunder.

     4.03.  Promise to Repay; Evidence of Indebtedness.

     (a)  Promise to Repay.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay when
due the principal amount of each Loan which is made to it, and
further agrees to pay all unpaid interest accrued thereon, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Notes.  The
Borrower shall execute and deliver to each Lender on the Effective
Date promissory notes, in form and substance acceptable to the
Administrative Agent and such Lender, evidencing the Loans made
from time to time hereunder by such Lender and thereafter shall
execute and deliver such other promissory notes as are necessary to
evidence Loans owing to the Lenders after giving effect to any
assignment thereof pursuant to Section 15.01, all in form and
substance acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the parties to
such assignment.

     (b)     Loan Account.  Each Lender shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts (a "Loan
Account") evidencing the Indebtedness of the Borrower to such
Lender resulting from each Loan owing to such Lender from time to
time, including the amount of principal and interest payable and
paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder and under the
Notes.

     (c)     Control Account.  The Register maintained by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 15.01(c) shall include a
control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender, in which
accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and amount
of each Borrowing made hereunder, the type of Loan comprising such
Borrowing and any Eurodollar Interest Period applicable thereto,
(ii) the effective date and amount of each Assignment and
Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and the parties thereto,
(iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to
become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder
or under the Notes, and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the
Administrative Agent from the Borrower hereunder and each Lender's
share thereof. 

     (d)     Entries Binding.  The entries made in the Register and
each Loan Account shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

     4.04.  Proceeds of Collateral; Concentration Account
Arrangements.  (a)  Establishment.  The Borrower shall establish
and maintain, and shall cause the Guarantors to establish and
maintain, Collection Accounts into which all collections of
Receivables shall be deposited. All amounts deposited in Collection
Accounts established by the Borrower and the Domestic Subsidiaries
shall be promptly transferred directly to the Concentration Account
established at Citibank in New York, New York. The Borrower shall
cause all other proceeds of Collateral to be deposited in the
appropriate Concentration Account or pursuant to other similar
arrangements for the collection of such amounts established by the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent. All collections of
Receivables and other proceeds of Collateral which are received
directly by the Borrower or any Domestic Subsidiary shall be deemed
to have been received by the Borrower or such Domestic Subsidiary
as the Administrative Agent's trustee and, upon the Borrower's or
such Domestic Subsidiary's receipt thereof, the Borrower or such
Domestic Subsidiary shall immediately transfer, or cause to be
transferred, all such amounts into the appropriate Concentration
Account in their original form. All collections of Receivables, all
payments, and all proceeds of other Collateral received by the
Administrative Agent, whether through payment, deposit in a
Concentration Account as described above, or otherwise, will be
deemed received by the Administrative Agent, will be the sole
property of the Administrative Agent, and will be held by the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Holders (i) for
application to the Obligations pursuant to Section 4.02 and (ii)
thereafter, as Cash Collateral for the Obligations, subject to the
rights of the Borrower set forth in Section 4.04(b) and the rights
of the Administrative Agent set forth in Section 4.06.

     (b)  Pre-Default Withdrawals from Concentration Account.  If
requested by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall, so long
as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or
unwaived, from time to time, (i) apply funds in the Concentration
Accounts promptly after deposit therein to payment of the Loans and
to payment of other Obligations of the Borrower as they become due
and payable, (ii) after giving effect to the aforesaid payments,
invest funds on deposit in the Concentration Accounts and accrued
interest thereon, reinvest proceeds of any such investments which
may mature or be sold, and invest interest or other income received
from such investments, in such Cash Equivalents as the Borrower may
select, and (iii) upon the Borrower's request therefor after giving
effect to the payments described in clause (i) above, transfer
funds on deposit in the Concentration Accounts to Borrower' or
their Subsidiaries' designated accounts. Such funds, interest,
proceeds, or income which are not so disbursed, invested or
reinvested shall be deposited and held in the Concentration Account
for the benefit of the Holders as provided in Section 4.04(a). None
of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank shall
be liable to the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower for, or
with respect to, any decline in value of amounts on deposit in the
Concentration Accounts which shall have been invested pursuant to
this Section 4.04(b). Cash Equivalents from time to time purchased
and held pursuant to this Section 4.04(b) shall constitute Cash
Collateral and shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be deemed to
be part of the funds held in the respective Concentration Accounts
in amounts equal to their respective outstanding principal amounts.

     (c)  Reasonable Care.  The Administrative Agent shall exercise
reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any funds held
in the Concentration Accounts and shall be deemed to have exercised
such care if such funds are accorded treatment substantially
equivalent to that which the Administrative Agent accords its own
like property, it being understood that the Administrative Agent
shall not have any responsibility for taking any steps necessary to
preserve rights against any parties with respect to any such funds
but may do so at its option. All reasonable expenses incurred in
connection therewith shall be for the sole account of the Borrower
and shall constitute Obligations hereunder.

     4.05.  Cash Collateral Account.  (a)  Investments.  If
requested by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall, so long
as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, from
time to time invest funds on deposit in the Cash Collateral Account
and accrued interest thereon, reinvest proceeds of any such
investments which may mature or be sold, and invest interest or
other income received from any such Investments, in each case in
such Cash Equivalents as the Borrower may select; provided,
however, that such accrued interest and other income received from
any such Investments, upon the request of the Borrower, shall be
remitted to the Borrower.  Such funds, interest, proceeds or income
which are not so invested or reinvested in Cash Equivalents shall,
except as otherwise provided above or in Section 4.05(b) and
Section 4.06, be deposited and held by the Administrative Agent in
the Cash Collateral Account.  None of the Administrative Agent, any
Lender or any Issuing Bank shall be liable to the Borrower for, or
with respect to, any decline in value of amounts on deposit in the
Cash Collateral Account which shall have been invested pursuant to
this Section 4.05(a) at the direction of the Borrower.  Cash
Equivalents from time to time purchased and held pursuant to this
Section 4.05(a) shall constitute Cash Collateral and shall, for
purposes of this Agreement, be deemed to be part of the funds held
in the Cash Collateral Account in amounts equal to their respective
outstanding principal amounts.

     (b)  Withdrawal Rights.  Neither the Borrower nor any Person
or entity claiming on behalf of or through the Borrower shall have
any right to withdraw any of the funds held in the Cash Collateral
Account, except that, upon the later to occur of (i) the expiration
or termination of all of the Letters of Credit in accordance with
their respective terms and (ii) the payment in full in cash of the
Obligations, any funds remaining in the Cash Collateral Account
shall be returned by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower or
paid to whomever may be legally entitled thereto.

     (c)  Additional Deposits.  If at any time the Administrative
Agent determines that any funds held in the Cash Collateral Account
are subject to any interest, right, claim or Lien of any Person
other than the Administrative Agent, the Borrower will, forthwith
upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative
Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the Cash
Collateral Account, an amount equal to the amount of funds subject
to such interest, right, claim or Lien.

     (d)  Reasonable Care.  The Administrative Agent shall exercise
reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any funds held
in the Cash Collateral Account and shall be deemed to have
exercised such care if such funds are accorded treatment
substantially equivalent to that which the Administrative Agent
accords its own like property, it being understood that the
Administrative Agent shall not have any responsibility for taking
any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with
respect to any such funds but may do so at its option.  All
expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be for the sole
account of the Borrower and shall constitute Obligations hereunder.

     (e)  Foreign Exchange Requirements. In the event deposits have
been made to the Cash Collateral Account to secure Letter of Credit
Obligations denominated in a non-U.S. currency, the Borrower shall
enter into a Hedge Agreement for a forward foreign exchange
contract reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent to
protect against fluctuation in the Exchange Rate for the amount of
such Letter of Credit Obligations until the same are paid in full. 
   

     4.06.  Post-Default Withdrawals from the Concentration Account
and Cash Collateral Account.  Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, from and after (a) the occurrence of an Event of
Default described in Section 12.01(a) and for so long as the same
is continuing unwaived or (b) the occurrence of any other Event of
Default and the Administrative Agent's receipt of written notice
from the Requisite Lenders that no further withdrawals may be made
from the Concentration Accounts other than for application on the
Obligations for so long as the same is continuing unwaived, neither
the Borrower nor any other Person or entity claiming on behalf of
or through the Borrower shall have any right to withdraw any of the
funds held in a Concentration Account. The Administrative Agent
may, at any time during the period clause (a) or clause (b) above
is applicable, sell or cause to be sold any Cash Equivalents being
held by the Administrative Agent in the Concentration Accounts or
as Cash Collateral at any broker's board or at public or private
sale, in one or more sales or lots, at such price as the
Administrative Agent may deem best, without assumption of any
credit risk, and the purchaser of any or all such Cash Equivalents
so sold shall thereafter own the same, absolutely free from any
claim, encumbrance or right of any kind whatsoever. The
Administrative Agent or any Holder may, in its own name or in the
name of a designee or nominee, buy such Cash Equivalents at any
public sale and, if permitted by applicable law, buy such Cash
Equivalents at any private sale. The Administrative Agent shall
apply the proceeds of any such sale, net of any reasonable expenses
incurred in connection therewith, and any other funds deposited in
the Concentration Accounts or Cash Collateral Account to the
payment of the Obligations in accordance with Section 4.02(c),
other than amounts which are being held as Cash Collateral for
Reimbursement Obligations, which shall be applied to such
Reimbursement Obligations without regard to Section 4.02(c). The
Borrower agrees that any sale of Cash Equivalents conducted in
conformity with reasonable commercial practices of banks,
commercial finance companies, insurance companies or other
financial institutions disposing of property similar to such Cash
Equivalents shall be deemed to be commercially reasonable and any
requirements of reasonable notice shall be met if such notice is
given by the Administrative Agent within a commercially reasonable
time prior to such disposition, the time of delivery of which
notice the parties hereto agree shall in no event be required to be
greater than five (5) Business Days before the date of the intended
sale or disposition. Any other requirement of notice, demand or
advertisement for sale is waived to the extent permitted by law.
The Administrative Agent may adjourn any public or private sale
from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed
therefor and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the
time and place to which it was so adjourned.

                             ARTICLE V
                        INTEREST AND FEES

     5.01.  Interest on the Loans and other Obligations.  (a)  Rate
of Interest.  (i) All Loans and the outstanding principal balance
of all other Obligations shall bear interest on the unpaid
principal amount thereof from the date such Loans are made and such
other Obligations are incurred until paid in full, except as
otherwise provided in Section 5.01(d) or Section 14.04, as follows:

     (A)     If a Base Rate Loan or such other Obligation, at a
rate per annum equal to the sum of (1) the Base Rate, as in effect
from time to time as interest accrues plus (2) the Base Rate
Margin; and

     (B)     If a Eurodollar Rate Loan, at a rate per annum equal
to the sum of (1) the applicable Eurodollar Rate determined for
such Eurodollar Rate Loan for the applicable Eurodollar Interest
Period, plus (2) the Eurodollar Rate Margin.

     (ii)  The applicable basis for determining the rate of
interest on the Loans shall be selected by the Borrower at the time
a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation is
delivered by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent; provided,
however, the Borrower may not select a Eurodollar Rate as the
applicable basis for determining the rate of interest on such a
Loan if (A) such Loan is to be made on the Effective Date or (B) at
the time of such selection an Event of Default or a Potential Event
of Default would occur or has occurred and is continuing.  If on
any day any Loan is outstanding with respect to which notice has
not been timely delivered to the Administrative Agent in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement specifying the basis for
determining the rate of interest on that day, then for that day
interest on that Loan shall be determined by reference to clause
(i)(A) above.

     (b)  Interest Payments.  (i)  Interest accrued on each Base
Rate Loan shall be payable in arrears (A) on the first Business Day
of each calendar quarter, commencing with the calendar quarter
following the calendar quarter in which such Loan was made and (B)
if not theretofore paid in full, at maturity (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) of such Base Rate Loan.

     (ii)  Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be
payable in arrears (A) on each Eurodollar Interest Payment Date
applicable to such Loan, (B) upon the payment or prepayment thereof
in full or in part, and (C) if not theretofore paid in full, at
maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) of such Eurodollar
Rate Loan.

     (iii)  Interest accrued on the principal balance of all other
Obligations shall be payable in arrears (A) on the first day of
each calendar quarter, commencing with the calendar quarter
following the calendar quarter in which such Obligation was
incurred, (B) upon repayment thereof in full or in part, and (C) if
not theretofore paid in full, at the time such other Obligation
becomes due and payable (whether by acceleration or otherwise).

     (c)  Conversion or Continuation.  (i) The Borrower shall have
the option (A) to convert at any time all or any part of
outstanding Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans; (B) to
convert all or any part of outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans having
Eurodollar Interest Periods which expire on the same date to Base
Rate Loans on such expiration date; or (C) to continue all or any
part of outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans having Eurodollar
Interest Periods which expire on the same date as Eurodollar Rate
Loans, and the succeeding Eurodollar Interest Period of such
continued Loans shall commence on such expiration date; provided,
however, no such outstanding Loan may be continued as, or be
converted into, a Eurodollar Rate Loan (i) if such continuation of,
or conversion into, would violate any of the provisions of Section
5.02 or (ii) if an Event of Default or a Potential Event of Default
would occur or has occurred and is continuing.  Any conversion into
or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans under this Section 5.01(c)
shall be in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 and in integral
multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount except in the case
of a conversion into or a continuation of an entire Borrowing of
Non Pro Rata Loans.

     (ii)  To convert or continue a Loan under Section 5.01(c)(i),
the Borrower shall deliver a Notice of Conversion/Continuation to
the Administrative Agent no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time)
at least three (3) Business Days in advance of the proposed
conversion/continuation date.  A Notice of Conversion/Continuation
shall specify (A) the proposed conversion/continuation date (which
shall be a Business Day), (B) the aggregate principal amount of the
respective Loans to be converted/continued, (C) whether such Loans
shall be converted and/or continued, and (D) in the case of a
conversion to, or continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the
requested Eurodollar Interest Period.  In lieu of delivering a
Notice of Conversion/Continuation, the Borrower may give the
Administrative Agent telephonic notice of any proposed
conversion/continuation by the time required under this Section
5.01(c)(ii), and such notice shall be confirmed in writing
delivered to the Administrative Agent by facsimile transmission
promptly (but in no event later than 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on
the same day), the original of which facsimile copy shall be
delivered to the Administrative Agent within three (3) days after
the date of such transmission.  Promptly after receipt of a Notice
of Conversion/Continuation under this Section 5.01(c)(ii) (or
telephonic notice in lieu thereof), the Administrative Agent shall
notify each applicable Lender, by telecopy or other similar form of
transmission, of the proposed conversion/continuation.  Any Notice
of Conversion/Continuation for conversion to, or continuation of,
a Loan (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof) shall be irrevocable,
and the Borrower shall be bound to convert or continue in
accordance therewith.

     (d)  Default Interest.  Notwithstanding the rates of interest
specified in Section 5.01(a), effective immediately upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default (except an Event of Default
resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Administrative Agent) and for as long thereafter as such Event of
Default shall be continuing unwaived, the principal balance of all
Obligations, including, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
accrued interest unpaid when due, shall bear interest, payable on
demand, at a rate which is two percent (2.0%) per annum in excess
of the rate of interest specified in Section 5.01(a)(i).

     (e)  Computation of Interest.  Interest on all Obligations
shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
in the period during which interest accrues and a year of 360 days. 
In computing interest on any Loan, the date of the making of the
Loan or the first day of a Eurodollar Interest Period, as the case
may be, shall be included and the date of payment or the expiration
date of a Eurodollar Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be
excluded; provided, however, if a Loan is repaid on the same day on
which it is made, one (1) day's interest shall be paid on such
Loan.

     5.02.  Special Provisions Governing Eurodollar Rate Loans. 
With respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans:

     (a)  Amount of Eurodollar Rate Loans.  Each Borrowing of
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be for a minimum amount of $1,000,000
and in integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount.

     (b)  Determination of Eurodollar Interest Period.  By giving
notice as set forth in Section 2.02(b) (with respect to a Borrowing
of Eurodollar Rate Loans) or Section 5.01(c) (with respect to a
conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans), the
Borrower shall have the option, subject to the other provisions of
this Section 5.02, to select an interest period (each, a
"Eurodollar Interest Period") to apply to the Loans described in
such notice, subject to the following provisions: 

     (i)  The Borrower may only select, as to a particular
Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans, a Eurodollar Interest Period of
one, two, three or six months in duration (or such intermediate
periods to which the Lenders may agree in their sole discretion,
provided that, for purposes of determining the interest rate with
respect to such intermediate periods, such periods shall be rounded
up to the next nearest period of full months);

     (ii)  In the case of immediately successive Eurodollar
Interest Periods applicable to a Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate
Loans, each successive Eurodollar Interest Period shall commence on
the day on which the next preceding Eurodollar Interest Period
expires;

     (iii)  If any Eurodollar Interest Period would otherwise
expire on a day which is not a Business Day, such Eurodollar
Interest Period shall be extended to expire on the next succeeding
Business Day if the next succeeding Business Day occurs in the same
calendar month, and if there will be no succeeding Business Day in
such calendar month, the Eurodollar Interest Period shall expire on
the immediately preceding Business Day;

     (iv)  The Borrower may not select a Eurodollar Interest Period
as to any Loan if such Eurodollar Interest Period terminates later
than the scheduled Revolving Credit Termination Date; and

     (v)  There shall be no more than six (6) Eurodollar Interest
Periods in effect at any one time.

     (c)  Determination of Interest Rate.  As soon as practicable
on the second Business Day prior to the first day of each
Eurodollar Interest Period (the "Eurodollar Interest Rate
Determination Date"), the Administrative Agent shall determine
(pursuant to the procedures set forth in the definition of
"Eurodollar Rate") the interest rate which shall apply to the
Eurodollar Rate Loans for which an interest rate is then being
determined for the applicable Eurodollar Interest Period and shall
promptly give notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed
in writing) to the Borrower and to each Lender.  The Administrative
Agent's determination shall be presumed to be correct, absent
manifest error, and shall be binding upon the Borrower.  

     (d)     Interest Rate Unascertainable, Inadequate or Unfair. 
In the event that at least one (1) Business Day before the
Eurodollar Interest Rate Determination Date:

     (i)     the Administrative Agent is advised by Citibank that
deposits in Dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being
offered by Citibank in the London interbank market for such
Eurodollar Interest Period; or

     (ii)     the Administrative Agent determines that adequate and
fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest
rates by reference to which the Eurodollar Rate then being
determined is to be fixed; or

     (iii)  the Requisite Lenders advise the Administrative Agent
that the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar Rate Loans comprising such
Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such Requisite
Lenders of obtaining funds in Dollars in the London interbank
market in the amount substantially equal to such Lenders'
Eurodollar Rate Loans and for a period equal to such Eurodollar
Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof
to the Borrower, whereupon (until the Administrative Agent notifies
the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension
no longer exist) the right of the Borrower to elect to have Loans
bear interest based upon the Eurodollar Rate shall be suspended and
each outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be converted into a
Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then current Eurodollar
Interest Period therefor, notwithstanding any prior election by the
Borrower to the contrary.  

     (e)  Booking of Eurodollar Rate Loans.  Any Lender may make,
carry or transfer Eurodollar Rate Loans at, to, or for the account
of, its Eurodollar Lending Office or Eurodollar Affiliate or its
other offices or Affiliates.  No Lender shall be entitled, however,
to receive any greater amount under Article XIV as a result of the
transfer of any such Eurodollar Rate Loan to any office (other than
such Eurodollar Lending Office) or any Affiliate (other than such
Eurodollar Affiliate) than such Lender would have been entitled to
receive immediately prior thereto, unless (i) the transfer occurred
at a time when circumstances giving rise to the claim for such
greater amount did not exist and (ii) such claim would have arisen
even if such transfer had not occurred.

     (f)     Affiliates Not Obligated.  No Eurodollar Affiliate or
other Affiliate of any Lender shall be deemed a party to this
Agreement or shall have any liability or obligation under this
Agreement.

     5.03.  Fees.  (a)  Administrative Agent's Fee.  The Borrower
shall pay to the Administrative Agent, solely for the account of
the Administrative Agent, the fee provided in the Fee Letter as and
when set forth therein during the term of this Agreement.

     (b)  Fronting Fee and Letter of Credit Fee.  In addition to
any charges paid pursuant to Section 3.01(g), the Borrower shall
pay (i) to the Issuing Bank, a fee accruing at the rate of
one quarter of one percent (0.25%) on the undrawn face amount of
each outstanding Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank (the
"Fronting Fee") and (ii) to the Administrative Agent, for the
account of the Revolving Lenders based on their respective
Revolving Credit Pro Rata Shares, a fee (the "Letter of Credit
Fee") accruing at a per annum rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate
Margin on the undrawn face amount of each outstanding Letter of
Credit, which Fronting Fee and Letter of Credit Fee shall be
payable quarterly, in arrears, on the first day of each calendar
quarter and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date; provided,
however, that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the rate
at which the Letter of Credit Fee shall accrue and be payable shall
be equal to two percent (2.0%) per annum plus the Eurodollar Rate
Margin.

     (c)  Commitment Fee.  (i) The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Revolving Lenders in
accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Pro Rata Shares,
a fee (the "Commitment Fee"), accruing at the rate of one-half of
one percent (0.50%) per annum on the average amount by which the
Revolving Credit Commitments exceed the sum of the Revolving Credit
Obligations, such Commitment Fee being payable quarterly, in
arrears, commencing on the first day of the calendar quarter next
succeeding the Effective Date and on the Revolving Credit
Termination Date.

     (ii)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any
Lender fails to fund its Revolving Credit Pro Rata Share of any
Revolving Loan which such Lender is obligated to fund under the
terms of this Agreement, (A) such Lender shall not be entitled to
any Commitment Fee with respect to its Revolving Credit Commitment
until such failure has been cured in accordance with Section
4.02(f)(ii) and (B) until such time, the Commitment Fee shall
accrue in favor of the Lenders which have funded their respective
Revolving Credit Pro Rata Shares of such requested Revolving Loan,
shall be allocated among such performing Lenders ratably based upon
their respective Revolving Credit Commitments, and shall be
calculated based upon the average amount by which the aggregate of
such Revolving Credit Commitments of such performing Lenders
exceeds the sum of (1) the Revolving Credit Obligations owing to
such performing Lenders, plus (2) the aggregate participation
interests of such performing Lenders arising pursuant to Section
3.01(e) with respect to undrawn and outstanding Letters of Credit.

     (d)  Contingent Fee.  The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent on June 30, 1998, for the account of the
Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, a fee
(the "Contingent Fee") in an amount equal to $3,000,000 in the
event the Borrower has failed, by June 30, 1998, to commence, in a
manner and to an extent reasonably acceptable to the Administrative
Agent and either the Syndication Agent or the Documentation Agent,
a transaction acceptable to the Administrative Agent and either the
Syndication Agent or Documentation Agent, consisting of a
combination of asset sales and capital raising initiatives the
proceeds of which, in the aggregate, will enable the Borrower, on
or before December 31, 1998, to repay the Term Loans in full and
reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments to a maximum of
$52,000,000. In the event either of NationsBank or Salomon Brothers
Holding Company Inc is not a Lender on June 30, 1998, the aforesaid
determinations shall be made by the Administrative Agent and either
the Syndication Agent or Documentation Agent which is, or whose
Affiliate is, then a Lender and, if neither NationsBank nor Salomon
Brothers Holding Company Inc is a Lender on June 30, 1998, the
aforesaid determinations shall be made by the Administrative Agent. 


     (e)  Calculation and Payment of Fees.  The Commitment Fee,
Fronting Fee, and Letter of Credit Fee shall be calculated on the
basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a 360-day year.  All
such fees and the Contingent Fee shall be payable in addition to,
and not in lieu of, interest, compensation, expense reimbursements,
indemnification and other Obligations payable under this Agreement,
to the Administrative Agent at its office in New York, New York in
immediately available funds.  All such fees and the Contingent Fee
shall be fully earned and nonrefundable when paid.  All fees
specified or referred to in this Agreement due to the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, including,
without limitation, those referred to in this Section 5.03, shall
bear interest, if not paid when due, at the interest rate for Base
Rate Loans set forth in Section 5.01(d), shall constitute
Obligations and shall be secured by all of the Collateral in which
Liens are granted by the Borrower and Domestic Subsidiaries.

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     7.01.  Representations and Warranties of the Borrower and RHI. 
In order to induce the Lenders and the Issuing Banks to enter into
this Agreement and to make the Loans and the other financial
accommodations to the Borrower and to issue the Letters of Credit
described herein, RHI and the Borrower hereby represent and warrant
to each Lender, each Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent that
the following statements are true, correct and complete:

     (a)  Organization; Corporate Powers.  (i) RHI, the Borrower
and each Subsidiary of the Borrower (A) is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction of its organization, (B) is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the
laws of each jurisdiction in which failure to be so qualified and
in good standing will have or is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect, and (C) has all requisite corporate power
and authority to own, operate and encumber its Property and to
conduct its business as presently conducted and as proposed to be
conducted in connection with and following the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. RHI, the Borrower and
each Subsidiary of the Borrower which is a Domestic Subsidiary has
filed and maintained effective (unless exempt from the requirements
for filing) a current Business Activity Report with the appropriate
Governmental Authority in the states of Minnesota and New Jersey.

     (ii)  True, correct and complete copies of the Organizational
Documents identified on Schedule 7.01 A attached hereto have been
delivered to the Administrative Agent, each of which is in full
force and effect, has not been modified or amended except to the
extent indicated therein and, to the best of the Borrower's
knowledge, there are no defaults under such Organizational
Documents and no events which, with the passage of time or giving
of notice or both, would constitute a default under such
Organizational Documents.

     (b)  Authority.  (i)  RHI, the Borrower and each Subsidiary of
the Borrower has the requisite corporate power and authority (A) to
execute, deliver and perform each of the Loan Documents which have
been executed by it as required by this Agreement on or prior to
the Effective Date and (B) to file or record the Loan Documents
which have been filed or recorded by it with any Governmental
Authority as required by this Agreement on or prior to the
Effective Date.

     (ii)  The execution, delivery, performance and filing or
recording, as the case may be, of each of the Loan Documents which
have been executed, filed or recorded as required by this Agreement
on or prior to the Effective Date and to which RHI, the Borrower or
any Subsidiary of the Borrower is party and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, have been duly approved by the
respective boards of directors (or substantially similar governance
bodies, as applicable) and, if necessary, the shareholders of such
Person and such approvals have not been rescinded.  No other
corporate action or proceedings on the part of RHI, the Borrower or
any Subsidiary of the Borrower is necessary to consummate such
transactions.

     (iii)  Each of the Loan Documents to which RHI, the Borrower
or any Subsidiary of the Borrower is a party (A) has been duly
executed, delivered, filed or recorded, as the case may be, by it,
(B) where applicable, creates valid and perfected first Liens in
the Collateral covered thereby securing the payment of all of the
Obligations purported to be secured thereby, (C) constitutes such
Person's respective legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, and (D) is in
full force and effect and no material term or condition thereof has
been amended, modified or waived from the terms and conditions
contained therein as delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant
to Section 6.01(a) without the prior written consent of the
Requisite Lenders. All parties to the Loan Documents have performed
and complied with all the terms, provisions, agreements and
conditions set forth therein and required to be performed or
complied with by such parties on or before the Effective Date, all
filings and recordings and other actions which are necessary or
desirable to perfect and protect the Liens granted pursuant to the
Loan Documents and preserve their required priority have been duly
taken, and no Potential Event of Default, Event of Default or
breach of any covenant by any such party exists thereunder.

     (c)  Subsidiaries; Ownership of Equity Securities.  Schedule
7.01 C attached hereto and as the same may be amended from time to
time (i) contains a diagram indicating the corporate structure of
RHI, the Borrower, their respective Subsidiaries and any other
Person in which RHI, the Borrower or any of their respective
Subsidiaries holds a direct or indirect partnership, joint venture
or other equity interest and indicates the nature of such interest
with respect to each Person included in such diagram; and (ii)
accurately sets forth (A) the correct legal name of such Person,
the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and the
jurisdictions in which it is qualified to transact business as a
foreign corporation or otherwise and (B) the authorized, issued and
outstanding shares or interests of each class of equity Securities
of RHI, the Borrower and each of their respective Subsidiaries and
the owners of such shares or interests.  None of such issued and
outstanding equity Securities is subject to any vesting,
redemption, or repurchase agreement, and there are no warrants,
puts, or options (other than Permitted Equity Securities Options)
outstanding with respect to such equity Securities other than as
disclosed on Schedule 7.01-C as attached hereto or amended from
time to time.  The outstanding equity Securities of RHI, the
Borrower and each of their respective Subsidiaries are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable free and
clear of any Liens, except for the Liens granted pursuant to the
Loan Documents, and are not Margin Stock except as specifically
identified on Schedule 7.01-C.

     (d)  No Conflict.  The execution, delivery and performance of
each of the Loan Documents to which RHI, the Borrower or any
Subsidiary of RHI or the Borrower is a party do not and will not
(i) conflict with the Organizational Documents of such Person, (ii)
constitute a tortious interference with any Contractual Obligation
of any Person or conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute
(with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default under
any Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation of such Person, or
require termination of any Contractual Obligation, the consequences
of which violation, breach, default or termination, singly or in
the aggregate, will, or is reasonably likely to, result in a
Material Adverse Effect or may subject the Administrative Agent,
any of the Lenders or any of the Issuing Banks to any liability,
(iii) result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien
whatsoever upon any of the Property or assets of such Person, other
than Liens contemplated by the Loan Documents, or (iv) require any
approval of such Person's shareholders, which has not been
obtained.

     (e)  Governmental Consents.  The execution, delivery and
performance of each of the Loan Documents to which RHI, the
Borrower or any Subsidiary of RHI or the Borrower is a party do not
and will not require any registration with, consent or approval of,
or notice to, or other action to, with or by any Governmental
Authority, except (i) filings, consents or notices which have been
made, obtained or given and (ii) filings necessary to create or
perfect the Administrative Agent's security interests in the
Collateral.

     (f)  Governmental Regulation.  Neither RHI nor the Borrower,
nor any Subsidiary of RHI or the Borrower, is subject to regulation
under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal
Power Act, the Interstate Commerce Act, or the Investment Company
Act of 1940, or any other federal or state statute or regulation or
other Requirement of Law which limits its ability to incur
indebtedness or its ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Loan Documents.

     (g)  Restricted Junior Payments.  The Borrower has not
directly or indirectly declared, ordered, paid or made or set apart
any sum or Property for any Restricted Junior Payment or agreed to
do so, except as permitted pursuant to Section 10.06.

     (h)  Intentionally omitted.

     (i)  Pro Forma Financials.  The Pro Forma Balance Sheet,
copies of which have been furnished to the Lenders on the Effective
Date, fairly presents on a pro forma basis the financial condition
of the Operating Units as of the date designated therein.  The
Projections and the assumptions expressed in the Pro Forma Balance
Sheet are reasonable based on the information available to the
Borrower at the time so furnished.

     (j)  Indebtedness.  Schedule 1.01.9 attached hereto or as
amended from time to time sets forth all Indebtedness for borrowed
money of RHI, the Borrower and the Borrower's Subsidiaries and
there are no defaults in the payment of principal or interest on
any such Indebtedness and no payments thereunder have been deferred
or extended beyond their stated maturity (except as disclosed on
such Schedule).

     (k)     Litigation; Adverse Effects.  Except as set forth in
Schedule 7.01-K attached hereto, there is no action, suit,
proceeding, Claim, investigation or arbitration before or by any
Governmental Authority or private arbitrator pending or, to the
knowledge of RHI, the Borrower or any of the Borrower's
Subsidiaries, threatened against VSI or FII (with respect to which
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may have successor
liability), TFC, RHI, the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the
Borrower or any of the Property (i) challenging the validity or the
enforceability of any of the Loan Documents, (ii) which will, or is
reasonably likely to, result in any Material Adverse Effect, or
(iii) under the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act or any similar federal or state statute where such Person is a
defendant in a criminal indictment that provides for the forfeiture
of assets to any Governmental Authority as a criminal penalty. 
There is no material loss contingency within the meaning of GAAP
which has not been reflected in the Pro Forma Balance Sheet or,
after the Effective Date, the consolidated Financial Statements of
RHI or the Borrower.  None of TFC, RHI, the Borrower or any
Subsidiary of the Borrower is (A) in violation of any applicable
Requirements of Law which violation will result, or is reasonably
likely to result, in a Material Adverse Effect, or (B) subject to
or in default with respect to any final judgment, writ, injunction,
restraining order or order of any nature, decree, rule or
regulation of any court or Governmental Authority which will, or is
reasonably likely to, result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     (l)  No Material Adverse Effect.  Since June 30, 1996, there
has occurred no event with respect to the Borrower or any Affiliate
of the Borrower which has resulted, or is reasonably likely to
result, in a Material Adverse Effect.

     (m)     Tax Examinations.  The IRS has examined (or is
foreclosed from examining by applicable statutes) the consolidated
federal income tax returns of TFC for all tax periods prior to and
including the taxable year ending June 30, 1993.  All deficiencies
which have been asserted against RHI, the Borrower or any of the
Borrower's Subsidiaries as a result of any federal, state, local or
foreign tax examination for each taxable year in respect of which
an examination has been conducted have been fully paid or finally
settled or are being contested in good faith, and no issue has been
raised in any such examination which, by application of similar
principles, reasonably can be expected to result in assertion of a
material deficiency for any other year not so examined which has
not been reserved for in the Borrower's consolidated Financial
Statements heretofore delivered to the Administrative Agent to the
extent, if any, required by GAAP.  None of RHI, the Borrower or any
Subsidiary of the Borrower has taken any reporting positions for
which it does not have a reasonable basis and does not anticipate
any further material adverse tax liability with respect to the
years which have not been closed pursuant to applicable law and
which are not reserved in the Financial Statements described above
or the Financial Statements of RHI, as applicable.

     (n)  Payment of Taxes.  All tax returns and reports of each of
TFC, RHI, the Borrower and their Subsidiaries (or the respective
predecessors in interest of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries)
required to be filed have been timely filed, and all taxes,
assessments, fees and other charges of Governmental Authorities
thereupon and upon or relating to their respective Property,
assets, income and franchises which are shown in such returns or
reports to be due and payable have been paid, except to the extent
(i) such taxes, assessments, fees and other charges are being
contested in good faith by an appropriate proceeding diligently
pursued as permitted by the terms of Section 9.04 and (ii) non-
payment of the amounts thereof would not, individually or in the
aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither RHI nor
the Borrower has any knowledge of any proposed tax assessment
against TFC, RHI, the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower
(or the respective predecessors in interest of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries) that will, or is reasonably likely to, result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

     (o)  Performance.  None of RHI, the Borrower, any Subsidiary
of the Borrower, or any predecessor in interest of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries, has received any notice, citation, or
allegation, nor has actual knowledge, that (i) it is in default in
the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the
obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any Contractual
Obligation applicable to it, (ii) any Property of RHI, the Borrower
or any Subsidiary of the Borrower is in violation of any
Requirement of Law, or (iii) any condition exists which, with the
giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default with respect to any such Contractual Obligation, in each
case, except where such default or defaults, if any, will not, or
is not reasonably likely to, result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     (p)  Disclosure.  The representations and warranties of RHI,
the Borrower and the Borrower's Subsidiaries contained in the Loan
Documents, and all certificates and other documents delivered to
the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms thereof, do not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
herein or therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.  Neither RHI nor the Borrower has
intentionally withheld any fact from the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Banks or the Lenders in regard to any matter which will, or
is reasonably likely to, result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     (q)  Requirements of Law.  RHI, the Borrower and each
Subsidiary of the Borrower, respectively, is in compliance with all
Requirements of Law applicable to it and its respective businesses,
in each case where the failure to so comply individually or in the
aggregate will, or is reasonably likely to, result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

     (r)  Environmental Matters.  (i) Except as disclosed on
Schedule 7.01-R attached hereto:

     (A) neither the Borrower nor any Domestic Subsidiary (or any
of their respective predecessors in interest) has received any
unresolved notice from any federal, state or local agency to the
effect that its operations are not in compliance with any
applicable Environmental, Health or Safety Requirements of Law or
the subject of any federal or state investigation evaluating
whether any remedial action is needed to respond to a Release of a
Contaminant into the environment;

     (B) to the knowledge of the Borrower, none of the Borrower,
the Domestic Subsidiaries (or any of their respective predecessors
in interest), or any of its their respective present or past
Property or operations, are subject to or the subject of any
judicial or administrative proceeding, order, judgment, decree,
dispute, negotiations, agreement, or settlement respecting (I) any
Environmental, Health or Safety Requirements of Law, (II) any
Remedial Action, (III) any Claims or Liabilities and Costs arising
from the Release or threatened Release of a Contaminant into the
environment, or (IV) any violation of or liability under any
Environmental, Health or Safety Requirement of Law that the
Borrower or Domestic Subsidiaries reasonably believe will result in
a material expenditure of money;

     (C)  none of the Borrower, any Domestic Subsidiary, or any of
their respective predecessors in interest has filed any notice
under any applicable Requirement of Law (I) reporting a Release of
a Contaminant where remedial action has not been conducted to the
satisfaction of the appropriate Governmental Authority; or (II)
reporting a violation of any applicable Environmental, Health or
Safety Requirement of Law where such violation has not been
corrected to the satisfaction of the appropriate Governmental
Authority;  

     (D)  none of the Borrower's or the Domestic Subsidiaries'
present or past Property is listed or, to the knowledge of the
Borrower, proposed for listing on the National Priorities List
("NPL") pursuant to CERCLA or on the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation Liability Information System List ("CERCLIS")
or any similar state list of sites requiring Remedial Action; 

     (E)  to the knowledge of the Borrower, neither the Borrower
nor any Domestic Subsidiary has any material contingent liability
in connection with any Release or threatened Release of any
Contaminants into the environment; and

     (F)  no Environmental Lien has attached to any Property.


     (ii)  the Borrower and each Domestic Subsidiary are conducting
and will continue to conduct their respective business and
operations in an environmentally responsible manner in material
compliance with Environmental, Health or Safety Requirements of
Law, and the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, have
not been, and have no reason to believe that they will be, subject
to Liabilities and Costs arising out of or relating to
environmental, health or safety matters that have or will result in
material cash expenditures by the Borrower and the Domestic
Subsidiaries in the aggregate for the Fiscal Year ending June 30,
1998 in excess of the reserves established therefor.

     (s)     ERISA.  None of RHI, the Borrower or any Subsidiary of
the Borrower contributes to any Benefit Plan, Multiemployer Plan or
Foreign Pension Plan. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur that has resulted or is reasonably likely to
result in a material liability of RHI, the Borrower or any
Subsidiary of the Borrower. Schedule B (Actuarial Information) to
the 1995 annual report (Form 5500 Series) for each Benefit Plan,
copies of which have been filed with the Internal Revenue Service
and furnished to the Administrative Agent, is complete and accurate
and fairly presents the funding status of such Benefit Plan, and
since the date of such Schedule B there has been no material
adverse change in such funding status. Neither the Borrower nor any
ERISA Affiliate has incurred or is reasonably expected to incur any
withdrawal liability to any Multiemployer Plan. Neither the
Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has been notified by the sponsor
of a Multiemployer Plan that such Multiemployer Plan is in
reorganization or has been terminated, within the meaning of Title
IV of ERISA, and no Multiemployer Plan is reasonably expected to be
in reorganization or to be terminated, within the meaning of Title
IV of ERISA. The aggregate annualized cost (including, without
limitation, the cost of insurance premiums) with respect to post-
retirement benefits under Benefit Plans for which RHI and/or the
Borrower is liable does not exceed $10,000,000.

     (t)  Foreign Employee Benefit Matters.  Each Foreign Employee
Benefit Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all
laws, regulations and rules applicable thereto and the respective
requirements of the governing documents for such Plan.  The
aggregate of the liabilities to provide all of the accrued benefits
under any Foreign Pension Plan does not exceed the current fair
market value of the assets held in the trust or other funding
vehicle for such Plan.  With respect to any Foreign Employee
Benefit Plan maintained or contributed to by the Borrower, any of
its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate (other than a Foreign
Pension Plan), reasonable reserves have been established in
accordance with prudent business practice or where required by
ordinary accounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such
Plan is maintained.  The aggregate unfunded liabilities, after
giving effect to any reserves for such liabilities, with respect to
such Plans does not exceed the current fair market value of the
assets held in the trust or other funding vehicle for such Plan. 
There are no actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims
for benefits) pending or, to the best knowledge of the Borrower,
threatened against the Borrower, any Subsidiary of the Borrower or
any ERISA Affiliate with respect to any Foreign Employee Benefit
Plan.

     (u)  Labor Matters.  Schedule 7.01-U accurately sets forth all
labor contracts, other than national union agreements to which any
Subsidiary of the Borrower domiciled in Europe is a party, to which
RHI, the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower is a party on
the date hereof and the expiration date of each such contract. 
There are no strikes, lockouts or other grievances relating to any
collective bargaining or similar agreement to which RHI, the
Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower is a party.

     (v)  Securities Activities.  None of RHI, the Borrower or any
Subsidiary of the Borrower is engaged in the business of extending
credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

     (w)  Solvency.  After giving effect to the Loans to be made
and Letters of Credit to be issued or continued on the Effective
Date or such other date as Loans requested hereunder are made or
Letters of Credit requested hereunder are issued, the disbursement
of the proceeds of such Loans pursuant to the Borrower's
instructions, and the making of any intercompany advance or loan,
dividend or other distribution, RHI, the Borrower and each
Subsidiary of the Borrower is Solvent.

     (x)     Patents, Trademarks, Permits, Etc.; Government
Approvals.  (i)  RHI, the Borrower and each Subsidiary of the
Borrower, as applicable, owns, is licensed or otherwise has the
lawful right to use, or has all Permits and other governmental
approvals, patents, trademarks, trade names, copyrights,
technology, know-how, permits and processes used in or necessary
for the conduct of its respective business as currently conducted
which are material to its condition (financial or otherwise),
operations, performance and prospects, taken as a whole.  Except as
set forth on Schedule 7.01-X attached hereto, no claims are pending
or, to the best of RHI's and the Borrower's knowledge following
diligent inquiry, threatened that RHI, the Borrower or any
Subsidiary of the Borrower is infringing or otherwise adversely
affecting the rights of any Person with respect to such Permits and
other governmental approvals, patents, trademarks, trade names,
copyrights, technology, know-how, permits and processes, except for
such claims and infringements as do not, in the aggregate, give
rise to any liability on the part of RHI, the Borrower or any
Subsidiary of the Borrower which will, or is reasonably likely to,
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     (ii)  The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Loan Documents will not impair the ownership of or rights under (or
the license or other right to use, as the case may be) any Permits
and governmental approvals, patents, trademarks, trade names,
copyrights, technology, know-how, permits or processes by RHI, the
Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower in any manner which
will, or is reasonably likely to, result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

     (y)  Assets and Properties.  RHI, the Borrower and each
Subsidiary of the Borrower has good and marketable title to all of
the assets and Property (tangible and intangible) owned by it
(except insofar as marketability may be limited by any laws or
regulations of any Governmental Authority affecting such assets),
and all such assets and Property are free and clear of all Liens
except Liens securing the Obligations and Liens permitted under
Section 10.03.  Substantially all of the assets and Property owned
by, leased to, or used by RHI, the Borrower and/or each Subsidiary
of the Borrower in their respective businesses is in adequate
operating condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, is
free and clear of any known defects except such defects as do not
substantially interfere with the continued use thereof in the
conduct of normal operations, and is able to serve the function for
which they are currently being used, except in each case where the
failure of such asset to meet such requirements would not, or is
not reasonably likely to, result in a Material Adverse Effect. 
Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document, nor any
transaction contemplated under any such agreement, will affect any
right, title or interest of RHI, the Borrower or any Subsidiary of
the Borrower in and to any of such assets in a manner that would,
or is reasonably likely to, result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     (z)  Insurance.  Schedule 7.01-Z attached hereto or as amended
from time to time accurately sets forth as of the date of such
Schedule all insurance policies and programs in effect with respect
to the respective Property and assets and business of RHI, the
Borrower and the Borrower's Subsidiaries, specifying for each such
policy and program, (i) the amount thereof, (ii) the risks insured
against thereby, (iii) the name of the insurer and each insured
party thereunder, (iv) the policy or other identification number
thereof, and (v) the expiration date thereof.  The Borrower has
delivered to the Administrative Agent copies of all such insurance
policies.  Such insurance policies and programs are currently in
full force and effect, in compliance with the requirements of
Section 9.05 and are in amounts sufficient to cover the replacement
value of the respective Property and assets of RHI, the Borrower
and the Borrower's Subsidiaries.

     (aa)  Pledge of Capital Stock.  The grant and perfection of
the security interest in the Capital Stock of the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries of the Borrower constituting a portion of the
Collateral for the benefit of the Holders, as contemplated by the
terms of the Loan Documents, is not made in violation of the
registration provisions of the Securities Act, any applicable
provisions of other federal securities laws, state securities or
"Blue Sky" law, foreign securities law, or applicable general
corporation law or in violation of any other Requirement of Law.

     (bb)  Liquidity.  The unused Revolving Credit Commitments,
together with the remaining liquidity sources available to the
Borrower and RHI is sufficient to fund all of RHI's and the
Borrower's cash requirements through December 31, 1998, including,
without limitation, cash requirements of TFC, in accordance with
all Requirements of Law.

                     AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

     RHI and the Borrower covenant and agree that so long as any
Revolving Credit Commitment is outstanding and thereafter until
payment in full of all of the Obligations (other than indemnities
not yet due), unless the Requisite Lenders shall otherwise give
prior written consent:

     9.01.  Corporate Existence, Etc.  RHI and the Borrower shall,
and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, at all
times maintain its corporate existence and preserve and keep, or

termination of such rights and franchises is not likely to result
in a Material Adverse Effect.

     9.02.  Corporate Powers; Conduct of Business.  RHI and the
Borrower shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to, qualify and remain qualified to do business and
maintain its good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of its business and the ownership of its Property requires it to be
so qualified and in good standing.

     9.03.  Compliance with Laws, Etc.  RHI and the Borrower shall,
and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, (a)
comply with all Requirements of Law and all restrictive covenants
affecting it or its business, Property, assets or operations and
(b) obtain as needed all Permits necessary for its operations and
maintain such Permits in good standing, except in the case where
noncompliance with either clause (a) or (b) above is not reasonably
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     9.04.  Payment of Taxes and Claims; Tax Consolidation.  RHI
and the Borrower shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to, pay (a) all taxes, assessments and other
governmental charges imposed upon it or on any of its Property or

Property before any penalty or interest accrues thereon, and (b)
all Claims (including, without limitation, claims for labor,
services, materials and supplies) for sums which have become due
and payable and which by law have or may become a Lien (other than
a Lien permitted by Section 10.03) upon any Property or assets of
RHI, the Borrower or any such Subsidiary, prior to the time when
any penalty or fine shall be incurred with respect thereto;
provided, however, that no such taxes, assessments and governmental
charges referred to in clause (a) above or Claims referred to in
clause (b) above need be paid if being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings diligently instituted and conducted and if
such reserve or other appropriate provision, if any, as shall be
required in conformity with GAAP shall have been made therefor.

itself and its respective Subsidiaries, or shall cause each of its
respective Subsidiaries to maintain, in full force and effect the

policy or policies of insurance shall be altered adversely to the
interests of the Holders or canceled and that no act, whether
willful or negligent, or default of RHI, the Borrower, any
Subsidiary of the Borrower or any other Person shall affect the
right of the Administrative Agent to recover under such policy or
policies of insurance in case of loss or damage.  In the event RHI,
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, at any time or times
hereafter shall fail to obtain or maintain any of the policies or

may at any time or times thereafter (but shall be under no
obligation to do so) obtain and maintain such policies of insurance
and pay such premiums and take any other action with respect

RHI and the Borrower shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, permit any authorized representative(s)

and independent certified public accountants, all upon reasonable
written notice and at such reasonable times during normal business

an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, RHI and the
Borrower, upon the Administrative Agent's request, shall, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, turn over any such
records to the Administrative Agent or its representatives;
provided, however, that RHI and the Borrower may, in their
discretion, retain copies of such records.

     9.07.  Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds.  (a) Direction to
Insurers.  RHI and the Borrower hereby direct (and, if applicable,

proceeds payable under such policies or with respect to such claim
or award directly to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of

this Agreement.

     (i)     Loan Documents; Failure of Security.  At any time, for
any reason, (i) any Loan Document ceases to be in full force and

agreement or indenture pertaining to any Indebtedness of TFC or RHI
described above, if the effect thereof (with or without the giving
of notice or lapse of time or both) is to accelerate (as
distinguished from imposing a requirement to offer to purchase), or
permit the holder(s) of such Indebtedness to accelerate (as
distinguished from imposing a requirement to offer to purchase),

its stated maturity or (ii) issue equity Securities, incur
Indebtedness for borrowed money, or sell, lease, transfer, convey
or otherwise dispose of any assets not identified on Schedule
12.01-P without transferring the proceeds of such equity
Securities, Indebtedness or such assets to the Borrower to enable
the Borrower to repay the principal of, and all accrued interest

amount sufficient to reduce the outstanding principal amount
thereof to no more than $52,000,000 and reduce the Revolving Credit
Commitments to an amount no more than $52,000,000.         

     An Event of Default shall be deemed "continuing" until cured
or waived in writing in accordance with Section 15.07.

          12.02.  Rights and Remedies.

     (a)     Acceleration and Termination.  Upon the occurrence of
any Event of Default described in Sections 12.01(f) or 12.01(g),
the Lenders' respective obligations to make Loans under the
Revolving Credit Commitments shall automatically and immediately
terminate and the unpaid principal amount of, and any and all
accrued interest on, the Obligations and all accrued fees shall
automatically become immediately due and payable, without
presentment, demand, or protest or other requirements of any kind
(including, without limitation, valuation and appraisement,
diligence, presentment, notice of intent to demand or accelerate
and of acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly waived by
the Borrower; and upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
any other Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall at the
request, or may with the consent, of the Requisite Lenders, by
written notice to the Borrower, (i) declare that the Lenders'
respective obligations to make Revolving Loans under the Revolving
Credit Commitments are terminated, whereupon such obligation of
each such Lender to make any Loan hereunder and of each such Lender
or Issuing Bank to issue or participate in any Letter of Credit not
then issued shall immediately terminate, and/or (ii) declare the
unpaid principal amount of and any and all accrued and unpaid
interest on the Obligations to be, and the same shall thereupon be,
immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, or
protest or other requirements of any kind (including, without
limitation, valuation and appraisement, diligence, presentment,
notice of intent to demand or accelerate and of acceleration), all
of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower.

     (b)  Deposit for Letters of Credit.  In addition, after the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent,
deliver to the Administrative Agent, Cash Collateral in such form
as requested by the Administrative Agent for deposit in the Cash
Collateral Account, together with such endorsements, and execution
and delivery of such documents and instruments, as the
Administrative Agent may request in order to perfect or protect the
Administrative Agent's Lien with respect thereto, in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the then outstanding Letter of Credit
Obligations.

     (c)  Rescission.  If at any time after termination of the
Lenders' obligations to make Revolving Loans under the Revolving
Credit Commitments and/or acceleration of the maturity of the
Loans, the Borrower shall pay all arrears of interest and all
payments on account of principal of the Loans and Reimbursement
Obligations which shall have become due otherwise than by
acceleration (with interest on principal and, to the extent
permitted by law, on overdue interest, at the rates specified in
this Agreement) and all Events of Default and Potential Events of
Default (other than nonpayment of principal of and accrued interest
on the Loans due and payable solely by virtue of acceleration)
shall be remedied or waived pursuant to Section 15.07, then upon
the written consent of the Requisite Lenders and written notice to
the Borrower, the termination of the Lenders' respective
obligations to make Revolving Loans under the Revolving Credit
Commitments and the respective Lenders' and Issuing Banks'
obligations to participate in or issue Letters of Credit and/or the
aforesaid acceleration and its consequences may be rescinded and
annulled; but such action shall not affect any subsequent Event of
Default or Potential Event of Default or impair any right or remedy
consequent thereon.  The provisions of the preceding sentence are
intended merely to bind the Lenders and the Issuing Banks to a
decision which may be made at the election of the Requisite
Lenders; they are not intended to benefit the Borrower and do not
give the Borrower the right to require the Lenders to rescind or
annul any termination of the aforesaid obligations of the Lenders
or Issuing Banks or any acceleration hereunder, even if the
conditions set forth herein are met.

     (d)  Enforcement.  The Borrower acknowledges that in the event
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries fails to perform, observe
or discharge any of their respective obligations or liabilities
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any remedy of law
may prove to be inadequate relief to the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Banks and the Lenders; therefore, the Borrower agrees that
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders shall
be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any
such case without the necessity of proving actual damages.

                      ARTICLE XIII
                THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

     13.01.  Appointment.  (a)  Each Lender and each Issuing Bank
hereby designates and appoints Citicorp as the Administrative Agent
of such Lender or such Issuing Bank under this Agreement and each
Lender and each Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement and the Loan Documents and to exercise
such powers as are set forth herein or therein together with such
other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The
Administrative Agent hereby agrees to act in the aforesaid
capacities on the express conditions contained in this Article
XIII.

     (b)  The provisions of this Article XIII are solely for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and Issuing Banks,
and neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary of the Borrower shall
have any rights to rely on or enforce any of the provisions hereof
(other than as expressly set forth in Section 13.07).  In
performing its functions and duties under this Agreement, the
Administrative Agent shall act solely as Administrative Agent of
the Lenders and the Issuing Banks and does not assume and shall not
be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship of agency,
trustee or fiduciary with or for the Borrower or any Affiliate of
the Borrower.  The Administrative Agent may perform any of its
respective duties hereunder, or under the other Loan Documents, by
or through its agents or employees.

     13.02.  Nature of Duties.  The Administrative Agent shall not
have any duties or responsibilities other than those expressly set
forth in this Agreement or in the Loan Documents.  The duties of
the Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in
nature.  The Administrative Agent shall not have, by reason of this
Agreement, any fiduciary relationship in respect of any Holder. 
Nothing in this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, expressed
or implied, is intended to or shall be construed to impose upon the
Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents other than as expressly set
forth herein or therein.  Each Lender and each Issuing Bank shall
make its own independent investigation of the financial condition
and affairs of the Borrower and its Affiliates in connection with
the making and the continuance of the Loans hereunder and with the
issuance of the Letters of Credit and shall make its own appraisal
of the creditworthiness of the Borrower and Guarantors initially
and on a continuing basis, and the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a
continuing basis, to provide any Holder with any credit or other
information with respect thereto (except for reports required to be
delivered by the Administrative Agent under the terms of this
Agreement).  If the Administrative Agent seeks the consent or
approval of the Lenders to the taking or refraining from taking of
any action hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall send notice
thereof to each Lender.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify each Lender at any time that the Lenders so required
hereunder have instructed the Administrative Agent to act or
refrain from acting pursuant hereto. As to any matters not
expressly provided for by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, enforcement or collection of the Notes or any amount
payable under any provision of Article IV or Article V when due) or
the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not be
required to exercise any discretion or take any action. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall be
required to act or refrain from acting (and shall be fully
protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the
instructions of the Requisite Lenders (unless the instructions or
consent of all of the Lenders is required hereunder or thereunder)
and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders, Issuing
Banks and Holders; provided, however, the Administrative Agent
shall not be required to take any action which (i) the
Administrative Agent reasonably believes will expose it to personal
liability unless the Administrative Agent receives an
indemnification satisfactory to it from the Lenders with respect to
such action or (ii) is contrary to this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents or applicable law. 

     13.03.  Rights, Exculpation, Etc.  (a)  Liabilities;
Responsibilities.  None of the Administrative Agent, any Affiliate
of the Administrative Agent, or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents shall be liable to any Holder for
any action taken or omitted by them hereunder or under any of the
Loan Documents, or in connection therewith, except that no Person
shall be relieved of any liability imposed by law for gross
negligence or willful misconduct.  The Administrative Agent shall
not be liable for any apportionment or distribution of payments
made by it in good faith pursuant to Section 4.02(b), and, if any
such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to
have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Holder to whom
payment was due, but not made, shall be to recover from other
Holders any payment in excess of the amount to which they are
determined to have been entitled.  The Administrative Agent shall
not be responsible to any Holder for any recitals, statements,
representations or warranties herein or for the execution,
effectiveness, genuineness, validity, legality, enforceability,
collectibility, or sufficiency of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, or
for the financial condition of the Borrower or any of its
Affiliates or the Guarantors.  The Administrative Agent shall not
be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance
or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or the financial
condition of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or the
Guarantors, or the existence or possible existence of any Potential
Event of Default or Event of Default.

     (b)  Right to Request Instructions.  The Administrative Agent
may at any time request instructions from the Lenders with respect
to any actions or approvals which by the terms of any of the Loan
Documents the Administrative Agent is permitted or required to take
or to grant, and shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from
taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be
under any liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from
any action or withholding any approval under any of the Loan
Documents until it shall have received such instructions from those
Lenders from whom the Administrative Agent is required to obtain
such instructions for the pertinent matter in accordance with the
Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
no Holder shall have any right of action whatsoever against the
Administrative Agent as a result of the its acting or refraining
from acting under the Loan Documents in accordance with the
instructions of the Requisite Lenders or, where required by the
express terms of this Agreement, a greater proportion of the
Lenders.

     13.04.  Reliance.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled
to rely upon any written notices, statements, certificates, orders
or other documents or any telephone message believed by it in good
faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or
made by the proper Person, and with respect to all matters
pertaining to this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents and its
duties hereunder or thereunder, upon advice of legal counsel
(including counsel for the Borrower), independent public
accountants and other experts selected by it.

     13.05.  Indemnification.  To the extent that the
Administrative Agent is required to be reimbursed and indemnified
by the Borrower but is not reimbursed and indemnified by the
Borrower, the Lenders will reimburse and indemnify the
Administrative Agent for and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against it in any
way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any action
taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under the Loan
Documents, in proportion to each Lender's 

<PAGE>
Pro Rata Share.  The obligations of the Lenders under this Section
13.05 shall survive the payment in full of the Loans, the
Reimbursement Obligations and all other Obligations and the
termination of this Agreement.

     13.06.  Citicorp Individually.  With respect to its Pro Rata
Share of the Revolving Credit Commitments hereunder, and the Loans
made by it, Citicorp shall have and may exercise the same rights
and powers hereunder and is subject to the same obligations and
liabilities as and to the extent set forth herein for any other
Lender.  The terms "Lenders" or "Requisite Lenders" or any similar
terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates,
include Citicorp in its individual capacity as a Lender or one of
the Requisite Lenders.  Citicorp and its Affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of
banking, trust or other business with the Borrower or any of its
Affiliates as if it were not acting as the Administrative Agent
pursuant hereto.

     13.07.  Successor Administrative Agents.  (a)  Resignation. 
The Administrative Agent may resign from the performance of all its
functions and duties hereunder at any time by giving at least
thirty (30) Business Days' prior written notice to the Borrower and
the Lenders.  Such resignation shall take effect upon the
acceptance by a successor Administrative Agent of appointment
pursuant to this Section 13.07.

     (b)     Appointment by Requisite Lenders.  Upon any such
notice of resignation, the Requisite Lenders shall have the right
to appoint a successor Administrative Agent selected from among the
Lenders which appointment shall be subject to the prior written
approval of the Borrower (which may not be unreasonably withheld,
and shall not be required upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default).

     (c)  Appointment by Retiring Administrative Agent.  If a
successor Administrative Agent shall not have been appointed within
the thirty (30) Business Day period provided in clause (a) of this
Section 13.07, the retiring Administrative Agent, with the consent
of the Borrower (which may not be unreasonably withheld, and shall
not be required upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default), shall then appoint a successor Administrative
Agent who shall serve as such until such time, if any, as the
Requisite Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as
provided above.

     (d)  Rights of the Successor and Retiring Administrative
Agents.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative
Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor
Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall
be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. 
After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article XIII shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by it while it was the Administrative Agent under this Agreement.

     13.08.  Relations Among Lenders.  Each Lender and each Issuing
Bank agrees (except as provided in Section 15.05) that it will not
take any legal action, nor institute any actions or proceedings,
against the Borrower or any other obligor hereunder or under the
other Loan Documents with respect to any Collateral, without the
prior written consent of the Requisite Lenders.  Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, no Lender may accelerate or
otherwise enforce its portion of the Obligations, or unilaterally
terminate its Revolving Loan Commitment except in accordance with
Section 12.02(a).

     13.09.  Concerning the Collateral and the Loan Documents.  (a) 
Protective Advances.  The Administrative Agent may from time to
time, before or after the occurrence of an Event of Default, make
such disbursements and advances pursuant to the Loan Documents
which the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, deems
necessary or desirable to preserve or protect the Collateral or any
portion thereof or to enhance the likelihood or maximize the amount
of repayment of the Loans and other Obligations ("Protective
Advances").  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Borrower and each Lender in writing of each such Protective
Advance, which notice shall include a description of the purpose of
such Protective Advance.  The Borrower agrees to pay the
Administrative Agent, upon demand, the principal amount of all
outstanding Protective Advances, together with interest thereon at
the rate from time to time applicable to Base Rate Loans from the
date of such Protective Advance until the outstanding principal
balance thereof is paid in full.  If the Borrower fails to make
payment in respect of any Protective Advance within one (1)
Business Day after the date the Borrower receives written demand
therefor from the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent
shall promptly notify each Lender and each Lender agrees that it
shall thereupon make available to the Administrative Agent, in
Dollars in immediately available funds, the amount equal to such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Protective Advance.  If such funds
are not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender
within one (1) Business Day after the Administrative Agent's demand
therefor, the Administrative Agent will be entitled to recover any
such amount from such Lender together with interest thereon at the
Federal Funds Rate for the first day after the date of such demand
and at the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans for each day
during the period commencing on the second day after the date of
such demand and ending on the date such amount is received.  The
failure of any Lender to make available to the Administrative Agent
its Pro Rata Share of any such Protective Advance shall neither
relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make
available to the Administrative Agent such other Lender's Pro Rata
Share of such Protective Advance on the date such payment is to be
made nor increase the obligation of any other Lender to make such
payment to the Administrative Agent.  All outstanding principal of,
and interest on, Protective Advances shall constitute Obligations
secured by the Collateral until paid in full by the Borrower.  

     (b)  Authority.  Each Lender and each Issuing Bank authorizes
and directs the Administrative Agent to enter into the Loan
Documents relating to the Collateral for the benefit of the Lenders
and the Issuing Banks.  Each Lender and each Issuing Bank agrees
that any action taken by the Administrative Agent or the Requisite
Lenders (or, where required by the express terms of this Agreement,
a greater proportion of the Lenders) in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, and the
exercise by the Administrative Agent or the Requisite Lenders (or,
where so required, such greater proportion) of the powers set forth
herein or therein, together with such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon
all of the Lenders and Issuing Banks.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall have
the sole and exclusive right and authority to (i) act as the
disbursing and collecting agent for the Lenders and the Issuing
Banks with respect to all payments and collections of the
Obligations of the Borrower arising in connection with this
Agreement and the Loan Documents or relating to the Collateral;
(ii) execute and deliver each Loan Document relating to the
Collateral and accept delivery of each such agreement delivered by
the Borrower, any Subsidiary of the Borrower, or any Guarantor a
party thereto; (iii) act as collateral agent for the Lenders and
the Issuing Banks for purposes of the perfection of all security
interests and Liens created by such agreements and all other
purposes stated therein; provided, however, the Administrative
Agent hereby appoints, authorizes and directs the Lenders and the
Issuing Banks to act as collateral sub-agent for the Administrative
Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks for purposes of the
perfection of all security interests and Liens with respect to the
Property at any time in the possession of such Lender or such
Issuing Bank, including, without limitation, Deposit Accounts
maintained with, and cash and Cash Equivalents held by, such Lender
or such Issuing Bank; (iv) manage, supervise and otherwise deal
with the Collateral; (v) take such action as is necessary or
desirable to maintain the perfection and priority of the security
interests and liens created or purported to be created by the Loan
Documents; and (vi) except as may be otherwise specifically
restricted by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, exercise all remedies given to the Administrative Agent,
the Lenders or the Issuing Banks with respect to the Collateral
under the Loan Documents relating thereto, applicable law or
otherwise.  

     (c)     Release of Collateral.  (i) Each Lender and each
Issuing Bank hereby directs, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Administrative Agent to release any Lien held by the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Holders:

     (A)     against all of the Collateral, upon final and
indefeasible payment in full of the Obligations and termination of
this Agreement;

        (B)     against any part of the Collateral sold or disposed
of by a Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, if such sale or
disposition is permitted by Section 10.02 or is otherwise consented
to by the Requisite Lenders, as certified to the Administrative
Agent by the Borrower in an Officer's Certificate; and/or

     (C)  against any part of the Collateral consisting of a
promissory note, upon final and indefeasible payment in full of the
Indebtedness evidenced thereby.

     (ii)  Each Lender and each Issuing Bank hereby directs the
Administrative Agent to execute and deliver or file such
termination and partial release statements and do such other things
as are necessary to release Liens to be released pursuant to this
Section 13.09(c) promptly upon the effectiveness of any such
release.

                   YIELD PROTECTION


     14.01.  Taxes.  (a)  Payment of Taxes.  Any and all payments
by the Borrower hereunder or under any Note or other document
evidencing any Obligations shall be made, in accordance with
Section 4.02, free and clear of and without reduction for any and
all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges,
withholdings, and all stamp or documentary taxes, excise taxes, ad
valorem taxes and other taxes imposed on the value of the Property,
charges or levies which arise from the execution, delivery or
registration, or from payment or performance under, or otherwise
with respect to, any of the Loan Documents or the Revolving Credit
Commitments and all other liabilities with respect thereto
excluding, in the case of each Lender, each Issuing Bank and the
Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on or measured by net income or
overall gross receipts and capital and franchise taxes imposed on
it by (i) the United States, (ii) the Governmental Authority of the
jurisdiction in which such Lender's Applicable Lending Office is
located or any political subdivision thereof or (iii) the
Governmental Authority in which such Person is organized, managed
and controlled or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-
excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges and
withholdings being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes").  If the
Borrower shall be required by law to withhold or deduct any Taxes
from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any such
Note or document to any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the
Administrative Agent, (x) the sum payable to such Lender, Issuing
Bank, or the Administrative Agent shall be increased as may be
necessary so that after making all required withholding or
deductions (including withholding or deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section 14.01) such Lender, such
Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be)
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no
such withholding or deductions been made, (y) the Borrower shall
make such withholding or deductions, and (z) the Borrower shall pay
the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant taxation
authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

     (b)  Indemnification.  The Borrower will indemnify each
Lender, each Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent against, and
reimburse each on demand for, the full amount of all Taxes
(including, without limitation, any Taxes imposed by any
Governmental Authority on amounts payable under this Section 14.01
and any additional income or franchise taxes resulting therefrom)
incurred or paid by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) or any of their
respective Affiliates and any liability (including penalties,
interest, and out-of-pocket expenses paid to third parties) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were
lawfully payable.  A certificate as to any additional amount
payable to any Person under this Section 14.01 submitted by it to
the Borrower shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and
binding upon all parties hereto.  Each Lender and each Issuing Bank
agrees, within a reasonable time after receiving a written request
from the Borrower, to provide the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent with such certificates as are reasonably required, and take
such other actions as are reasonably necessary to claim such
exemptions as such Lender or such Issuing Bank may be entitled to
claim in respect of all or a portion of any Taxes which are
otherwise required to be paid or deducted or withheld pursuant to
this Section 14.01 in respect of any payments under this Agreement
or under the Notes.  

     (c)  Receipts.  Within thirty (30) days after the date of any
payment of Taxes by the Borrower, it will furnish to the
Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 15.08,
the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment
thereof.  

     (d)  Foreign Bank Certifications.  (i) Each Lender that is not
created or organized under the laws of the United States or a
political subdivision thereof shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent on the Effective Date or the date on which
such Lender becomes a Lender pursuant to Section 15.01 hereof a
true and accurate certificate executed in duplicate by a duly
authorized officer of such Lender to the effect that such Lender is
eligible to receive payments hereunder and under the Notes without
deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax (I)
under the provisions of an applicable tax treaty concluded by the
United States (in which case the certificate shall be accompanied
by two duly completed copies of IRS Form 1001 (or any successor or
substitute form or forms)), (II) under Sections 1442(c)(1) and
1442(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (in which case the certificate
shall be accompanied by two duly completed copies of IRS Form 4224
(or any successor or substitute form or forms)), or (III) due to
such Lender's not being a "bank" as such term is used in Section
881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code (in which case, the
certificate shall be accompanied by two accurate and complete
original signed copies of IRS Form W-8 (or any successor or
substitute form or forms)).

     (ii)  Each Lender further agrees to deliver to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent from time to time, a true and accurate
certificate executed in duplicate by a duly authorized officer of
such Lender before or promptly upon the occurrence of any event
requiring a change in the most recent certificate previously
delivered by it to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
pursuant to this Section 14.01(d).  Each certificate required to be
delivered pursuant to this Section 14.01(d)(ii) shall certify as to
one of the following:

     (A)     that such Lender can continue to receive payments
hereunder and under the Notes without deduction or withholding of
United States federal income tax;
     (B)     that such Lender cannot continue to receive payments
hereunder and under the Notes without deduction or withholding of
United States federal income tax as specified therein but does not
require additional payments pursuant to Section 14.01(a) because it
is entitled to recover the full amount of any such deduction or
withholding from a source other than the Borrower; or

     (C)     that such Lender is no longer capable of receiving
payments hereunder and under the Notes without deduction or
withholding of United States federal income tax as specified
therein and that it is not capable of recovering the full amount of
the same from a source other than the Borrower.

Each Lender agrees to deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent further duly completed copies of the
above-mentioned IRS forms on or before the earlier of (x) the date
that any such form expires or becomes obsolete or otherwise is
required to be resubmitted as a condition to obtaining an exemption
from withholding from United States federal income tax and (y)
fifteen (15) days after the occurrence of any event requiring a
change in the most recent form previously delivered by such Lender
to the Borrower and Administrative Agent, unless any change in
treaty, law, regulation, or official interpretation thereof which
would render such form inapplicable or which would prevent the
Lender from duly completing and delivering such form has occurred
prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be
required and the Lender promptly advises the Borrower that it is
not capable of receiving payments hereunder and under the Notes
without any deduction or withholding of United States federal
income tax.

     14.02.  Increased Capital.  If after the date hereof any
Lender or Issuing Bank determines that (i) the adoption or
implementation of or any change in or in the interpretation or
administration of any law or regulation or any guideline or request
from any central bank or other Governmental Authority or quasi-
governmental authority exercising jurisdiction, power or control
over any Lender, Issuing Bank or banks or financial institutions
generally (whether or not having the force of law), compliance with
which affects or would affect the amount of capital required or
expected to be maintained by such Lender or Issuing Bank or any
Person controlling such Lender or Issuing Bank and (ii) the amount
of such capital is increased by or based upon (A) the making or
maintenance by any Lender of its Loans, any Lender's participation
in or obligation to participate in the Loans, Letters of Credit or
other advances made hereunder or the existence of any Lender's
obligation to make Loans or (B) the issuance or maintenance by any
Issuing Bank of, or the existence of any Issuing Bank's obligation
to issue, Letters of Credit, then, in any such case, upon written
demand by such Lender or Issuing Bank (with a copy of such demand
to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall immediately pay to
the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender or Issuing
Bank, from time to time as specified by such Lender or Issuing
Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or
Issuing Bank or such Person therefor.  Such demand shall be
accompanied by a statement as to the amount of such compensation
and include a brief summary of the basis for such demand.  Such
statement shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error.

     14.03.  Changes; Legal Restrictions.  If after the date hereof
any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that the adoption or
implementation of or any change in or in the interpretation or
administration of any law or regulation or any guideline or request
from any central bank or other Governmental Authority or quasi-
governmental authority exercising jurisdiction, power or control
over any Lender, Issuing Bank or over banks or financial
institutions generally (whether or not having the force of law),
compliance with which:

     (a)  does or will subject a Lender or an Issuing Bank (or its
Applicable Lending Office or Eurodollar Affiliate) to charges
(other than taxes) of any kind which such Lender or Issuing Bank
reasonably determines to be applicable to the Revolving Credit
Commitments of the Lenders and/or the Issuing Banks to make
Eurodollar Rate Loans or issue and/or participate in Letters of
Credit or change the basis of taxation of payments to that Lender
or Issuing Bank of principal, fees, interest, or any other amount
payable hereunder with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans or Letters
of Credit; or 

     (b)  does or will impose, modify, or hold applicable, in the
determination of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, any reserve (other
than reserves taken into account in calculating the Eurodollar
Rate), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar
requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other
liabilities (including those pertaining to Letters of Credit) in or
for the account of, advances or loans by, commitments made, or
other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, a
Lender or an Issuing Bank or any Applicable Lending Office or
Eurodollar Affiliate of that Lender or Issuing Bank;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to
that Lender or Issuing Bank of making, renewing or maintaining the
Loans or its Revolving Credit Commitment with respect to, or
issuing or participating in, the Letters of Credit or to reduce any
amount receivable thereunder; then, in any such case, upon written
demand by such Lender or Issuing Bank (with a copy of such demand
to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall immediately pay to
the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender or Issuing
Bank, from time to time as specified by such Lender or Issuing
Bank, such amount or amounts as may be necessary to compensate such
Lender or Issuing Bank or its Eurodollar Affiliate for any such
additional cost incurred or reduced amount received.  Such demand
shall be accompanied by a statement as to the amount of such
compensation and include a brief summary of the basis for such
demand.  Such statement shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.

     14.04.  Illegality.  (i)  If at any time any Lender determines
(which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and
conclusive and binding upon all parties) that the making or
continuation of or conversion into any Eurodollar Rate Loan has
become unlawful or impermissible by compliance by that Lender with
any law, governmental rule, regulation or order of any Governmental
Authority (whether or not having the force of law and whether or
not failure to comply therewith would be unlawful or would result
in costs or penalties), then, and in any such event, such Lender
may give notice of that determination, in writing, to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly transmit the notice to each other Lender.

         (ii)  When notice is given by a Lender under Section
14.04(i), (A) the Borrower's right to request from such Lender and
such Lender's obligation, if any, to make Eurodollar Rate Loans
shall be immediately suspended, and such Lender shall make a Base
Rate Loan as part of any requested Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate
Loans and (B) if the affected Eurodollar Rate Loan or Loans are
then outstanding, the Borrower shall immediately, or if permitted
by applicable law, no later than the date permitted thereby, upon
at least one (1) Business Day's prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent and the affected Lender, convert each such
Loan into a Base Rate Loan.

        (iii)  If at any time after a Lender gives notice under
Section 14.04(i) such Lender determines that it may lawfully make
Eurodollar Rate Loans, such Lender shall promptly give notice of
that determination, in writing, to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly
transmit the notice to each other Lender.  The Borrower's right to
request, and such Lender's obligation, if any, to make Eurodollar
Rate Loans shall thereupon be restored.

     14.05.  Compensation.  In addition to all amounts required to
be paid by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.01, the Borrower
shall compensate each Lender, upon demand, for all losses, expenses
and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits
or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund or maintain such
Lender's Eurodollar Rate Loans to the Borrower but excluding any
loss of Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin on the relevant Loans)
which that Lender may sustain (i) if for any reason a Borrowing,
conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans does not
occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or a
Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by the Borrower or in a
telephonic request by it for borrowing or conversion/continuation
or a successive Eurodollar Interest Period does not commence after
notice therefor is given pursuant to Section 5.01(c), including,
without limitation, pursuant to Section 5.02(e), (ii) if for any
reason any Eurodollar Rate Loan is prepaid (including, without
limitation, mandatorily pursuant to Section 4.01) on a date which
is not the last day of the applicable Eurodollar Interest Period,
(iii) as a consequence of a required conversion of a Eurodollar
Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan as a result of any of the events
indicated in Section 5.02(e), or (iv) as a consequence of any
failure by the Borrower to repay Eurodollar Rate Loans made to it
when required by the terms of this Agreement.  The Lender making
demand for such compensation shall deliver to the Borrower
concurrently with such demand a written statement in reasonable
detail as to such losses, expenses and liabilities, and this
statement shall be conclusive as to the amount of compensation due
to that Lender, absent manifest error.

     14.06.  Limitation on Additional Amounts Payable by the
Borrower.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 14.01(a), the
Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amounts
hereunder to a Lender or Issuing Bank if (a) the obligation to pay
such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by
the Lender or Issuing Bank to comply with the requirements
described in Section 14.01 or (b) the Lender or Issuing Bank shall
not have furnished the Borrower with such forms or shall not have
taken such other action as reasonably may be available to it under
applicable tax laws and any applicable tax treaty to obtain an
exemption from, or reduction (to the lowest applicable rate) of
withholding of such United States federal income tax; provided,
however, the Borrower's obligation to pay such additional amounts
shall be reinstated upon receipt of such forms or evidence that
action with respect to obtaining such exemption or reduction has
been taken.

     14.07.  Change in Lending Office.  Any Lender claiming any
additional amounts payable pursuant to Section 14.01 shall use
reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal
and regulatory restrictions) to change the Domestic Lending Office
designated by it for purposes of this Agreement to a Domestic
Lending Office in another jurisdiction, if the making of such a
change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such
additional amounts which may thereafter accrue and would not, in
the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such
Lender.

     14.08.  Judgment Currency.  If for the purposes of obtaining
judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due under
this agreement or any Note in any currency (the "first currency")
into another currency (the "second currency"), the parties hereto
agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the Exchange
Rate used shall be that determined on the Business Day preceding
that on which final judgment is given. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the Obligation in respect of any sum
due in a first currency shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a
second currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the
Business Day following receipt by any of the Administrative Agent,
any Lender or any Issuing Bank of any sum adjudged to be so due in
the second currency, such Person may purchase the first currency
with the second currency at the Exchange Rate determined on the
date of such purchase; if the amount of the first currency so
purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Person in the
first currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and
notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Person against
such loss, and if the amount of the first currency so purchases
exceeds the sum originally due to such Person in the first
currency, such Person agrees to remit to the Borrower such excess.

                          MISCELLANEOUS

     15.01.  Assignments and Participations.  (a)  Assignments.  No
assignments or participations of any Lender's rights or obligations
under this Agreement shall be made except in accordance with this
Section 15.01.  Each Lender may assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including all of its rights and obligations with respect
to the Loans and the Letters of Credit) in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 15.01.  

     (b)     Limitations on Assignments.  Each assignment shall be
subject to the following conditions:  (i) each such assignment may
be of any of the following: (A) all of a Lender's outstanding Term
Loan, (B) all of a Lender's Revovling Credit Commitment (together
with its Revolving Loans and participations in outstanding Letters
of Credit), and (C) in the event the outstanding balance of the
assigning Lender's Term Loan is greater than $5,000,000 or the
amount of the assigning Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment is
greater than $5,000,000 and such Lender desires to assign a portion
of either its Term Loan or Revolving Credit Commitment, such
assignment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000,
(ii) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a
varying, ratable percentage of all of the assigning Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement which are subject to such
assignment, (iii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible
Assignee consented to by the Issuing Banks, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, (iv) the Borrower shall have
the right to approve each such Eligible Assignee which is not
another Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (v) the parties to each
such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an
Assignment and Acceptance.  Upon such execution, delivery,
acceptance and recording in the Register, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance and
agreed to by the Administrative Agent, (A) the assignee thereunder
shall, in addition to any rights and obligations hereunder held by
it immediately prior to such effective date, if any, have the
rights and obligations hereunder that have been assigned to it
pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, have the same rights and benefits
hereunder as if it were an original Lender hereunder, (B) the
assigning Lender shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment
and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of such
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the
assigning Lender shall cease to be a party hereto), and (C) the
Borrower shall execute and deliver to the assignee thereunder one
or more Notes, as applicable, evidencing its obligations to such
assignee with respect to the Loans.

     (c)  The Register.  The Administrative Agent shall maintain at
its address referred to in Section 15.08 a copy of each Assignment
and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register (the
"Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of the
Lenders and their respective Revolving Credit Commitments, and the
principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to
time and whether such Lender is an original Lender or the assignee
of another Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance.  The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower and each of their
Subsidiaries, the Administrative Agent, and the Lenders may treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall
be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

     (d)     Fee.  Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance
executed by the assigning Lender and an Eligible Assignee and a
processing and recordation fee of $3,000 (payable by the assigning
Lender or the assignee, as shall be agreed between them), the
Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has
been completed and is in compliance with this Agreement and in
substantially the form of Exhibit A, (i) accept such Assignment and
Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the
Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and
the other Lenders.

     (e)     Participations.  Each Lender may sell participations
to one or more other financial institutions in or to all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under and in respect of any
and all facilities under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, all or a portion of any or all of its Revolving Credit
Commitment hereunder and the Loans owing to it and its undivided
interest in the Letters of Credit); provided, however, that (i)
such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, its Revolving Credit Commitments hereunder) shall
remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible
to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations, (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and the
other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement and (iv) such participant's rights to agree or
to restrict such Lender's ability to agree to the modification,
waiver or release of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or to
the release of any Collateral covered by the Loan Documents, to
consent to any action or failure to act by any party to any of the
Loan Documents or any of their respective Affiliates, or to
exercise or refrain from exercising any powers or rights which any
Lender may have under or in respect of the Loan Documents or any
Collateral, shall be limited to the right to consent to (A)
increase in the Commitment of the Lender from whom such participant
purchased a participation, (B) reduction of the principal of, or
rate or amount of interest on the Loans(s) subject to such
participation (other than by the payment or prepayment thereof),
(C) postponement of any date fixed for any payment of principal of,
or interest on, the Loan(s) subject to such participation and (D)
release of any Guarantor or all or a substantial portion of the
Collateral except as provided in Section 13.09(c).  

     (f)     Payment to Participants.  Anything in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, in the case of any participation,
all amounts payable by the Borrower under the Loan Documents shall
be calculated and made in the manner and to the parties required
hereby as if no such participation had been sold; provided,
however, that each participant shall be the beneficiary of the
provisions of Article XIV to the extent amounts payable thereunder
do not exceed the amounts payable thereunder to the Lender from
which such participation has been purchased. 

     (g)  Lenders' Creation of Security Interests.  Notwithstanding
any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at
any time create a security interest in all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation,
Obligations owing to it and any Notes held by it) in favor of any
Federal Reserve bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Federal
Reserve Board.

     (h)  Assignments by Citicorp.  If Citicorp ceases to be a
Lender under this Agreement by virtue of any assignment made
pursuant to this Section 15.01, then, as of the effective date of
such cessation, Citibank's obligations to issue Letters of Credit
pursuant to Section 3.01 shall terminate and Citibank shall be an
Issuing Bank hereunder only with respect to outstanding Letters of
Credit issued prior to such date.

     (i)  Information Regarding the Borrower.  Any Lender may, in
connection with any assignment or participation or proposed
assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 15.01,
disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant, any information relating to the Borrower or their
Subsidiaries furnished to such Lender by the Administrative Agent
or by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided that, prior to any
such disclosure, such assignee or participant, or proposed assignee
or participant, shall agree to preserve in accordance with Section
15.20 the confidentiality of any confidential information described
therein.

     15.02.  Expenses.  (a)  Generally.  The Borrower agrees upon
demand to pay, or reimburse the Administrative Agent for, all of
the Administrative Agent's reasonable internal and external audit,

without limitation, the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements
of Sidley & Austin, local legal counsel, auditors, accountants,

(iii) the creation, perfection or protection of the Liens under the

collection or enforcement of any of the Obligations or the
enforcement of any of the Loan Documents; (vi) the commencement,
defense or intervention in any court proceeding relating in any way

(vii) the response to, and preparation for, any subpoena or request
for document production with which the Administrative Agent is

their Subsidiaries, this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents; and (viii) any amendments, consents, waivers,
assignments, restatements, or supplements to any of the Loan

     (b)  After Default.  The Borrower further agrees to pay or
reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the
Lenders upon demand for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees
(including allocated costs of internal counsel and costs of
settlement) incurred by any of them after the occurrence of an
Event of Default (i) in enforcing any Loan Document or Obligation
or any security therefor or exercising or enforcing any other right
or remedy available by reason of such Event of Default; (ii) in
connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the credit
arrangements provided under this Agreement in the nature of a
"work-out" or in any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding; (iii) in
commencing, defending or intervening in any litigation or in filing
a petition, complaint, answer, motion or other pleadings in any
legal proceeding relating to the Obligations, the Property, the

of the transactions contemplated hereby or by any of the other Loan
Documents; and (iv) in taking any other action in or with respect
to any suit or proceeding (bankruptcy or otherwise) described in
clauses (i) through (iii) above.

     15.03.  Indemnity.  The Borrower further agrees (a) to defend,
protect, indemnify, and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and
each and all of the Lenders and Issuing Banks and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents
(including, without limitation, those retained in connection with
the satisfaction or attempted satisfaction of any of the conditions
set forth in Article VI) (collectively, the "Indemnitees") from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses (other than
loss of profits), damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever (excluding any taxes and including, without limitation,
the fees and disbursements of counsel for such Indemnitees in
connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial
proceeding, whether or not such Indemnitees shall be designated a
party thereto), imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such
Indemnitees in any manner relating to or arising out of (i) this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any act, event or
transaction related or attendant thereto, the making of the Loans
and the issuance of and participation in Letters of Credit
hereunder, the management of such Loans or Letters of Credit, the
use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loans or Letters of
Credit hereunder, or any of the other transactions contemplated by
any of the Loan Documents, or (ii) any Liabilities and Costs
relating to any violation by the Borrower, its Subsidiaries, or the
Guarantors, or their respective predecessors-in-interest of any
Environmental, Health or Safety Requirements of Law, the past,
present or future operations of the Borrower, its Subsidiaries, any
Guarantor, or any of their respective predecessors in interest, or,
the past, present or future environmental, health or safety
condition of any respective past, present or future Property of the
Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries, or any Guarantor, the presence
of asbestos-containing materials at any respective past, present or
future Property of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries, or any
Guarantor, or the Release or threatened Release of any Contaminant
into the environment by the Borrower, its Subsidiaries, any
Guarantor, or their respective predecessors-in-interest, or the
Release or threatened Release of any Contaminant into the
environment from or at any facility to which the Borrower, any of
its Subsidiaries, or any Guarantor, or their respective
predecessors-in-interest sent or directly arranged the transport of
any Contaminant (collectively, the "Indemnified Matters");
provided, however, the Borrower shall have no obligation to an
Indemnitee hereunder with respect to Indemnified Matters caused by
or resulting from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of
such Indemnitee, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
and (b) not to assert any claim against any of the Indemnified
Parties on any theory of liability for special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages arising out of, or in any way in
connection with, the Revolving Credit Commitments, the Obligations
or any other matters governed by this Agreement and/or the other
Loan Documents.  To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify,
pay and hold harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be
unenforceable because it is violative of any law or public policy,
the Borrower shall contribute the maximum portion which it is
permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law, to the payment
and satisfaction of all Indemnified Matters incurred by the
Indemnitees. The Administrative Agent, Lenders and the Issuing
Banks agree to notify the Borrower of the institution or assertion
of any Indemnified Matter, but the parties hereto hereby agree that
the failure to so notify the Borrower shall not release the
Borrower from its obligations hereunder.

     15.04.  Change in Accounting Principles.  If any change in the
accounting principles used in the preparation of the most recent
Financial Statements referred to in Section 8.01 are hereafter
required or permitted by the rules, regulations, pronouncements and
opinions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (or successors
thereto or agencies with similar functions) and are adopted by the
Borrower with the agreement of its independent certified public
accountants and such changes result in a change in the method or
result of calculation of any of the covenants, standards or terms
found in Article IX, Article X, and Article XI, the parties hereto
agree to enter into negotiations in order to amend such provisions
so as to equitably reflect such changes with the desired result
that the criteria for evaluating compliance with such covenants,
standards and terms by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall be
the same after such changes as if such changes had not been made;
provided, however, no change in such accounting principles that
would affect the method of calculation of any of the covenants,
standards or terms shall be given effect in such calculations until
such provisions are amended, in a manner satisfactory to the
Requisite Lenders and the Borrower, to so reflect such change in
accounting principles.

     15.05.  Setoff.  In addition to any Liens granted under the
Loan Documents and any rights now or hereafter granted under
applicable law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
any Event of Default, each Lender, each Issuing Bank and any
Affiliate of any Lender or Issuing Bank is hereby authorized by the
Borrower at any time or from time to time, without notice to any
Person (any such notice being hereby expressly waived) to set off
and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or
special, including, but not limited to, indebtedness evidenced by
certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured (but not
including trust accounts)) and any other Indebtedness at any time
held or owing by such Lender, Issuing Bank or any of their
Affiliates to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower
against and on account of the Obligations of the Borrower to such
Lender, Issuing Bank or any of their Affiliates, including, but not
limited to, all Loans and Letters of Credit and all claims of any
nature or description arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, irrespective of whether or not (i) such Lender or
Issuing Bank shall have made any demand hereunder or (ii) the
Administrative Agent, at the request or with the consent of the
Requisite Lenders, shall have declared the principal of and
interest on the Loans and other amounts due hereunder to be due and
payable as permitted by Article XII and even though such
Obligations may be contingent or unmatured.  Each Lender and each
Issuing Bank agrees that it shall not, without the express consent
of the Requisite Lenders, and that it shall, to the extent it is
lawfully entitled to do so, upon the request of the Requisite
Lenders, exercise its setoff rights hereunder against any accounts
of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries, or a Guarantor now or
hereafter maintained with such Lender, Issuing Bank or any
Affiliate of such Lender or Issuing Bank.

     15.06.  Ratable Sharing. The Lenders agree among themselves
that (i) with respect to all amounts received by them which are
applicable to the payment of the Obligations (excluding the fees
described in Section 5.03 and Article XIV), equitable adjustment
will be made so that, in effect, all such amounts will be shared
among them ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares,
whether received by voluntary payment, by the exercise of the right
of setoff or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross-action or by
the enforcement of any or all of the Obligations (excluding the
fees described in Section 5.03 and Article XIV) or the Collateral,
(ii) if any of them shall by voluntary payment or by the exercise
of any right of counterclaim, setoff, banker's lien or otherwise,
receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of the
Obligations held by it, which is greater than the amount which such
Lender is entitled to receive hereunder, the Lender receiving such
excess payment shall purchase, without recourse or warranty, an
undivided interest and participation (which it shall be deemed to
have done simultaneously upon the receipt of such payment) in such
Obligations owed to the others so that all such recoveries with
respect to such Obligations shall be applied ratably in accordance
with their Pro Rata Shares; provided, however, that if all or part
of such excess payment received by the purchasing party is
thereafter recovered from it, those purchases shall be rescinded
and the purchase prices paid for such participations shall be
returned to such party to the extent necessary to adjust for such
recovery, but without interest except to the extent the purchasing
party is required to pay interest in connection with such recovery. 
The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation
from another Lender pursuant to this Section 15.06 may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including, subject to Section 15.05, the right of setoff) with
respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the
direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.
     15.07.  Amendments and Waivers.  (a) General Provisions. 
Unless otherwise provided for or required in this Agreement, no
amendment or modification of any provision of this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents shall be effective without the written
agreement of the Requisite Lenders (which the Requisite Lenders
shall have the right to grant or withhold in their sole discretion)
and the Borrower. No termination or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or consent to any
departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall be effective without the
written concurrence of the Requisite Lenders, which the Requisite
Lenders shall have the right to grant or withhold in their sole
discretion.  All amendments, modifications, waivers and consents
not specifically reserved to Lenders, Issuing Banks, and the
Administrative Agent in Section 15.07(b), Section 15.07(c) and in
other provisions of this Agreement shall require only the approval
of the Requisite Lenders. Any waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which it was given. No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any
case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or
demand in similar or other circumstances. 

     (b)  Amendments, Consents and Waivers by Super- Majority
Lenders.  Any amendment, modification, termination, waiver or
consent with respect to any of the provisions of Section 4.01(b) of
this Agreement shall be effective only by a written agreement
signed by the Super-Majority Lenders.

     (c)  Amendments, Consents and Waivers by All Lenders.  Any
amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent with
respect to any of the following provisions of this Agreement shall
be effective only by a written agreement, signed by each Lender:

(i) increase in the amount of any of the Revolving Credit
Commitments,

(ii) reduction of the principal of, rate or amount of interest on
the Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations, or any fees or other
amounts payable to the Lenders or Issuing Banks (other than by the
payment or prepayment thereof),

(iii) postponement of the Revolving Credit Termination Date or any
date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the
Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations or any fees or other amounts
payable to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, except to the extent
provided for in clause (b) above,

(iv)  the orders of priority of applications set forth in Section
4.01, 

(v)  change in the definitions of the Revolving Credit Commitments,
Term Loans, Requisite Lenders or Super-Majority Lenders;

(vi)  waiver of any of the conditions specified in Sections 6.01 or
6.02 or the covenant set forth in Section 9.15,

(vii)  release of any Guarantor or all or a substantial portion of
the Collateral (except as provided in Section 13.09(c)),

(viii)  change in the aggregate Pro Rata Share of the Lenders which
shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take action
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents,

(ix)  amendment of Section 15.01 or this Section 15.07,

(x)  assignment of any right or interest in or under this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents by the Borrower, and

(xi)  waiver of any Event of Default described in Sections
12.01(a), (f), (g), (h), and (n).

     (d)  Administrative Agent Authority.  The Administrative Agent
may, but shall have no obligation to, with the written concurrence
of any Lender, execute amendments, modifications, waivers or
consents on behalf of that Lender.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 15.07, no amendment,
modification, waiver or consent shall affect the rights or duties
of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, unless made in writing and signed by the Administrative
Agent in addition to the Lenders required above to take such
action; and the order of priority set forth in clauses (A) through
(C) of Section 4.02(b) may be changed only with the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent.  Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, in the event that the Borrower shall have
requested, in writing, that any Lender agree to an amendment,
modification, waiver or consent with respect to any particular
provision or provisions of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, and such Lender shall have failed to state, in writing,
that it either agrees or disagrees (in full or in part) with all
such requests (in the case of its statement of agreement, subject
to satisfactory documentation and such other conditions it may
specify) within thirty (30) days after such request, then such
Lender shall be deemed to not have approved such amendment,
modification, waiver or consent and the Administrative Agent shall
thereupon determine whether the Lenders required above to take the
requested action have approved the same within the required time
and communicate such determination to the Borrower and the Lenders.

     15.08.  Notices.  Unless otherwise specifically provided
herein, any notice or other communication herein required or
permitted to be given shall be in writing and may be personally
served, sent by facsimile transmission or courier service or United
States certified mail and shall be deemed to have been given when
delivered in person or by courier service, upon receipt of a
facsimile transmission, or four (4) Business Days after deposit in
the United States mail with postage prepaid and properly addressed. 
Notices to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Articles II, IV or
XIII shall not be effective until received by the Administrative
Agent.  For the purposes hereof, the addresses of the parties
hereto (until notice of a change thereof is delivered as provided
in this Section 15.08) shall be as set forth below each party's
name on the signature pages hereof or the signature page of any
applicable Assignment and Acceptance, or, as to each party, at such
other address as may be designated by such party in a written
notice to all of the other parties to this Agreement.

     15.09.  Survival of Warranties and Agreements.  All
representations and warranties made herein and all covenants and
other obligations of the Borrower in respect of taxes,
indemnification and expense reimbursement shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, the making and repayment of the Loans, the issuance and
discharge of Letters of Credit hereunder and the termination of
this Agreement and shall not be limited in any way by the passage
of time or occurrence of any event and shall expressly cover time
periods when the Administrative Agent, any of the Issuing Banks or
any of the Lenders may have come into possession or control of any
of the Borrower's or its Subsidiaries' Property.

     15.10.  Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. 
No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent, any
Lender or any Issuing Bank in the exercise of any power, right or
privilege under any of the Loan Documents shall impair such power,
right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or
acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further
exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege.  All
rights and remedies existing under the Loan Documents are
cumulative to and not exclusive of any rights or remedies otherwise
available.

     15.11.  Marshalling; Payments Set Aside.  None of the
Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank shall be under
any obligation to marshall any assets in favor of the Borrower or
any other Person or against or in payment of any or all of the
Obligations.  To the extent that the Borrower makes a payment or
payments to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing
Banks or any of such Persons receives payment from the proceeds of
the Collateral or exercises its rights of setoff, and such payment
or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any
part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to
a trustee, receiver or any other party, then to the extent of such
recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be
satisfied, and all Liens, right and remedies therefor, shall be
revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment
had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

     15.12.  Severability.  In case any provision in or obligation
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or
obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other
jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

     15.13.  Headings.  Section headings in this Agreement are
included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not
constitute a part of this Agreement or be given any substantive
effect.

     15.14.  Governing Law.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE INTERPRETED,
AND THE RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES OF THE PARTIES HERETO DETERMINED, IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

     15.15.  Limitation of Liability.  No claim may be made by the
Borrower, any Lender, any Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent,
or any other Person against the Administrative Agent, any other
Issuing Bank or any other Lender or the Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, attorneys or agents of any of them for any
special, consequential or punitive damages in respect of any claim
for breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising out
of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith;
and the Borrower, each Lender, each Issuing Bank, and the
Administrative Agent hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue
upon any such claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued
and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.

     15.16.  Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and the successors and permitted assigns of the
Lenders and the Issuing Banks.  The rights hereunder of the
Borrower, or any interest therein, may not be assigned without the
written consent of all Lenders.

     15.17.  Certain Consents and Waivers of the Borrower.

     (a) Personal Jurisdiction.  (i) EACH OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT, THE LENDERS, THE ISSUING BANKS, THE BORROWER IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS, FOR ITSELF AND ITS PROPERTY, TO THE
NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY NEW YORK STATE COURT OR FEDERAL
COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK, AND ANY COURT HAVING
JURISDICTION OVER APPEALS OF MATTERS HEARD IN SUCH COURTS, IN ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH, RELATED TO OR
INCIDENTAL TO THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED AMONG THEM IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, WHETHER ARISING IN
CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, OR FOR RECOGNITION OR
ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT, AND EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT
OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN
SUCH STATE COURT OR, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN SUCH
FEDERAL COURT.  THE BORROWER IRREVOCABLY DESIGNATES AND APPOINTS
TFC, 110 EAST 59TH STREET, 30TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10022, AS
ITS AGENT (THE "PROCESS AGENT") FOR SERVICE OF ALL PROCESS IN ANY
SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT, SUCH SERVICE BEING HEREBY
ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE EFFECTIVE AND BINDING SERVICE IN EVERY RESPECT. 
EACH OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE LENDERS, THE ISSUING BANKS,
AND THE BORROWER AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR
PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER
JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER
PROVIDED BY LAW.  THE BORROWER WAIVES IN ALL DISPUTES ANY OBJECTION
THAT IT MAY HAVE TO THE LOCATION OF THE COURT CONSIDERING THE
DISPUTE.

     (ii)  THE BORROWER AGREES THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT SHALL
HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROCEED AGAINST IT OR ITS PROPERTY IN A COURT IN
ANY LOCATION TO ENABLE THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE ISSUING BANKS
AND THE LENDERS TO REALIZE ON THE COLLATERAL OR ANY OTHER SECURITY
FOR THE OBLIGATIONS, OR TO ENFORCE A JUDGMENT OR OTHER COURT ORDER
ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY ISSUING BANK OR
ANY LENDER.  THE BORROWER AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT ANY
PERMISSIVE COUNTERCLAIMS IN ANY PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY LENDER OR ANY ISSUING BANK TO REALIZE ON
THE COLLATERAL OR ANY OTHER SECURITY FOR THE OBLIGATIONS, OR TO
ENFORCE A JUDGMENT OR OTHER COURT ORDER IN FAVOR OF THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY LENDER OR ANY ISSUING BANK.  THE BORROWER
WAIVES ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY HAVE TO THE LOCATION OF THE COURT
IN WHICH THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY ISSUING BANK OR ANY LENDER
MAY COMMENCE A PROCEEDING DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION.

     (b)  Service of Process.  THE BORROWER IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO
THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OF ANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED COURTS IN ANY
SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF BY
REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO THE PROCESS AGENT
OR THE BORROWER'S NOTICE ADDRESS SPECIFIED BELOW, SUCH SERVICE TO
BECOME EFFECTIVE FIVE (5) DAYS AFTER SUCH MAILING.  THE BORROWER
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY OBJECTION OF THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF
FORUM NON CONVENIENS) WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE
BRINGING OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT IN ANY JURISDICTION SET FORTH
ABOVE.  NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS IN
ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE BORROWER IN
THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

     (c)  Waiver of Jury Trial.  EACH OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT,
LENDERS, ISSUING BANKS, AND THE BORROWER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT. ANY OF THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT, LENDERS, OR ISSUING BANKS MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART
OR A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF
THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY.

     15.18.  Counterparts; Effectiveness; Inconsistencies.  This
Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents, or supplements
hereto may be executed in counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such
counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same
instrument.  This Agreement shall become effective against the
Borrower, each Lender, each Issuing Bank, and the Administrative
Agent on the Effective Date, whereupon the terms and provisions of
the First Amended Agreement shall be and hereby are amended,
superseded and restated in their entirety by the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not constitute
a novation. This Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents
shall be construed to the extent reasonable to be consistent one
with the other, but to the extent that the terms and conditions of
this Agreement are actually inconsistent with the terms and
conditions of any other Loan Document, this Agreement shall govern.

     15.19.  Limitation on Agreements.  All agreements between and
among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each
Issuing Bank in the Loan Documents are hereby expressly limited so
that in no event shall any of the Loans or other amounts payable by
the Borrower under any of the Loan Documents constitute "purpose
credit" within the meaning of Regulation U or G.

     15.20.  Confidentiality.  Subject to Section15.01(f), the
Lenders and the Issuing Banks shall hold all nonpublic information
obtained pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement and
identified as such by the Borrower in accordance with such Lender's
or such Issuing Bank's customary procedures for handling
confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe
and sound banking practices and in any event may make disclosure
(a) to its Affiliates or (b) as is reasonably required by a bona
fide offeree, transferee or participant in connection with a
contemplated assignment, transfer or participation permitted under
Section 15.01 or (c) as required or requested by any Governmental
Authority or representative thereof or pursuant to legal process or
(d) to any direct or indirect contractual counterparties in swap
agreements or such contractual counterparties' professional
advisors, provided that such offeree, transferee, participant,
contractual counterparty or professional advisor to such
contractual counterparty agrees, in writing, to keep such
information confidential to the same extent required of the Lenders
hereunder.  In no event shall any Lender or any Issuing Bank be
obligated or required to return any materials furnished by the
Borrower; provided, however, each offeree shall be required to
agree that if it does not become a transferee or participant it
shall return all materials furnished to it by the Borrower in
connection with this Agreement.  Any and all confidentiality
agreements entered into between any Lender or any Issuing Bank and
the Borrower shall survive the execution of this Agreement.

     15.21.  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, taken together with
all of the other Loan Documents, embodies the entire agreement and
understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, written and oral, relating to the
subject matter hereof.

     15.22.  Advice of Counsel.  The Borrower and each Lender and
Issuing Bank understand that the Administrative Agent's counsel
represents only the Administrative Agent's and its Affiliates'
interests and that the Borrower, other Lenders and other Issuing
Banks are advised to obtain their own counsel. The Borrower
represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent  and the other
Holders that it has discussed this Agreement with its counsel.
