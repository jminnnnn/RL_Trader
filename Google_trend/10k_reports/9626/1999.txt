ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
- -----------------

INTRODUCTION

     The business of The Bank of New York Company, Inc. (the "Company") and 
its subsidiaries is described in "The Businesses of The Bank of New York" 
section of the Company's 1998 Annual Report to Shareholders which description 
is included in Exhibit 13 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.  
Also, the "Management's Discussion and Analysis" section included in Exhibit 
13 contains financial and statistical information on the operations of the 
Company.  Such information is herein incorporated by reference.

CERTAIN REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

General

     As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to the regulation and 
supervision of the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act 
("BHC Act").  The Company is also subject to regulation by the New York State 
Department of Banking.  Under the BHC Act, bank holding companies may not 
directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of the 
voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company, including a 
bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.  In addition, 
bank holding companies are generally prohibited under the BHC Act from 
engaging in nonbanking activities, subject to certain exceptions.

     The Company's subsidiary banks are subject to supervision and examination 
by applicable federal and state banking agencies.  The Bank of New York 
("BNY"), a New York chartered banking corporation, is a member of the Federal 
Reserve System and is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by 
the Federal Reserve Board.  BNY is also subject to regulation, supervision and 
examination by the New York Banking Department.

     Both federal and state laws extensively regulate various aspects of the 
banking business, such as permissible types and amounts of loans and 
investments, permissible activities, and reserve requirements.  These 
regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather 
than the Company's stockholders.

Capital Adequacy

     The Federal bank regulators have adopted risk-based capital guidelines 
for bank holding companies and banks.  The minimum ratio of qualifying total 
capital ("Total Capital") to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-
balance sheet items) is 8%.  At least half of the total capital is to consist 
of common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, 
minority interests (including trust preferred securities) and, for bank 
holding companies, a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual 
preferred stock, less most intangibles including goodwill ("Tier 1 Capital").  
The remainder ("Tier 2 Capital") may consist of other preferred stock, certain 
other instruments, and limited amounts of subordinated debt and the loan and 
lease allowance.  Not more than 25% of qualifying Tier 1 Capital may consist 
of trust preferred securities.

     In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum Leverage 
Ratio (Tier 1 Capital to average total assets) guidelines for bank holding 
companies and banks.  The Federal Reserve Board's guidelines provide for a 
minimum Leverage Ratio of 3% for bank holding companies and banks that meet 
certain specified criteria, including those having the highest regulatory 
rating.  All other banking organizations will be required to maintain a 
Leverage Ratio of at least 3% plus an additional cushion of 100 to 200 basis 
points.  The guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing 
internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong 
capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without 
significant reliance on intangible assets.  At December 31, 1998, the Federal 
Reserve Board has not advised the Company of any specific minimum Leverage 
Ratio applicable to it.  See "FDICIA" below.  

<PAGE> 3

     Federal banking agencies have recently issued regulations that modify 
existing rules related to capital ratios with respect to various areas of risk 
including interest rate exposure and other market risk.  The Company does not 
believe that the aggregate impact of these modifications would have a 
significant impact on its capital position.  


FDICIA

     The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 
("FDICIA") among other things, requires the federal banking regulators to take 
prompt corrective action in respect of FDIC-insured depository institutions 
that do not meet minimum capital requirements.  FDICIA establishes five 
capital tiers: "well capitalized", "adequately capitalized," 
"undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" and "critically 
undercapitalized."  An FDIC-insured bank is defined to be: (i) well 
capitalized if it maintains a Leverage Ratio of at least 5%, a Tier 1 Capital 
Ratio (Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets and certain off-balance sheet 
items) of at least 6% and a Total Capital Ratio of at least 10%; (ii) 
adequately capitalized if it maintains a Leverage Ratio of at least 4% (or a 
Leverage Ratio of at least 3% if it is rated Composite 1 in its most recent 
report of examination, subject to appropriate federal banking agency 
guidelines), a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 4% and a Total Capital Ratio of at 
least 8% and is not defined to be well capitalized; (iii) undercapitalized if 
it has a Leverage Ratio of less than 4% (or a Leverage Ratio that is less than 
3% if it is rated Composite 1 in its most recent report of examination, 
subject to appropriate federal banking agency guidelines), a Tier 1 Capital 
Ratio less than 4% and a Total Capital Ratio of less than 8% and it does not 
meet the definition of a significantly undercapitalized or critically 
undercapitalized institution; (iv) significantly undercapitalized if it has a 
Leverage Ratio of less than 3%, a Tier 1 Capital Ratio less than 3% and a 
Total Capital Ratio of less than 6% and it does not meet the definition of 
critically undercapitalized; and (v) critically undercapitalized if it 
maintains a level of tangible equity capital equal to or less than 2% of total 
assets. A bank may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower 
than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an 
unsatisfactory examination rating.  FDICIA imposes progressively more 
restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, 
depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified.

     FDICIA generally prohibits an FDIC-insured depository institution from 
making any capital distribution (including payment of dividends) or paying any 
management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would 
thereafter be undercapitalized.  Undercapitalized depository institutions are 
subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration 
plan.  The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without 
determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic 
assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution's 
capital.  In addition, for an undercapitalized depository institution's 
capital restoration plan to be acceptable, its holding company must guarantee 
the capital plan up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository 
institution's assets at the time it became undercapitalized and the amount of 
the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan.  In 
the event of the parent holding company's bankruptcy, such guarantee would 
take priority over the parent's general unsecured creditors.  If a depository 
institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is 
significantly undercapitalized.

     Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to 
a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient 
voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total 
assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.  
Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment 
of a receiver or conservator.  A depository institution that is not well 
capitalized is subject to certain limitations on brokered deposits.

     A discussion of the Company's capital position and capital adequacy is 
incorporated by reference from "Capital Resources" in the "Management's 

<PAGE> 4

Discussion and Analysis" Section and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements of Exhibit 13.

FDIC Insurance Assessments 

     BNY is subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments.  As required by 
FDICIA, the FDIC adopted a risk-based premium schedule to determine the 
assessment rates for most FDIC-insured depository institutions.  Effective 
January 1, 1997, under the schedule, the premiums range from zero to $.27 for 
every $100 of deposits.  Each financial institution is assigned to one of nine 
categories based on the institutions capital ratios and supervisory 
evaluations, and the premium paid by the institution is based on the category.  
Under the present schedule institutions in the highest of the three capital 
categories and the highest of three supervisory categories pay no premium and 
institutions in the lowest of these categories pay $.27 per $100 of deposits.  
In addition, the Deposit Insurance Funds Act provides for assessments at all 
insured depository institutions to pay for the cost of the Financing 
Corporation (a governmental agency) funding.  The assessment will be based on 
deposit levels and will be approximately 1.76 basis points.  BNY paid no FDIC 
insurance premiums in 1998.

     The FDIC is authorized to raise insurance premiums in certain 
circumstances.  Any increase in premiums would have an adverse effect on the 
Company's earnings.  

     Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon 
a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is 
in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any 
applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by a bank's 
federal regulatory agency.

Depositor Preference

     The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 provides for a domestic 
depositor preference on amounts realized from the liquidation or other 
resolution of any depository institution insured by the FDIC.

<PAGE> 6

Acquisitions

     The BHC Act generally limits acquisitions by the Company to commercial 
banks and companies engaged in activities that the Federal Reserve Board has 
determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident 
thereto.  The Company's direct activities are generally limited to furnishing 
services to its subsidiaries and activities that qualify under the "closely 
related" and "proper incident" tests.  Prior Federal Reserve Board approval is 
required under the BHC Act for new activities and acquisitions of most 
nonbanking companies.

     The BHC Act, the Federal Bank Merger Act, and the New York Banking Law 
regulate the acquisition of commercial banks.  The BHC Act requires the prior 
approval of the Federal Reserve Board for the direct or indirect acquisition 
of more than 5% of the voting shares of a commercial bank.

     The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 
("IBBEA") permits bank holding companies, with Federal Reserve Board approval, 
to acquire banks located in states other than the bank holding company's home 
state without regard to whether the transaction is permitted under state law.  
In addition, IBBEA provides that national banks and state banks with different 
home states are permitted to merge across state lines, with the approval of 
the appropriate federal banking agency, unless the home state of a 
participating bank passed legislation between the date of enactment of IBBEA 
and May 31, 1997 expressly prohibiting interstate mergers.  Most states, 
including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have not passed legislation 
prohibiting interstate mergers.  A bank may also establish and operate a de 
novo branch in a state in which the bank does not maintain a branch if that 
state expressly permits de novo branching.  Once a bank has established 
branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may 
establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where 
any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have established 
or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law.  A bank that has 
established a branch in a state through de novo branching may establish and 
acquire additional branches in such state in the same manner and to the same 
extent as a bank having a branch in such state as a result of an interstate 
merger.

     The merger of BNY with another bank would require the approval of the 
Federal Reserve Board or other federal bank regulatory authority and, if the 
surviving bank is a New York state bank, the New York Superintendent of Banks.

     In reviewing bank acquisition and merger applications, the bank 
regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive 
effect of the transaction, financial and managerial issues including the 
capital position of the combined organization, and convenience and needs 
factors, including the applicant's record under the Community Reinvestment 
Act.

     Under Federal Reserve Board policy, the Company is expected to act as a 
source of financial strength to its banks and to commit resources to support 
such banks in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy.  In 
addition, any loans by the Company to its banks would be subordinate in right 
of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of its banks.

Restrictions on Transfer of Funds

     Restrictions on the transfer of funds to the Company and subsidiary bank 
dividend limitations are discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements included in Exhibit 13.  Such discussion is incorporated herein by 
reference.

Cross Guarantees

     Under FDIA, a financial institution insured by the FDIC that is under 
common control with a failed or failing FDIC-insured institution can be 
required to indemnify the FDIC for losses resulting from the insolvency of the 
failed institution, even if this causes the affiliated institution also to 
become insolvent.  Any obligation or liability owed by a subsidiary depository 

<PAGE> 7

institution to its parent company is subordinate to the subsidiary's cross-
guarantee liability with respect to commonly controlled insured depository 
institutions and to the rights of depositors.

Market Risk Management
- ----------------------

     Market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in the financial 
markets.  Market risk arises from derivative financial instruments, such as 
futures, forwards, swaps and options, and other financial instruments, such as 
loans, securities, deposits and other borrowings.  The market risks are 
primarily interest rate and foreign exchange risk, as well as credit risk.  
Market risk associated with the Company's trading activities and 
asset/liability management activities is managed and controlled as discussed 
under "Market Risk Management", "Trading Activities and Risk Management" and, 
"Asset/Liability Management" in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis" 
section of Exhibit 13.  Such discussion is incorporated herein by reference.

    The information presented with respect to market risk is forward looking 
information.  As such it is subject to risks and uncertainties that could 
cause actual results to differ materially from projected results discussed in 
this Report.  These include adverse changes in market conditions and the 
actions that management could take in response to these changes.

Interest Rate Sensitivity
- -------------------------

     A discussion of the Company's interest rate sensitivity management 
activities is incorporated by reference from "Asset/Liability Management" in 
the "Management's Discussion and Analysis" section of Exhibit 13.

     The following table reflects the year-end position of the Company's 
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that either reprice 
or mature within the designated time periods.  The interest sensitivity 
indicated by this table is not necessarily indicative of the Company's 
interest sensitivity models (discussed under "Asset/Liability Management" in 
the "Management's Discussion and Analysis" section of Exhibit 13) because 
within each time period, assets and liabilities reprice on different dates and 
at different levels, and interest sensitivity gaps change daily.  A positive 
interest sensitivity gap, for a particular time period, is one in which more 
assets reprice or mature than liabilities.  A negative interest sensitivity 
gap results from a greater amount of liabilities repricing or maturing.  A 
positive gap implies that there are more rate sensitive assets than 
liabilities which suggests that as interest rates rise, the return on assets 
will rise faster than the funding costs.  Conversely, a negative gap indicates 
more rate sensitive liabilities than assets.  In such case, if interest rates 
rise, then funding costs will rise at a faster rate than the return on assets.  
The cumulative gap is the sum of the dollar gap for sequential time periods.

Credit Risk Management
- ----------------------

     Credit risk represents the possibility that the Company would suffer a 
loss if a borrower or other counterparty were to default on its obligations to 
the Company.  Credit risk exposure arises primarily from lending activities, 
as well as from interest rate, foreign exchange, and securities processing 
products.  For derivative financial instruments, total credit exposure 
consists of current and potential exposure.  Current credit exposure 
represents the replacement cost of the transaction.  Potential credit exposure 
is a statistically based estimate of the future replacement cost of the 
transaction.  The Company has established policies and procedures to manage 
the level and composition of its credit risk on both a transaction and a 
portfolio basis.  In managing the aggregate credit extension to individual 
customers, the Company measures the amount at risk on derivative financial 
instruments as the total of current and potential credit exposure.

     The Credit Policy Committee is responsible for developing and maintaining 
credit risk policies, as well as for overseeing and reviewing credit 
guidelines.  Through the use of a credit approval process and established 
credit limits, the Company evaluates the credit quality of counterparties, 
industries, products, and countries.  The Company seeks to reduce both on and 
off-balance-sheet credit risk through portfolio diversification, loan 
participations, syndications, asset sales, credit enhancements, risk reduction 
arrangements, and netting agreements.


<PAGE> 12

     Although the Company attempts to minimize its exposure to credit risk, 
this risk is inherent in the banking industry and can increase as a result of 
general economic developments.

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses
- -----------------------------------------

     The provision for credit losses was $20 million in 1998, compared with 
$280 million in 1997 and $600 million in 1996.  The decrease in the provision 
compared with 1997 and 1996 was primarily due to the sale of credit card 
receivables, continued low charge-offs in the remainder of the loan portfolio, 
and a further reduction in nonperforming loans

     Nonperforming assets declined by 7% to $193 million at December 31, 1998.  
The decrease in nonperforming assets during 1998 is attributable to charge-
offs and writedowns of $18 million and paydowns, sales, and returns to accrual 
status of $79 million.  The decrease was partially offset by $82 million of 
loans placed on nonperforming status.


A summary of nonperforming assets is presented in the following table.

     Net charge-offs were $29 million in 1998, $354 million in 1997, and $455 
million in 1996.  In 1998, net charge-offs were mainly related to commercial 
loans, while net charge-offs were primarily attributable to credit card loans 
in 1997 and 1996.  The total allowance for credit losses was $636 million and 
$641 million at year-end 1998 and 1997.  The ratio of the total allowance for 
credit losses to year-end loans was 1.66% and 1.82% at December 31, 1998 and 
1997 reflecting a $3.3 billion increase in loans in 1998.

     At December 31, 1998 and 1997, the Company's nonperforming real estate 
loans and real estate acquired in satisfaction of loans aggregated $40 million 
and $50 million, respectively.  Real estate loan net recoveries were $7 
million in 1998  and $3 million in 1997.  In addition, other real estate 
charges were $2 million and $11 million in 1998 and 1997.  Other real estate 
charges in 1997 primarily relate to the sale of one property in Florida. 

     At December 31, 1998, the Company's emerging markets exposures consisted 
of $70 million in medium-term loans (and no material commitments), $1,258 
million in short-term loans, primarily trade related, and $113 million in 
investments.  In addition, the Company has $313 million of debt securities of 
emerging market countries, including $219 million (book value) of bonds whose 
principal payments are collateralized by U.S. Treasury zero coupon obligations 
and whose interest payments are partially collateralized.  Emerging market 
countries where the Company has exposure include Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, 
China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Honduras, 
Indonesia, Iraq, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Panama, Peru, 
Philippines, Russia, Thailand, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Vietnam.

     The Company's consumer loan portfolio is comprised principally of other 
installment and residential loans.  Residential and auto loans are 
collateralized, thereby reducing the risk.

     The Company's loans to the energy industry primarily consist of credits 
with investor-owned electric and gas utilities, and oil, gas and mining 
companies.  There were no nonperforming loans to borrowers in this industry at 
December 31, 1998 and 1997. There were no charge-offs in this industry in 1998 
and there were $2 million charge-offs in 1997.

     The Company's loans to the media and telecommunications industries 
primarily consist of credits with cable television operators, broadcasters, 
magazine and newspaper publishers, motion picture theaters and regional 
telephone companies.  There were no nonperforming loans to borrowers in these 
industries at December 31, 1998 and 1997.  There were no charge-offs in these 
industries in 1998 and there were $6 million charge-offs in 1997.

     The Company's portfolio of loans for purchasing or carrying securities is 
comprised largely of overnight loans which are fully collateralized, with 
appropriate margins, by marketable securities.  Throughout its many years of 
experience in this area, the Company has rarely experienced a loss.

     The Company makes loans to mortgage bankers to fund their operations and  
mortgages to be sold to investors.  Frequently these loans are collateralized 
by the mortgages sold to investors. There were no nonperforming loans at 
December 31, 1998 and 1997, and no charge-offs in 1998 and 1997.  A $44 
million loan to a mortgage lender became nonperforming in the first quarter of 
1999.

Introduction of the Euro
- ------------------------
     In January 1999, eleven European countries adopted the euro as their 
common legal currency.  In the transition period from adoption through 
December 31, 2001, commerce may be conducted in either the euro or the former 
national currencies.

     The Company has adapted its information technology systems and business 
practices to accommodate euro-denominated transactions.  The introduction of 
the euro currency may result in increased price transparency in the euro-area 
countries as well as a loss of cross-currency trading in the former national 
currencies, and may ultimately have profound political and financial 
implications.  Based on its knowledge at this time, the Company does not 
anticipate that the introduction of the euro will have a material effect on 
the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
- ----------------------------------------------------------
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
         -----------------------------------
     Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results 
of operations is incorporated herein by reference from the corresponding 
section of Exhibit 13.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

     The Company or its executive officers and directors on behalf of the 
Company, may from time to time make forward looking statements.  To the extent 
that any forward looking statements are made, the Company is necessarily 
unable to predict future changes in interest rates, economic activity, 
consumer behavior, government monetary policy, legislation and regulation, 
competition, and loan demand.  In addition, the Company's future results of 
operations and other forward looking statements contained in "Management's 
Discussion and Analysis" and elsewhere in this Form 10-K involve a number of 
risks and uncertainties, including risks relating to Year 2000 and the 
introduction of the Euro (in particular, the Year 2000 readiness of third 
parties with which the Company does business).  As a result of variations in 
such factors, actual results may differ materially from any forward looking 
statements.  Some of these factors are described below.  References made to 
the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a 
further discussion of such factors. The Company disclaims any obligation to 
update forward looking statements.


Government Monetary Policies

     The Federal Reserve Board has the primary responsibility for United 
States monetary policy.  Its actions have an important influence on the demand 
for credit and investments and the level of interest rates and thus on the 
earnings of the Company.

Legislation and Regulation

     Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking 
industry are frequently introduced in Congress, in the state legislatures and 
before the various bank regulatory agencies.  Such changes could, among other 
things, increase the Company's overhead and capital costs or reduce fees 
charged by the Company or increase competition for banks.  The likelihood and 
timing of any such changes and the impact such changes might have on the 
Company and its subsidiaries, however, cannot be determined at this time.

<PAGE> 20

Competition

     The businesses in which the Company operates are very competitive.  
Competition is provided by both unregulated and regulated financial services 
organizations, whose products and services span the local, national, and 
global markets in which the Company conducts operations.

     Savings banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions actively 
compete for deposits, and money market funds and brokerage houses offer 
deposit-like services.  These institutions, as well as consumer and commercial 
finance companies, national retail chains, factors, insurance companies and 
pension trusts, are important competitors for various types of loans.  Issuers 
of commercial paper compete actively for funds and reduce demand for bank 
loans.  For personal and corporate trust services and investment counseling 
services, insurance companies, investment counseling firms, and other business 
firms and individuals offer active competition.  A wide variety of domestic 
and foreign companies compete for processing services.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
- --------------------------------------------------------------------

     See page 10 and 11 "Market Risk Management" and "Interest Rate 
Sensitivity".

     Quantitative and qualatative disclosure about market risk are 
incorporated herein by reference from the "Market Risk Management", "Trading 
Activities and Risk Management", and "Asset/Liability Mangement" sections 
included in Exhibit 13.

- ----------------------------------------------------
     Consolidated financial statements and notes and the independent auditors' 
report are incorporated herein by reference from Exhibits 13 to this Report.

ITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND 
FINANCIAL  DISCLOSURE

               AMENDMENT TO THE 1993 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN OF 
               -------------------------------------------------

                     THE BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY, INC.
                     ----------------------------------


     WHEREAS, the 1993 Long-Term Incentive Plan of The Bank of New York 
Company, Inc. (the "Plan") was established, effective as of January 1, 1993; 
and

     WHEREAS, Section 17 of the Plan provides that the Board of Directors of 
The Bank of New York Company, Inc. may amend the Plan at any time; and

     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors desires to amend the Plan.

     NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS RESOLVED that the Plan is hereby amended in the 
following respects, effective as of July 14, 1998: 

     1.  Section 4 is amended by adding the following immediately after "(i)" 
in the second paragraph thereof:

     (or its delegate, within limits established by the Committee, with 
respect to non-Covered Employees and employees who are not subject to Section 
16 of the Exchange Act)

     2.  Section 13 is amended by deleting the first paragraph thereof and 
substituting therefor the following:

     13.  CHANGE OF CONTROL.  In the event of a Change of Control, as 
hereinafter defined, (i) all stock appreciation rights which have not been 
granted in tandem with stock options and which have been outstanding for at 
least six months shall become exercisable in full, (ii) the restrictions 
applicable to all shares of restricted stock shall lapse and such shares shall 
be deemed fully vested and all restricted stock granted in the form of share 
units shall be paid in cash, (iii) all performance shares shall be deemed to 
be earned in full and all performance shares granted in the form of share 
units shall be paid in cash, and (iv) any Participant who has been granted a 
stock option which is not exercisable in full shall be entitled, in lieu of 
the exercise of the portion of the stock option which is 

<PAGE> 2

not exercisable, to obtain a cash payment in an amount equal to the difference 
between the option price of such stock option and (A) in the event the Change 
of Control is the result of a tender offer or exchange offer for the Common 
Stock, the final offer price per share paid for the Common Stock, or such 
lower price as the Committee may determine with respect to any incentive stock 
option to preserve its incentive stock option status, multiplied by the number 
of shares of Common Stock covered by such portion of the stock option, or (B) 
in the event the Change of Control is the result of any other occurrence, the 
aggregate value of the Common Stock covered by such portion of the stock 
option, as determined by the Committee at such time.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, if a Change of Control occurs under clause (C) of the definition 
thereof and (x) the Voting Securities of the Company outstanding immediately 
prior to such merger or consolidation would continue to represent more than 
50% of the combined voting power of the Voting Securities of the Company or

                                                  EXHIBIT 10(aa)

                       THE BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY, INC.
                       
                         1999 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

1.     PURPOSE.  The purpose of the 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan of The Bank 
of New York Company, Inc. (the "Plan") is to promote the long term financial 
interests of The Bank of New York Company, Inc. (the "Company"), including its 
growth and performance, by encouraging employees of the Company and its 
subsidiaries to acquire an ownership position in the Company, enhancing the 
ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to attract and retain employees of 
outstanding ability, and providing employees with an interest in the Company 
parallel to that of the Company's stockholders.

2.     DEFINITIONS.  The following definitions are applicable to the Plan:

"Award" shall mean an award determined in accordance with the terms of the 
Plan.

"Board of Directors" shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.

"Committee" shall mean the Compensation and Organization Committee of the 
Board of Directors.

"Common Stock" or "Stock" shall mean the common stock of the Company.

"Covered Employee" means, at the time of an Award (or such other time as 
required or permitted by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code) (i) the 
Company's Chief Executive Officer (or an individual acting in such capacity), 
(ii) any employee of the Company or its subsidiaries who, in the discretion of 
the Committee for purposes of determining those employees who are "covered 
employees" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, is likely to be 
among the four other highest compensated officers of the Company for the year 
in which an Award is made or payable, and (iii) any other employee of the 
Company or its subsidiaries designated by the Committee in its discretion.

"Exchange Act" shall mean the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

"Fair Market Value" shall mean, per share of Stock, the closing price of the 
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on the applicable date, or, 
if there are no sales of Stock on the NYSE on such date, then the closing 
price of the Stock on the last previous day on which a sale on the NYSE is 
reported.

"Participant" shall mean an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries who is 
selected by the Committee to participate in the Plan.

3.     SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN.  Subject to adjustment as provided in

available for the grant of Awards under the Plan shall not exceed 35,000,000. 
Notwithstanding anything contained 


<PAGE> 2

herein to the contrary, in no event shall more than 10,500,000 shares of Stock 
(subject to adjustment as provided in Section 15 of this Plan) be available in 
the aggregate for the issuance of Stock pursuant to performance shares or 
restricted stock granted under the Plan. The shares of Stock issued under the 
Plan may be authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares, as the Company 
may from time to time determine.

Shares of Stock subject to an Award under the Plan that, in whole or in part, 
expires unexercised or that is forfeited, terminated or cancelled or is paid 
in cash in lieu of Stock, shares of Stock surrendered or withheld from any 
Award under the Plan to satisfy a Participant's income tax withholding 
obligation and shares of Stock owned by the Participant that are tendered to 
pay for the exercise of a stock option under the Plan shall thereafter again 
be available for grant under the Plan.

4.     ADMINISTRATION.  The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. A 
majority of the Committee shall constitute a quorum, and the acts of a 
majority shall be the acts of the Committee.

Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee (i) (or its delegate, 
within limits established by the Committee, with respect to non-Covered 
Employees and employees who are not subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act) 
shall select the Participants, determine the type of Awards to be made to 
Participants, determine the shares or share units subject to Awards, and (ii) 
shall have the authority to interpret the Plan, to establish, amend, and 
rescind any rules and regulations relating to the Plan, to determine the terms 
and provisions of any agreements entered into hereunder, and to make all other 
determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. The 
Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any 
inconsistency in the Plan or in any Award in the manner and to the extent it 
shall deem desirable to carry it into effect. The determinations of the 
Committee in the administration of the Plan, as described herein, shall be 
final and conclusive.

5.     ELIGIBILITY.  All employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who 
have demonstrated significant management potential or who have the capacity 
for contributing in a substantial measure to the successful performance of the 
Company, as determined by the Committee, are eligible to be Participants in 
the Plan. In addition, the Committee may from time to time deem other 
employees of the Company or its subsidiaries eligible to participate in the 
Plan to receive awards of nonstatutory stock options.

6.     AWARDS.  Awards under the Plan may consist of: stock options (either 
incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal 
Revenue Code or nonstatutory stock options), performance shares, and 
restricted stock grants. Awards of performance shares and restricted stock may 
provide the Participant with dividends or dividend equivalents and voting 
rights prior to vesting (whether based on a period of time or based on 
attainment of specified performance conditions).

7.     STOCK OPTIONS.  The Committee shall establish the option price at the 
time each stock option is granted, which price shall not be less than 100% of 
the Fair Market Value of the 

<PAGE> 3

Common Stock on the date of grant. Stock options shall be exercisable for 
such period as specified by the Committee, but in no event may options be 
exercisable for a period of more than ten years after their date of grant. The 
option price of each share as to which a stock option is exercised shall be 
paid in full at the time of such exercise. Such payment shall be made in cash, 
by tender of shares of Common Stock owned by the Participant valued at Fair 
Market Value as of the date of exercise, subject to such guidelines for the 
tender of Common Stock as the Committee may establish, in such other 
consideration as the Committee deems appropriate, or by a combination of cash, 
shares of Common Stock and such other consideration. In no event may any 
Participant receive stock options with respect to more than 750,000 shares of 
Stock in any calendar year.

8.     PERFORMANCE SHARES.  Performance shares may be granted in the form of 
actual shares of Stock or share units having a value equal to an identical 
number of shares of Stock. In the event that a stock certificate is issued in 
respect of performance shares, such certificate shall be registered in the 
name of the Participant but shall be held by the Company until the time the 
performance shares are earned. The performance conditions and the length of 
the performance period shall be determined by the Committee but in no event 
may a performance period be less than twelve months. The Committee shall 
determine in its sole discretion whether performance shares granted in the 
form of share units shall be paid in cash, Stock, or a combination of cash and 
Stock.

Awards of performance shares to a Covered Employee shall (unless the Committee 
determines otherwise) be subject to performance conditions based on the 
achievement (i) by the Company or a business unit of a specified target 
operating or net income or return on assets, (ii) by the Company or a business 
unit of specified target earnings per share or return on equity, (iii) of a 
targeted total shareholder return or (iv) any combination of the conditions 
set forth in (i) and (ii) above. If an Award of performance shares is made on 
such basis, the Committee shall establish the relevant performance conditions 
within 90 days after the commencement of the performance period (or such later 
date as may be required or permitted by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue 
Code). The Committee may, in its discretion, reduce or eliminate the amount of 
payment with respect to an Award of performance shares to a Covered Employee, 
notwithstanding the achievement of a specified performance condition. The 
maximum number of performance shares subject to any Award to a Covered 
Employee is 300,000 for each 12 months during the performance period (or, to 
the extent the Award is paid in cash, the maximum dollar amount of any such 
Award is the equivalent cash value of such number of Shares at the closing 
price on the last trading day of the performance period). For purposes of the 
immediately preceding sentence, "trading day" shall mean a day in which the 
Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. An Award of performance 
shares to a Participant who is a Covered Employee shall (unless the Committee 
determines otherwise) provide that in the event of the Participant's 
termination of employment prior to the end of the performance period for any 
reason, such Award will be payable only (A) if the applicable performance 
conditions are achieved and (B) to the extent, if any, as the Committee shall 
determine.

9.     RESTRICTED STOCK.  Restricted stock may be granted in the form of 
actual shares of Stock or share units having a value equal to an identical 
number of shares of Stock. In the 


<PAGE> 4

event that a stock certificate is issued in respect of restricted stock, such 
certificate shall be registered in the name of the  Participant but shall be 
held by the Company until the end of the restricted period. The employment 
conditions and the length of the period for vesting of restricted stock shall 
be established by the Committee at time of grant. A restricted period of not 
less than three years shall apply to shares of Stock subject to restricted 
stock grants under the Plan, except that a restricted period of less than 
three years may apply to such grants with respect to up to ten percent (10%) 
of the total shares of Stock available for the grant of Awards under the Plan. 
The Committee shall determine in its sole discretion whether restricted stock 
granted in the form of share units shall be paid in cash, Stock, or a 
combination of cash and Stock.

10.     AWARD AGREEMENTS.  Each Award under the Plan shall be evidenced by an 
agreement setting forth the terms and conditions, as determined by the 
Committee, which shall apply to such Award, in addition to the terms and 
conditions specified in the Plan.

11.     CHANGE IN CONTROL.  In the event of a Change in Control, as 
hereinafter defined, (i) the restrictions applicable to all shares of 
restricted stock and restricted share units shall lapse and such shares and 
share units shall be deemed fully vested, (ii) all restricted stock granted in 
the form of share units shall be paid in cash, (iii) all performance shares 
granted in the form of shares of Stock or share units shall be deemed to be 
earned in full, (iv) all performance shares granted in the form of share units 
shall be paid in cash, and (v) each Participant who holds a stock option that 
is not exercisable in full shall be entitled to receive a cash payment as 
provided below with respect to the portion of the stock option which is not 
then exercisable. The amount of any cash payment in respect of a restricted 
share unit or performance share unit shall be equal to: (A) in the event the 
Change in Control is the result of a tender offer or exchange offer for Common 
Stock, the final offer price per share paid for the Common Stock or (B) in the 
event the Change in Control is the result of any other occurrence, the 
aggregate per share value of Common Stock as determined by the Committee at 
such time. The amount to be paid in respect of the portion of any stock option 
which is not exercisable shall be equal to the result of multiplying the 
number of shares of Common Stock covered by such portion of the stock option 
by the difference between (x) the per share value of Common Stock determined 
pursuant to the preceding sentence, or such lower price as the Committee may 
determine with respect to any incentive stock option to preserve its incentive 
stock option status, and (y) the per share exercise price of such stock 
option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change in Control occurs under 
clause (C) of the definition thereof and (x) the Voting Securities of the 
Company outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation would 
continue to represent more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Voting 
Securities of the Company or the surviving entity immediately after such 
merger or consolidation and (y) immediately after such merger or consolidation 
there would be no Change in Control under clause (B) of the definition thereof 
if the words "at least 50% thereof" were substituted for the words "a majority 
thereof", then no payment of cash shall be made pursuant to clause (v) of the 
first sentence of this paragraph and in lieu thereof all stock options shall 
become exercisable in full. The Committee may, in its discretion, include such 
further provisions and limitations in any agreement documenting such Awards as 
it may deem equitable and in the best interests of the Company.

<PAGE> 5

A "Change in Control" shall be deemed to occur if (A) any "person" (as such 
term is defined in Section 3(a)(9) and as used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), 
excluding the Company or any of its subsidiaries, a trustee or any fiduciary 
holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its 
subsidiaries, an underwriter temporarily holding securities pursuant to an 
offering of such securities or a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by 
stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportion as their 
ownership of the Company, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in 
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of 
the Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the 
Company's then outstanding securities ("Voting Securities"); or (B) during any 
period of not more than two years, individuals who constitute the Board of 
Directors of the Company as of the beginning of the period and any new 
director (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an 
agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in clause (A) or 
(C) of this sentence) whose election by the Board of Directors of the Company 
or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders was approved by a 
vote of at least two thirds ( 2/3) of the directors then still in office who 
either were directors at such time or whose election or nomination for 
election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute a 
majority thereof; or (C) the shareholders of the Company approve a merger or 
consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger 
or consolidation which would result in the Voting Securities of the Company 
outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by 
remaining outstanding or by being converted into Voting Securities of the 
surviving entity) at least 60% of the combined voting power of the Voting 
Securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately 
after such merger or consolidation, or the shareholders of the Company approve 
a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or any agreement for the sale or 
disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's 
assets.

12.     WITHHOLDING.  The Company shall have the right to deduct from any 
payment to be made pursuant to the Plan the amount of any taxes required by 
law to be withheld therefrom, or to require a Participant to pay to the 
Company such amount required to be withheld prior to the issuance or delivery 
of any shares of Stock or the payment of cash under the Plan. The Committee 
may, in its discretion, permit a Participant to elect to satisfy such 
withholding obligation by having the Company retain the number of shares of 
Stock whose Fair Market Value equals the amount required to be withheld. Any 
fraction of a share of Stock required to satisfy such obligation shall be 
disregarded and the amount due shall instead be paid in cash to the 
Participant.

13.     NONTRANSFERABILITY.  No Award shall be assignable or transferable, and 
no right or interest of any Participant shall be subject to any lien, 
obligation or liability of the Participant, except by will or the laws of 
descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, 
the Committee may, subject to the terms and conditions it may specify, permit 
a Participant to transfer any nonstatutory stock options granted to him 
pursuant to the Plan to one or more of his immediate family members or to 
trusts established in whole or in part for the benefit of the Participant 
and/or one or more of such immediate family members. During the lifetime of 
the Participant, a nonstatutory stock option shall be exercisable only by the 
Participant 


<PAGE> 6

or by the immediate family member or trust to whom such stock option has been 
transferred pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. For purposes of 
the Plan, (i) the term "immediate family" shall mean the Participant's spouse 
and issue (including adopted and step children) and (ii) the phrase "immediate 
family members and trusts established in whole or in part for the benefit of 
the Participant and/or one or more of such immediate family members" shall be 
further limited, if necessary, so that neither the transfer of a nonstatutory 
stock option to such immediate family member or trust, nor the ability of a 
Participant to make such a transfer shall have adverse consequences to the 
Company or the Participant by reason of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue 
Code.

14.     NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT.  No person shall have any claim or right to be 
granted an Award, and the grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a 
Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or its 
subsidiaries. Further, the Company and its subsidiaries expressly reserve the 
right at any time to dismiss a Participant free from any liability, or any 
claim under the Plan, except as provided herein or in any agreement entered 
into hereunder.
 
15.     ADJUSTMENT OF AND CHANGES IN STOCK.  In the event of any change in the 
outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split, 
recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spinoff, combination or exchange of 
shares or other corporate change, or any distributions to common shareholders 
other than regular cash dividends, the Committee may make such substitution or 
adjustment, if any, as it deems to be equitable, as to the number or kind of 
shares of Common Stock or other securities issued or reserved for issuance 
pursuant to the Plan and to outstanding Awards.

16.     AMENDMENT.  The Board of Directors may amend, suspend or terminate the 
Plan or any portion thereof at anytime, provided that no amendment shall be 
made without stockholder approval if such approval is necessary in order for 
the Plan to continue to comply with Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

17.     EFFECTIVE DATE.  The Plan shall be effective as of January 1, 1999, 
subject to its approval by shareholders of the Company. Subject to earlier 
termination pursuant to Section 16 of this Plan, the Plan shall have a term of 
five years from its effective date.

                       THE BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY, INC.
                   RETIREMENT PLAN FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS

     WHEREAS, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. Retirement Plan for Non-

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies

The Bank of New York Company, Inc. (the "Company") provides a complete range 
of banking and other financial services to corporations and individuals 
worldwide through its business segments: Trust, and Securities and Cash 
Processing; Corporate Banking; Retail Banking; and Financial Markets.

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial 
statements. Amounts subject to significant estimates and assumptions are items 
such as the allowance for credit losses, pension and postretirement 
obligations, and the fair value of financial instruments. Actual results could 
differ from these estimates.     

     The following is a summary of the Company's more significant accounting 
and reporting policies.

Securities - Debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are 
carried at fair value, except for those equity securities whose fair value 
cannot be readily determined. These securities are carried at cost. Equity 
investments of less than a majority but at least 20% ownership are accounted 
for by the equity method and classified as other assets. For securities 
carried at fair value, the after-tax effect of net unrealized gains and losses 
is reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity.  

     Securities classified as trading assets are carried at fair value, with 
net unrealized holding gains and losses recognized currently in income. Debt 
securities, which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until 
maturity, are classified as held-to-maturity and stated at cost, adjusted for 
discount accreted and premium amortized. Realized gains and losses on the sale 
of debt and equity securities are determined by the specific identification 
and average cost methods, respectively.

Allowance for Credit Losses - The allowance for credit losses is maintained at 
a level that, in management's judgment, is adequate to absorb probable losses 
associated with specifically identified loans, as well as estimated probable 
credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio at the balance 
sheet date. Management's judgment includes the following factors, among 
others: risks of individual credits; past experience; the volume, composition, 
and growth of the loan portfolio; and economic conditions.

     The Company conducts a quarterly portfolio review to determine the 
adequacy of its allowance for credit losses. All significant commercial loans 
are assigned to specific risk categories. Smaller commercial and consumer 
loans are evaluated on a pooled basis. Following this review, senior 
management of the Company analyzes the results and determines the allowance 
for credit losses. The Audit, Examining and CRA Committee of the Company's 
Board of Directors reviews the allowance at the end of each quarter.

     The portion of the allowance for credit losses allocated to nonaccrual 
commercial loans over $1 million (impaired loans) is measured by the 
difference between their recorded value and fair value. Fair value is either 
the present value of the expected future cash flows from borrowers, the market 
value of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral.

Nonperforming Assets - Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status when 
collateral is insufficient and principal or interest is past due 90 days or 
more, or when there is reasonable doubt that interest or principal will be 
collected. Accrued interest is usually reversed when a loan is placed on 
nonaccrual status. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans may be 
recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's 
judgment. Nonaccrual loans are restored to accrual status when principal and 
interest are current or they become fully collateralized. Consumer loans are 
not classified as nonperforming assets, but are charged off and interest 
accrued is suspended based upon an established delinquency schedule determined 
by product. Real estate acquired in satisfaction of loans is carried in other 
assets at the lower of the recorded investment in the property or fair value 
minus estimated costs to sell.

<PAGE> 8
Derivative Financial Instruments - Derivative contracts, such as futures, 
forwards, swaps, options, and similar products used in trading activities, are 
recorded at market value. Gains and losses are included in other noninterest 
income. Unrealized gains and losses are reported on a gross basis in trading 
account assets and other borrowed funds, after taking into consideration 
master netting agreements.

     Derivative contracts are designated as an element of the Company's asset 
and liability management (ALM) process when they alter the Company's interest 
rate and foreign currency exposures. Contracts used in the ALM process are 
linked to specific or groups of similar assets or liabilities where there is a 
high correlation between the derivative contract and the item altered, both at 
inception and throughout the contract period. ALM derivative contracts are 
accounted for on the deferral, accrual, or mark-to-market basis, as noted 
below. Under the deferral or accrual method, gains and losses on terminated 
derivative contracts are deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the 
linked assets or liabilities. Gains and losses on derivative contracts linked 
to assets or liabilities that are sold are recognized as an adjustment to the 
gain or loss of the balance sheet item.

     Deferral Accounting - This method relates principally to futures and 
forwards.  Deferred gains and losses are reported as adjustments to the 
carrying value of the linked items.  The amortization of deferred gains and 
losses is reported as interest income or expense related to the linked item.

     Accrual Accounting - Interest rate swap and purchased option contracts 
are accounted for on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest income or 
expense related to the linked item.

     Mark-to-Market Accounting - This method relates to derivative contracts 
linked to balance sheet items recorded at fair value. The fair value changes 
of balance sheet and derivative items are reported in shareholders' equity net 
of tax. Interest accruals for derivative contracts are reported as interest 
income related to balance sheet items. Fair value changes in derivative 
contracts are recorded in earnings when the linked balance sheet item's fair 
value changes are recorded in earnings.

New Accounting Pronouncements - On January 1, 1998, a new accounting 
pronouncement related to comprehensive income was adopted. Unrealized gains or 
losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation 
adjustments, which were reported separately in shareholders' equity, are now 
included in other comprehensive income. Prior periods have been restated for 
these changes.

     The Company has adopted a new accounting standard for disclosure of its 
operating segments. The Company's segment disclosures, consisting of Segment 
Data and Foreign Operations, are incorporated from the Segment Profitability 
section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Company's Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations.

     Beginning in 1999, the Company will adopt new accounting guidance 
relating to the costs of internally-developed software. Upon adoption, the 
Company will capitalize certain costs incurred to develop or acquire software 
for internal use. Although the Company has not yet quantified the impact of 
capitalizing software development costs in 1999, it does not expect the impact 
to be significant.

     Effective January 1, 2000, a new accounting standard will require the 
Company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value and apply 
new accounting practices for hedging activities. The Company has not yet 
determined the impact of the new accounting standard.

Other - Certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform its 
presentation with the 1998 financial statements.

2.  Acquisitions and Dispositions

In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company acquired a merger and advisory 
firm, a correspondent securities clearing organization and a directed 
brokerage services firm. In the first quarter of 1998, the Company acquired 
International Factors, Ltd., an asset based lender located in England, which 
included assets of approximately $900 million as well as a firm specializing 
in the research and trading of high yield securities. The Company also 
acquired the corporate trust businesses of several smaller banks in 1998. 

     During 1997, the Company acquired asset based lending and employee 
benefit recordkeeping businesses. Also in 1997, the Company acquired the 
corporate trust businesses of Wells Fargo & Company and Boatmen's Bancshares 
as well as those of several smaller banks. In addition, the Company acquired 
certain assets of BondNet, an information technology company. The Company also 
acquired ESI Securities Company and its affiliate, B-Trade Services. These 
companies deliver trading services to institutions. 

     The Company acquired asset based lending, corporate trust, and unit 
investment trust businesses in 1996.
 
     In January 1997, the Company sold approximately $900 million in credit 
card receivables. In November 1997, the Company sold its remaining credit card 
operations ($4.4 billion in receivables) and recorded a pre-tax gain on this 
sale of approximately $177 million. In 1996, the Company sold its AFL-CIO 
Union Privilege affinity credit card portfolio ($3.4 billion in receivables) 
for $575 million. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $400 million on this 
transaction.

     In 1997 and 1996, the Company sold portions of its interest in Wing Hang 
Bank, Ltd. for pre-tax gains of $27 million and $21 million.

     The pro forma effect of the above acquisitions and dispositions is not 
material.

4.  Loans

The Company's loan distribution and industry concentrations of credit risk at 
December 31, 1998 and 1997 are incorporated by reference from "Loans" in the 
Management's Discussion and Analysis Section of this Report.  The Company's 
retail, community, and regional commercial banking operations in the New York 
metropolitan area create a significant geographic concentration.  

     In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its banking 
subsidiaries have made loans at prevailing interest rates and terms to 
directors and executive officers of the Company and to certain entities to 
which these individuals are related.  The aggregate dollar amount of these 
loans was $1,057 million, $767 million, and $755 million at December 31, 1998, 
1997, and 1996. These loans are primarily with related entities under 
revolving lines of credit. During 1998, these loans averaged $904 million, and 
ranged from $694 million to $1,070 million. All loans were fully performing 
during this period.  

Transactions in the allowance for credit losses are summarized as follows:

(1) In 1997, $186 million was allocated to credit card loans sold during the 
year.

     Nonaccrual and reduced rate loans outstanding at December 31, 1998, 1997, 
and 1996 were $179 million, $193 million, and $213 million. At December 31, 
1998, commitments to borrowers whose loans were classified as nonaccrual or 
reduced rate were not material.

     At December 31, 1998 and 1997, impaired loans aggregated $145 million and 
$151 million, of which $116 million and $118 million exceeded their fair value 
by $35 million and $25 million. For 1998 and 1997, the average amount of 
impaired loans was $142 million and $149 million and interest income 
recognized on them (limited to cash received) was $1 million in each year.

     Interest income recognized on total nonaccrual and reduced rate loans 
exceeded reversals by $3 million in 1998, $2 million in 1997, and $3 million 
in 1996. Interest income would have been increased by $10 million, $10 
million, and $11 million if loans on nonaccrual status at December 31, 1998, 
1997, and 1996 had been performing for the entire year. At year end, foreign 
loans on nonperforming status were $53 million in 1998, $34 million in 1997, 
and $38 million in 1996. Interest income received on foreign nonperforming 
loans equaled reversals in 1998, 1997, and 1996. If foreign loans on 
nonaccrual status at December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996 had been performing for 
the entire year, interest income would have been increased by $2 million for 
1998, $3 million for 1997 and $2 million for 1996.

     Other real estate was $14 million, $15 million, and $41 million at 
December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996. Writedowns of and expenses related to other 
real estate included in noninterest expense were $2 million, $11 million, and 
$1 million in 1998, 1997, and 1996.

     Fixed-rate debt at December 31, 1998 had interest rates ranging from 
6.20% to 8.50%. The weighted average interest rates on fixed-rate debt at 
December 31, 1998 and 1997 were 7.50% and 7.59%. The weighted average interest 
rates on variable-rate debt at December 31, 1998 and 1997 were 5.41% and 
6.23%. Exposure to interest rate movements is reduced by interest rate swap 
agreements. As a result of these agreements, the effective interest rates 
differ from those stated.


6.  Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interests in the Company's Junior 
Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures

Wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company ("the Trusts") have issued cumulative 
Capital Securities ("Capital Securities"). The sole assets of each trust are 
junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of the Company, whose 
maturities and interest rates match the Capital Securities. The Company's 
obligations under the agreements that relate to the Capital Securities, the 
Trusts and the debentures constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the 
Company of the Trusts' obligations under the Capital Securities.

     The following table sets forth a summary of the Capital Securities issued 
by the Company as of December 31, 1998:

7.  Shareholders' Equity

The Company currently plans to buy back up to 18 million shares of its common 
stock through the end of 1999. In 1998, the Company's shareholders authorized 
an increase in the Company's common stock from 800 million common shares to 
1.6 billion common shares. The common stock was split two-for-one as of July 
24, 1998. Prior period financial statements have been restated to reflect the 
stock split. The Company's warrants expired in November 1998. In addition to 
the Class A preferred stock, the Company has 5 million authorized shares of 
preferred stock having no par value, with no shares outstanding at either 
December 31, 1998 or 1997.

     The Company's preferred stock purchase rights plan provides that if any 
person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the Company's 
common stock (an "acquiring person"), then on and after the tenth day 
thereafter, each right would entitle the holder (other than the acquiring 
person) to purchase $400 in market value of the Company's common stock for 
$200. In addition, if there is a business combination between the Company and 
an acquiring person, or in certain other circumstances, each right (if not 
previously exercised) would entitle the holder (other than the acquiring 
person) to purchase $200 in market value of the common stock of the acquiring 
person for $100. The rights are redeemable by the Company at $0.05 per right 
until they are exercisable, and will expire in 2004.

     At December 31, 1998, the Company had reserved for issuance 26 million 
common shares pursuant to the terms of securities and employee benefit plans.

Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows:

     The assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining benefit 
expense for 1998 is 8% decreasing to 5% in 2005 and thereafter. A change of 
one percentage point in this rate for each year would change the benefit 
obligation by 8% and the benefit expense by 9%.

     The Company has defined contribution benefit plans for which it 
recognized a cost of $82 million in 1998, $78 million in 1997 and $77 million 
in 1996.

10.  Company Financial Information

The Bank of New York (the "Bank"), the Company's primary banking subsidiary, 
is subject to dividend limitations under the Federal Reserve Act and state 
banking laws. Under these statutes, prior regulatory approval is required for 
dividends in any year that would exceed the Bank's net profits for such year 
combined with retained net profits for the prior two years. The Bank is also 
prohibited from paying a dividend in excess of undivided profits.

     Under the first of these limitations, in 1999 the Bank could declare 
dividends of $1.3 billion plus net profits earned in 1999. The Bank is not 
restrained from paying dividends under the second limitation. 

     The Federal Reserve Board can prohibit a dividend if payment would 
constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The Federal Reserve Board 
generally considers that a bank's dividends should not exceed earnings from 
continuing operations.

     Regulators require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum levels of 
capital in accordance with established quantitative measurements. As of 
December 31, 1998 and 1997, the Company and the Bank were considered well 
capitalized on the basis of the ratios (defined by regulation) of Total and 
Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I capital to average assets, 
which are shown as follows:

     The Federal Reserve Act limits and requires collateral for extensions of 
credit by the Company's banks to the Company and certain of its non-bank 
affiliates. Also, there are restrictions on the amounts of investments by such 
banks in stock and other securities of the Company and such affiliates, and 
restrictions on the acceptance of their securities as collateral for loans by 
such banks. Extensions of credit by the banks to each of the Company and such 
affiliates are limited to 10% of such bank's regulatory capital, and in the 
aggregate for the Company and all such affiliates to 20%.

     The subsidiary banks of the Company are required to maintain reserve 
balances with Federal Reserve Banks under the Federal Reserve Act and 
Regulation D. Required balances averaged $468 million and $535 million for the 
years 1998 and 1997.

12.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of the Company's financial instruments (i.e., monetary 
assets and liabilities) are determined under different accounting methods-see 
Note 1. The following disclosure discusses these instruments on a uniform 
basis - fair value. However, active markets do not exist for a significant 
portion of these instruments, principally loans and commitments. As a result, 
fair value determinations require significant subjective judgments regarding 
future cash flows. Other judgments would result in different fair values. 
Among the assumptions used by the Company are discount rates ranging 
principally from 5% to 8% at December 31, 1998 and 6% to 8% at December 31, 
1997. The fair value information supplements the basic financial statements 
and other traditional financial data presented throughout this Report.


     A summary of the practices used for determining fair value is as follows:

Securities, Trading Activities, and Derivatives Used for ALM
- ------------------------------------------------------------
The fair value of securities and trading assets and liabilities is based on 
quoted market prices, dealer quotes, or pricing models. Fair value amounts for 
derivative instruments, such as options, futures and forward rate contracts, 
commitments to purchase and sell foreign exchange, and foreign currency swaps, 
are similarly determined. The fair value of interest rate swaps is the amount 
that would be received or paid to terminate the agreement.  

Loans and Commitments
- ---------------------
For certain categories of consumer loans, fair value includes consideration of 
the quoted market prices for securities backed by similar loans. Discounted 
future cash flows and secondary market values are used to determine the fair 
value of other types of loans. The fair value of commitments to extend credit, 
standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit is based upon the 
cost to settle the commitment.

Other Financial Assets
- ----------------------
Fair value is assumed to equal carrying value for these assets due to their 
short maturity.

Deposits, Borrowings, and Long-Term Debt
- ----------------------------------------
The fair value of noninterest-bearing deposits is assumed to be their carrying 
amount. The fair value of interest-bearing deposits, borrowings, and long-term 
debt is based upon current rates for instruments of the same remaining 
maturity or quoted market prices for the same or similar issues.

     The carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company's financial 
instruments are as follows:

</TABLE>


     The Company's financial assets and liabilities are primarily variable 
rate instruments. Fixed rate loans and deposits are issued to satisfy customer 
and investor needs. Derivative financial instruments are utilized to manage 
exposure to the effect of interest rate changes on fixed rate assets and 
liabilities, and to enhance liquidity. The Company matches the duration of 
derivatives to that of the assets and liabilities being hedged, so that 
changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates will be offset.

     The Company uses interest rate swaps, futures contracts, and forward rate 
agreements to convert fixed rate loans, deposits, and long-term debt to 
floating rates. Basis swaps are used to convert various variable rate 
borrowings to LIBOR which better matches the assets funded by the borrowings. 

     The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value 
of its investments in foreign subsidiaries. The after-tax effects are shown in 
the cumulative translation adjustment included in shareholders' equity. At 
December 31, 1998 and 1997, $360 million and $246 million in notional amount 
of foreign exchange contracts, with fair values of $(1.6) million and $0.8 
million, hedged corresponding amounts of foreign investments. These foreign 
exchange contracts had a maturity of less than two months at December 31, 
1998.

     There were no deferred net gainsor losses on ALM derivative financial 
instruments at December 31, 1998 and 1997.  

     Net interest income increased by $4 million in 1998 and $8 million in 
1997 and 1996 as a result of ALM derivative financial instruments.

     A discussion of the credit, market, and liquidity risks inherent in 
financial instruments is presented under "Liquidity," "Market Risk 
Management,"  "Trading Activities and Risk Management," and "Asset/Liability 
Management" in the unaudited Management's Discussion and Analysis Section of 
this Report and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Foreign exchange includes income from trading commitments to purchase and 
sell foreign exchange, futures, and options. Interest rate contracts reflect 
the results of trading futures and forward contracts, interest rate swaps, 
foreign currency swaps, and options. Debt and other securities primarily 
reflect income from trading debt and equity securities.


14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent 
liabilities are outstanding which are not reflected in the accompanying 
consolidated balance sheets. Management does not expect any material losses to 
result from these matters.   

     The Company's significant trading and off-balance-sheet risks are 
securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk management products, 
commercial lending commitments, letters of credit, and securities lending 
indemnifications. The Company assumes these risks to trade for its own 
account, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks, and to provide 
customers with the ability to meet credit and liquidity needs and to hedge 
foreign currency and interest rate risks. These items involve, to varying 
degrees, credit, foreign exchange, and interest rate risk not recognized in 
the balance sheet. The Company's off-balance-sheet risks are managed and 
monitored in manners similar to those used for on-balance-sheet risks. There 
are no significant industry concentrations of such risks.

<PAGE> 24
     A summary of the notional amount of the Company's off-balance-sheet 
credit transactions, net of participations, at December 31, 1998 and 1997 
follows:

Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Risks

In millions                                   1998             1997
- -----------                                 -------          -------
Commercial Lending Commitments              $44,104          $38,254
Standby Letters of Credit                     6,620            6,056
Commercial Letters of Credit                  1,548            1,945
Securities Lending Indemnifications          47,839           41,041

     The total potential loss on undrawn commitments, standby and commercial 
letters of credit, and securities lending indemnifications is equal to the 
total notional amount if drawn upon, which does not consider the value of any 
collateral. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being 
drawn upon, the total amount does not necessarily represent future cash 
requirements. In securities lending transactions, the Company requires the 
borrower to provide collateral, thus reducing credit risk.

     The notional amounts for other off-balance-sheet risks express the dollar 
volume of the transactions; however, credit risk is much smaller. The Company 
performs credit reviews and enters into netting agreements to minimize the 
credit risk of foreign currency and interest rate risk management products. 
The Company enters into offsetting positions to reduce exposure to foreign 
exchange and interest rate risk.

     Standby letters of credit principally support corporate obligations and 
include $0.3 billion and $0.4 billion that were collateralized with cash and 
securities at December 31, 1998 and 1997. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, 
securities lending indemnifications were secured by collateral of $47.8 
billion and $41.0 billion. At December 31, 1998, approximately $5.3 billion of 
the standbys will expire within one year, and the balance between one to five 
years.

     At December 31, 1998, approximately $60.9 billion of interest rate 
contracts will mature within one year, $68.5 billion between one and five 
years, and the balance after five years. At December 31, 1998, approximately 
$130.4 billion of foreign exchange contracts will mature within one year and 
$1.7 billion between one and five years. There were no derivative financial 
instruments on nonperforming status at year end 1998.

     Use of derivative financial instruments involves reliance on 
counterparties. Failure of a counterparty to honor its obligation under a 
derivative contract is a risk the Company assumes whenever it engages in a 
derivative contract.

     Net rent expense for premises and equipment was $101 million in 1998, $92 
million in 1997, and $91 million in 1996.

     At December 31, 1998, the Company and its subsidiaries were obligated 
under various noncancelable lease agreements, certain of which provide for 
additional rents based upon real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance and 
for various renewal options. The minimum rental commitments under 
noncancelable operating leases for premises and equipment having a term of 
more than one year from December 31, 1998 are as follows:

     In the ordinary course of business, there are various claims pending 
against the Company and its subsidiaries. In the opinion of management, 
liabilities arising from such claims, if any, would not have a material effect 
upon the Company's consolidated financial statements.


15.  Stock Option Plans

The Company's stock option plans ("the Option Plans") provide for the issuance 
of stock options at fair market value at the date of grant to officers and 
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Under the Company's 1993 Plan, 
options to acquire common stock may be granted in amounts that do not 
generally exceed, on a cumulative basis, 1% of the outstanding shares of 
common stock per year. Generally, each option granted under the Option Plans 
is exercisable between one and ten years from the date of grant.

<PAGE> 26
     The Company accounts for its Option Plans under Accounting Principles 
Board Opinion 25. As a result, compensation cost is not recorded. If 
compensation cost for these plans had been based on fair value, net income 
would have been reduced by $24 million in 1998, $22 million in 1997, and $9 
million in 1996. Also, diluted earnings per share would have been reduced by 3 
cents per share in 1998, 3 cents per share in 1997, and 1 cent per share in 
1996.

     The assumptions used in determining the impact of accounting for the 
Option Plans at fair value for 1998 are as follows:  dividend yield of 3%; 
expected volatility of 25%; risk free interest rate of 5.16%; and expected 
option lives of 5 years.

     A summary of the status of the Company's Option Plans as of December 31, 
1998, 1997, and 1996, and changes during the years ending on those dates is

Report of Independent Auditors



We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Bank of 
New York Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 
1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in 
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period 
ended December 31, 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of 
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Bank of New 
York Company, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the 
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the 
three years in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Company's Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY OF RESULTS

For 1998, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. (the "Company") reported record 
net income of $1,192 million or a record $1.53 per diluted share, compared 
with $1,104 million or $1.36 per diluted share in 1997 and $1,020 million or 
$1.20 per diluted share in 1996.
 
     In 1998, securities servicing fee revenues grew by 27% reaching $1 
billion for the year which, when combined with 15% growth in trust and 
investment fees, pushed noninterest income to 58% of revenues, up from 54% a 
year ago. Principal drivers for securities servicing were continued strong 
growth in securities transaction volumes, augmented by record new business 
wins and the introduction of new products. Strong internal growth of 16% was 
spread over all of the Company's securities servicing businesses with 
acquisitions contributing the remainder. Revenue growth was led by ADRs, 
domestic and global custody, securities lending, corporate trust, UIT and 
execution services. Trust and investment fees were $208 million for the year, 
an increase of 15% over last year, as a result of focused and aggressive new 
business efforts. Keeping pace with the substantial increase in the Company's 
processing businesses, foreign exchange and other trading revenues grew to 
$170 million for 1998 compared with $125 million last year, reflecting the 
customer driven nature of this business. In 1998, net interest income on a 
taxable equivalent basis was $1,709 million compared with $1,890 million in 
1997  and the provision for credit losses decreased to $20 million from $280 
million reflecting primarily the impact of the sale of the credit card 
business in 1997. Additional highlights were continued strength in asset 
quality and the maintenance of one of the best efficiency ratios in the 
industry at 50.5%.

     In 1998, return on average common equity was a record 24.25% compared 
with 22.13% in 1997 and 19.98% in 1996, while return on average assets was 
1.89% compared with 1.86% in 1997 and 1.90% in 1996.

     Tangible diluted earnings per share (earnings before the amortization of 
goodwill and intangibles) were $1.62 per share in 1998 compared with $1.45 per 
share in 1997. Tangible return on average assets was 2.06% in 1998 and 2.04% 
in 1997 and tangible return on average common equity was 37.13% in 1998 
compared with 31.78% in 1997.

     In 1997, revenues from the Company's securities servicing business grew 
21% to $790 million. This reflects strong internal growth of 16%, with 
increases in all businesses. ADRs, stock transfer, corporate trust, and mutual 
funds were particularly strong. Fees from cash processing were up 14% in 1997 
to $239 million. Trust and investment management grew 12% over 1996 to $181 
million reflecting new business and generally strong markets. In 1997, net 
income on a taxable equivalent basis totaled $1,890 million compared with 
$1,999 million in the prior year. The decline is primarily attributable to the 
sale of the credit card operations and the stock buyback program, partially 
offset by growth in corporate lending. The provision for credit losses 
decreased to $280 million from $600 million due largely to the sale of credit 
card receivables. Operating expenses continued to remain under good control.

     In 1996, revenues from the Company's securities servicing business grew 
59% to $655 million. This significant increase reflected strong internal 
growth as well as the acquisition of the corporate trust business of 
NationsBank and the custody businesses of BankAmerica and J.P. Morgan. All 
areas of securities processing contributed to an internal growth rate of 14% 
with ADRs, corporate trust, and government securities clearance particularly 
strong. Fees from cash processing were up 11% to $209 million. Trust and 
investment management fees grew 18% over the prior year to $161 million. In 
1996, net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis declined to $1,999 
million reflecting the sale of the $3.4 billion AFL-CIO Union Privilege 
affinity credit card portfolio. The provision for credit losses increased to 
$600 million in 1996 due largely to a deterioration in the Company's credit 
card portfolio. Operating expenses were strictly controlled.

For 1998, net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis amounted to $1,709 
million compared with $1,890 million in 1997. Average earning assets were 
$52.8 billion up from $48.5 billion in 1997 reflecting increased customer 
driven deposits from the Company's global securities servicing business as 
well as increased corporate lending. Average loans were $38.3 billion in 1998 
compared with $36.6 billion in 1997. The increase in loans was primarily in 
the special industries lending divisions and asset based lending. The net 
interest rate spread and yield were 2.22% and 3.24% in 1998 compared with 
2.88% and 3.89% in 1997. The decrease in net interest income, net interest 
rate spread, and yield from 1997 reflect the impact of the sale of the 
Company's credit card operations and the financing of the stock buyback 
program.

     On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income was $1,890 million in 
1997. Average loans were $36.6 billion in 1997 down from $36.7 billion in 
1996. Year end 1997 loans were $34.5 billion down from $36.1 billion in 1996 
reflecting the sale of $5.3 billion of credit card receivables partially 
offset by increased corporate lending. The net interest rate spread and yield 
were 2.88% and 3.89% in 1997 compared with 3.37% and 4.35% in 1996. These 
declines were primarily attributable to the sale of the credit card portfolio. 
The decline in the net yield also reflected the financing of the stock buyback 
program.

     On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income was $1,999 million in 
1996. Average loans grew 4% to $36.7 billion in 1996. Year end 1996 loans 
decreased 2% to $36.1 billion reflecting the sale of $3.4 billion of credit 
card receivables in the second quarter of 1996. The declines in the net 
interest income, net interest rate spread, and yield were primarily 
attributable to the sale of the credit card portfolio and the financing of the 
stock buyback program. 

     Interest income would have been increased by $10 million, $10 million, 
and $11 million if loans on nonaccrual status at December 31, 1998, 1997, and 
1996 had been performing for the entire year.


NONINTEREST INCOME

A wide range of securities servicing, cash processing services, trust and 
investment fees, other fee-based services, and trading activities provide 
noninterest income. Revenues from these activities were $2,283 million in 
1998, compared with $2,137 million in 1997 and $2,130 million in 1996.    

     Securities servicing fees were $1 billion, $790 million, and $655 million 
in 1998, 1997, and 1996. Cash processing fees, principally funds transfer, 
deposit services, and trade finance, were $256 million in 1998, $239 million 
in 1997, and $209 million in 1996. Funds transfer fees were ahead a strong 13% 
and cash management fees were up by 7%, while revenues from the trade finance 
business were flat compared to 1997. Trust and investment management fees were 
$208 million in 1998, $181 million in 1997, and $161 million in 1996. Service 
charges and fees were $326 million in 1998, compared with $354 million in 1997 
and $421 million in 1996. For further discussion of fee revenue see Segment 
Profitability.

     Securities gains totaled $175 million, $136 million, and $97 million in 
1998, 1997, and 1996. 

<PAGE> 30
     Other noninterest income was $318 million in 1998, $437 million in 1997, 
and $587 million in 1996. Profits from foreign exchange and other trading 
activities were $170 million, $125 million, and $67 million in 1998, 1997, and 
1996. In 1998, other noninterest income included a $29 million pre-tax gain on 
the sale of the Company's property at 48 Wall Street. In 1997 and 1996, other 
noninterest income included pre-tax gains on the sale of credit card 
portfolios of $177 million and $400 million. Other noninterest income also 
includes pre-tax gains of $27 million in 1997 and $21 million in 1996 related 
to the sale of portions of the Company's interest in Wing Hang Bank, Ltd.


NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME TAXES

Total noninterest expense was $1,928 million in 1998, $1,874 million in 1997, 
and $1,835 million in 1996. Salaries and employee benefits increased 11% to 
$1,178 million in 1998 primarily due to acquisitions, new business growth and 
technology spending. Noninterest expense for 1998 includes $33 million, 
approximately 3 cents per share, related to making computer systems Year 2000 
compliant. Net occupancy and furniture and fixture expenses decreased by a 
combined $9 million to $252 million. Other expenses fell by 9% in 1998 to $498 
million. 

     Total noninterest expense increased 2% in 1997 compared with 1996, 
principally due to acquisitions of securities servicing and asset based 
lending businesses and the sale of the credit card business. Salaries and 
employee benefits increased 5% in 1997 to $1,066 million. Net occupancy and 
furniture and fixture expenses increased by a combined $1 million to $261 
million in 1997. Other expenses fell by 3% in 1997 to $547 million. Year 2000 
expenses were $18 million.

     The efficiency ratio was 50.5% in 1998 compared with 50.2% in 1997 and 
50.5% in 1996. The efficiency ratios exclude the gains on the sale of the 
credit card portfolios in 1997 and 1996.

     The Company's consolidated effective tax rates for 1998, 1997, and 1996 
were 35.2%, 36.4%, and 38.3%. The 1998 rate decreased compared with 1997 due 
to higher non-taxable income and larger deductions for trust preferred 
securities partially offset by higher state and local taxes.  The 1997 rate 
decreased due to larger deductions for trust preferred securities in addition 
to the reduced impact of state and local taxes.


LIQUIDITY

The Company maintains its liquidity through the management of its assets and 
liabilities, utilizing worldwide financial markets. The diversification of 
liabilities reflects the flexibility of the Company's funding sources under 
changing market conditions. Stable core deposits, including demand, retail 
time, and trust deposits from processing businesses, are generated through the 
Company's diversified network and managed with the use of trend studies and 
deposit pricing. The use of derivative products such as interest rate swaps 
and financial futures enhances liquidity through the issue of long-term 
liabilities with limited exposure to interest rate risk. Liquidity also 
results from the maintenance of a portfolio of assets which can be easily 
reduced and the monitoring of unfunded loan commitments, thereby reducing 
unanticipated funding requirements.

     Average savings, time, and noninterest-bearing deposits increased 
slightly by $159 million in 1998. Medium-term notes increased slightly by $140 
million and foreign deposits increased by $1.5 billion. The increase in 
foreign deposits primarily relates to the Company's European based securities 
servicing business. More volatile sources of interest-bearing deposits and 
borrowings increased by $1.9 billion.

     In 1998, the Company's average commercial paper borrowings were $1.1 
billion compared with $602 million in 1997. The Company has backup lines of 
credit of $350 million at financial institutions supporting these borrowings.

     The following comments relate to the information disclosed in the 
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

     Cash flows from earnings and other operating activities were $1.6 billion 
in 1998, compared with $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion in 1997 and 1996. The 
increase in 1998 cash flows from operations was principally the result of 
changes in trading activities. In 1997, cash flow from operations declined 
slightly as increased use of cash for trading activities was offset by changes 
in accruals and other.

     In 1998, cash used by investing activities was $5.2 billion as compared 
to $3.2 billion used by investing activities in 1997. In 1998, additions to 
commercial loans and interest-bearing deposits were partially offset by sales 
of securities. In 1997, additions to commercial loans, securities and federal 
funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, were partially 
offset by the sale of credit card loans. The 1996 cash flows provided by 
investing activities were $0.1 billion, reflecting the sale of credit card 
loans offset by additions to loans, securities and interest-bearing deposits.

     Cash provided by financing activities was $1.9 billion, $2.0 billion, and 
$0.4 billion in 1998, 1997, and 1996 as the Company used deposits to finance 
its investing activities. In 1998, 1997, and 1996, financing activities used 
cash to buy back the Company's common shares, and provided cash through the 
issuance of trust preferred securities. Federal funds purchased and securities 
sold under repurchase agreements were a net use of funds in 1998 and 1996 
while a net source of funds in 1997.

     Restrictions on the ability of the Company to obtain funds from its 
subsidiaries are discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.


CAPITAL RESOURCES

Shareholders' equity was $5,448 million at December 31, 1998, compared with 
$5,002 million at December 31, 1997 and $5,127 million at December 31, 1996. 
In July 1998, the Company increased its quarterly common stock dividend to 14 
cents per share, up 17% from the beginning of 1997. During 1998, the Company 
retained $789 million of earnings and issued $300 million of trust preferred 
securities and $335 million of medium term notes. In addition, the conversion 
of warrants provided $333 million in capital. The Company also repurchased 
32.5 million common shares for $976 million. In 1999, the Company plans to buy 
back 18 million shares. 

     In 1997, the Company retained $721 million of earnings and issued $400 
million of trust preferred securities. Warrant holders converted 3 million 
warrants into 22 million common shares, providing $169 million in capital. In 
addition, 58 million common shares were repurchased for $1.2 billion and $111 
million in preferred stock was redeemed.

     In 1996, the Company retained $682 million of earnings and issued $600 
million of trust preferred securities and $100 million of subordinated debt.  
Warrant holders converted 5 million warrants into 42 million common shares, 
providing $323 million in capital, and $114 million of subordinated debentures 
converted into common stock.  In addition, 95 million common shares were 
repurchased for $1.3 billion.

     In January 1999, the Company issued $200 million of trust preferred 
securities. The Company has filed a shelf registration statement for up to 
$1.3 billion of debt, preferred stock, trust preferred securities, and common 
stock.

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The provision for credit losses was $20 million in 1998, compared with $280 
million in 1997 and $600 million in 1996. The decrease in the provision 
compared with 1997 and 1996 was primarily due to the sale of credit card 
receivables, continued low charge-offs in the remainder of the loan portfolio, 
and a further reduction in nonperforming loans.

     Nonperforming assets declined by 7% to $193 million at December 31, 1998. 
The decrease in nonperforming assets during 1998 is attributable to charge-
offs and writedowns of $18 million and paydowns, sales, and returns to accrual 
status of $79 million. The decrease was partially offset by $82 million of 
loans placed on nonperforming status.

     The following table shows the distribution of nonperforming assets at 
December 31, 1998 and 1997:

     Net charge-offs were $29 million in 1998, $354 million in 1997, and $455 
million in 1996. In 1998, net charge-offs were mainly related to commercial 
loans, while net charge-offs were primarily attributable to credit card loans 
in 1997 and 1996. The total allowance for credit losses was $636 million and 
$641 million at year-end 1998 and 1997. The ratio of the total allowance for 
credit losses to year-end loans was 1.66% and 1.82% at December 31, 1998 and 
1997 reflecting a $3.3 billion increase in loans in 1998.

     Based on an evaluation of individual credits, historical credit losses, 
and global economic factors, the Company has allocated its allowance for 
credit losses as follows:

                                   1998     1997     1996     1995     1994

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in the financial 
markets. Market risk arises from derivative financial instruments, such as 
futures, forwards, swaps and options, and other financial instruments, such 
as loans, securities, deposits and other borrowings. The market risks are 
primarily interest rate and foreign exchange risk, as well as credit risk. 

     The Company's risk management process begins with oversight by the 
Board of Directors, who periodically review risk management policies and 
controls and approves aggregate levels of risk. The Company's market risk 
governance structure includes two committees comprised of senior executives 
who review market risk activities, risk measurement methodologies, and risk 
limits, approve new products, and provide direction for the Company's 
market risk profile. The Asset/Liability Management Committee oversees the 
market risk management process for interest rate risk related to 
asset/liability management activities. The Treasury Risk Management 
Committee oversees the market risk management process for trading 
activities. Both committees are supported by a comprehensive risk 
management process that is designed to identify, measure, and manage market 
risk.


TRADING ACTIVITIES AND RISK MANAGEMENT

     The Company's trading activities are primarily oriented towards acting 
as a market maker for the Company's customers. The risk from these market 
making activities and from the Company's own positions is managed by the 
Company's traders and limited in total exposure as described below.

     The Company manages trading risk through a system of position limits, 
a value at risk (VAR) methodology, stop loss advisory triggers, and other 
market sensitivity measures.  Risk is monitored and reported to senior 
management by an independent unit on a daily basis.  The VAR methodology 
captures, based on certain assumptions, the potential overnight pre-tax 
dollar loss from adverse changes in fair values of all trading positions.  
The calculation assumes a one day holding period for most instruments, 
utilizes a 99% confidence level, and incorporates the non-linear 
characteristics of options. This methodology does not attempt to evaluate 
risk created from extraordinary financial, economic or other occurrences, 
some of which have recently occurred, and any risk evaluation system has 
judgmental aspects.

     The following table indicates the calculated VAR amounts for the 
trading portfolio for the years ending December 31, 1998 and 1997.  During 
these periods, the daily trading loss did not exceed the calculated VAR 
amounts on any given day.

ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

     The Company's activities other than trading include lending, investing 
in securities, accepting deposits, raising money as needed to fund assets, 
and processing securities and other transactions. The market risks that 
arise from these activities are interest rate risk, and to a lesser degree, 
foreign exchange risk.  The Company's primary market risk is exposure to 
movements in US dollar interest rates. Exposure to movements in foreign 
currency interest rates also exists, but to a significantly lower degree. 
The Company actively manages interest-rate sensitivity (the exposure of net 
interest income to interest rate movements). In addition to gap analysis, 
the Company uses earnings simulation and discounted cash flow models to 
identify interest rate exposures.

     An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to assess 
changes in pre-tax net interest income. The model incorporates management's 
assumptions regarding interest rates, balance changes on core deposits, and 
changes in 

<PAGE> 34
prepayment behavior of loans. These assumptions have been developed through 
a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. 
Derivative financial instruments used for asset/liability management 
purposes are also included in this model.

     The Company evaluates the effects on earnings of alternate interest 
rate scenarios against earnings. A base line, high and low rate scenario 
are considered to model interest rate sensitivity. Interest rate scenarios 
are obtained from an independent third party. The base line scenario for 
January 1999 assumes rates remain relatively flat for the first 12 months 
of the forecast. The high rate scenario forecasts rates increasing steadily 
throughout the year. Rates rise on average 138 basis points over the base 
line scenario. The low rate scenario assumes that rates at year end 1999 
are on average 95 basis points below the baseline forecast. Additionally, 
200 basis point shock scenarios are reviewed to examine the impact of large 
interest rate movements. Interest rate sensitivity is quantified by 
calculating the change in pre-tax net interest income between the three 
scenarios over a 12 month measurement period. Net interest income as 
calculated by the earnings simulation model under the base line scenario 
becomes the standard. The measurement of interest rate sensitivity is the 
percentage change in net interest income calculated by the model under high 
rate versus base line scenario and under low rate versus base line 
scenario.  These scenarios do not include the strategies that management 
could employ as rate expectations change.  

     The Company's policy limit for fluctuations in pre-tax net interest 
income resulting from either the high rate or low rate scenario under the 
earnings simulation model is 6%. Based on the January 1999 outlook, if 
interest rates were to rise to follow the high rate scenario, net interest 
income would be positively affected by 2.45%. If interest rates were to 
follow the low rate scenario, net interest income would be negatively 
affected by 4.59% (assuming management took no action). Assuming that the 
up or down 200 basis point scenarios occurred, net interest income would 
increase 2.95% in the upward shock and be negatively affected by 3.93% in 
the downward shock.

     To manage foreign exchange risk, the Company funds foreign currency-
denominated assets with liability instruments denominated in the same 
currency. The Company utilizes various foreign exchange contracts if a 
liability denominated in the same currency is not available or desired, and 
to minimize the earnings impact of translation gains or losses created by 
investments in overseas markets. The foreign exchange risk related to the 
interest rate spread on foreign currency-denominated asset/liability 
positions is managed as part of the Company's trading activities. The 
Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of its 
net investment in foreign operations. At December 31, 1998, net investments 
in foreign operations approximated $375 million and were spread across 13 
foreign currencies.

     The Company's equity investments of $1.7 billion at December 31, 1998 
primarily consisted of venture capital investments, equity positions from 
debts previously contracted, equity positions in other financial 
institutions, and minority interests in various subsidiaries. The majority 
of these long-term investments are of a long-term strategic nature and 
accordingly the Company does not view fluctuations in the market prices of 
these securities as having a material impact on the Company's operations. 
Changes in prices for marketable equity securities are reflected in the 
Statements of Changes in Shareholders' Equity. All equity investments are 
evaluated on a regular basis for permanent impairment.


SEGMENT PROFITABILITY 

Segment Data

     The Company has adopted a new accounting pronouncement requiring 
disclosure about the Company's segments based on a management approach. The 
Company has an internal information system that produces performance data 
for its four segments along product and service lines. 


<PAGE> 35
     The Trust, and Securities and Cash Processing segment provides a broad 
array of fee based services. Trust includes personal trust and investment 
management. Securities servicing includes services to both institutional 
issuers and investors. Cash processing products primarily relate to funds 
transfer, deposit services and trade finance.

     The Corporate Banking segment provides lending services, including 
asset based financing, to domestic and international commercial 
enterprises.

     The Retail Banking segment includes consumer lending, residential 
mortgage lending, and retail deposit services. 

     The Financial Markets segment includes trading, investing and leasing 
activities, and treasury services to other segments.

     The Company's segment data has been determined on an internal 
management basis of accounting, other than the generally accepted 
accounting principles used for consolidated financial reporting. These 
measurement principles ensure that reported results of the segments track 
their economic performance. Segment results are subject to restatement 
whenever improvements are made in the measurement principles or 
organizational changes are made. 

     The measure of revenues and profit or loss by operating segment has 
been adjusted to present segment data on a taxable equivalent basis. The 
provision for credit losses allocated to each reportable segment is based 
on management's judgment as to average credit losses that will be incurred 
in the operations of the segment over a credit cycle of a period of years. 
Management's judgment includes the following factors among others: 
historical charge-off experience and the volume, composition and growth of 
the loan portfolio. This method is different from that required under 
generally accepted accounting principles as it anticipates future losses 
which are not yet probable and therefore not recognizable under generally 
accepted accounting principles. Assets and liabilities are match funded. 
Support and other indirect expenses are allocated to segments based on 
general guidelines.

     The segments contributed to the Company's profitability as follows:

* - Reconciling items for net interest income primarily relate to the 
recording of interest income on a taxable equivalent basis, reallocation of 
capital and the funding of goodwill. Reconciling items for noninterest 
income primarily relate to gains on the sale of the Company's credit card 
operation, sales of interest in Wing Hang Bank and other securities and the 
sale of a building. Reconciling items for noninterest expense include $101 
million, $105 million, and $105 million of goodwill amortization in 1998, 
1997, and 1996, and corporate overhead. The adjustment to the provision for 
credit losses reflects the difference between the aggregate of the credit 
provision over a credit cycle for the reportable segments and the Company's 
recorded provision. The reconciling items for average assets consist of 
goodwill and other intangible assets.

Segment Highlights

     In the Trust, and Securities and Cash Processing segment, securities 
servicing fees increased to $1 billion as compared with $790 million in 
1997 and $655 million in 1996. All of the Company's businesses have shown 
strong internal growth with ADRs, global custody, domestic custody, UIT, 
stock transfer, securities lending, corporate trust, and execution services 
performing particularly well in 1998. In addition to internal growth, the 
increase reflects the late 1997 acquisition of ESI and in 1998 several 
small corporate trust businesses and a clearing business. Fee revenues from 
issuer services grew to $422 million in 1998, up from $309 million in 1997 
and $223 million in 1996. The Company's ADR business benefited from record 
depositary receipt trading volume on US exchanges which grew 27% in 1998. 
In addition, the Company was named as agent on 162 new programs from 43 
countries, or 80% of all new sponsored depositary receipt programs in 1998. 
Investment company services increased to $338 million in 1998, as compared 
to $268 million in 1997 and $240 million in 1996. Domestic and global 
custody continued to gain momentum from significant new business wins in 
the mutual funds and insurance industries. Broker/dealer services in 1998 
were $240 million, up from $213 million in 1997 and $191 million in 1996. 

<PAGE> 37
     Fees from cash processing in 1998 increased to $256 million over 
1997's $239 million and 1996's $209 million. Funds transfer fees were 
particularly strong in 1998, growing by 13% to $94 million, with cash 
management fees ahead of the prior year by 7%, reaching $46 million. Funds 
transfer fees in 1997 and 1996 were $83 million and $70 million, while cash 
management fees totaled $43 million and $38 million. Fees from trust and 
investment management grew to $208 million in 1998, as compared to $181 
million in 1997 and $161 million in 1996, reflecting new business growth 
and generally strong markets.

     Net charge-offs in the Trust, and Securities and Cash Processing 
segment were zero in 1998 and 1997 and $1 million in 1996. The rise in 
noninterest expense is consistent with the increase in growth as well as 
the added salary and other expenses from acquisitions.

     The Corporate Banking segment's net interest income has demonstrated a 
consistently upward trend from $544 million in 1996 to $585 million in 1997 
and increasing by 16% to $677 million in 1998, reflecting strong loan 
growth over the past three years in addition to acquisitions of asset based 
lending businesses in 1998 and 1997. In 1998, Special Industries lending 
increased 16% over the prior year, while Regional Commercial lending was up 
10% over 1997.

     The 1998 provision for credit losses reflects the growth in the loan 
portfolio. Net charge-offs in the Corporate Banking segment were $16 
million, $75 million, and $1 million in 1998, 1997, and 1996. The 21% 
increase in noninterest income to $305 million in the current year reflects 
higher asset based lending revenue following the acquisitions of UK asset 
based lending businesses. Syndication fees in 1998 increased nearly 33% 
over 1997. This trend was offset by continued lower income from the 
Company's offshore banking subsidiaries. The increase in 1998's noninterest 
expense is also partially attributable to acquisitions related to the 
Company's asset based lending business.

     The decreases in the Retail Banking segment's net interest income, 
provision for credit losses, noninterest income, and noninterest expense in 
1998 and 1997 are principally due to the sale of a portion of the Company's 
credit card operation in 1996 and the remainder in 1997. Net interest 
income in the branch banking network has been negatively impacted by the 
declines in the value of noninterest bearing sources of funds in a 
declining rate environment. 

     Net charge-offs were $5 million, $280 million and $452 million in 
1998, 1997, and 1996. Operating expenses relating to branch banking 
decreased in the current year, due in part to the sale of 11 retail 
branches in late 1997. 

     In the Financial Markets segment, net interest income increased 10% 
from 1996's $61 million to $66 million in 1997 followed by a 42% increase 
to $94 million in 1998. Noninterest income rose from $138 million in 1996 
to $186 million in 1997 to $252 million in 1998, a 35% increase in each of 
the last two years, reflecting increases in foreign exchange and other 
trading revenue. Strong equity markets resulted in increased securities 
gains included in noninterest income in 1998 and 1997. Net charge-offs were 
$7 million in 1998 and zero in 1997 and 1996. The increase in noninterest 
expense in 1998 and 1997 reflects increased compensation expense associated 
with the expansion of the Company's trading activities.

YEAR 2000 READINESS

The Company's Year 2000 compliance program consists of updating major 
Company-owned application systems, business-area supported systems, and the 
Company's proprietary customer software and evaluating the Year 2000 
compliance efforts of vendors of major vendor-supplied systems. The 
Company's compliance efforts have also focused on assessing the Year 2000 
readiness of its major service providers, business partners, and borrowers 
as well as contingency planning.

     The Company has divided its major proprietary applications systems 
into three business line groups.  The applications in each group were 
subjected to a four-phase process of assessment, renovation, certification 
testing, and implementation. All critical systems have completed all four 
phases. Compliant versions of substantially all these applications are 
currently in use. Major business-line products are being made available in 
isolated future-dated environments for customers to test their interfaces 
and to assure themselves of the Company's compliance.  

     The Company has identified its critical vendor-supplied systems. These 
systems have been internally certified as Year 2000 compliant in accordance 
with the Company's internal certification procedures.

     Remediation of the Company's proprietary customer software has been 
completed. Installation on client desktop computers is expected to be 
complete by July 1999. Customers have been advised of their obligation to 
assure that their environments are compliant in order for the Company's 
software to function correctly during and after the century date change.

     The Company has completed an initial evaluation of its significant 
business partners, including other financial service providers, 
correspondents, counterparties, sub-custodians, vendors and settlement 
agencies, for the purpose of assessing their Year 2000 compliance. The 
Company is currently satisfied with the progress and Year 2000 readiness 
programs of each significant third party. The Company will continue to 
monitor the readiness and progress of these parties throughout 1999. The 
Company is prepared to replace service providers that are seen as not 
managing the Year 2000 issue adequately.

     The Company considers Year 2000 readiness in its credit decisions and 
factors this into borrower ratings. Based on a review of significant 
obligors, the Company believes that exposure to obligor Year 2000 problems 
does not present a material risk to the Company. 

     The Company's personal computers and physical facilities considered 
critical to the Company's operations are expected to be upgraded to Year 
2000 readiness by the end of July 1999.

     The Company's contingency plans relating to Year 2000 issues include 
the identification and assessment of the impact of various worst case 
scenarios on the critical operational components for each of the Company's 
business units. The Company is in the process of reviewing the 
applicability of its current contingency plan, which includes creation of 
command centers, establishment of special rapid response technology teams, 
scheduling availability of key personnel, testing and simulation 
activities, offsite data center facilities, and emergency backup power, and 
expects to complete modifications to the Plan by June 30, 1999.

     Overall the Company's Year 2000 compliance program is on or ahead of 
schedule to meet the needs of its customers and compliance deadlines 
defined by its regulators. The estimated cost of the Year 2000 project is 
approximately $82 million. In 1998 and 1997, the Company spent $33 million 
and $18 million for a total of $51 million through December 31, 1998.

     A material Year 2000 problem could result in an interruption in, or a 
failure of, certain normal business activities or operations. Such problems 
could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations, 
liquidity and financial condition. Due to the general uncertainty inherent 
in 
<PAGE> 41
the Year 2000 problem, resulting in part from the uncertainty of the Year 
2000 readiness of suppliers, customers and other business partners, as well 
as companies with which the Company does not have direct business 
relations, the Company is unable to determine at this time whether the 
consequences of the Year 2000 failures will have a material impact on the 
Company's results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. The Year 
2000 compliance program is intended to significantly reduce the Company's 
level of uncertainty about the Year 2000 problem and, in particular, about 
the Year 2000 compliance and readiness of its material business partners. 
The Company believes that, with completion of its Year 2000 compliance 
program as scheduled, the possibility of significant interruptions of 
normal operations should be reduced. However, because of the unprecedented 
nature of this issue, there can be no certainty as to its impact.

     Readers are cautioned that forward looking statements should be read

Securities Servicing and Cash Processing
- ----------------------------------------

The Bank of New York delivers comprehensive solutions for investors and 
issuers worldwide through an extensive array of products and services, 
outstanding client relationship management and creatively applied 
technology. Through our global operations centers and superior global 
network, we deliver unmatched services to clients in their own time zones 
and languages.  Overall these businesses contributed 37% of total bank 
earnings.

Investment Lifecycle

In 1998, we continued the transition from basic portfolio servicing to 
supporting the entire investment lifecycle. Through recent acquisitions and
product enhancements, we support investment decisions, execution and 
portfolio analysis. Our ability to offer the client a complete array of 
securities services has resulted in an increase in revenue of 27%. 

     We offer investment managers a variety of analytical tools: AA Expert 
for asset allocation, DR Converter (service mark) for investors in 
depositary receipts and Vertex for pre-trade compliance.

     When it comes to executing an investment decision, we offer the 
following solutions: GlobalTrade (service mark), the first ever Windows 
(registered trademark)-based, real-time equity trade management system, 
gives institutions access to more than 40 equity markets worldwide.

     Through BondNet (service mark), we provide the bond market with the 
most advanced electronic trading systems available today. For trade 
settlements requiring foreign currency, we provide FX Execution.

     We continue to improve our capabilities and efficiency through major 
system developments such as our Securities Information Warehouse, a common 
repository for pricing and information on securities we hold for clients. 
Our acquisition of a majority interest in EVEREN Clearing, now known as BNY 
Clearing, marks our entry into the correspondent clearing business. And our 
acquisition of the UK-based institutional custody and unit trust 
trusteeship business of Coutts & Co. further enhances the products we 
offer.

     The last phase of the investment lifecycle is portfolio analysis. Our 
lnformPA platform provides on-line access to a comprehensive array of 
performance and analytic services. For post trade compliance reporting, we 
offer BNY Compliance (service mark). And finally, our BNY Value at Risk 
product assists in analyzing portfolio risk.

     Other service introductions during 1998 included INFORM, which 
provides clients with enhanced on-line information and real-time brokerage 
and execution services via the Internet, and STEP (Straight-Through 
Execution and Processing) which connects and integrates all securities 
processing products, services and systems onto a single platform. 

INVESTOR SERVICES

The need to maximize investment performance, coupled with the rising costs 
of portfolio servicing, has prompted many institutional investors to 
reevaluate their investment approach. As a leading provider of global 
investor services, The Bank of New York delivers comprehensive services to 
help clients attain their strategic goals. We have the global network, 
local market expertise, resources and advanced technology to support our 
clients' safekeeping, trade settlement, risk management and reporting needs 
wherever the client may be invested.


<PAGE> 43

Custody

We continue to maintain our leadership position as a global custodian 
throughout the world. We are well positioned to take advantage of 
continuing industry consolidation as well as the increasing reliance on 
outsourcing, as companies turn to experts who offer services requiring 
scale and significant technology investments. Our clients include insurance 
companies, central banks, mutual funds, commercial banks and government 
agencies. We are also one of the largest providers of trustee and custody 
services to clients with multiple investment portfolios such as pension 
funds, foundations, endowments, public funds and Taft-Hartley funds.

     The Bank's international network of branches and representative 
offices ensures that we maintain both a strong global presence as well as a 
complete understanding of regional markets. We are one of the largest 
global custodians in the world. Assets under custody grew 30% in 1998 to 
more than $5.1 trillion. The 88 markets in which we operate enable us to 
offer one of the most extensive and highly rated sub-custodian networks in 
the world.

Securities Lending

In 1998, we leveraged our industry expertise, exceptional distribution 
network and capital markets orientation to provide clients with the highest 
securities lending returns available in the marketplace. We increased our 
market share and overall outstanding securities lending activity by nearly 
15%, which ranks us among the largest bank agents in the world. During the 
second half of 1998, we formed Wall Street Portfolio Advisors, a separate 
and highly focused  securities lending unit which immediately added 20 new 
client relationships. Growth was also driven by our increasing presence in 
the foreign central bank market and expansion of lendable assets from new 
and existing customers.

Broker/Dealer Services

We remain the largest clearer of government agency and mortgage-backed 
securities, as well as the largest tri-party collateral agent for 
broker/dealer financing activities.

     In 1998, we added a record number of new tri-party relationships and 
continued to see significant growth in our global collateral management 
service for international investors. Securities collateral under 
administration reached a record $300 billion. Moreover, collateral under 
administration increased more than 20% since year-end 1997 and clearance 
transactions grew more than 15%.

Mutual Fund and Unit investment Trust Services

As one of the world's largest custodians for the mutual funds industry, we 
develop solutions for our clients that can include worldwide custody, 
portfolio accounting/administration and cash management services. Growth in 
non-US custody, investment accounting services and offshore fund 
administration has fueled mutual fund revenue increases. For non-US 
registered mutual funds, we provide global solutions through our offices in 
Dublin, Grand Cayman and Luxembourg.

     In 1998, we recorded a 20% growth in fund assets under custody, 
reaching over $750 billion. During 1998, we added ten new fund manager 
appointments and increased the number of portfolios serviced to over 1,700.

     Unit Investment Trust continues to benefit from the issuance of new 
equity trusts by our major sponsors, which was evidenced by our 17% growth.


<PAGE> 44

Trade Execution Services

Through our subsidiary BNY ESI & Co., Inc., we provide institutional 
investors with a complete range of products and services which capture 
value at every point of the trading process, improving overall performance 
and profitability. These include execution and commission management 
services, as well as clearing and settlement, which provides follow through 
and control from order entry to settlement.


ISSUER SERVICES

The Bank offers a complete line of services to satisfy the specialized 
needs of global securities issuers, including debt and equity issuance, 
reorganization and proceeds management. Through our international network 
of offices in 26 countries, we provide solutions to the challenges faced by 
corporations, governments and municipalities worldwide.

Depositary Receipt Services

We are the leader in servicing American (ADRs) and Global (GDRs) depositary 
receipts, which enable US and non-US investors to purchase dollar-
denominated equity securities of non-US companies, and provide the issuers 
of these securities access to the US and European capital markets.

     1998 was a record year for our depositary receipt (DR) business. We 
won over 80% of all new issues that came to market in more than 40 
countries. The Bank currently issues depositary receipts for more than 
1,200 programs representing over 65 countries. This accounts for 62% of all 
public DR programs. In addition, we currently serve 185 GlobalBuyDIRECT 
(service mark) programs, a direct purchase and sale plan for investors in 
depositary receipts of non-US companies. DR revenues increased by more than 
30% as we benefited from the growth and diversity of our DR client base, 
the strong increase in trading volume up 25% over 1997 and the introduction 
of new products and services. An important factor contributing to the 
increase in trading volume has been the expanded investor interest in 
Europe for depositary receipts traded on US or European stock exchanges.

     During 1998, we introduced several new products that will strengthen 
our position in the market and provide new growth opportunities.

    DR Converter (trademark) is an analytical product that allows investors 
to evaluate the cost advantage of purchasing DRs when compared to investing 
directly in foreign shares.

     We introduced the first real-time, market value-weighted index to 
track the performance of all American and global depositary receipts 
trading on US stock exchanges. The Bank of New York ADR Index (service 
mark) consists of US exchange-listed DR companies from over 35 countries 
with a total market capitalization of over $3 trillion. The Bank of New 
York ADR Index contains a composite index and four regional indices for: 
Europe, Asia, Latin America and emerging markets. We will soon introduce 
additional indices that will review specific sectors such as Latin America 
telecom, European oil and gas and the Euroland index. These indices can be 
viewed through our web site at www.bankofnycom/adr.

     With the launch of the Euro, the Bank introduced the Euro DR, which 
allows companies not participating in the Euro currency to access investors 
who wish to trade and hold Euro-denominated shares.

     For the first time, a DR Unit was established for one of the largest 
telecorn privatizations. The DR Unit listed and traded on the NYSE was 
designed to provide current shareholders with a single exchange listed 
security representing ownership in the twelve companies that were created 
by the privatization.

     Overall, growth prospects for the DR business are excellent as 
investors continue their strong interest in international markets. 
Additional growth will develop as non-US governments continue to sell 
state-owned enterprises and the current global merger and acquisition 
activity creates new opportunities for the use of DRs.

<PAGE> 45

Corporate Trust

With 67,000 issues representing more than $700 billion in securities 
outstanding, the Bank strengthened its leadership role in the corporate 
trust industry during 1998. This was further demonstrated by our 
appointment to serve as common depository for Euroclear and Cedel. We were 
able to grow our revenue over 20% by delivering the highest quality trustee 
and agency services to corporate and municipal debt issuers around the 
world. Our intensified efforts to provide trustee and other services for 
global structured finance products contributed substantially to this record 
growth. In fact, as one of the most successful providers of global 
corporate trust services, we have over 650 appointments for debt placements 
in nearly 50 countries. Our achievement in the international markets 
underscores our ability to support virtually every known type of global 
debt instrument.

     In 1998, we responded to the changing global debt markets by 
introducing new services for collateralized loan obligations and bond 
obligations as well as asset-backed commercial paper. Our Global Structured 
Products Unit leverages both our experience with structured financings and 
the Bank's unique network of global safekeeping capabilities to help 
issuers develop customized strategies for their programs. Our other eight 
corporate trust business units, Corporate Finance, Municipal Finance, 
International Finance, Escrow and Insurance Services, Asset-Backed 
Securities, Mortgage-Backed Securities, Derivative Products and Successor 
Management and Default Administration, support all types of debt on the 
market. In addition, the Bank launched a dedicated corporate trust web site 
(wwwbankofnycom/corptrust) and introduced on-line investor reporting for 
mortgage and asset-backed securities investors via the Internet 
(wwwbnymbs.com).

Stock Transfer

As one of the world's leading stock transfer agents, we offer a complete 
array of stock transfer services, including shareholder recordkeeping, 
dividend paying and reinvestment, proxy tabulation and exchange agent 
services for corporate issuers of equity securities. In addition, we 
provide a vast range of interrelated services, such as direct registration, 
direct purchase and sale plans, employee stock option plans, initial public 
offerings and corporate reorganization services. During the last decade, we 
have earned a reputation for providing sophisticated administrative, 
operational and technological tools, as well as the professional expertise 
necessary to meet the requirements of today's marketplace.

     Our shareholder base grew 20% and we added 55 transfer clients, 
representing nearly 1.5 million shareholders. We now serve 11.5 million 
shareholders for more than 550 clients. Corporate actions, such as stock 
split activity, spin-offs and mergers remained high and are expected to 
experience continued growth in 1999. Consolidation continues to fuel 
business growth as the trend toward outsourcing persists. While innovations 
in technology help to meet the demands of increased transaction volumes, 
they also serve to create new and enhanced technology-driven products and 
services. As the markets move toward a book-entry environment new 
opportunities to generate increased transaction fees will be realized.


CASH PROCESSING

We deliver flexible cash processing options to a diversified customer base, 
providing varied payment and collection methods for account funding and 
cash movement. Our cash products are supplemented by a full range of 
electronic reporting capabilities. Many of our customers have selected The 
Bank of New York Office Manager (trademark), a Windows (registered 
trademark) -based family of products, to easily obtain integrated access to 
the Bank's funds transfer, trade, deposit and information reporting 
services.

Funds Transfer

By fully automating our processing, we have realized efficiencies in funds 
transfer, which involves the processing of electronic payment orders. The 
underlying business activity reflects global trade, securities and foreign 
exchange transactions in which our customers are parties.


<PAGE> 46

     On an average day, the Bank processes over 110,000 transactions with 
an aggregate value exceeding $600 billion. In 1998, our share of funds 
transfer transactions increased for the seventh straight year and fees were 
up 13%. In the last five years, we were the only bank to significantly 
increase our market share, growing from 6.5% to 10.6%.

Trade Services

We deliver a wide range of services that facilitate global trade flows, 
including letters of credit, bankers acceptances, reimbursements and 
government insurance programs. Our customers include corporations involved 
in import and export trade transactions as well as banks that deliver 
global trade services.

     In 1998, global economic conditions and depressed trade flows resulted 
in unchanged trade services revenues. We are confident that activity levels 
and revenues will improve throughout 1999. We have implemented several new 
technologies, such as document imaging technology and an Internet-based 
reporting product.

Cash Management

We offer a broad array of cash management solutions which include 
disbursement, collection and reporting services ranging from traditional 
check processing to sophisticated electronic services such as the realtime 
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). Revenues increased 17% in 1998, well 
ahead of market growth.

Trust, Investment Management and Private Banking
- ------------------------------------------------

Our private client business produced fee revenues of $208 million, a 15% 
increase over the preceding year, and the third consecutive year of double-
digit gains. These results were driven by an aggressive new business 
development effort, strong investment performance and a growing demand for 
sophisticated services.


     We are one of the largest bank managers of trust and investment assets 
in the United States. We provide a complete range of services for the 
affluent investor including: Personal Asset Management, Trust and Estate 
Administration, Personal Financial Planning, Personal and Advisory Custody 
and Private Banking Services. Corporations, nonprofit institutions and 
investment advisors have come to rely on the Bank as a premier provider of 
equity, fixed-income and specialty investment services, such as Short-Term 
Money Management (STMM) and Portfolio Transition Services. Total assets 
under management grew by 12% in 1998 and now exceed $48 billion.

     All of the BNY Hamilton Equity Mutual Funds outperformed their peer 
universe, with the Large Cap, Small Cap and International Equity Funds 
significantly outperforming their peers. Equity, Fixed-Income and Balanced 
account results for institutional portfolios all ranked in the top quartile 
for the year. This strong investment performance was similarly reflected in 
our individually managed portfolios for private clients.

     This past year we introduced the BNY Partners Fund. This "fund of 
funds" comprises private equities, specifically buyout, venture capital and 
special situation funds. Long used by institutional money managers, our 
fund makes private investment opportunities accessible to wealthy 
individuals. The potential for higher returns, high level of 
diversification and access to specialty advisors offered by these 
partnerships is increasingly attractive to wealthy individuals and 
families.

     Our Advisory Custody business experienced rapid growth in 1998 with 
assets in custody increasing 28% over 1997. This business provides 
investment advisors throughout the country with the sophisticated custody 
and reporting tools they require to serve their individual clients.

<PAGE> 47

     We are well positioned for continued growth as a greater number of 
affluent individuals seek expert financial advice, portfolio management and 
customized service. Our customer base includes long-standing institutional 
and multigenerational personal relationships and is continuing to grow.

     We are committed to retaining our position as an industry leader 
through a continuing program of investment and new product introductions. 
In 1999, we will open two new private banking offices in New Canaan and 
Westport, Connecticut and will introduce new products, including planned 
giving services and a margin account for high net worth clients.

Corporate Banking
- -----------------

The Bank is a financial partner to thousands of large domestic and 
multinational corporations as well as regional and middle market companies 
located in the tri-state area. Together with BNY Capital Markets, Inc., we 
provide credit and fee-based services, including commercial lending, bond 
underwriting and other capital markets services. The Bank also provides 
corporate customers with securities servicing, trade execution, cash 
processing, risk management, trade finance and foreign exchange services.

     The breadth of our unique product offerings provide us with a distinct 
competitive advantage, enhancing our ability to serve our client base. Our 
corporate lending franchise serves as a foundation for the cross selling of 
other bank services and has led to the introduction of many new product 
offerings. Broad relationships are the basis of our strategy, as our 
corporate lending clients have become major users of all of our other 
value-added services.

Special Industries Banking

The Bank holds a leadership position in providing financing and other 
corporate banking services to certain key industry sectors, including media 
and telecommunications, energy and public utilities, retail and apparel, 
and real estate. In 1998 loan volume throughout the sector showed 
significant growth, with particular strength in media and 
telecommunications, where we underwrote 47 credits as agent, totaling over 
$30 billion.

Financial Companies Services

Financial companies represent the Bank's largest and fastest growing 
market. Clients include insurance companies, mutual ftinds, banks, 
investment managers, broker/dealers and government agencies. We offer these 
companies a full array of credit and non-credit services, ranging from 
lending and custody to trade execution. Over 90% of our clients subscribe 
to more than one service, with the average customer using over six 
products.

US Commercial Banking

The Bank continues as a major resource to large companies. We have a 
sizable and diverse portfolio of commercial lending clients, ranging from 
traditional industrial manufacturers to national wholesale distribution and 
service companies. At the end of 1998, the average corporate client used 
more than six distinct products, up from three in 1996. And overall, 80% of 
our clients use more than one service.

Regional Commercial Banking

Mid-sized commercial banking customers in the tri-state area can choose 
from our extensive list of sophisticated banking services. These services 
include traditional lending, cash management, leasing, capital markets and 
corporate finance. Our services for these customers are supported by our 
extensive branch system. In addition, we offer a full range of personal and 
fiduciary services to the principals of these companies. The average loan 
outstandings in this area grew 10% in 1998.

Leasing

BNY Capital Funding LLC is one of the largest bank-owned leasing companies 
in the United States offering a full array of leasing products. We develop 
innovative and creative structuring to meet the tax-oriented equipment 
financing needs of our corporate customers. In 1998, we participated in 
over $1.6 billion in lease transactions. Through our middle market 
subsidiary, BNY Capital Resources Corporation, we completed $151 million in 
financing, providing an alternative funding source for our clients' capital 
acquisition needs. In 1998, we also introduced BNY Leasing Edge, offering 
lease financing to small businesses and middle market clients through the 
Bank's retail network.

Capital Markets

Your company provides capital markets and investment banking services 
through its BNY Capital Markets, Inc. subsidiary. Services include the 
structuring and syndication of credit facilities, underwriting and 
distribution of corporate bonds, private placement of debt securities and 
merger, acquisition and other financial advisory services. Two key 
strategic acquisitions were Mendham Capital Group, which significantly 
expanded our offerings in the areas of corporate bond underwriting, sales, 
trading and research; and Patricof & Co. Capital Corp., which enhanced our 
mergers and acquisitions and other specialized financial service 
capabilities.

     We ranked seventh among major banks acting as agent or co-agent on 
syndicated corporate credit facilities, up from eleventh, five years 
earlier, as we helped our clients raise over $200 billion in bank 
financing. BNY Capital Markets, Inc. also expanded corporate bond 
underwriting activities in 1998 and acted as a co-manager/placement agent 
on 41 investment grade and high yield bond transactions as compared with 
nine in 1997. This raised over $20 billion for our clients, up 
significantly from $2.4 billion in the prior year. In addition, our 
Municipal Securities Group, which specializes in underwriting and trading 
investment grade tax-exempt securities, posted strong results for the year.

International Banking

The Bank has 30 international branches and representative offices in 26 
countries throughout Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia and the Middle 
East and an established network of over 2,300 foreign correspondent banks. 
We are among the top five US issuers of import trade letters of credit and 
a major player in facilitating export trade transactions. In addition, our 
global presence provides an important marketing platform for all of our 
processing businesses, including depositary receipts, global custody, 
securities lending, cash processing and trade execution. The increased 
globalization of the securities markets provides us with enhanced 
opportunities for continued revenue growth.

Retail Banking
- --------------

With its network of 359 branches in three states, the Retail Bank offers us 
an extensive distribution channel for our consumer products, establishing 
us as a leader in the suburban metropolitan regions. Today, we serve over 
600,000 personal households and 140,000 small businesses, providing a full 
range of traditional banking services as well as a complete array of retail 
investment products.

     Retail banking continues to serve as a source of $14 billion in stable 
core deposits that assist in funding lending areas throughout the Bank. We 
have experienced strong market acceptance of Priority Value Banking, a 
package of deposit services with pricing specifically tailored to meet the 
needs of the individual. In 1998, we introduced new investment and fee-
based products aimed at attracting new customers and solidifying 
relationships through cross-selling.


<PAGE> 49

     In November, we launched our Direct 24 (service mark) Debit Card 
program. Checking customers now enjoy the convenience of direct access to 
their accounts not only at our ATMs, but also at supermarkets, department 
stores and service stations throughout our market area. Our Direct 24 
(service mark) PC Banking and Bill Paying Services also provide 24-hour 
service to our customers. In the last two years, the number of depositors 
using these products has doubled, as individuals and businesses have become 
aware of the ease of accessing information and conducting transactions 
through desktop computers.

     Our Group Banking Plan provides preferred banking packages to 
employees of our business customers, deepening relationships with both 
business and individual consumers. The fee revenue growth from this program 
has been 20% annually for the last three years.

     Checkinvest (registered trademark), which automatically sweeps excess 
balances daily from a checking account to a mutual fund, continues to be a 
key business product. An innovation of The Bank of New York, CheckInvest 
accounts grew by 24% in 1998 with mutual fund balances exceeding $500 
million. Continuing our commitment to deliver specialized services, we 
opened two Business Banking Centers in midtown Manhattan offering business 
consulting information to our customers. Access is available to a business 
site that allows customers to network with other business owners, to 
identify business prospects and to share ideas with other Bank clients. 
Customer reaction has been very positive, with checking balances increasing 
14%. We plan to increase the number of dedicated branches in 1999.

     BNY Mortgage Company, LLC, provides financing for one to four family 
homes, condominiums and cooperative apartments through offices in the tri-
state area and is the leading originator of New York State-backed loans for 
first-time buyers. We offer a broad range of innovative programs including 
loans for first-time borrowers, jumbo mortgages and reverse mortgages. 
During 1998 we entered into a joint venture with Alliance Mortgage Company 
that will enable us to significantly increase the resources committed to 
originating mortgages while broadening the product lines.

     The BNY Investment Centers, a third-party service provider, increased 
mutual fund sales volume by 13% over 1997. The expansion of financial 
offerings through the BNY Investment Centers is a major component of our 
retail strategy. Investment products such as mutual funds, fixed and 
variable annuities, and municipal bonds represent important opportunities 
for future growth.

Asset Based Lending
- -------------------

The Bank is a leading provider of asset based loans through BNY Financial 
Corporation, our factoring and commercial finance subsidiary. Average asset 
based loans outstanding in 1998 were $3.2 billion, 52% higher than 1997.

     BNY Financial Corporation and its affiliates are the largest factor in 
Canada and the United Kingdom, and the second largest in the United States. 
Factoring, accounts receivable management and secured lending services are 
provided through our offices in New York, Boston, Atlanta, Charlotte, Los 
Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Toronto and Montreal. In 1998, we consolidated 
our two factor and asset based lending companies in the United Kingdom into 
one location.

     BNY Financial Corporation supports the credit needs of firms that 
cannot obtain bank financing on a fully secured basis. The financing 
available through our asset based lending programs enables clients to 
secure credit with balance sheet assets, such as accounts receivable, 
inventory, equipment and real estate. Intangible assets such as trademarks, 
licenses, franchise rights and intellectual property can also be used as 
collateral in our programs.


<PAGE> 50

     We optimize borrowing efficiency and continued growth for our clients 
by offering effective receivables management programs. By purchasing 
accounts receivables, we provide immediate working capital to fund 
inventory, marketing efforts or normal obligations. And, we can reduce a 
client's overhead by taking on certain labor-intensive, optional tasks. 
Clients can take advantage of these services on an individual basis or use 
the complete program as a total outsourcing solution.

     Continuing enhancements to our technology have increased our ability 
to acquire new business and serve international markets. Factored volume 
during 1998 reached $26.7 billion, a 60% increase over 1997 levels.

Financial Market Services
- -------------------------

Financial Market Services includes the Bank's foreign exchange and 
interest-rate risk management products as well as our trading and investing 
activities. These businesses, operating around the world, benefit from the 
growth of our custody client base and increasing sales of products to 
Corporate clients both here and abroad. Revenues for 1998 reached $170 
million, a 36% increase over 1997, and were driven by increased customer 
volumes.

Foreign Exchange

We are a premier FX provider, trading in over 100 currency markets around 
the world. In 1998, we expanded our global customer base by 15%, increased 
the total number of transactions by 23% and customer volumes by 68%.

Customized Derivative Solutions

The Bank ranks among the top US banks in derivative activity, offering a 
full array of currency and interest rate options, swaps and risk management 
solutions. We are a recognized leader in exotic option strategies 
worldwide.

Global Risk Management Services

In 1998, we expanded our suite of research products and now provide 
currency professionals with a wide array of research and technological 
tools for the foreign exchange market. We expanded our interest rate 
derivatives customer base by 40% and established a market leadership 
position in providing risk management products to US government agencies. 
In addition, we introduced six Internet accessible programs which will 
enable clients to evaluate market activity and risk.

BNY Overlay Associates

BNY Overlay Associates is the Bank's specialist currency overlay manager, 
providing investment advisory services to institutional investors. Using 
proprietary techniques, we manage clients' existing currency exposures with 
the twin objectives of managing risk and increasing overall portfolio 
returns. 1998 represented our most successful year in terms of client 
mandates and assets under management.
