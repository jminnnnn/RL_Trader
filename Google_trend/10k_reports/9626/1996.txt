ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
- -----------------

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT

     To the extent that any forward looking statements are made, the Company
is necessarily unable to predict future changes in interest rates, economic
activity and loan demand.  As a result of variations in such factors, actual
results may differ materially from any forward looking statements.

INTRODUCTION

     The business of The Bank of New York Company, Inc. (the "Company") and
its subsidiaries is described in the "Business Review" section of the
Company's 1995 Annual Report to Shareholders which description is included in
Exhibit 13 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.  Also, the
"Management's Discussion and Analysis" section included in Exhibit 13 contains
financial and statistical information on the operations of the Company.  Such
information is herein incorporated by reference.

COMPETITION

     The businesses in which the Company operates are very competitive. 
Competition is provided by both unregulated and regulated financial services
organizations, whose products and services span the local, national, and
global markets in which the Company conducts operations.

     Savings banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions actively
compete for deposits, and money market funds and brokerage houses offer
deposit-like services.  These institutions, as well as consumer and commercial
finance companies, national retail chains, factors, insurance companies and
pension trusts, are important competitors for various types of loans.  Issuers
of commercial paper compete actively for funds and reduce demand for bank
loans.  For personal and corporate trust services and investment counseling
services, insurance companies, investment counseling firms, and other business
firms and individuals offer active competition.  A wide variety of domestic
and foreign companies compete for processing services.

CERTAIN REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

General

     As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to the regulation and
supervision of the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act
("BHC Act").  The Company is also subject to regulation by the New York State
Department of Banking.  Under the BHC Act, bank holding companies may not
directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of the
voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company, including a
bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.  In addition,
bank holding companies are generally prohibited under the BHC Act from
engaging in nonbanking activities, subject to certain exceptions.

     The Company's subsidiary banks are subject to supervision and examination
by applicable federal and state banking agencies.  The Bank of New York
("BNY"), a New York chartered banking corporation and The Bank of New York
(NJ) ("BNYNJ"), a New Jersey chartered banking corporation are members of the
Federal Reserve System and are subject to regulation and supervision
principally by the Federal Reserve Board.  As banks insured by the FDIC, BNY
and BNYNJ are also subject to examination by that agency.  The Bank of New
York (Delaware) ("BNY Del."), chartered in Delaware, and The Putnam Trust
Company ("PTC"), chartered in Connecticut, are FDIC-insured non-member banks
and therefore subject to regulation and supervision principally by the FDIC. 
BNY, BNYNJ, BNY (Del.), and PTC are also subject to supervision and
examination by their respective state regulators,

<PAGE> 3

the New York Banking Department, the New Jersey Banking Department, the Office
of State Bank Commissioner of the State of Delaware, and the Connecticut
Banking Department.

    Both federal and state laws extensively regulate various aspects of the
banking business, such as permissible types and amounts of loans and
investments, permissible activities, and reserve requirements.  These
regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather
than the Company's stockholders.

Capital Adequacy

     Bank regulators have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for bank
holding companies and banks.  The minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to
risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items) is 8%.  At
least half of the total capital is to be comprised of common stock, retained
earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, minority interests and for
bank holding companies, a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual
preferred stock, less certain intangibles including goodwill ("Tier 1
capital").  The remainder ("Tier 2 capital") may consist of other preferred
stock, certain other instruments, and limited amounts of subordinated debt and
allowance for loan losses.

     In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum Leverage
Ratio (Tier 1 capital to average total assets) guidelines for bank holding
companies and banks, and the FDIC has established substantially identical
minimum leverage requirements for state chartered FDIC-insured, nonmember
banks.  The Federal Reserve Board's guidelines provide for a minimum Leverage
Ratio of 3% for bank holding companies and banks that meet certain specified
criteria, including those having the highest regulatory rating.  All other
banking organizations will be required to maintain a Leverage Ratio of at
least 3% plus an additional cushion of 100 to 200 basis points.  The
guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal
growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital
positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without
significant reliance on intangible assets.  Furthermore, the guidelines
indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will continue to consider a "Tangible
Tier 1 Leverage Ratio" in evaluating proposals for expansion or new
activities.  The Tangible Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the ratio of Tier 1
capital, less intangibles not deducted from Tier 1 capital, to average total
assets.  The Federal Reserve Board has not advised the Company of any specific
minimum Leverage Ratio applicable to it.  See "FDICIA" below.

     Federal banking agencies have proposed or are considering regulations
that would modify existing rules related to capital ratios with respect to
various areas of risk including interest rate exposure and other market risk. 
The Company does not believe that the aggregate impact of these modifications
would have a significant impact on its capital position.

FDICIA

     The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
("FDICIA"), substantially revised the depository institution regulatory and
funding provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ("FDIA") and made
revisions to several other federal banking statutes.  
     Among other things, FDICIA requires the federal banking regulators to
take prompt corrective action in respect of FDIC-insured depository
institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements.  FDICIA
establishes five capital tiers: "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized,"
"undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" and "critically
undercapitalized."  Under applicable regulations, an FDIC-insured bank is
defined to be well capitalized if it maintains a Leverage Ratio of at least
5%, a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of at least 6% and a Total Capital Ratio of at
least 10% and is not otherwise in a "troubled condition" as specified by its
appropriate federal regulatory agency.  A bank is generally considered to be
adequately capitalized if it is not defined to be well capitalized but meets
all of its minimum capital requirements, i.e., if it has a Total Capital Ratio
of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 4% or greater and a Leverage Ratio
of 4% or greater.  A bank will be considered undercapitalized if it fails to
meet any minimum required measure, significantly undercapitalized if it is
significantly below any such measure and critically undercapitalized if it
maintains a

<PAGE> 4

level of tangible equity capital equal to or less than 2% of total
assets.  A bank may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower
than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an
unsatisfactory examination rating.

     FDICIA generally prohibits an FDIC-insured depository institution from
making any capital distribution (including payment of dividends) or paying any
management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would
thereafter be undercapitalized.  Undercapitalized depository institutions are
subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System.  In
addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth
limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans.  For an
undercapitalized depository institution's capital restoration plan to be
acceptable, its holding company must guarantee the capital plan up to an
amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution's assets at the
time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when
the institution fails to comply with the plan.  In the event of the parent
holding company's bankruptcy, such guarantee would take priority over the
parent's general unsecured creditors.  The federal banking agencies may not
accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan
is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the
depository institution's capital.  If a depository institution fails to submit
an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized.

     Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to
a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient
voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total
assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. 
Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment
of a receiver or conservator.

     The Company's major banking subsidiaries are well capitalized.

     The table below indicates capital ratios of the Company and its major
banking subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the respective
guidelines for well capitalized institutions under FDICIA.

     A discussion of the Company's capital position is incorporated by
reference from the caption "Capital Resources" in the "Management's Discussion
and Analysis" section of Exhibit 13.

Brokered Deposits

     The FDIC has adopted regulations under FDICIA governing the receipt of
brokered deposits.  Under the regulations, a bank cannot accept, rollover or
renew brokered deposits unless (i) it is well capitalized or (ii) it is
adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC.  A bank that
cannot receive brokered deposits also cannot offer "pass-through" insurance on
certain employee benefit accounts.  Whether or not it has obtained such a
waiver, an adequately capitalized bank may not pay an interest rate on any
deposits in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates
specified by regulation.  There are no such restrictions on a bank that is
well capitalized.  Because BNY and BNY Del. are well capitalized, the Company
believes the brokered deposits regulation will have no material effect on the
funding or liquidity of BNY and BNY Del.  BNYNJ and PTC are well capitalized,
but have no brokered deposits.

FDIC Insurance Assessments 

     BNY, BNY Del., BNYNJ, and PTC are subject to FDIC deposit insurance
assessments.  As required by FDICIA, the FDIC adopted a risk-based premium
schedule to determine the assessment rates for most FDIC-insured depository
institutions.  Effective January 1, 1996, under the schedule, the premiums
range from zero to $.27 for every $100 of deposits compared to a range of $.04
to $.31 for every $100 of deposits from June 1, 1995 to December 31, 1995 and
a previous range of $.23 to $.31 for every $100 of deposits.  Each financial
institution is assigned to one of nine categories based on the institutions
capital ratios and supervisory evaluations, and the premium paid by the
institution is based on the category.  Under the present schedule institutions
in the highest of the three capital categories and the highest of three
supervisory categories pay no premium and institutions in the lowest of these
categories pay $.27 per $100 of deposits.  

     The FDIC is authorized to raise insurance premiums in certain
circumstances.  Any increase in premiums would have an adverse effect on the
Company's earnings.  

     Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon
a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is
in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any
applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by a bank's
federal regulatory agency.

Depositor Preference

     The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 provides for a national
depositor preference on amounts realized from the liquidation or other
resolution of any depository institution insured by the FDIC.  That act
requires claims against insured depositary institutions to be paid in the
following order of priority: the receiver's administrative expenses; deposits;
other general or senior liabilities of the institution; obligations
subordinated to depositors or general creditors; and obligations to
shareholders.  Under an FDIC interim rule, which became effective August 13,
1993, "administrative expenses of the receiver" are defined as those incurred
by the receiver in liquidating or resolving the affairs of a failed insured
depository institution.  

<PAGE> 7

Acquisitions

     The BHC Act generally limits acquisitions by the Company to commercial
banks and companies engaged in activities that the Federal Reserve Board has
determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident
thereto.  The Company's direct activities are generally limited to furnishing
services to its subsidiaries and activities that qualify under the "closely
related" and "proper incident" tests.  Prior Federal Reserve Board approval is
required under the BHC Act for new activities and acquisitions of most
nonbanking companies.

     The BHC Act, the Federal Bank Merger Act, and the New York Banking Law
regulate the acquisition of commercial banks.  The BHC Act requires the prior
approval of the Federal Reserve Board for the direct or indirect acquisition
of more than 5% of the voting shares of a commercial bank.  

     Effective September 29, 1995, The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and
Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 ("IBBEA")  permits bank holding companies,
with Federal Reserve Board approval, to acquire banks located in states other
than the bank holding company's home state without regard to whether the
transaction is permitted under state law.  In addition, IBBEA provides that,
commencing June 1, 1997, national banks and state banks with different home
states will be permitted to merge across state lines, with the approval of the
appropriate federal banking agency, unless the home state of a participating
bank passes legislation between the date of enactment of IBBEA and May 31,
1997 expressly prohibiting interstate mergers.  IBBEA further provides that
states may enact laws permitting interstate bank merger transactions prior to
June 1, 1997 (opt-in statutes).  A bank may also establish and operate a de
novo branch in a state in which the bank does not maintain a branch if that
state expressly permits de novo branching.  Once a bank has established
branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may
establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where
any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have established
or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law.  A bank that has
established a branch in a state through de novo branching may establish and
acquire additional branches in such state in the same manner and to the same
extent as a bank having a branch in such state as a result of an interstate
merger.  One effect of this legislation, will be to permit the Company to
merge two or more of its banking subsidiaries which, as a result, may create
greater efficiency in its operations.  New York and Connecticut have enacted
opt-in statutes.

     The merger of BNY with another bank would require the approval of the
Federal Reserve Board or other federal bank regulatory authority and, if the
surviving bank is a New York state bank, the New York Superintendent of Banks.

     In reviewing bank acquisition and merger applications, the bank
regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive
effect of the transaction, financial and managerial issues including the
capital position of the combined organization, and convenience and needs
factors, including the applicant's record under the Community Reinvestment
Act.

     Under Federal Reserve Board policy, the Company is expected to act as a
source of financial strength to its banks and to commit resources to support
such banks in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy.  In
addition, any loans by the Company to its banks would be subordinate in right
of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of its banks.

Restrictions on Transfer of Funds

     Restrictions on the transfer of funds to the Company and subsidiary bank
dividend limitations are discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Exhibit 13.  Such discussion is incorporated herein by
reference.

FDIA

     Under the FDIA, a depository institution insured by the FDIC can be held
liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the
FDIC after August 9, 1989 in connection with (i) the default of a commonly
controlled FDIC-insured depository institution or (ii) any assistance provided
by the FDIC to a commonly controlled, FDIC-insured depository institution in
danger of default.  "Default" is defined generally as the appointment of a
conservator or receiver, and "in danger of default" is defined generally as
the existence of certain conditions indicating that a "default" is likely to
occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.

Government Monetary Policies

     The Federal Reserve Board has the primary responsibility for monetary
policy; accordingly, its actions have an important influence on the demand for
credit and investments and the level of interest rates and thus on the
earnings of the Company.

Proposed Legislation

     Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking
industry are frequently introduced in Congress, in the state legislatures and
before the various bank regulatory agencies.  The likelihood and timing of any
such changes and the impact such changes might have on the Company and its
subsidiaries, however, cannot be determined at this time.

Interest-Rate Sensitivity
- -------------------------

     The Company actively manages interest-rate sensitivity (the exposure of
net interest income to interest rate movements).  The relationship between
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is closely monitored. 
The Company attempts to develop and follow policies which are flexible enough
to capitalize on opportunities, while minimizing adverse effects on earnings
when changes in short-term and long-term interest rates occur.  The Company
uses complex simulation models to adjust the structure of its assets and
liabilities in response to interest rate exposures.
       The Company considers three basic scenarios to model interest rate
sensitivity; these are base line, high rate, and low rate.  The base line
scenario is the Company's estimated most likely path for future short-term
interest rates.  The base line scenario forecast in January 1996 assumes rates
will decline slightly during the first quarter of 1996 and then rise back to
year end 1995 levels during the fourth quarter of 1996.  The "high rate"
scenario assumes a 153 basis point increase from the base line scenario.  The
"low rate" scenario assumes the average rate declines 50 basis points under
the base line scenario.  Additionally, other scenarios are reviewed to examine
the impact of other interest rate changes.
     The Company quantifies interest rate sensitivity by calculating the
change in net interest income between the three scenarios over a 12 month
measurement period.  Net interest income as calculated by the earnings
simulation model under the base line scenario becomes the standard.  The
measurement of interest rate sensitivity is the percentage change in net
interest income calculated by the model under high rate versus base-line
scenario and under low rate versus base-line scenario.  The scenarios do not
include the adjustments that management would make as rate expectations
change.
     The Company's policy limit for fluctuations in net interest income
resulting from either the high rate or low rate scenario is 6.00 percent. 
Based upon the January 1996 outlook, if interest rates were to rise to follow
the high rate scenario, then net interest income during the policy measurement
period would be positively affected by 2.26 percent.  If interest rates were
to follow the low rate scenario, then net interest income would be negatively
affected by 0.22 percent (assuming management took no actions).
     In addition to the policy limit discussed above, the Company also has a
global mismatch limit to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations on
the Company's earnings. The Company's global mismatch is defined as the
absolute value of the Company's asset repricings less liability repricings in
24 maturity bands ranging from one day to over 10 years.  Off balance sheet
instruments, such as swaps and futures used to hedge balance sheet items are
included in the calculation of the global mismatch.  Each year the Company's
Board of Directors approves both mismatch limits and earnings at risk limits. 
The global mismatch is reviewed weekly by senior management.  Estimated market
value changes under various interest rate scenarios are also monitored.
     The following table reflects the year-end position of the Company's
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that either reprice
or mature within the designated time periods.  The interest sensitivity
indicated by this table is not necessarily indicative of the Company's
interest sensitivity models discussed above because within each time period,
assets and liabilities reprice on different dates and at different levels, and
interest sensitivity gaps change daily.  A positive interest  sensitivity gap,
for a particular time period, is one in which more assets reprice or mature
than liabilities.  A negative interest sensitivity gap results from a greater
amount of liabilities repricing or maturing.  A positive gap implies that
there are more rate sensitive assets than liabilities which suggests that as
interest rates rise, the return on assets will rise faster than the funding
costs.  Conversely, a negative gap indicates a higher ratio of rate sensitive
liabilities than assets.  In such case, if interest rates rise, then funding
costs will rise at a faster rate than the return on assets.  The cumulative
gap is the sum of the dollar gap for sequential time periods.

LOANS AND PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES
- -------------------------------------------------

     The provision for loan losses was $330 million in 1995, compared with
$162 million in 1994 and $284 million in 1993.  The increase in the provision
compared with 1994 was principally related to charge-offs in the credit card
portfolio.  In 1995, the Company continued to experience improvement in the
asset quality of business loans as nonperforming loans dropped.

     At December 31, 1995, the domestic commercial real estate portfolio had
approximately 81% of its loans in New York and New Jersey, 4% in California,
3% in New England, and 2% in Pennsylvania; no other state accounts for more
than 1% of the portfolio.  This portfolio consists of the following types of
properties:

                                                                  ====

     At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Company's nonperforming real estate
loans and real estate acquired in satisfaction of loans aggregated $114
million and $119 million, respectively.  Net charge-offs of real estate loans
were $16 million in 1995 and $6 million in 1994.  In addition, other real
estate charges were $5 million and $11 million in 1995 and 1994. 

     At December 31, 1995  the Company's LDC exposures consisted of $49
million in medium-term loans (and no material commitments), $447 million in
short-term loans, $9 million in accrued interest, and $148 million in equity
investments.  At December 31, 1995, the allowance for loan losses associated
with LDC loans was $74 million.  In addition, the Company has $316 million of
debt securities to emerging market countries, including $280 million (book
value) of bonds whose principal payments are collateralized by U.S. Treasury
zero coupon obligations and whose interest payments are partially
collateralized.

     The Company's consumer loan portfolio is comprised principally of credit
card, other installment, and residential loans.  Residential and auto loans
are collateralized, thereby reducing the risk.  Credit card delinquencies and
charge-offs increased compared to last year.  Credit card accounts past due
over 30 days were 4.50% of managed outstandings at the end of 1995 compared
with 3.34% at the end of 1994.  Credit card net charge-offs were $267 million
in 1995 compared to $149 million in 1994.  The 1995 and 1994 amounts exclude
$2 million and $32 million in net charge-offs related to the portion of the
portfolio that was securitized.  As a percentage of average credit card
outstandings, net charge-offs were 3.44% in 1995 compared to 2.47% in 1994. 
On a managed receivables basis, net charge-offs as a percentage of average
outstandings were 3.44% in 1995 compared to 2.68% in 1994.  Other consumer net
charge-offs were $5 million in 1995 and $7 million in 1994.

     The Company's loans to the energy industry primarily consist of credits
with investor-owned electric and gas utilities, and oil, gas and mining
companies.  Nonperforming loans in this industry amounted to $11 million at
year-end 1995 and 1994.  There were no charge-offs in 1995 and 1994.
     
<PAGE> 15     
     
     The Company's loans to the communications, entertainment, and publishing
industries primarily consist of credits with cable television operators,
broadcasters, magazine and newspaper publishers, motion picture theaters and
regional telephone companies.  There were no nonperforming communications
loans at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and there were no charge-offs in 1995 and
1994.    

     The Company's portfolio of loans for purchasing or carrying securities is
comprised largely of overnight loans which are fully collateralized, with
appropriate margins, by marketable securities.  Throughout its many years of
experience in this area, the Company has rarely experienced a loss.

     The Company makes short-term, collateralized loans to mortgage bankers
to fund mortgages sold to investors.  There were no nonperforming loans at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, and there were no charge-offs in 1995 and 1994.

     Based on an evaluation of individual credits, historical loan losses, and
global economic factors, the Company has allocated its allowance for loan
losses as follows:

                                 1995       1994       1993      1992     1991
                                 ----       ----       ----      ----     ----
Real Estate Loans                  7%         9%         8%        9%      10%
Other Domestic Commercial 
 and Industrial Loans             57         56         64        64       62
Consumer Loans                    25         16         10         9       10
Foreign Loans (excluding 
 medium-term LDC loans)            1          7          6         6        6
LDC Loans                         10         12         12        12       12 
                                 ----       ----       ----      ----     ----
                                 100%       100%       100%      100%     100%
                                 ====       ====       ====      ====     ====

     Such an allocation is inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for
loan losses is available to absorb loan losses regardless of the nature of the
loan.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies

The Company provides a complete range of banking and other financial services
to corporations and individuals worldwide through its sectors: Trust, and
Securities and Other Processing; Retail Banking; Corporate Banking; and Other.

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial
statements.  Amounts subject to significant estimates and assumptions are
items such as the allowance for loans losses, pension and postretirement
obligations, and the fair value of financial instruments.  Actual results
could differ from these estimates.     

     The following is a summary of the Company's more significant accounting
and reporting policies.

Securities - Effective January 1, 1994, the Company accounts for debt and
equity securities classified as available-for-sale at fair value, except for
those equity securities whose fair value cannot be readily determined.  These
securities are carried at cost.  Equity investments of less than a majority
but at least 20% ownership are accounted for by the equity method and
classified as other assets.  For securities carried at fair value the after
tax effect of net unrealized gains and losses is reported as a separate
component of shareholders' equity.  Previously such securities were stated at
the lower of aggregate cost or market value.  

     Securities classified as trading assets are carried at fair value, with
net unrealized holding gains and losses recognized currently in income.  Debt
securities, which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until
maturity, are classified as held-to-maturity and stated at cost, adjusted for
discount accrued and premium amortized.  Gains and losses on the sale of
securities are determined by the specific identification method.

Allowance for Loan Losses - The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a
level that, in management's judgment, is adequate to absorb future losses. 
Management's judgment is based on an evaluation of existing risks of
individual credits; past loan loss experience; the volume, composition, and
growth of the loan portfolio; current and projected economic conditions; and
other relevant factors.

     Effective January 1, 1995, the Company adopted a new accounting standard 
which introduces the time value of money into the determination of the
allowance for loan losses.  The portion of the allowance allocated to
nonaccrual commercial loans over $1 million is now measured by the difference
between their recorded value and fair value.  Fair value is either the present
value of the expected future cash flows from borrowers, market value of the
loan, or the fair value of the collateral.  The adoption of this accounting
standard did not have an impact on the Company's financial statements.

Nonperforming Assets - Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status when
collateral is insufficient and principal or interest is past due 90 days or
more, or when there is reasonable doubt that interest or principal will be
collected.  Accrued interest is usually reversed when a loan is placed on
nonaccrual status.  Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans may be
recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's
judgment.  Nonaccrual loans are not restored to accruing status until
principal and interest are current or they become fully collateralized. 
Consumer loans are not classified as nonperforming assets, but are charged off
based upon an established delinquency schedule determined by product. 
Interest accrual on consumer loans is suspended when the loans are 120 days
past due.  Real estate acquired in satisfaction of loans is carried in other
assets at the lower of the recorded investment in the property or fair value
minus estimated costs to sell.

<PAGE> 7

Derivative Financial Instruments - Derivative contracts, such as futures,
forwards, swaps, options, and similar products used in trading activities are
recorded at market value; gains and losses are included in other noninterest
income.  Unrealized gains and losses are reported on a gross basis in trading
account assets and other borrowed funds, after taking into consideration
master netting agreements.

     Derivative contracts are designated as an element of the Company's asset
and liability management (ALM) process when they alter the Company's interest
rate and foreign currency exposures.  Contracts used in the ALM process are
linked to specific or groups of similar assets or liabilities where there is a
high correlation between the derivative contract and the item altered, both at
inception and throughout the contract period.  ALM derivative contracts are
accounted for on the deferral, accrual, or mark-to-market basis, as noted
below.  Under the deferral or accrual method, gains and losses on terminated
derivative contracts are deferred and amortized over the remaining life
(currently averaging less than one year) of the linked assets or liabilities. 
Gains and losses on derivative contracts linked to assets or liabilities that
are sold are recognized as an adjustment to the gain or loss on the
disposition of the related asset or liability.

     Deferral Accounting - This method relates to principally futures
     and forwards.  Deferred gains and losses are reported as
     adjustments to the carrying value of the linked items.  The
     amortization of these deferred gains and losses is reported as
     interest income or expense related to the linked item.
     
     Accrual Accounting - Interest rate swap and purchased option
     contracts are accounted for on an accrual basis as an adjustment
     to the interest income or expense related to the linked item.
     
     Mark-to-Market Accounting - This method relates to derivative
     contracts linked to the securities available-for-sale portfolio. 
     Changes in market value are reported in shareholders' equity on a
     net-of-tax basis.  The accrual of interest on the derivative
     contracts is reported in interest income related to securities
     available-for-sale.
     
Other - Certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform its
presentation with the 1995 financial statements.

2.  Acquisitions and Dispositions

During 1995, the Company agreed to acquire several securities processing
businesses.  The major acquisitions include the securities lending, U.S. and
global custody, securities clearance, and master trust business of
BankAmerica, the securities lending and U.S. and global custody business of
J.P. Morgan,  and the corporate trust business of NationsBank.  Securities
processing revenues in 1995 did not include any revenue related to the J.P.
Morgan and BankAmerica acquisitions.  These acquisitions require payment of
additional consideration contingent upon future revenues.

     On September 1, 1995, the Company acquired The Putnam Trust Company of
Greenwich ("Putnam"), headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut.

     During 1994, the Company made acquisitions related to its corporate trust
and factoring businesses.

     In the first quarter of 1996, the Company made an acquisition related to
its unit investment trust business.

     The pro forma effect of the above acquisitions is not material.

     In 1995, the Company sold its mortgage servicing portfolio, recording a
pre-tax gain of $58 million.  The Company also completed the closing of its
mortgage origination offices on the West coast.  The Company will continue to
originate residential mortgages through offices in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut.

     In December 1995, $1,353 million of U.S. government obligations and $246
million of obligations of state and political subdivisions classified as held-
to-maturity were transferred to available-for-sale, as permitted by the
implementation guidelines for a new accounting standard.  The net unrealized
gains on these securities were $9 million at the time of transfer.  Realized
gross gains and (losses) on the sale of securities available-for-sale were $98
million and zero in 1995 and $17 million and $(1) million in 1994.

     Assets, including securities sold under repurchase agreements, carried at
$3 billion, $2 billion, and $3 billion at December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993
were pledged for various purposes as required or permitted by law.

4.  Loans

The Company's loan distribution and industry concentrations of credit risk at
December 31, 1995 and 1994 are incorporated by reference from "Loans" in the
Management's Discussion and Analysis Section of this Report.  The Company's
retail, community, and middle market banking operations in the New York
metropolitan area create a significant geographic concentration.  
     
     In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its banking
subsidiaries have made loans at prevailing interest rates and terms to
directors and executive officers of the Company and to certain entities to
which these individuals are related.  The aggregate dollar amount of these
loans was $720 million, $663 million, and $237 million at December 31, 1995,
1994, and 1993.  These loans are primarily with related entities under
revolving lines of credit.  During 1995 these loans averaged $768 million, and
ranged from $629 million to $994 million.  All loans were fully performing
during this period.  

Transactions in the allowance for loan losses are summarized as follows:

     Nonaccrual and reduced rate loans outstanding at December 31, 1995, 1994,
and 1993 were $225 million, $297 million, and $540 million.  At December 31,
1995, commitments to borrowers whose loans were classified as nonaccrual or
reduced rate were not material.

     At December 31, 1995, impaired loans (nonaccrual commercial loans over $1
million) aggregated $159 million, of which $95 million exceeded their fair
value by $22 million.  For 1995, the average amount of impaired loans was $182
million and interest income recognized on them (limited to cash received) was
$1 million.

     Interest income recognized on total nonaccrual and reduced rate loans
exceeded reversals by $2 million in 1995, $3 million in 1994, and $4 million
in 1993.  Interest income would have been increased by $19 million, $17
million, and $27 million if loans on nonaccrual status at December 31, 1995,
1994, and 1993 had been performing for the entire year.  At year end, foreign
(including LDC) loans on nonperforming status were $41 million in 1995, $77
million in 1994, and $130 million in 1993.  Interest income received on
foreign nonperforming loans equaled reversals in 1995, 1994, and 1993. 
Interest income would have been increased by $2 million, $2 million, and $6
million if foreign loans on nonaccrual status at December 31, 1995, 1994, and
1993 had been performing for the entire year.

     Other real estate was $72 million, $56 million, and $99 million at
December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993.  Writedowns of and expenses related to
other real estate included in noninterest expense were $5 million, $11
million, and $53 million (including operating expenses of $4 million, $4
million, and $8 million) in 1995, 1994, and 1993.

     Fixed-rate debt at December 31, 1995 had interest rates ranging from
6.50% to 8.50%.  The weighted average interest rates on fixed-rate debt at
December 31, 1995 and 1994 were 7.61% and 7.64%.  Exposure to interest rate
movements with respect to fixed rate debt is reduced by interest rate swap
agreements.  As a result of these agreements, the effective interest rates
differ from those stated.  The weighted average interest rates on variable-
rate debt at December 31, 1995 and 1994 were 6.27% and 6.25%.

     The Company's $114 million of 7.50% subordinated debentures due 2001 are
convertible at the option of the holder into common stock of the Company at a
price of $19.55 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. 
The debentures may be redeemed, at the option of the Company, on or after
August 15, 1996 at an initial redemption price of 103.75% of the principal
amount, declining by 0.75% per annum.

The following is a summary of the Company's preferred stock outstanding:

                                                                 ----   ----

     Holders of cumulative preferred stock have cumulative dividend rights in
preference to holders of common stock.  

     The 8.60% cumulative preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $625
per share and is redeemable at the option of the Company on and after December
1, 1997 at $625 per share, plus cumulative and unpaid dividends.

     At December 31, 1995, 13,737,557 warrants expiring in 1998 (exercise
price $31 per share) to purchase 27,475,114 shares of the Company's common
stock were outstanding.  

     At December 31, 1995, the Company had reserved for issuance 48 million
common shares pursuant to the terms of securities and employee benefit plans.

     The Company has a preferred stock purchase rights plan.  The plan
provides that if any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or
more of the Company's common stock (an "acquiring person"), then on and after
the tenth day thereafter, each right would entitle the holder (other than the
acquiring person) to purchase $400 in market value of the Company's common
stock for $200.  In addition, if there is a business combination between the
Company and an acquiring person, or in certain other circumstances, each right
(if not previously exercised) would entitle the holder (other than the
acquiring person) to purchase $200 in market value of the common stock of the
acquiring person for $100.  The rights are redeemable by the Company at $0.05
per right until they are exercisable, and will expire in 2004.

     In 1995, the effect of warrants on earnings per share is dilutive.  Fully
diluted earnings per share also give effect to the assumed conversion of
convertible debentures and convertible preferred stock.

     In 1995, the Company announced a plan to buy back through the end of 1996
up to 16 million shares of its common stock.  Approximately 5 million shares
will be used in connection with the purchase of Putnam, and shares may be used
in connection with certain employee benefit plans.  As of December 31, 1995,
2.2 million shares had been repurchased.

8.  Employee Benefit Plans

Pension Plans
- -------------
The Company has defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all
full-time employees.  The Company has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP),
which may provide additional benefits.  The Company's funding policy is to
annually contribute an amount necessary to satisfy the Internal Revenue
Service's funding standards.

     The following table presents the income (expense) components included in
net pension income:
  
  In millions                                         1995    1994    1993

     The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in computing
pension income was 10.0% in 1995 and 10.5% in 1994 and 1993.  The ESOP
provision was $3 million in 1995 and $1 million in 1994 and 1993.

Other Postretirement Benefits
- -----------------------------
     The Company provides health care and life insurance benefits for certain
retired employees.  

     The cost of these benefits consisted of the following components:

In millions                                       1995       1994       1993

     The assumed health care cost trend rates to be used in determining the
cost of these benefits for 1995 is 9%, decreasing proportionately in each
successive year to 6% in 2004 and thereafter.  A change of one percentage
point in this rate for each year would change the benefit obligation by 10%
and the cost of the benefits by 8%.

In 1995, the Company contributed $361 million of available-for-sale securities
to a subsidiary, recording a gain of $79 million, of which $16 million remains
unrealized at December 31, 1995. 
     
<PAGE> 19     
     
     The Bank of New York ("Bank"), a significant subsidiary, and The Bank of
New York (NJ) ("BNYNJ"), are subject to dividend limitations under the Federal
Reserve Act and state banking laws.  Under these statutes, prior regulatory
approval is required for dividends in any year that would exceed either bank's
net profits for such year combined with retained net profits for the prior two
years.  Putnam is subject to a similar limitation under state banking laws. 
The Bank and BNYNJ are also prohibited from paying a dividend in an amount
greater than "undivided profits then on hand" less "bad debts" (generally
loans six months or more past due).  Putnam is also prohibited from declaring
a dividend in excess of current retained earnings.

     Under the first of these limitations, in 1996 the Bank could declare
dividends of $893 million plus net profits earned in 1996, BNYNJ could declare
dividends of $53 million plus net profits earned in 1996, and Putnam could
declare dividends of $4 million plus net profits earned in 1996.  None of
these banks are restrained from paying dividends under the additional
limitations.  The dividend policy of The Bank of New York (Delaware)
("BNYDEL"), a significant subsidiary, is to declare dividends that, at a
minimum, allow it to meet capital guidelines established by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC").

     In addition to these statutory tests, the primary federal regulators of
the banks (the Federal Reserve Board in the case of the Bank and BNYNJ and the
FDIC in the case of BNYDEL and Putnam could prohibit a dividend if they
determined that the payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking
practice.  Bank regulators have indicated that, generally, dividends should be
paid by banks only to the extent of earnings from continuing operations.

     The Company, the Bank, BNYNJ, BNYDEL, and Putnam each must comply with
risk based capital and leverage ratio guidelines established by bank
regulators for bank holding companies and banks.  In addition, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") restricts
dividend payments that would cause certain capital ratios to fall below
"adequate" capital ratio standards.  Each of the Company, the Bank, BNYNJ,
BNYDEL and Putnam is in compliance with the capital and leverage ratio
standards applicable to it.

     Consistent with its policy regarding bank holding companies serving as a
source of financial strength for their subsidiary banks, the Federal Reserve
Board has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company
generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income
available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the
dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent
with the bank holding company's capital needs, asset quality, and overall
financial condition.

     The Federal Reserve Act limits amounts of, and requires collateral for,
extensions of credit by the Company's insured bank subsidiaries to the Company
and, with certain exceptions, its nonbank affiliates; also, there are
restrictions on the amounts of investments by such banks in stock and other
securities of the Company and such affiliates, and restrictions on the
acceptance of their securities as collateral for loans by such banks. 
Extensions of credit by insured bank subsidiaries to each of the Company and
such affiliates are limited to 10% of such bank subsidiary's capital and
surplus, and in the aggregate for the Company and all such affiliates to 20%.

     The subsidiary banks of the Company are required to maintain reserve
balances with Federal Reserve Banks under the Federal Reserve Act and
Regulation D.  Required balances averaged $770 million and $789 million for
the years 1995 and 1994.

10.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of the Company's financial instruments (i.e., monetary
assets and liabilities) are determined under different accounting methods-see
Note 1.  The following disclosure discusses these instruments on a uniform
basis - fair value.  However, active markets do not exist for a significant
portion of these instruments, principally loans and commitments.  As a result,
fair value determinations require significant subjective judgments regarding
future cash flows.  Other judgments would result in different fair values. 
Among the assumptions used by the Company are discount rates ranging
principally from 6% to 8% at December 31, 1995 and 7% to 11% at December 31,
1994.  The fair value information supplements the basic financial statements
and other traditional financial data presented throughout this Report.

     A summary of the practices used for determining fair value is as follows:

Securities, Trading Activities, and Derivatives Used for ALM        
- ------------------------------------------------------------        
The fair value of securities and trading assets and liabilities is based on
quoted market prices, dealer quotes, or pricing models.  The fair value of
derivative instruments such as options, future and forward rate contracts,
commitments to purchase and sell foreign exchange, and foreign currency swaps,
are similarly determined.  The fair value of interest rate swaps is the amount
that would be received or paid to terminate the agreement.  

Loans and Commitments
- ---------------------
For certain categories of consumer loans, fair value includes consideration of
the quoted market prices for securities backed by similar loans.  The fair
value of other types of loans is determined by discounting the future cash
flows  and using secondary market values.  The fair value of commitments to
extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit is
based upon the cost to settle the commitment.

Other Financial Assets
- ----------------------
The fair value of these assets is assumed to equal their carrying value due to
their short maturity.

Deposits, Borrowings, and Long-Term Debt
- ----------------------------------------
The fair value of noninterest-bearing deposits is assumed to be their carrying
amount.  The fair value of interest-bearing deposits, borrowings, and long-
term debt is estimated based upon the current rates for instruments of the
same remaining maturity or quoted market prices for the same or similar
issues.

     * Including forward rate agreements 


    A discussion of the credit, interest rate, and foreign exchange risks
inherent in off-balance-sheet financial transactions is presented under
"Liquidity" and "Trading and Off-Balance-Sheet Risks" in the Management's
Discussion and Analysis Section of this Report.

    The Company's financial assets and liabilities are primarily variable rate
instruments.  Fixed rate loans and deposits are issued to satisfy customer and
investor needs.  Derivative financial instruments are utilized to manage
exposure to the effect of interest rate changes on fixed rate assets and
liabilities, and to enhance liquidity.  The Company matches the duration of
derivatives to that of the assets and liabilities being hedged, so that
changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates will be offset.
 
    The Company uses receive fixed and pay fixed interest rate swaps, futures
contracts, and forward rate agreements to convert fixed rate loans, deposits,
borrowings, long term debt, and securitized credit card receivables to
floating rates.  The aggregate notional amount of the futures contracts in
1994 is greater than the amount of assets and liabilities hedged because the
three-month duration of the futures contract is shorter than the duration of
the assets hedged.  The basis swaps convert various variable rate borrowings
to LIBOR which better matches the assets funded by the borrowings. 

    The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value
of its investments in foreign subsidiaries.  The after-tax effects are shown
in the cumulative translation adjustment included in shareholders' equity.  At
December 31, 1995 and 1994, $237 million and $202 million in notional amount
of foreign exchange contracts, with fair values of $1 million and zero, hedged
corresponding amounts of foreign investments.  These foreign exchange
contracts had a maturity of approximately one month at December 31, 1995.

     Deferred net gains on derivative financial instruments used for ALM
amounted to $1 million and $4 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994.  

<PAGE> 23

     Net interest income increased by $17 million, $24 million, and $39
million in 1995, 1994, and 1993 as a result of derivative financial
instruments used for ALM.

     The following table illustrates the notional amount, remaining contracts
outstanding, and weighted average rates for interest rate contracts that were
used for ALM:

12.  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent
liabilities are outstanding which are not reflected in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.  Management does not expect any material losses
to result from these matters.   

     A summary of the notional amount of the Company's off-balance-sheet
credit  transactions, net of participations, at December 31, 1995 and 1994
follows:
                                                                    
In millions                                               
                                    
Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Risks                 1995               1994 
- ------------------------------                 ----               ----
Commercial Lending Commitments               $26,606            $21,931        
Credit Card Commitments                       18,874             15,512
Standby Letters of Credit                      4,257              4,085        
Commercial Letters of Credit                   1,728              2,070        
Securities Lending Indemnifications           15,068             15,326        

     The total potential loss on undrawn commitments, standby and commercial
letters of credit, and securities lending indemnifications is equal to the
total notional amount if drawn upon, which does not consider the value of any
collateral.  The Company does not anticipate the use of all of its unused
credit lines available to credit card holders by individual customers at one
time.  These credit lines are contingent upon customers maintaining specific
credit standards, and the Company has the right to reduce or cancel them at
any time.  
     Standby letters of credit principally support corporate obligations and
include $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion that were collateralized with cash and
securities at December 31, 1995 and 1994.  At December 31, 1995 and 1994,
securities lending indemnifications were secured by collateral of $15.1
billion and $15.3 billion.  At December 31, 1995, approximately $3.3 billion
of the standbys will expire within one year, $0.9 billion between one to five
years, and the balance after five years.  

     At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Company has recourse obligations
related to the sale of $79 million of mortgages and $1,251 million of
mortgages and credit card receivables.  The Company has recorded liabilities
for these  obligations of zero and $7 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994.

     A summary of the notional amount and credit exposure of the Company's
derivative financial instruments at December 31, 1995 and 1994 follows:

     The Company's exposure to credit loss for lending commitments, letters of
credit, and securities lending indemnification is represented by the
contractual amount of those transactions.  Since many of the commitments are
expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total amount does not
necessarily represent future cash requirements.  In securities lending
transactions, the Company requires the borrower to provide collateral, thus
reducing the credit risk.

     The notional amounts for other off-balance-sheet risks express the dollar
volume of the transactions; however, the credit risk is much smaller.  The
Company performs credit reviews and enters into netting agreements to minimize
the credit risk of foreign currency and interest rate risk management
products.  Exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk is reduced by
entering into offsetting positions.

     At December 31, 1995 approximately $13.1 billion of interest rate
contracts will mature within one year, $11.0 billion between one and five
years, and the balance after five years.  Substantially all foreign exchange
contracts mature within one year.  At December 31, 1995 there were no
derivative financial instruments on nonperforming status.

     Net rent expense for premises and equipment was $94 million in 1995, $96
million in 1994, and $99 million in 1993.

     At December 31, 1995, the Company and its subsidiaries were obligated
under various noncancelable lease agreements, certain of which provide for
additional rents based upon real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance and
for various renewal options.  The minimum rental commitments under
noncancelable operating leases for premises and equipment having a term of
more than one year from December 31, 1995 are as follows:

     In 1990, Northeast Bancorp., Inc. brought suit against the Company
seeking money damages of $350 million related to a terminated merger
agreement.  The suit was settled in November 1995 for $13 million.

     In the ordinary course of business, there are various claims pending
against the Company and its subsidiaries.  In the opinion of management,
liabilities arising from such claims, if any, would not have a material effect
upon the Company's consolidated financial statements.


13.  Other Noninterest Income and Expense

Other noninterest income includes equity in earnings of unconsolidated
subsidiaries of $62 million, $34 million, and $46 million in 1995, 1994, and
1993.  Other noninterest expense includes deposit insurance premiums of $32
million, $52 million, and $57 million in 1995, 1994, and 1993 and amortization
of intangibles of $74 million, $86 million, and $81 million in 1995, 1994, and
1993.

14.  Stock Option Plans

The Company has stock option plans (the Option Plans) which provide for the
issuance of stock options at fair market value at the date of grant to
officers and key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.  Under the
Company's 1993 Plan, options to acquire common stock may be granted in amounts
that do not exceed, on a cumulative basis, 1% of the outstanding shares of
common stock per year, and, subject to adjustment, options covering no more
than approximately 9.5 million shares in the aggregate may be granted during
the first five years.  Generally, each option granted under the Option Plans
is exercisable between one and 10 years from the date of grant.  The following
is a summary of activity under the Option Plans for the years 1995, 1994, and
1993:

In 1996, a new accounting standard will allow the Company to continue to
account for its Option Plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25
("APB 25") or switch to fair value.  The Company plans to continue using APB
25 and as a result no compensation cost will be recorded related to the
granting of options. If fair value accounting had been used to account for
stock options in 1995, the Company estimates earnings per share would have
been reduced by 3 cents.

15.  Foreign Operations

The Company's foreign activities consist of banking, trust, and processing 
services provided to customers domiciled outside of the United States,
principally in Europe and Asia.  The following financial information
concerning such activities reflects direct attributions and charges for funds
employed, based upon average costs of interest-bearing funds:

Independent Auditors' Report                                                 


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Bank of
New York Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31,
1995 and 1994, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1995.  These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Bank
of New York Company, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1995 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Company's Financial Condition and
Results of Operations
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
SUMMARY OF RESULTS

For the year 1995, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. (the "Company") reported
record net income of $914 million or a record $4.30 per fully diluted share,
compared with $749 million or $3.70 per fully diluted share in 1994 and $559
million or $2.72 per fully diluted share in 1993.  Earnings per share for 1995
were reduced by 21 cents for the dilutive effect of the Company's warrants.
     In 1995, net interest income, the net interest rate spread, and net yield
on interest earning assets reached record levels.  Loan demand was strong in
1995, particularly in corporate lending across the United States, and in all
of the special industry lending areas.  Revenues from the Company's securities
processing business grew 14% in 1995.  All areas of securities processing
increased, led by ADRs, corporate trust, and master trust.  In 1995, other
processing fees grew 11% over last year led by increases in funds transfer and
trade finance revenues.  The provision for loan losses increased to $330
million.  Operating expenses remained under tight control.
     In 1995, returns on average common equity and on average assets
established all-time highs.  Return on average common equity was 19.42% in
1995 compared with 18.49% in 1994 and 14.98% in 1993, while return on average
assets for 1995 was 1.72% compared with 1.49% in 1994 and 1.20% in 1993.
     Nonperforming assets declined by $56 million, or 16%, to $297 million in
1995.  December 31, 1995 marked the eighteenth consecutive quarter that
nonperforming assets declined.
     In 1994, net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased to
$1,763 million as the net interest spread increased to 3.30% and the net yield
on interest earning assets was 4.11%.  These increases reflect a continued
shift in the asset mix toward higher yielding assets, including strong growth
in credit cards.  A reduction in nonperforming assets also contributed to the
increase in net interest income.  Revenues from the Company's securities and
other processing businesses remained strong.  A lower provision for loan
losses and continued control of operating expenses contributed to higher
earnings.
     In 1993, spreads widened reflecting a continuing shift in asset mix
toward higher yielding assets and a lower level of nonperforming assets.  Fee
income was strong, especially from credit cards and securities and other
processing.  A lower provision for loan losses, continued control of operating
expenses, and the acquisition of 62 branches of Barclays Bank of New York,
N.A. ("Barclays") on December 11, 1992, also helped to increase earnings. 
Earnings at The Bank of New York (NJ) ("BNYNJ") increased significantly in
1993.

NET INTEREST INCOME

Dollars in millions                           1995          1994         1993
                                              ----          ----         ----
Net Interest Income on a Taxable
 Equivalent Basis                           $2,068        $1,763       $1,550
Net Interest Rate Spread                      3.41%         3.30%        3.12%
Net Yield on Interest-Earning Assets          4.53%         4.11%        3.84%


     Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased 17% in 1995
to $2.1 billion.  Continuing growth in the loan portfolio and wider interest
rate spreads contributed to the increase during 1995.  Average loans grew 11%
to $35.4 billion in 1995 from $32.0 billion in 1994.  Managed credit card
outstandings were up 13% to $8.7 billion from $7.7 billion and the number of
card accounts increased to 6.4 million from 6.0 million.  Other loan growth
was attributable to strong demand in corporate lending across the United
States and in all of the special industries lending areas.  The acquisition of
Putnam added $105 million to average loan outstandings.  The increase in the
yield also reflects an increase in the volume of interest-free sources of
funds by $813 million (a portion attributable to compensating balances in lieu
of servicing fees), and higher returns on these funds.
     On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income increased 14% in 1994. 
Credit card growth, the large decline in nonperforming loans, and wider
interest rate spreads contributed to this growth during 1994.  Average loans
grew to $32.0 billion in 1994 from $30.4 billion in 1993.  Managed credit card
outstandings were up by 24% to $7.7 billion at December 31, 1994.  Large
corporate lending in the U.S. also showed strong growth.  The net interest
rate spread and net yield on interest-earning assets increased by 6% and 7% in
1994.  The spread and yield benefitted from the return of most of the
Company's credit card securitization to its balance sheet.  The increase in
the yield also reflects an increase in the volume of interest-free sources of
funds by $281 million (a portion attributable to compensating balances in lieu
of servicing fees), and higher returns on these funds in a rising interest
rate environment.
     Net interest income increased 8%, the spread by 7%, and the yield by 6%
in 1993.  Contributing to these increases were a $0.7 billion rise in the
level of average interest-earning assets, the Company being liability
sensitive in a declining rate environment, and the large decline in
nonperforming loans.  The increase in yield also reflects a higher volume of
interest-free sources of funds, partially offset by lower returns on these
funds in a low interest rate environment.  
     The credit card securitizations reduced net interest income by $5 million
in 1995, $87 million in 1994, and $162 million in 1993.   
     Interest income would have been increased by $19 million, $17 million,
and $27 million if loans on nonaccrual status at December 31, 1995, 1994, and
1993 had been performing for the entire year.

NONINTEREST INCOME

Noninterest income is provided by a wide range of fiduciary and processing
services, other fee-based services, and trading activities.  These revenues
were $1,496 million in 1995, compared with $1,289 million in 1994 and $1,319
million in 1993.    
     Securities processing fees were $411 million, $359 million, and $309
million in 1995, 1994, and 1993.  Other processing fees, principally funds
transfer, deposit services, and trade finance, were $189 million in 1995, $171
million in 1994, and $162 million in 1993.  Trust and investment fees were
$136 million in 1995, $126 million in 1994, and $134 million in 1993.  Service
charges and fees, excluding those associated with the credit card
securitization, were $425 million in 1995, compared with $427 million in 1994
and $390 million in 1993.  For further discussion of fee revenue see Sector
Profitability.
     The credit card securitizations increased noninterest income by $3
million in 1995, $38 million in 1994, and $64 million in 1993.  Most of the
decreases in noninterest income from securitizations were due to maturities.
     Securities gains totaled $115 million, $15 million, and $64 million in
1995, 1994, and 1993, including gains on equity securities of $97 million in
1995 and $28 million in 1993.  There were no net equity securities gains
recorded in 1994.
     Other noninterest income was $217 million in 1995, $153 million in 1994,
and $196 million in 1993.  Profits from foreign exchange and other trading
activities were $60 million, $44 million, and $79 million in 1995, 1994, and
1993.  Other noninterest income includes a pre-tax gain of $58 million in 1995
related to the sale of the Company's mortgage servicing portfolio.  Other
noninterest income for 1994 and 1993 included pre-tax gains of $22 million and
$24 million related to the sale of portions of the Company's interest in Wing
Hang Bank, Ltd.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME TAXES

Expenses remained under good control in 1995.  Total noninterest expense was 
$1,713 million in 1995 and $1,646 million in 1994 and 1993.  The efficiency
ratio has steadily declined to 50.0% in 1995 from 53.8% in 1994 and 56.8% in
1993.  The efficiency ratio for 1995 excludes the expenses related to the
settlement of litigation related to Northeast Bancorp.
      Securities processing acquisitions and the purchase of Putnam
contributed to the rise in expenses in 1995.  Net occupancy and furniture and
fixture expenses fell by a combined $4 million, or 2%, to $262 million. 
Salaries and employee benefits increased 7% to $913 million in 1995.  In 1995,
expenses related to the settlement of litigation with NEB were $15 million.
     Total noninterest expense was unchanged in 1994 compared with 1993.  Net
occupancy and furniture and fixture expenses fell by a combined $7 million, or
3%, to $266 million.  Salary expense increased by 4% in 1994, and profit
sharing and incentive compensation also increased.  Medical insurance expense
was $59 million in 1994, a decline of 5% from $62 million in 1993.    
     Deposit insurance premiums were $32 million in 1995 compared with $52
million and $57 million in 1994 and 1993.  The FDIC substantially reduced the
assessment rate for deposit insurance premiums in 1995.  The initial
assessment rate for 1996 is zero.
     Other real estate charges were $5 million, $11 million, and $53 million
in 1995, 1994, and 1993.  Operating expenses related to other real estate
owned were approximately $4 million in 1995 and 1994, down from $8 million in
1993.  
     The Company's consolidated effective tax rates for 1995, 1994, and 1993
were 38.3%, 37.5%, and 36.9%.  The 1995 rate increased primarily from the
reduced impact of tax-exempt income partially offset by the reduced impact of
state and local taxes.  The 1994 rate reflects the reduced impact of tax-
exempt income and state and local taxes, offset by lower taxes on foreign
operations and the effect of nondeductible expenses to total income.

LIQUIDITY

The Company maintains its liquidity through the management of its assets and
liabilities, utilizing worldwide financial markets.  The diversification of
liabilities reflects the flexibility of the Company's funding sources under
changing market conditions.  Stable core deposits, including demand and retail
time, are generated through the Company's diversified network and managed with
the use of trend studies and deposit pricing.  The use of derivative products
such as interest rate swaps and financial futures enhances liquidity through
the issue of long-term liabilities without exposure to interest rate risk. 
Liquidity also results from the maintenance of a portfolio of assets which can
be easily reduced and the monitoring of unfunded loan commitments, thereby
reducing unanticipated funding requirements.
     The Company actively manages interest rate sensitivity (the exposure of
net interest income to interest rate movements).  The relationship of
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities between repricing
dates is closely monitored, yet the Company's policies are flexible enough to
capitalize on profit opportunities, while minimizing adverse effects on
earnings when changes in short-term and long-term interest rates occur.  The
Company uses complex simulation models to adjust the structure of its assets
and liabilities in response to interest rate exposures.
     Average savings, time, and noninterest-bearing deposits increased by $0.1
billion during 1995.  Medium-term notes declined $0.3 billion and foreign
deposits increased by $1.4 billion.  More volatile sources of interest-bearing
deposits and borrowings increased by $0.7 billion. 
     In 1995, the Company's average commercial paper borrowings were $656
million compared with $361 million in 1994.  The Company has backup lines of
credit of $350 million at financial institutions supporting these borrowings.
     The following comments relate to the information disclosed in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
     Cash flows from earnings and other operating activities were $1.8 billion
in 1995, compared with $2.5 billion and $0.7 billion in 1994 and 1993.  The
decrease in 1995 reflects only a small decline in trading assets while in 1994
the increase is attributable to a significant decline in trading assets.   
     In 1995, cash used by investing activities was $2.4 billion, reflecting
additions to loans partially offset by a decline in federal funds sold and
securities purchased under resale agreements.  The 1994 and 1993 cash flows
used by investing activities were $5.4 billion and $1.0 billion, reflecting
additions to loans and securities.  Cash provided by financing activities was
$2.4 billion and $1.3 billion in 1995 and 1994 as the Company used deposits to
finance its investing activities.  Federal funds purchased and securities sold
under repurchase agreements in 1995 and other borrowings in 1994 were also
sources of funds.  Cash used by financing activities was $0.7 billion in 1993
as the Company reduced its deposit borrowings.
     Restrictions on the ability of the Company to obtain funds from its
subsidiaries are discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     The Company's common equity ratio is one of the highest among money
center banks.  The Company's banks' capital ratios exceed "well capitalized,"
the highest of five regulatory capital categories.
     Shareholders' equity was $5,232 million at December 31, 1995, compared
with $4,296 million at December 31, 1994 and $4,072 million at December 31,
1993.  In January 1996, the Company increased its quarterly common stock
dividend to 40 cents per share, up 25% from the beginning of 1995.  The
Company retained $641 million of earnings and issued $200 million of
subordinated debt.  Subordinated debentures totaling $136 million were
converted to common stock.  In addition, the Company repurchased 4.7 million
shares of common stock in 1995.  The Company's plans to repurchase its common
stock are discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
     
<PAGE> 34     
     
     In 1994, the Company increased its quarterly stock dividend to 32 cents
per share, a 42% increase.  The Company also declared a 2-for-1 common stock
split.  In addition, the Company repurchased 3.7 million shares of common
stock.  The Company retained $512 million of earnings and issued $300 million
of subordinated debt.  Two issues of preferred stock were redeemed in 1994,
reducing preferred stock by $156 million and retained earnings by $17 million.
     During 1993, the Company strengthened its capital position.  The Company
retained $383 million of earnings and issued $550 million of subordinated debt
while $655 million of long-term debt matured or was redeemed and $75 million
of preferred stock was redeemed.  In addition, $58 million of preferred stock
was converted into $46 million of common stock.  
    The Company can issue up to $1.3 billion of debt and preferred stock
(including convertible preferred stock) pursuant to a shelf registration
statement.      

CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION

The Company securitized $1,350 million of credit card receivables in 1991. 
All securitized receivables matured prior to December 31, 1995.  The impact of
the securitizations on the Company's financial statements, assuming the funds
received from the securitizations were used to replace short-term borrowings,
is summarized below:

In millions                              1995        1994       1993
                                         ----        ----       ----
Lower Net Interest Income                  $5         $87       $162
Lower Provision for Loan Losses             2          32         56
Higher Noninterest Income                   3          38         64

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

The provision for loan losses was $330 million in 1995, compared with $162
million in 1994 and $284 million in 1993.  The increase in the provision
compared with 1994 was principally related to charge-offs in the credit card
portfolio.  In 1995, the Company continued to experience improvement in the
asset quality of business loans as nonperforming loans dropped.
     Net charge-offs were $377 million in 1995, $354 million in 1994, and $387
million in 1993.  In these years, net charge-offs were primarily attributable
to real estate, other commercial, and consumer loans.  The total allowance for
loan losses was $756 million and $792 million at year-end 1995 and 1994.  The
decrease in the allowance for loan losses ($36 million in 1995 and $178
million in 1994) resulted primarily from net charge-offs exceeding the
provision for loan losses and the decline in the level of nonaccrual loans. 
Maturities in the Company's credit card securitization program enabled it to
transfer $3 million in 1995 and $14 million in 1994 of its recourse obligation
from other liabilities to the allowance.  The ratio of the total allowance for
loan losses to year-end loans was 2.01% and 2.40% at December 31, 1995 and
1994.

Allowance/Nonperforming Assets         254.5       224.4


     Nonperforming assets declined for the eighteenth consecutive quarter to
$297 million at December 31, 1995.
     The decrease in nonperforming assets during 1995 is attributable to
charge-offs and writedowns of $74 million and paydowns, sales, and returns to
accrual status of $137 million.  The decrease was partially offset by $155
million of loans placed on nonperforming status.    


FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of the Company's financial instruments are disclosed in Note 10
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The fair values, if realized, would
improve the Company's capital resources and results of operations because the
excess of fair value over the carrying amount for its assets is greater than
the corresponding excess for liabilities.  The fair values would not affect
liquidity.
     In 1995, declining interest rates produced unrecognized fair value gains
in the securities portfolios.  Rising interest rates in 1994 resulted in
unrecognized fair value losses in the securities portfolio.  Higher values
attributable to consumer loans more than offset the declines in value
associated with credit-impaired commercial loans in both 1995 and 1994.  The
increase in fair value of long-term debt primarily reflects the influence of
the Company's stock price on the fair value of its convertible subordinated
debentures.

TRADING AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISKS

The Company's significant trading and off-balance-sheet risks are securities,
foreign currency and interest rate risk management products,   commercial
lending commitments, letters of credit, and securities lending
indemnifications.  The Company assumes these risks to trade for its own
account, to reduce its own interest rate and foreign currency risks, and to
enable its customers to meet their credit and liquidity needs and hedge their
foreign currency and interest rate risks.  These items involve, to varying
degrees, credit, foreign exchange, and interest rate risk not recognized in
the balance sheet.  The Company's off-balance-sheet risks are managed and
monitored in manners similar to those used for on-balance-sheet risks.  There
are no significant industry concentrations of such risks.  The Company manages
trading risk through a system of position limits, an earnings at risk
methodology, stop loss advisory limits, and other market sensitivity measures. 
Position limits restrict by instrument and currency the size of positions the
Company can take.  Earnings at risk is designed to measure with 95% certainty
the Company's exposure to change in earnings resulting from price fluctuations
in the Company's trading portfolio over a 24-hour period.  The trading
portfolio's pre-tax earnings at risk averaged approximately $1.5 million for
the fourth quarter of 1995, and ranged from approximately $0.8 million to $2.4
million.  During the fourth quarter of 1995 daily trading revenue 

<PAGE> 37

averaged approximately $0.2 million, and ranged from approximately a gain of 
$1.2 million to a loss of $0.5 million.  During this period, trading revenue 
did not exceed the Company's earnings at risk estimates on any given trading 
day.  Stop loss advisory limits require a trading desk's open positions and 
trading strategy to be reviewed by senior management when a predetermined loss 
amount has been reached by that trading desk.  Market price risk is also 
managed by monitoring a trading position's price sensitivity to changes in 
interest rates.  This sensitivity analysis is used to establish trading limits 
for certain products.
     The amounts associated with off-balance-sheet risks are disclosed in
Notes 10 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

SECTOR PROFITABILITY

The Company has an internal information system used for management purposes
that produces sector performance data for Trust, and Securities and Other
Processing, Retail Banking, Corporate Banking, and Other sectors.  A set of
measurement principles has been developed to help ensure that reported results
of the sectors track their economic performance.  Sector results are subject
to restatement whenever improvements are made in the measurement principles or
organizational changes are made.  In 1995, the data was restated to reflect
the transfer from the Corporate Banking Sector to the Other Sector gains and
losses associated with foreign investments and subsidiaries.  The methodology
used for match funding of assets and liabilities was also adjusted.
     Net interest income is computed on a taxable equivalent basis.  Support
and  other indirect expenses are allocated to sectors based on general
guidelines.  The provision for loan losses is based on net charge-offs
incurred by each sector.  Assets and liabilities are match funded.
     The Trust, and Securities and Other Processing Sector provides a broad
array of fee based services.  Trust includes personal trust, personal asset
management and institutional investment.  Securities processing includes
American depositary receipts, corporate trust, securities lending, government
securities clearance, mutual fund custody, unit investment trust, stock
transfer, and institutional custody.  Trade finance, funds transfer, and
deposit services are included in other processing.
     The Retail Banking Sector includes credit card financing, consumer
lending, custom banking, and residential mortgage lending.
     The Corporate Banking Sector is divided into special industries banking,
U.S. commercial banking, middle market banking, international banking, and
factoring.
     The Other Sector includes trading and investing activities, treasury
services to other sectors, general administration, and the difference between
the recorded provision for loan losses and that allocated to the other
sectors.

     The sectors contributed to the Company's profitability as follows: 


                         Trust, and
                     Securities and                      Corporate

     In the Trust, and Securities and Other Processing Sector, securities
processing fees increased 14% over last year to $411 million compared to $359
million in 1994 and $309 million in 1993.  All areas of securities processing
increased led by ADRs, corporate trust and master trust.  Securities
processing revenues did not include any revenue from the acquisition of the
custody business of J.P. Morgan or BankAmerica.  Transition activities
associated with these acquisitions will continue throughout 1996.  Fees from
the acquisition of NationsBank's corporate trust business were included in
securities processing revenue for the month of December.  In other processing,
fees grew by 11% led by increases in funds transfer and trade finance
revenues.  Trust and investment management fees increased to $136 million in
1995 from $126 million in 1994 primarily due to higher market valuation of
assets under management and the acquisition of Putnam.
     In 1994, American depositary receipts and corporate trust showed
exceptional growth.  Other areas of strength included mutual fund custody and
government securities clearance.  In other processing, trade finance increased
by 15% over 1993.  Overall volume and total revenue in funds transfer were up
20% and 18% from 1993.  However, service fees in the funds transfer and
deposit services area were lower due to customers' increasing use of
compensating balances in a rising interest rate environment.  Trust and
investment management reported lower revenue due primarily to lower market
valuations of assets under management.  
     The increase in net interest income in the Retail Sector principally
reflects growth in the Company's credit card business and the higher value of
noninterest-bearing balances.  Charge-offs increased compared to last year. 
Credit card accounts past due over 30 days were 4.50% of managed outstandings
at the end of 1995 compared with 3.34% and 3.30% at the end of 1994 and 1993. 
Net credit card charge-offs as a percentage of average managed outstandings
were 3.44% in 1995, compared with 2.68% and 3.19% in 1994 and 1993. 
Maturities in the credit card securitization program shifted revenue from
noninterest income to net interest income.  Credit card interchange income for
managed outstandings was $85 million, $81 million, and $68 million in 1995,
1994, and 1993.
     The Company is currently negotiating with an affinity group to renew a
contract related to a credit card portfolio with $3.6 billion of outstandings
at December 31, 1995.  The contract expires in 1997 and entitles the Company
to sell the portfolio at fair market value if it is not renewed.
     The increase in net interest income in the Corporate Banking Sector in
1995 is attributable to increased loan demand, higher yields, and a decline in
nonperforming assets.  Loan demand continued to strengthen, particularly in
corporate lending across the United States, in the middle market, and in all
of the special industry lending areas.  In 1994, the increase in net interest
income in the Corporate Banking Sector was attributable to higher yields as
well as a decline in nonperforming assets.  The sector also benefitted from a
reduction in the provision for loan losses.  In addition, increased earnings
in the Company's factoring business contributed to the sector's results.  The
decrease in noninterest expense was partially attributable to a reduction in
other real estate expense.
     The Other Sector reflects the difference between the recorded provision
for loan losses and that allocated to the sectors.  Noninterest income for
1995 includes $58 million for the pre-tax gain on the sale of the ARCS
Mortgage portfolio.  Also included in noninterest income for 1994 and 1993 are
pre-tax gains of $22 million and $24 million on the sale of portions of the
Company's interest in Wing Hang Bank, Ltd.  Securities gains and foreign
exchange and other trading activity increased $116 million from 1994.  In
1994, the Other Sector had a decline in revenues from trading and investing
activities.

                           Business Review

Securities And Other Processing
  
     The Bank of New York offers a more complete range of processing and
operating services than any other bank.  We are the largest overall processor
of securities in the U.S. and one of the largest in the world.  We offer
customers experience, scale and technological resources to fulfill virtually
all requirements.
  
Securities Processing:
     We offer nine distinct product lines:  three for issuers of debt and
equity securities, three for institutional investors, and three for the
securities and mutual fund management industries.  Record keeping and
reporting are common functions for all product lines.
     We are the market leader in American and global depositary receipts and
government securities clearance.  We hold the number two market position for 
corporate trust, institutional custody, mutual funds custody, securities
lending and unit investment trust servicing.  We rank among the top three
providers of master trust/master custody and among the top four in stock
transfer.  Each of our nine product lines experienced internal growth in 1995,
most in excess of 10%.
     Several banking institutions decided to exit the securities processing
services industry in 1995.  Because we have consistently invested in the
resources and technology necessary to improve our operating efficiency and
accommodate additional business,  the Bank was able to take advantage of this
consolidation trend.  We made 11 strategic acquisitions during 1995, including 
the custody businesses of  BankAmerica and J.P. Morgan, which represented
combined assets of approximately $1.2 trillion.  These acquisitions give both
our new and existing clients enhanced service capabilities and access to an
expanded 

<PAGE> 41

domestic and global operations network.  The conversion of acquired
accounts to the Bank's processing systems is on schedule and proceeding as
expected.
  
Services provided to issuers of securities are comprised of the following
product lines:
     American Depositary Receipts:  Depositary receipts enable U.S. investors
to invest in dollar-denominated equity and debt securities of foreign 
companies and government agencies, providing them access to the U.S. capital 
markets.
     In total, the Bank issues depositary receipts for more than 800 non-U.S.
companies representing 50 countries and accounting for over 55% of all
sponsored public depositary receipt programs.  
     We continued to lead this industry in 1995.  We acted as depositary for
62% of all new public sponsored depositary receipt programs for companies
based in 28 countries.  For the last five years our share of all new programs
has averaged over 60%.  Among our achievements were the establishment of
the first 144A depositary receipt programs for the Czech Republic, Slovakia,
Poland and Russia and the first depositary receipt program for Bolivia.  We
have diversified our client base by establishing new depositary receipt
programs in nearly every foreign market.  This enables us to benefit from
changes in investment flows.
     Industry share trading volume for listed depositary receipts increased
almost 40% during 1995.  It comprised only 5.3% of total U.S. share trading
volume, indicating that there is still considerable room for depositary
receipt growth in the future.  
     Fees increased over 30% for the year.
  
     Corporate Trust:  As corporate trustee, the Bank provides registrar,
custodial, escrow and paying agent services to corporate and government
issuers of debt securities.
     
<PAGE> 42     
     
     The Bank is the second largest supplier of corporate trust services,
handling approximately 34,000 issues with over $450 billion in principal
amount outstanding.
     We acquired seven corporate trust books of business which added over
14,000 trust appointments to our portfolio.  We have already completed the
successful conversion of the NationsBank, CoreStates Financial, Frost National
Bank, Hibernia National Bank, Meridian Trust and First Hawaiian Bank
portfolios.  The Wachovia Corp. acquisition will be converted in 1996.  The
NationsBank acquisition was particularly significant as it greatly enhanced
the Bank's market share in several fast-growing markets in the U.S. 
     Our existing book of business also grew substantially in 1995. 
Excluding acquisitions, we achieved more new trustee appointments than any of
our competitors during the year in both the number and the principal amount of
debt issues: 162 issues amounting to more than $53 billion.  We ranked among
the top five in new appointments in every product we service. 
     Overall fees increased 24% for the year.
  
     Stock Transfer:  As stock transfer agent, we provide shareholder record
keeping, dividend paying and reinvestment, proxy tabulation, and exchange
services to corporate issuers of equity securities.
     We perform these services for more than 400 public companies with over 8
million shareholders.  Based upon customer surveys, an independent study
ranked the quality of our services number one among the leading stock transfer
agents in 1995.
     In 1996 we will begin to incorporate image processing into our
operations, a technology which will increase processing speed, improve service
quality and add to our capacity.  
     We added 36 companies to our customer list during the year, an increment
of over 500,000 shareholders. Fees were modestly higher for the year.

The Bank is an internationally recognized securities custodian for
institutional investors:  We offer a comprehensive array of services through a
worldwide settlement network encompassing 80 markets.  Our services for a
diversified base of clients include custody, settlement of trades, income
collection, corporate action processing, proxy management, pricing and
performance analysis for securities portfolios.  Our reporting systems allow
us to tailor information to meet the specific requirements of our custody
customers such as insurance companies.  In addition, we provide our custody
clients with securities lending, cash management, foreign exchange and credit
services. 
     Worldwide custody services for institutional investors include the
following:
     Master Trust/Master Custody:  We are a leading provider of custody and
trustee services to clients with multiple investment portfolios.  Our clients
include public funds, corporate pension funds, Taft-Hartley funds, foundations
and endowments.  In addition to our regular custodial service, we provide
these clients with daily portfolio valuation, enhanced regulatory compliance
reporting and on-line portfolio performance analysis.
     Excluding acquisitions, our client base grew by 57 clients in 1995 with
particular strength exhibited by the corporate pension fund segment.  Fees
advanced 14%.
     Institutional Custody:  The Bank is a leading custodian for insurance
companies, central banks, commercial banks and government agencies.
     In 1995 we added 91 new institutional clients unrelated to our
acquisitions, representing a 23% increase over 1994.  Our strong emphasis on
the insurance industry enabled us to double our custody assets for that market
segment.  Fees increased modestly.
     Securities Lending:  In conjunction with its custody businesses the Bank
operates one of the largest securities lending programs in the world.  Lending
securities that are held in custody, or that are otherwise available to us,
increases the yield on customers' portfolios by investing the cash collateral

<PAGE> 44

exchanged for those securities.  Our services include loan solicitation,
negotiation of terms, transaction settlement, loan administration, credit
analysis of borrowers, and receipt and investment of cash collateral.  We
operate this business through our offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.
     Fees increased 7% for the year.
  
We also offer custodian services to the securities and mutual fund management
industries.
     Mutual Funds Custody:  We are the second largest custodian for mutual
fund management companies, providing domestic and global custody, portfolio
accounting and pricing, and fund administration services.  In total, we act as
custodian for over 800 mutual funds for 72 management companies, including 11
of the industry's 20 largest firms.  We have an office in Dublin, Ireland for
servicing non-U.S. registered mutual funds which are sold to non-U.S.
citizens.  We also provide our stock transfer service for closed end mutual
funds.
     During 1995 we achieved 17 new mutual fund manager appointments and
increased the total number of mutual fund portfolios by over 125.  Total
assets under custody rose 35% to $450 billion at year end.  Fees increased 7%
in 1995.     
     Unit Investment Trust:  We are the second largest provider of trustee
services for unit investment trusts, which are passive securities portfolios
created by broker/dealer sponsors.  Our role as trustee is to provide
portfolio custody, accounting and administration services as well as transfer
agency and unitholder relations services.
     In March 1995 we acquired about 500 unit investment trusts from
Investors Bank & Trust Company.  Overall, at year end we were trustee for
approximately 4,100 trusts with assets of over $26 billion.  
     Fees rose 9% for the year. 
  
<PAGE> 45

     Government Securities Clearance:  We continue to be the market leader in
the clearance of U.S. government and certain other government agency
securities as well as in the administration of tri-party repurchase
agreements.  In the former role we serve as the agent for the movement of
securities from the U.S. Treasury and other government agency issuers to the
dealer community and for the movement of securities among dealers.  Under the
latter program the Bank acts as an intermediary between a dealer and an
investor, holding the securities in custody until the termination of the
repurchase agreement.  We provide valuation and segregation services as long
as the securities held as collateral are under our custody management.
     We added 18 new tri-party relationships in 1995.  Significant growth was
realized from the establishment of a global collateral management service for
international investors.  On an average day, we cleared over 55,000
transactions representing approximately $600 billion of securities, and held
$125 billion of tri-party collateral under management during 1995.  Fees were
modestly higher for the year.
  
  
Other Processing:
Our Other Processing products serve financial institutions and corporations
around the world as well as middle market companies and small businesses
located in the greater New York metropolitan area.  All three of our other
processing businesses experienced revenue growth in 1995.  The businesses are:
     Funds Transfer:  This service involves the electronic payment of U.S.
dollars within the U.S. and around the world on behalf of our customers for
the settlement of financial transactions.  On an average day we clear over
60,000 transactions worth $220 billion for domestic and foreign financial
institutions, corporations and individuals.  Primarily an international
business, we interface with a network of over 2,000 correspondent financial
institutions throughout the world.
     
<PAGE> 46     
     
     Our market share among U.S. commercial banks has been improving steadily
over the past four years.
     Revenues increased 18% in 1995.
     
     Trade Services:  The Bank provides a broad range of trade services for
financial institutions and corporations through its global network of branches
and representative offices.  Our major product is letters of credit, which
expedite payment for customers' imports and exports around the world.  Asia,
Latin America and the Middle East are our primary foreign markets.
     We are in the midst of an automation program to upgrade the electronic
linkages among our Asian offices and New York, which should enhance service
quality significantly.  
     Trade services fees increased 13% in 1995.
     
     Cash Management:  We offer a full range of cash management services to
corporate and institutional customers, primarily located in the U.S.  The
product line involves the receipt and disbursement of cash along with
sophisticated reporting.  Markets of particular strength for the Bank include
middle market companies and small businesses in the greater New York
metropolitan area, financial institutions of all types and large corporations
for which we serve as a lead bank.
     Two major new products were introduced in 1995.  The WINDOWS (registered
trademark) based workstation enables customers to initiate wire transfer and
automated clearing house transactions and provides them with access to a wide
array of information regarding their cash movements.  The check imaging
service allows corporations to electronically retrieve copies of their checks
onto their personal computers, reducing opportunities for fraud and providing
fast information to respond to inquiries.
     Revenues increased 5% for the year.

Corporate Banking

     The Bank of New York serves the global banking needs of domestic and
multi-national corporations and institutions.  We focus on companies where we
can position ourselves as a lead bank.  Our strategy is to not only arrange
their corporate credits, but also assist them with their securities
processing, cash management, trade finance and other banking and transactional
requirements.  
     Our Capital Markets division provides loan structuring and syndication
services to our customers as well as corporate advisory services and private
placements.  Gains in this area have been significant over the last few years. 
In 1995 we ranked eighth among major banks in acting as agent or co-agent on
credit facilities.  Four years ago, we ranked 21st.  The Bank of New York
currently acts as administrative agent on 180 broadly syndicated loans, of
which 44 were new appointments in 1995.  
  
Corporate Banking is divided into the following areas:
     Special Industries Banking:  The Bank of New York is a leading provider
of credit  and operating services to the media and entertainment,
telecommunications, securities, energy and public utility, marine
transportation, real estate, retailing, mortgage banking and insurance
industries.  We bring a depth of experience and expertise to these industries
that provides added value for our clients.  A 12% increase in average loan
volume was achieved during 1995.  
     We are a leading lender and arranger of bank loans to the rapidly
expanding media and telecommunications industries.  Our media division 
currently acts as lead agent or co-agent for 83 transactions representing over
$74 billion in bank facilities.
     U.S. Commercial Banking:  This area serves the banking needs of large
corporations primarily located in nine major urban markets.  Our targeted

<PAGE> 48

marketing emphasis resulted in strong loan growth with average outstandings
increasing 16% in 1995. 
     Middle Market Banking:   The Bank has emphasized this market segment in
recent years.  We offer middle market customers throughout the greater New
York metropolitan area, Connecticut and New Jersey a broad range of 
sophisticated banking services including asset-based finance, cash management,
securities processing, trade finance, leasing and investment banking.  Average
loan volume grew 15% in 1995.
     International Banking:  Our international banking operations focus on 
promoting the processing businesses of the Bank with major emphasis on
American depositary receipts, global custody, securities lending, funds
transfer and trade finance.   Our customers include U.S. corporations and
foreign commercial banks, governments and corporations.  We operate in 26
foreign countries through our network of  29  branches and representative
offices.  In 1995 we opened offices in Jakarta and Mexico City.
     Factoring:  BNY Financial Corporation is the second-largest factoring
operation in the United States and the largest in Canada.  We have
accomplished major customer diversification in this business over the last
five years.  The apparel industry, historically two-thirds of our volume,
today accounts for 40% as a result of our expanded business with the utility,
service, industrial security, shipping, airline, freight, food processing and
beverage industries.  We have also diversified geographically.  BNY Financial
now operates through offices located in New York, Boston, Atlanta, Charlotte,
Los Angeles,  Toronto and Montreal.  A 20% net income gain was achieved in
1995, our 14th consecutive year of record earnings.  Our factoring volume was 
$11.1 billion for the year.
     Asset Based Lending:  The Bank of New York Commercial Corporation
provides secured lending to mid-size companies.  Our customers include
retailers, distributors, manufacturers and service companies.  BNY Commercial
had a particularly strong year in 1995 with net income rising 21%.

Credit Cards
  
     The Bank of New York (Delaware) is the 14th largest issuer of credit
cards in the U.S.  We market nationally a wide array of credit cards targeted
to serve various consumer market segments.  We are a leading provider of low
rate, no annual fee credit cards.  At the end of 1995 we served 6.4 million
credit card accounts.  Our  managed credit card receivables outstanding
totaled $8.7 billion, a 13% increase over 1994.  
     We continue to make substantial investments in portfolio monitoring, 
customer service, and pricing and marketing capabilities.  In August we
converted our entire credit card portfolio to the computer systems of First
Data Resources.  This conversion reduces our costs, increases our processing
capacity, strengthens our protection against fraud, and enables us to apply
the disciplines of sophisticated credit scoring and risk-based pricing to new
and existing cardholder accounts. 
     The Consumers Edge product line, our primary offering, consists of a
variety of cards, all with no annual fees and low interest rates.  Consumers
Edge appeals to customers who maintain outstanding credit balances.  In 1995
we purposely controlled the growth of these cards to maintain credit quality
at a time when we and the industry were experiencing rising credit
delinquencies.
     The Union Privilege MasterCard is offered on an exclusive basis to
members of the AFL-CIO.  With more than 75 affiliated unions participating, it
is the largest single affinity card program in the country.
     In 1995 we introduced our first co-branded credit cards, in partnership
with two retailing companies.  
     In September we introduced the Toys-R-Us (registered trademark) Visa
card, a no annual fee credit card.  It is the first co-branded credit card
to reward customers with free toys and free clothes, provided through 
Toys-R-Us (registered trademark) and Kids-R-Us (registered trademark) stores.
Customers can also earn points toward discounted cruises, airline tickets and
hotel stays.  Applications for this card and the number of cards issued have
significantly 

<PAGE> 50

exceeded our expectations.  The initial response to this program
has been well above industry norms.
     A month later we launched the Stop & Shop (registered trademark) 
SupeRewards MasterCard, also a no annual fee credit card.  It is the first 
credit card co-branded in conjunction with a leading supermarket chain that 
offers travel rewards.  The card enables customers to earn free airline 
tickets and vacation rewards on every purchase.  Applications and issuances 
for this card have also surpassed our projections.
     The MasterCard Business Card provides small  businesses with a valuable
cash  management tool.  This card affords managers greater control over
purchasing  by allowing them to pre-authorize employee spending limits and
to pre-approve vendors.
     
<PAGE> 51

Retail Banking
  
     The Bank of New York is the leading retail bank in the suburban New York
area, with an extensive branch network and a broad range of products and
services for consumers and small businesses.
      Our  branch network comprises 384 offices serving 25 counties of New
York, New Jersey and Connecticut.  In March 1995 we acquired three branches of
the Carteret Savings FSB in New Jersey with $113 million in deposits.  In
September we acquired The Putnam Trust Company of Greenwich, which brought us
eight branches and over $700 million in assets in affluent Fairfield County,
Connecticut.
     The strongest segment of our consumer loan portfolio was  Homeowner's
Edge, a product that combines the features of an installment loan with the tax
deductibility of a home equity loan.  Average loan outstandings increased 32%
in 1995.  More than 30% of our  depositors now take advantage of our Priority
Value Banking service which, by linking accounts, enables them to receive our
most favorable loan and savings rates and offset account service charges.
     In October we introduced a new advertising campaign.  Its theme  "The
Bank of New York, The Bank of New Ideas"  builds on our reputation for product
and service innovation.
     Our  Group Banking Program reflects the Bank's expertise in
simultaneously serving our consumer and business markets.   This program
provides the employees of our business customers with a preferred banking
package that includes free checking and consumer loan rate discounts.  This
integrated effort deepens relationships with both business customers and their
employees.   An additional 150 companies participated in this program during
1995.
     We streamlined our lending process and can now offer small businesses
credit approvals in three days or less.  We are realizing additional cost
savings and competitive advantages through technology-driven credit scoring
which helps us to manage risk and achieve approvals quickly, consistently and
accurately.  

<PAGE> 52

Our new process provides automated document preparation and
disbursement through any branch location. 
     We also introduced Business CreditLink, a check-accessed revolving
credit product for small businesses.
     During the year we opened 15 Personal Investment Centers in New Jersey. 
This brings the region-wide total to 69, each staffed with licensed
Investment Representatives.  These centers offer a wide variety of mutual
funds, including our own BNY Hamilton Funds, as well as fixed and variable
rate annuities.
     BNY Mortgage Company offers a wide variety of fixed and variable rate
mortgage loans.  We are the leading originator of New York State-backed loans
for first-time home buyers and we provide other affordable lending products to
meet housing finance needs within the New York metropolitan region.

Personal Trust, Investment Management and Private Banking
  
     The Bank of New York has provided private banking services since its
founding in 1784 and trust services since banks were given those powers in the
1830's.  Today,  we offer individuals and institutions a broad range of
investment management, custody, estate and financial planning, trust and
estate settlement, and income tax preparation services, provided through
offices in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Florida.  We work with some
of the nation's largest corporations to manage liquidity and with their senior
executives to manage their personal financial situations. Total assets under
management exceed $30 billion.  We are among the largest bank managers of
discretionary assets in the nation.
     The Bank's  Private Banking, International Private Banking, Personal
Trust and Personal Asset Management divisions provide high income and high net
worth individuals in the U.S. and around the world with a full range of
services in banking, investment management, trust and estate, and personal
financial planning.  Three private banking groups address the needs of 
executives of corporations we serve in the real estate, media and marine
transportation industries. 
     Our Tax-Exempt Bond Management service helps high income and high net
worth individuals and corporations maximize after-tax returns on their
municipal bond portfolios. This service is delivered by a dedicated team who
combine the disciplines of municipal bond research, trading and portfolio
management to provide better returns by taking advantage of inefficiencies
that exist in the tax-exempt bond market.  Fees reached a record level in
1995.
     The full range of Institutional Investment services we provide includes
active management for fixed income, equity and balanced accounts, passive
investment products, commingled funds for ERISA accounts and short-term money
management.  Our customers include corporations, public funds, Taft-Hartley
clients, foundations and endowments and other domestic and international

<PAGE> 54

institutions.   A highlight in 1995 was our top quartile performance for fixed
income accounts.
     Our Short-Term Money Management service provides institutional clients
with a liquidity management vehicle that maximizes returns on short-term funds
on a cost effective basis.   We customize this product to meet each client's
specific needs.  Fees from this service rose 36% in 1995.

<PAGE> 55

Financial Market Services
  
     Financial Market Services represents the Bank's trading and investing
activities in foreign exchange products, municipal securities and interest-
rate management products.  We conduct these activities for customers as well
as for the Bank's own account.
     In Foreign Exchange, we are a market maker in all the world's major
trading currencies and provide 24-hour, full-service trading capabilities
through our offices in New York, London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul
and Taipei.  Revenues rose 55% in 1995.
          We introduced Currency Overlay during 1995.  This product provides
management strategies that are intended to protect a portfolio against losses
from unfavorable currency moves while retaining most of the benefit from
currency gains.  The demand for this product arises from the increasing
importance of international diversification in institutional investment
portfolios.
     The Bank is a full-service Municipal Securities Dealer and underwriter
of investment grade, general obligation tax-exempt securities, issued
principally in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.  Our customers for these
securities are mutual funds, financial institutions, corporations and
individual investors.  The remarketing of short-term tax-exempt notes to
institutional investors has become an important part of our business.  This
business grew substantially in 1995.
