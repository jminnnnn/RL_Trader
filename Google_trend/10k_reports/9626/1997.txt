PART I
- ------
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
- -----------------

INTRODUCTION

     The business of The Bank of New York Company, Inc. (the "Company") and 
its subsidiaries is described in the "Business Review" section of the 
Company's 1996 Annual Report to Shareholders which description is included in 
Exhibit 13 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.  Also, the 
"Management's Discussion and Analysis" section included in Exhibit 13 contains
financial and statistical information on the operations of the Company.  Such 
information is herein incorporated by reference.

CERTAIN REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

General

     As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to the regulation and 
supervision of the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act 
("BHC Act").  The Company is also subject to regulation by the New York State 
Department of Banking.  Under the BHC Act, bank holding companies may not 
directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of 
the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company, 
including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.  
In addition, bank holding companies are generally prohibited under the BHC 
Act from engaging in nonbanking activities, subject to certain exceptions.

     The Company's subsidiary banks are subject to supervision and 
examination by applicable federal and state banking agencies.  In the fourth 
quarter of 1996, The Bank of New York (NJ) and The Putnam Trust Company were 
combined into The Bank of New York ("BNY"), a New York chartered banking 
corporation.  BNY is a  member of the Federal Reserve System and consequently 
is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board.  As a 
bank insured by the FDIC, BNY is also subject to examination by that agency. 
 The Bank of New York (Delaware) ("BNY Del."), chartered in Delaware, is an 
FDIC-insured non-member bank and is therefore subject to regulation and 
supervision by the FDIC.  BNY and BNY (Del.)are also subject to supervision 
and examination by their respective state regulators, the New York Banking 
Department and the Office of State Bank Commissioner of the State of 
Delaware.

    Both federal and state laws extensively regulate various aspects of the 
banking business, such as permissible types and amounts of loans and 
investments, permissible activities, and reserve requirements.  These 
regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather 
than the Company's stockholders.

Capital Adequacy

     Bank regulators have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for bank 
holding companies and banks.  The minimum ratio of qualifying total capital 
to risk-weighted assets and certain off-balance sheet items ("Total Capital 
Ratio") is 8%.  At least half of the total capital is to be comprised of 
common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, 
minority interests (and, for bank holding companies, a limited amount of 
qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock), less most intangibles 
including goodwill ("Tier 1 capital").  The remainder ("Tier 2 capital") may 
consist of other preferred stock, certain other instruments, and limited 
amounts of subordinated debt and allowance for loan losses.


     In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum Leverage 
Ratio (Tier 1 capital to average total assets) guidelines for bank holding 
companies and banks, and the FDIC has established substantially identical 
minimum leverage requirements for state chartered FDIC-insured, nonmember 
banks.  The Federal Reserve Board's guidelines provide for a minimum Leverage 
Ratio of 3% for bank holding companies and banks that meet certain specified 
criteria, including those having the highest regulatory rating.  All other 
banking organizations will be required to maintain a Leverage Ratio of at 
least 3% plus an

<PAGE> 3

additional cushion of 100 to 200 basis points.  The 
guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal 
growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital 
positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without 
significant reliance on intangible assets.  Furthermore, the guidelines 
indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will continue to consider a "Tangible 
Tier 1 Leverage Ratio" in evaluating proposals for expansion or new 
activities.  The Tangible Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 
capital, less intangibles not deducted from Tier 1 capital, to average total 
assets.  The Federal Reserve Board has not advised the Company of any 
specific minimum Leverage Ratio applicable to it.  See "FDICIA" below.

     Federal banking agencies have issued regulations, which become effective 
in 1998, that modify existing rules related to capital ratios with respect to 
various areas of risk including interest rate exposure and other market risk. 
 The Company does not believe that the aggregate impact of these 
modifications would have a significant impact on its capital position.

FDICIA

     The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 
("FDICIA"), substantially revised the depository institution regulatory and 
funding provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ("FDIA") and made 
revisions to several other federal banking statutes.  

     Among other things, FDICIA requires the federal banking regulators to 
take prompt corrective action in respect of FDIC-insured depository 
institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements.  FDICIA 
establishes five capital tiers: "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," 
"undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" and "critically 
undercapitalized."  Under applicable regulations, an FDIC-insured bank is 
defined to be well capitalized if it maintains a Leverage Ratio of at least 
5%, a Tier 1 Capital Ratio (Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets and 
certain off-balance sheet items) of at least 6% and a Total Capital Ratio of 
at least 10% and is not otherwise in a "troubled condition" as specified by 
its appropriate federal regulatory agency.  A bank is generally considered to 
be adequately capitalized if it is not defined to be well capitalized but 
meets all of its minimum capital requirements, i.e., if it has a Total 
Capital Ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 4% or greater and a 
Leverage Ratio of 4% or greater.  A bank will be considered undercapitalized 
if it fails to meet any minimum required measure, significantly 
undercapitalized if it is significantly below any such measure and critically 
undercapitalized if it maintains a level of tangible equity capital equal to 
or less than 2% of total assets.  A bank may be deemed to be in a 
capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital 
position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating.

     FDICIA generally prohibits an FDIC-insured depository institution from 
making any capital distribution (including payment of dividends) or paying 
any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would 
thereafter be undercapitalized.  Undercapitalized depository institutions are 
subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System.  In 
addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth 
limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans.  For an 
undercapitalized depository institution's capital restoration plan to be 
acceptable, its holding company must guarantee the capital plan up to an 
amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution's assets at 
the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency 
when the institution fails to comply with the plan.  In the event of the 
parent holding company's bankruptcy, such guarantee would take priority over 
the parent's general unsecured creditors.  The federal banking agencies may 
not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the 
plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring 
the depository institution's capital.  If a depository institution fails to 
submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly 
undercapitalized.

     Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to 
a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell 
sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to 
reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent 
banks.  Critically undercapitalized depository institutions

are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator.

     A discussion of the Company's capital position and capital adequacy is 
incorporated by reference from "Capital Resources" in the "Management's 
Discussion and Analysis" Section and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Exhibit 13.

As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, capital ratios for the Company, the 
Bank, and BNYDEL were categorized as well capitalized as set forth in the 
table below.

FDIC Insurance Assessments 

     BNY and BNY Del. are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments.  As 
required by FDICIA, the FDIC adopted a risk-based premium schedule to 
determine the assessment rates for most FDIC-insured depository institutions. 
 Effective January 1, 1996, under the schedule, the premiums range from zero 
to $.27 for every $100 of deposits.  Each financial institution is assigned 
to one of nine categories based on the institutions capital ratios and 
supervisory evaluations, and the premium paid by the institution is based on 
the category.  Under the present schedule institutions in the highest of the 
three capital categories and the highest of three supervisory categories pay 
no premium and institutions in the lowest of these categories pay $.27 per 
$100 of deposits.  In addition, the Deposit Insurance Funds Act provides
for assessments at all insured depository institutions to pay for the cost
of the Financing Corporation (a governmental agency) funding.  The 
assessment will be based on deposit levels and will be approximately .325
basis points.

     The FDIC is authorized to raise insurance premiums in certain 
circumstances.  Any increase in premiums would have an adverse effect on the 
Company's earnings.  

     Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon 
a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, 
is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated 
any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by a bank's 
federal regulatory agency.

Depositor Preference

     The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 provides for a national 
depositor preference on amounts realized from the liquidation or other 
resolution of any depository institution insured by the FDIC.

Acquisitions

     The BHC Act generally limits acquisitions by the Company to commercial 
banks and companies engaged in activities that the Federal Reserve Board has 
determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident 
thereto.  The Company's direct activities are generally limited to furnishing 
services to its subsidiaries and activities that qualify under the "closely 
related" and "proper incident" tests.  Prior Federal Reserve Board approval 
is required under the BHC Act for new activities and acquisitions of most 
nonbanking companies.

     The BHC Act, the Federal Bank Merger Act, and the New York Banking Law 
regulate the acquisition of commercial banks.  The BHC Act requires the prior 
approval of the Federal Reserve Board for the direct or indirect acquisition 
of more than 5% of the voting shares of a commercial bank.  

     Effective September 29, 1995, The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and 
Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 ("IBBEA")  permits bank holding companies, 
with Federal Reserve Board approval, to acquire banks located in states other 
than the bank holding company's home state without regard to whether the 
transaction is permitted under state law.  In addition, IBBEA provides that, 
commencing June 1, 1997, national banks and state banks with different home 
states will be permitted to merge across state lines, with the approval of 
the appropriate federal banking agency, unless the home state of a 
participating bank passes legislation between the date of enactment of IBBEA 
and May 31, 1997 expressly prohibiting interstate mergers.  IBBEA further 
provides that states may enact laws permitting interstate bank merger 
transactions prior to June 1, 1997 (opt-in statutes).  New York, New Jersey 
and Connecticut have enacted opt-in statutes.  A bank may also establish and 
operate a de novo branch in a state in which the bank does not maintain a 
branch if that state expressly permits de novo branching.  Once a bank has 
established branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction, the 
bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the 
state where any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have 
established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law.  A 
bank that has established a branch in a state through de novo branching may 
establish and acquire additional branches in such state in the same manner 

<PAGE> 7

and to the same extent as a bank having a branch in such state as a result of 
an interstate merger.

     The merger of BNY with another bank would require the approval of the 
Federal Reserve Board or other federal bank regulatory authority and, if the 
surviving bank is a New York state bank, the New York Superintendent of 
Banks.  

     In reviewing bank acquisition and merger applications, the bank 
regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive 
effect of the transaction, financial and managerial issues including the 
capital position of the combined organization, and convenience and needs 
factors, including the applicant's record under the Community Reinvestment 
Act.

     Under Federal Reserve Board policy, the Company is expected to act as a 
source of financial strength to its banks and to commit resources to support 
such banks in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy.  In 
addition, any loans by the Company to its banks would be subordinate in right 
of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of its banks.

Restrictions on Transfer of Funds

     Restrictions on the transfer of funds to the Company and subsidiary bank 
dividend limitations are discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements included in Exhibit 13.  Such discussion is incorporated herein by 
reference.

Cross Guarantees

     Under FDIA, a financial institution insured by the FDIC that is under 
common control with a failed or failing FDIC-insured institution can be 
required to indemnify the FDIC for losses resulting from the insolvency of 
the failed institution, even if this causes the affiliated institution also 
to become insolvent.  Any obligation or liability owed by a subsidiary 
depository institution to its parent company is subordinate to the 
subsidiary's cross-guarantee liability with respect to commonly controlled 
insured depository institutions and to the rights of depositors.

Market Risk Management
- ----------------------

     Market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in the financial 
markets.  Market risk arises from derivative financial instruments, such as 
futures, forwards, swaps and options, and other financial instruments, such 
as loans, securities, deposits and other borrowings.  These instruments 
expose the Company primarily to interest rate and foreign exchange risk, but 
they also involve credit risk.  Market risk associated with the Company's 
trading activities and asset/liability management activities is managed and 
controlled as discussed under "Trading Activities" and, "Asset/Liability 
Management" in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of Exhibit 
13.  Such discussion is incorporated herein by reference.

Interest-Rate Sensitivity
- -------------------------

     A discussion of the Company's interest rate sensitivity management 
activities is incorporated by reference from "Asset/Liability Management" in 
the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of Exhibit 13.

     The following table reflects the year-end position of the Company's 
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that either reprice 
or mature within the designated time periods.  The interest sensitivity 
indicated by this table is not necessarily indicative of the Company's 
interest sensitivity models (discussed under "Asset/Liability Management" in 
the Managements' Discussion and Analysis section of Exhibit 13) because 
within each time period, assets and liabilities reprice on different dates 
and at different levels, and interest sensitivity gaps change daily.  A 
positive interest  sensitivity gap, for a particular time period, is one in 
which more assets reprice or mature than liabilities.  A negative interest 
sensitivity gap results from a greater amount of liabilities repricing or 
maturing.  A positive gap implies that there are more rate sensitive assets 
than liabilities which suggests that as interest rates rise, the return on 
assets will rise faster than the funding costs.  Conversely, a negative gap 
indicates more rate sensitive liabilities than assets.  In such case, if 
interest rates rise, then funding costs will rise at a faster rate than the 
return on assets.  The cumulative gap is the sum of the dollar gap for 
sequential time periods.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT
- ----------------------

     Credit risk represents the possibility that the Company would suffer a 
loss if a borrower or other counterparty were to default on its obligations 
to the Company.  Credit risk exposure arises primarily from lending 
activities, as well as from interest rate, foreign exchange, and securities 
processing products.  For derivative financial instruments, total credit 
exposure consists of current and potential exposure.  Current credit exposure 
represents the replacement cost of the transaction.  Potential credit 
exposure is a statistically based estimate of the future replacement cost of 
the transaction.  The Company has established policies and procedures to 
manage the level and composition of its credit risk on both a transaction and 
a portfolio basis.  In managing the aggregate credit extension to individual 
customers, the Company measures the amount at risk on derivative financial 
instruments as the total of current and potential credit exposure.

     The Credit Policy Committee is responsible for developing and 
maintaining credit risk policies, as well as for overseeing and reviewing 
credit guidelines.  Through the use of a credit approval process and 
established credit limits, the Company evaluates the credit quality of 
counterparties, industries, products, and countries.  The Company seeks to 
reduce both on and off-balance-sheet credit risk through portfolio 
diversification, loan participations, syndications, asset sales, credit 
enhancements, risk reduction arrangements, and netting agreements.

LOANS AND PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES
- -------------------------------------------------

The provision for loan losses was $600 million in 1996, compared with 
$330 million in 1995 and $162 million in 1994.  The increase in the provision 
compared with 1995 was principally related to the credit card portfolio.  In 
1996, the Company continued to experience improvement in the asset quality of 
business loans as nonperforming loans dropped.

     At December 31, 1996, the domestic commercial real estate portfolio had 
approximately 80% of its loans in New York and New Jersey, 3% in 
Pennsylvania, and 2% in both California and Connecticut; no other state 
accounts for more than 1% of the portfolio.  This portfolio consists of the 
following types of properties:

			 Business loans secured by real estate      37%
			 Offices                                    28
			 Retail                                     11
			 Mixed-Used                                  3 
			 Hotels                                      6 
			 Condominiums and cooperatives               5
			 Industrial/Warehouse                        2
			 Land                                        1
			 Other                                       7

     At December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company's nonperforming real estate 
loans and real estate acquired in satisfaction of loans aggregated $61 
million and $114 million, respectively.  Net charge-offs of real estate loans 
were $11 million in 1996 and $16 million in 1995.  In addition, other real 
estate charges were $1 million and $5 million in 1996 and 1995. 

     At December 31, 1996 the Company's LDC exposures consisted of $55 
million in medium-term loans (and no material commitments), $721 million in 
short-term loans, $8 million in accrued interest, and $148 million in equity 
investments.  In addition, the Company has $314 million of debt securities to 
emerging market countries, including $267 million (book value) of bonds whose 
principal payments are collateralized by U.S. Treasury zero coupon 
obligations and whose interest payments are partially collateralized.

<PAGE> 14

     The Company's consumer loan portfolio is comprised principally of credit 
card, other installment, and residential loans.  Residential and auto loans 
are collateralized, thereby reducing the risk.  Credit card delinquencies and 
charge-offs increased compared to last year.  A further discussion of the 
Company's credit card portfolio is incorporated by reference from "Provision 
and Allowance for Loan Losses" and "Sector Profitability" in the Management's 
Discussion and Analysis Section of Exhibit 13.

     The Company's loans to the energy industry primarily consist of credits 
with investor-owned electric and gas utilities, and oil, gas and mining 
companies.  There were no nonperforming loans to borrowers in this industry 
at year-end 1996.  Nonperforming loans to borrowers in the energy industry 
amounted to $11 million at year-end 1995.  Charge-offs in this industry were 
$1 million in 1996 and zero in 1995.

     The Company's loans to the communications, entertainment, and publishing 
industries primarily consist of credits with cable television operators, 
broadcasters, magazine and newspaper publishers, motion picture theaters and 
regional telephone companies.  At December 31, 1996 nonperforming loans in 
these industries amounted to $23 million and represented loans to a single 
borrower in the entertainment industry.  There were no nonperforming loans in 
these industries at December 31, 1995, and no charge-offs in 1996 and 1995.  
  

     The Company's portfolio of loans for purchasing or carrying securities 
is comprised largely of overnight loans which are fully collateralized, with 
appropriate margins, by marketable securities.  Throughout its many years of 
experience in this area, the Company has rarely experienced a loss.

The Company makes short-term, collateralized loans to mortgage bankers 
to fund mortgages sold to investors.  There were no nonperforming loans at 
December 31, 1996 and 1995, and no charge-offs in 1996 and 1995.

     Based on an evaluation of individual credits, historical loan losses, 
and global economic factors, the Company has allocated its allowance for loan 
losses as follows:

				1996       1995       1994      1993      1992
				----       ----       ----      ----      ----
Real Estate Loans                 5%         7%         9%        8%        9%
Domestic Commercial and
 Industrial Loans                40         36         40        40        40
Consumer Loans                    1          2          -         -         1
Credit Card Loans                29         23         16        10         8 
Foreign Loans                     4         11         19        18        18
Unallocated                      21         21         16        24        24
			       ----       ----       ----      ----      ----
			       100%       100%       100%      100%      100%
			       ====       ====       ====      ====      ====

     Such an allocation is inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance 
for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses regardless of the nature 
of the loan.

losses for the last five years.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
- ----------------------------------------------------------
	 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
	 -----------------------------------
     Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results 
of operations is incorporated herein by reference from the corresponding 
section of Exhibit 13.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT

     The Company or its executive officers and directors on behalf of the 
Company, may from time to time make forward looking statements.  To the 
extent that any forward looking statements are made, the Company is 
necessarily unable to predict future changes in interest rates, economic 
activity, consumer behavior, government monetary policy, legislation and 
regulation, competition, and loan demand.  In addition, the Company's future 
results of operations and other forward looking statements contained in 
Management's Discussion and Analysis and elsewhere in this Form 10-K involve 
a number of risks and uncertainties.  As a result of variations in such 
factors, actual results may differ materially from any forward looking 
statements.  Some of these factors are described below.  The Company 
disclaims any obligation to update forward looking statements.

Government Monetary Policies

     The Federal Reserve Board has the primary responsibility for monetary 
policy; accordingly, its actions have an important influence on the demand 
for credit and 

<PAGE> 20

investments and the level of interest rates and thus on the 
earnings of the Company.

Legislation and Regulation

     Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking 
industry are frequently introduced in Congress, in the state legislatures and 
before the various bank regulatory agencies.  Regulatory changes could 
increase the Company's overhead costs, restrict access to profitable markets 
or force participation in unprofitable markets.  The likelihood and timing of 
any such changes and the impact such changes might have on the Company and 
its subsidiaries, however, cannot be determined at this time.

Competition

     The businesses in which the Company operates are very competitive.  
Competition is provided by both unregulated and regulated financial services 
organizations, whose products and services span the local, national, and 
global markets in which the Company conducts operations.

     Savings banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions actively 
compete for deposits, and money market funds and brokerage houses offer 
deposit-like services.  These institutions, as well as consumer and 
commercial finance companies, national retail chains, factors, insurance 
companies and pension trusts, are important competitors for various types of 
loans.  Issuers of commercial paper compete actively for funds and reduce 
demand for bank loans.  For personal and corporate trust services and 
investment counseling services, insurance companies, investment counseling 
firms, and other business firms and individuals offer active competition.  A 
wide variety of domestic and foreign companies compete for processing 
services.


ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
- ----------------------------------------------------
     Consolidated financial statements and notes and the independent 
auditors' reports are incorporated herein by reference from Exhibits 13
and 99 to this Report.
     Supplementary financial information is incorporated herein by reference 
from the "Quarterly Data" section included in Exhibit 13.

ITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
	 --------------------
On March 12, 1996, the Company's Board of Directors, acting upon the 
recommendation of the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors 
dismissed Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent public 
accountants and appointed Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the Company's 
independent public accountants for the year 1996.
Deloitte & Touche LLP's report on the Company's financial statements 
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995 did not contain an adverse 
opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to 
uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.  During the fiscal year 
ended December 31, 1995 and during the period from December 31, 1995 through 
March 12, 1996, there were no disagreements between the Company and Deloitte 
& Touche LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial 
statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements 
would have caused Deloitte & Touche LLP to make reference to the subject 
matter of such disagreements in connection with its reports.
     There have been no other events which require disclosure under Item 304 
of Regulation S-K.

                        AMENDMENT TO
             THE BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY, INC.
           SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN


          WHEREAS, The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "Plan") was
adopted by the Board of Directors of The Bank of New York
Company, Inc., effective as of June 9, 1992; and
          WHEREAS, Section 9 of the Plan provides that the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may amend
the Plan at any time, except in certain respects not material
hereto; and
          WHEREAS, the Compensation Committee desires to
amend the Plan;
          NOW, THEREFORE, the Plan is hereby amended in the
following respects, effective as of July 1, 1996:
          1.  Section 3 of the Plan is amended by amending
the first sentence thereof to read as follows:
     The Committee shall determine in its sole discretion
     which employees of the Company who are members of the
     Retirement Plan shall become Participants in the Plan.

          2.  Section 4 of the Plan is amended by amending
the second paragraph thereof to read as follows:
          The spouse of a Participant whose death occurs
     while an active employee of the Company shall be
     entitled to the Benefit provided under the Plan if such
     spouse is entitled to a benefit under the Retirement
     Plan.

          3.  Section 5(b) of the Plan is amended by amending
the second sentence thereof to read as follows:

<PAGE> 2

     If the Committee determines that any other Participant
     whose employment terminates prior to attaining age 60,
     other than by reason of death, is entitled to a Benefit
     under the Plan, the amount thereof shall in the
     discretion of the Committee be equal to:

               (i)  the amount provided in paragraph (a) of
          this Section, subject to reduction (if any) in
          accordance with the provisions of the Retirement
          Plan for payment as of such date as determined by
          the Committee; or

              (ii)  the difference between (x) the sum of
          (1) 1.5% of the Participant's Average Final Salary
          multiplied by his years of Credited Service prior
          to January 1, 1976 and (2)(A) 1.65% of the
          Participant's Average Final Salary multiplied by
          his years of Credited Service after December 31,
          1975, reduced by (B) an amount equal to 1.25% of
          the Participant's Primary Social Security Benefit
          multiplied by his years of Credited Service after
          December 31, 1975 not in excess of 40 years and
          (y) the sum of (1) the annual retirement benefit
          payable to the Participant under the Retirement
          Plan at age 60 and (2) the equivalent actuarial
          value of the Participant's account under the
          Employee Stock Ownership Plan of The Bank of New
          York Company, Inc.; based on the date of payment
          (or commencement of payment) pursuant to
          paragraph   of this Section, such difference
          shall be subject to reduction (if any) in
          accordance with the provisions of the Retirement
          Plan as if the Participant had retired thereunder
          on or after attaining age 55 and, if so determined
          by the Committee, as if the Participant had
          completed at least 20 years of Continuous Service.

          4.  Section 5(c)  of the Plan is amended in its
entirety to read as follows:
             (c) Payment of the Benefit to a Participant shall
     be made in the form of a lump sum, unless the
     Participant elects in writing in accordance with rules
     established by the Committee to receive payment in
     eleven annual installments.  Unless the Committee, in
     its discretion, directs payment at a different time,
     payment shall be made or commenced within 30 days after:

<PAGE> 3

               (i)  the Participant's termination of
          employment with the Company, if his employment
          terminates on or after the date he attains age 60,
          other than by reason of death,

              (ii)  the first day of the month coinciding
          with or following the later of the date the
          Participant attains age 55 or the date of the
          Participant's termination of employment, if the
          Participant is listed on Exhibit A and his
          employment terminates prior to attaining age 60,
          other than by reason of death, or

             (iii)  as of such date as determined by the
          Committee, if the Committee determines that a
          Participant who is not listed on Exhibit A and
          whose employment terminates prior to attaining
          age 60, other than by reason of death, is entitled
          to a Benefit under the Plan.

     A Participant's election must be made prior to the
     beginning of the year before the year in which the
     Participant's employment terminates, unless the election
     is made no later than November 15, 1996.  In the event
     of the Participant's death after installment payments
     have commenced, the remaining value of the Participant's
     Benefit shall be paid in a lump sum to the beneficiary
     or beneficiaries designated by him (or, if no
     beneficiary is designated or survives the Participant,
     to the Participant's estate) within 90 days after his
     death.

          In the event of the Participant's death while an
     active employee of the Company, payment of a Benefit to
     a Participant's spouse shall, unless the Committee, in
     its discretion, directs payment in a different form or
     at a different time, be made in a lump sum within
     30 days after the latest of:

               (i)  the date of the Participant's death, or

              (ii)  the date on which benefits are payable to
          the Participant's spouse under the Retirement Plan.

          Lump sum payments under this paragraph (c) shall be
     the actuarial equivalent of the Benefit, as determined
     based on the actuarial assumptions in effect under the
     Retirement Plan as of the date of payment.  Installment
     payments under this paragraph (c) shall be actuarially
     equivalent to the lump sum payment of a Benefit, as

<PAGE> 4

     determined based on the actuarial assumptions referred
     to in the preceding sentence.

          Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
     contrary, in the event of a change of control of the
     Company (as defined below) (i) the Benefit to a
     Participant (including any remaining installments) shall
     be paid in a lump sum and the Committee may not direct
     that payment be made at a different time and (ii) the
     Committee may not direct payment of a Benefit to a
     Participant's spouse in a different form or at a
     different time.  For purposes of this Section, a "change
     of control" of the Company shall mean a change in
     control of a nature that would be required to be
     reported in response to Item 1(a) of the Current Report
     on Form 8-K, as in effect on March 9, 1993, pursuant to
     Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
     1934; provided that, without limitation, such change of
     control shall be deemed to occur if (A) any "person" (as
     such term is defined in Section 3(a)(9) and as used in
     Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
     of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), excluding The
     Bank of New York Company, Inc. or any of its sub-
     sidiaries, a trustee or any fiduciary holding securities
     under an employee benefit plan of The Bank of New York
     Company, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries, an underwriter
     temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering
     of such securities or a corporation owned, directly or
     indirectly, by stockholders of The Bank of New York
     Company, Inc. in substantially the same proportion as
     their ownership of The Bank of New York Company, Inc.,
     is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule
     13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly,
     of securities of The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
     representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of
     the then outstanding securities of The Bank of New York
     Company, Inc. ("Voting Securities"); or (B) during any
     period of not more than two years, individuals who
     constitute the Board of Directors of The Bank of New
     York Company, Inc. as of the beginning of the period and
     any new director (other than a director designated by a
     person who has entered into an agreement with The Bank
     of New York Company, Inc. to effect a transaction
     described in clause (A) or (C) of this sentence) whose
     election by the Board of Directors of The Bank of New
     York Company, Inc. or nomination for election by the
     shareholders of The Bank of New York Company, Inc. was
     approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the
     directors then still in office who either were directors
     at such time or whose election or nomination for
     election was previously so approved, cease for any

<PAGE> 5

     reason to constitute a majority thereof; or   the
     shareholders of The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
     approve a merger or consolidation of The Bank of New
     York Company, Inc. with any other corporation, other
     than a merger or consolidation which would result in the
     Voting Securities of The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
     outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to
     represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being
     converted into Voting Securities of the surviving
     entity) at least 60% of the combined voting power of the
     Voting Securities of The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
     or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after
     such merger or consolidation, or the shareholders of The
     Bank of New York Company, Inc. approve a plan of
     complete liquidation of The Bank of New York Company,
     Inc. or any agreement for the sale or disposition by The
     Bank of New York Company, Inc. or all or substantially
     all of the assets of The Bank of New York Company, Inc.


          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, The Bank of New York Company,
Inc. has caused this Amendment to be executed by its duly
authorized officers this 11th day of June, 1996.

                        AMENDMENT TO
             THE BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY, INC.
           SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN


          WHEREAS, The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "Plan") was
adopted by the Board of Directors of The Bank of New York
Company, Inc., effective as of June 9, 1992; and
          WHEREAS, Section 9 of the Plan provides that the
Board of Directors may amend the Plan at any time, except in
certain respects not material hereto; and
          WHEREAS, the Board of Directors desires to amend
the Plan;
          NOW, THEREFORE, the Plan is hereby amended in the
following respects, effective as of November 12, 1996, except
as otherwise provided herein:
          1.  Sections 2(c)  and (d) of the Plan are
redesignated as Sections 2(d) and (e), respectively, and a
new Section 2(c)  is added to the Plan to read as follows:
             (c) "Beneficiary" means the person or persons
     designated by the Participant on a form approved by the
     Committee which is filed with the Committee prior to the
     Participant's death.  Such designation may be revoked or
     changed by the Participant by filing a new form with the
     Committee prior to the Participant's death.  In the
     event of the death of a Participant who has not
     designated a Beneficiary, or if no Beneficiary survives
     the Participant, then the Participant's Beneficiary
     shall be (I) the spouse of the Participant, if he is
     married on the date of his death or (ii) the estate of
     the Participant if he is not married on his death.

          2.  Section 4 of the Plan is amended by amending
the second and third paragraphs thereof to read as follows:

<PAGE> 2

          The Beneficiary of a Participant whose death occurs
     while an active employee of the Company shall be
     entitled to the Benefit provided under the Plan.

          The Benefit provided under this Plan is in addition
     to any other retirement benefits provided by the Company
     to a Participant or, if applicable, his Beneficiary.

          3.  Section 5(b) of the Plan is amended by deleting
the third sentence thereof in its entirety.
          4.  Section 5(c)  of the Plan is amended by deleting
the last sentence of the first paragraph thereof and
substituting therefor the following:
     In the event of the Participant's death after
     installment payments have commenced, the remaining value

     form of actual shares of Common Stock.  At the discretion
     of the Committee, a stock certificate may be issued in
     respect of Stock Awards or a book entry of the Stock Award
     may be made.  If a certificate is issued, such certificate
     shall be registered in the name of and be delivered to the
     Participant.  Full ownership of such shares, whether issued
     in the form of a certificate or in book entry, including
     the right to vote and receive dividends, shall immediately
     vest in such Participant.

5.   Section 8 (as renumbered) is amended by the addition of the
following at the end thereof:

      In no event may any Participant receive stock options with
      respect to more than 500,000 shares of Stock in any
      calendar year beginning after December 31, 1996, increased
      in each subsequent calendar year by the difference between
      500,000 and the number of shares subject to stock options
      granted to the Participant under the Plan in each calendar
      year after December 31, 1996.

6.    Section 10 (as renumbered) is amended by the addition of
the following at the end thereof:

          Awards of performance shares to a Covered Employee
      shall (unless the Committee determines otherwise) be
      subject to performance conditions based on the achievement
      (i) by the Company or a business unit of a specified target
      operating or net income or return on assets, (ii) by the
      Company or a business unit of specified target earnings per
      share or return on equity, (iii) of a targeted total
      shareholder return or (iv) any combination of the
      conditions set forth in (i) and (ii) above.  If an Award of
      performance shares is made on such basis, the Committee
      shall establish the relevant performance conditions within
      90 days after the commencement of the performance period
      (or such later date as may be required or permitted by
      Section 162 (m) of the Internal Revenue Code).  The
      Committee may, in its discretion, reduce or eliminate the
      amount of payment with respect to an Award of performance
      shares to a Covered Employee, notwithstanding the
      achievement of a specified performance condition.  The
      maximum number of performance shares subject to any Award
      to a Covered Employee is 300,000 for each 12 months during
      the performance period (or, to the extent the Award is paid
      in cash, the maximum dollar amount of any such Award is the
      equivalent cash value of such number of Shares at the
      closing price on the last trading day of the performance
      period).  For purposes of the immediately preceding
      sentence, "trading day" shall mean a day in which the
      Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.  An Award
      of performance shares to a Participant who is a Covered
      Employee shall (unless the Committee determines otherwise)
      provide that in the event of the Participant's termination
      of employment prior to the end of

<PAGE> 3

      the performance period for any reason, such Award will be
      payable only (A) if the applicable performance conditions
      are achieved and (B) to the extent, if any, as the
      Committee shall determine.

7.   Section 15 of the Plan (as renumbered) is amended by the
addition of the following at the end thereof:

     Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the
     Committee may, subject to the terms and conditions it may
     specify, permit a Participant to transfer any nonstatutory
     stock options granted to him pursuant to the Plan to one or
     more of his immediate family members or to trusts
     established in whole or in part for the benefit of the
     Participant and/or one or more of such immediate family
     members.  During the lifetime of the Participant, a
     nonstatutory stock option shall be exercisable only by the
     Participant or by the immediate family member or trust to
     whom such stock option has been transferred pursuant to the
     immediately preceding sentence.  For purposes of the Plan,
     (i) the term "immediate family" shall mean the Participant's
     spouse and issue (including adopted and step children) and
     (ii) the phrase "immediate family members and trusts
     established in whole or in part for the benefit of the
     Participant and/or one or more of such immediate family
     members" shall be further limited, if necessary, so that
     neither the transfer of a nonstatutory stock option to such
     immediate family member or trust, nor the ability of a
     Participant to make such a transfer shall have adverse
     consequences to the Company or the Participant by reason of
     Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. has
caused this Amendment to be executed by its duly authorized
officers this 14th  day of January, 1997.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies

The Company provides a complete range of banking and other financial services 
to corporations and individuals worldwide through its business sectors: Trust, 
and Securities and Other Processing; Retail Banking; Corporate Banking; and 
Other.

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial
statements.  Amounts subject to significant estimates and assumptions are items
such as the allowance for loan losses, pension and postretirement obligations,
and the fair value of financial instruments.  Actual results could differ from
these estimates.     

     The following is a summary of the Company's more significant accounting 
and reporting policies.

Securities - Debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale are
carried at fair value, except for those equity securities whose fair value 
cannot be readily determined.  These securities are carried at cost.  Equity 
investments of less than a majority but at least 20% ownership are accounted 
for by the equity method and classified as other assets.  For securities 
carried at fair value the after tax effect of net unrealized gains and losses 
is reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity.  

     Securities classified as trading assets are carried at fair value, with 
net unrealized holding gains and losses recognized currently in income.  Debt
securities, which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until 
maturity, are classified as held-to-maturity and stated at cost, adjusted for 
discount accrued and premium amortized.  Realized gains and losses on the sale 
of debt and equity securities are determined by the specific identification 
and average cost methods, respectively.

Allowance for Loan Losses - The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a
level that, in management's judgment, is adequate to absorb probable losses. 
Management's judgment is based on an evaluation of existing risks of individual
credits; past loan loss experience; the volume, composition, and growth of the
loan portfolio; current and projected economic conditions; and other relevant
factors.

     The portion of the allowance for loan losses allocated to nonaccrual
commercial loans over $1 million (impaired loans) is measured by the difference
between their recorded value and fair value.  Fair value is either the present
value of the expected future cash flows from borrowers, market value of the 
loan, or the fair value of the collateral.

Nonperforming Assets - Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status when
collateral is insufficient and principal or interest is past due 90 days or 
more, or when there is reasonable doubt that interest or principal will be 
collected.  Accrued interest is usually reversed when a loan is placed on 
nonaccrual status.  Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans may be 
recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's 
judgment.  Nonaccrual loans are not restored to accruing status until principal 
and interest are current or they become fully collateralized.  Consumer loans 
are not classified as nonperforming assets, but are charged off based upon an 
established delinquency schedule determined by product.  Interest accrual on 
consumer loans is suspended based upon a schedule determined by product.  Real 
estate acquired in satisfaction of loans is carried in other assets at the 
lower of the recorded investment in the property or fair value minus estimated 
costs to sell.

PAGE <7>

Derivative Financial Instruments - Derivative contracts, such as futures,
forwards, swaps, options, and similar products used in trading activities are
recorded at market value; gains and losses are included in other noninterest
income.  Unrealized gains and losses are reported on a gross basis in trading
account assets and other borrowed funds, after taking into consideration master
netting agreements.

     Derivative contracts are designated as an element of the Company's asset
and liability management (ALM) process when they alter the Company's interest
rate and foreign currency exposures.  Contracts used in the ALM process are
linked to specific or groups of similar assets or liabilities where there is a
high correlation between the derivative contract and the item altered, both at
inception and throughout the contract period.  ALM derivative contracts are
accounted for on the deferral, accrual, or mark-to-market basis, as noted 
below.  Under the deferral or accrual method, gains and losses on terminated 
derivative contracts are deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the 
linked assets or liabilities.  Gains and losses on derivative contracts linked 
to assets or liabilities that are sold are recognized as an adjustment to the 
gain or loss of the balance sheet item.

     Deferral Accounting - This method relates principally to futures and
     forwards.  Deferred gains and losses are reported as adjustments to
     the carrying value of the linked items.  The amortization of

2.  Acquisitions and Dispositions

The Company has agreed to acquire the corporate and municipal trust business 
of Wells Fargo & Company.  The acquisition involves approximately 5,000 bond 
trustee and agency appointments, representing more than $85 billion in 
outstanding securities for municipal and corporate issuers primarily in the 
western United States.

     The Company made acquisitions related to its factoring and corporate trust
businesses during 1996 and 1994, and its unit investment trust business in 
1996.

     During 1995, the Company acquired several securities processing 
businesses.  The major acquisitions included the securities lending, U.S. and 
global custody, securities clearance, and master trust business of BankAmerica, 
the securities lending and U.S. and global custody business of J.P. Morgan,  
and the corporate trust business of NationsBank.  Securities processing 
revenues in 1995 did not include any revenue related to the J.P. Morgan and 
BankAmerica acquisitions.

     On September 1, 1995, the Company purchased The Putnam Trust Company of
Greenwich, headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut.

     In 1996, the Company sold its AFL-CIO Union Privilege affinity credit card
portfolio to Household International, Inc. for $575 million.  After settling 
its obligations to its marketing agent and other transaction costs, the 
Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $400 million.  The transaction related to
approximately $3.4 billion in outstandings and included 2.2 million cards.

4.  Loans

The Company's loan distribution and industry concentrations of credit risk at
December 31, 1996 and 1995 are incorporated by reference from "Loans" in the
Management's Discussion and Analysis Section of this Report.  The Company's
retail, community, and middle market banking operations in the New York
metropolitan area create a significant geographic concentration.  
     
     In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its banking 
subsidiaries have made loans at prevailing interest rates and terms to 
directors and executive officers of the Company and to certain entities to 
which these individuals are related.  The aggregate dollar amount of these 
loans was $755 million, $720 million, and $663 million at December 31, 1996, 
1995, and 1994.  These loans are primarily with related entities under 
revolving lines of credit.  During 1996 these loans averaged $680 million, and 
ranged from $605 million to $862 million.  All loans were fully performing 
during this period.  

Transactions in the allowance for loan losses are summarized as follows:

     Nonaccrual and reduced rate loans outstanding at December 31, 1996, 1995,
and 1994 were $213 million, $225 million, and $297 million.  At December 31,
1996, commitments to borrowers whose loans were classified as nonaccrual or
reduced rate were not material.

     At December 31, 1996 and 1995, impaired loans aggregated $154 million and
$159 million, of which $122 million and $95 million exceeded their fair value 
by $28 million and $22 million.  For 1996 and 1995, the average amount of 
impaired loans was $151 million and $182 million and interest income recognized 
on them (limited to cash received) was $0.4 million and $0.7 million.

     Interest income recognized on total nonaccrual and reduced rate loans
exceeded reversals by $3 million in 1996, $2 million in 1995, and $3 million in
1994.  Interest income would have been increased by $11 million, $19 million, 
and $17 million if loans on nonaccrual status at December 31, 1996, 1995, and 
1994 had been performing for the entire year.  At year end, foreign loans on
nonperforming status were $38 million in 1996, $41 million in 1995, and $77
million in 1994.  Interest income received on foreign nonperforming loans 
equaled reversals in 1996, 1995, and 1994.  If foreign loans on nonaccrual 
status at December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994 had been performing for the entire 
year, interest income would have been increased by $2 million for each year.

     Other real estate was $41 million, $72 million, and $56 million at 
December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994.  Writedowns of and expenses related to 
other real estate included in noninterest expense were $1 million, $5 million, 
and $11 million in 1996, 1995, and 1994.

                ==       ===       ======      ====     ======   ======


     Fixed-rate debt at December 31, 1996 had interest rates ranging from 6.50%
to 8.50%.  The weighted average interest rates on fixed-rate debt at December 
31, 1996 and 1995 were 7.60% and 7.61%.  The weighted average interest rates 
on variable-rate debt at December 31, 1996 and 1995 were 6.21% and 6.27%.  
Exposure to interest rate movements is reduced by interest rate swap 
agreements.  As a result of these agreements, the effective interest rates 
differ from those stated.

     In 1996, $114 million of 7.50% convertible subordinated debentures due 
2001 converted into 12 million shares of common stock.

6.  Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interests in the Company's Junior          
    Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures

In December 1996, BNY Institutional Capital Trust A (7.78%) and BNY Capital I
(7.97%) (the "Trust(s)"), wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, each issued
$300 million of cumulative Capital Securities ("Capital Securities") due 2026. 
The sole assets of each trust are $309 million of junior subordinated 
deferrable interest debentures of the Company, whose maturities and interest 
rates match the Capital Securities.  The Company's obligations under the 
agreements that relate to the Capital Securities, the Trusts and the debentures 
constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the Trusts' 
obligations under the Capital Securities.  The Capital Securities are callable 
in 2006 at prices of 103.89 and 103.985, which decline ratably to par in the 
year 2016.

7.  Shareholders' Equity

The Company's $111 million no par value 8.60% cumulative preferred stock has a
liquidation preference and stated value of $625 per share, and is redeemable at
the option of the Company on and after December 1, 1997 at $625 per share, plus
cumulative and unpaid dividends.  Holders of cumulative preferred stock have
cumulative dividend rights in preference to holders of common stock.

     At December 31, 1996, 8.4 million warrants expiring in 1998 (exercise 
price $15.50 per share) to purchase 33.5 million shares of the Company's 
common stock were outstanding.  During 1996, warrant holders converted 5.3 
million warrants into 21.0 million common shares, providing the Company with 
$325 million in capital.  

     At December 31, 1996, the Company had reserved for issuance 58 million
common shares pursuant to the terms of securities and employee benefit plans.

     The Company has a preferred stock purchase rights plan.  The plan provides
that if any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the
Company's common stock (an "acquiring person"), then on and after the tenth day
thereafter, each right would entitle the holder (other than the acquiring 
person) to purchase $400 in market value of the Company's common stock for 
$200.  In addition, if there is a business combination between the Company and 
an acquiring person, or in certain other circumstances, each right (if not 
previously exercised) would entitle the holder (other than the acquiring 
person) to purchase $200 in market value of the common stock of the acquiring 
person for $100.  The rights are redeemable by the Company at $0.05 per right 
until they are exercisable, and will expire in 2004.

     Warrants diluted earnings per share in 1996.  Fully diluted earnings per
share also give effect to the assumed conversion of convertible debentures and
convertible preferred stock.  In 1996, primary earnings per share would have
decreased by $.03 if the conversion of the 7.50% convertible debentures had
occurred at the beginning of the year.

     During 1996, the Company bought back 48 million shares of its common stock
at a cost of $1,332 million.  The Company plans to buy back through the end of
1997 up to 30 million additional shares.

9.  Employee Benefit Plans

In 1996, for both pension and postretirement plans, the Company elected to 
change the measurement date for plan assets and liabilities from December 31 
to September 30.  This change did not have a material effect on 1996 benefit
expense.

Pension Plans
- -------------
The Company has defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all 
full-time employees.  The Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) may 
provide additional benefits.  The Company's funding policy is to contribute 
annually an amount necessary to satisfy the Internal Revenue Service's funding 
standards.

     The following table presents the income (expense) components included in
net pension income:

                                                      ====    ====    ====

     The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in computing
pension income was 10.0% in both 1996 and 1995, and 10.5% in 1994.  The ESOP
provision was $4 million, $3 million, and $1 million in 1996, 1995, and 1994. 
The following table sets forth the retirement plans' funded status:

Other Postretirement Benefits

     The Company provides health care and life insurance benefits for certain
retired employees.  

     The cost of these benefits consisted of the following components:

     The assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining benefit 
expense for 1996 is 8%, decreasing to 5% in 2005 and thereafter.  A change of 
one percentage point in this rate for each year would change the benefit 
obligation by 9% and benefit expense by 7%.  The following table sets forth 
the funded status of the Company's other postretirement benefit obligation:

Supplemental Disclosure of Cash Flow Information
Cash Paid During the Year for:
   Interest                                          $ 178    $ 171   $  122

In 1995, the Company contributed $361 million of available-for-sale securities
to a subsidiary.  Gains of $16 million and $79 million were recorded in 1996 
and 1995.
  
<PAGE> 19

     In the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company combined two of its banking
subsidiaries, The Bank of New York (NJ) and The Putnam Trust Co., into The Bank
of New York ("Bank"), a significant subsidiary.

     The Bank is subject to dividend limitations under the Federal Reserve Act
and state banking laws.  Under these statutes, prior regulatory approval is
required for dividends in any year that would exceed the Bank's net profits for
such year combined with retained net profits for the prior two years.  The Bank
is also prohibited from paying a dividend in an amount greater than "undivided
profits then on hand" less "bad debts" (generally loans six months or more past
due).

     Under the first of these limitations, in 1997 the Bank could declare
dividends of $454 million plus net profits earned in 1997.  The Bank is not
restrained from paying dividends under the second limitation.  The dividend
policy of The Bank of New York (Delaware) ("BNYDEL"), a significant subsidiary,
is to declare dividends that, at a minimum, allow it to meet capital guidelines
established by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC").

     In addition to these statutory tests, the primary federal regulators of 
the banks (the Federal Reserve Board in the case of the Bank and the FDIC in 
the case of BNYDEL) could prohibit a dividend if they determined that the 
payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.  Bank 
regulators have indicated that, generally, dividends should be paid by banks 
only to the extent of earnings from continuing operations.

     Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I 
capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), 
and of Tier I capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined).

     As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, capital ratios for the Company, the 
Bank, and BNYDEL were categorized as well capitalized as set forth in the table 
below.

     The Federal Reserve Act limits and requires collateral for extensions of
credit by the Company's banks to the Company and certain of its nonbank
affiliates; also, there are restrictions on the amounts of investments by such
banks in stock and other securities of the Company and such affiliates, and
restrictions on the acceptance of their securities as collateral for loans by
such banks.  Extensions of credit by the banks to each of the Company and such
affiliates are limited to 10% of such bank's capital and surplus, and in the
aggregate for the Company and all such affiliates to 20%.

     The subsidiary banks of the Company are required to maintain reserve
balances with Federal Reserve Banks under the Federal Reserve Act and 
Regulation D.  Required balances averaged $783 million and $770 million for 
the years 1996 and 1995.

11.  Other Noninterest Income and Expense

Other noninterest income includes equity in earnings of unconsolidated
subsidiaries of $46 million, $62 million, and $34 million in 1996, 1995, and
1994.  In 1996, other noninterest income also includes a $400 million pre-tax
gain on the sale of the Company's AFL-CIO Union Privilege affinity credit card
portfolio.  Other noninterest expense includes deposit insurance premiums of 
$2 million, $32 million, and $52 million in 1996, 1995, and 1994 and 
amortization of intangibles of $105 million, $74 million, and $86 million in 
1996, 1995, and 1994.

12.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of the Company's financial instruments (i.e., monetary
assets and liabilities) are determined under different accounting methods-see
Note 1.  The following disclosure discusses these instruments on a uniform 
basis - fair value.  However, active markets do not exist for a significant 
portion of these instruments, principally loans and commitments.  As a result, 
fair value determinations require significant subjective judgments regarding 
future cash flows.  Other judgments would result in different fair values.  
Among the assumptions used by the Company are discount rates ranging 
principally from 6% to 9% at December 31, 1996 and 6% to 8% at December 31, 
1995.  The fair value information supplements the basic financial statements 
and other traditional financial data presented throughout this Report.

     A summary of the practices used for determining fair value is as follows:

Securities, Trading Activities, and Derivatives Used for ALM        
- ------------------------------------------------------------        
The fair value of securities and trading assets and liabilities is based on
quoted market prices, dealer quotes, or pricing models.  Fair value amounts 
for derivative instruments, such as options, futures and forward rate 
contracts, commitments to purchase and sell foreign exchange, and foreign 
currency swaps, are similarly determined.  The fair value of interest rate 
swaps is the amount that would be received or paid to terminate the agreement.  

Loans and Commitments
- ---------------------
For certain categories of consumer loans, fair value includes consideration of
the quoted market prices for securities backed by similar loans.  Discounted
future cash flows and secondary market values are used to determine the fair
value of other types of loans.  The fair value of commitments to extend credit,
standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit is based upon the
cost to settle the commitment.

Other Financial Assets
- ----------------------
Fair value is assumed to equal carrying value for these assets due to their 
short maturity.

Deposits, Borrowings, and Long-Term Debt
- ----------------------------------------
The fair value of noninterest-bearing deposits is assumed to be their carrying
amount.  The fair value of interest-bearing deposits, borrowings, and long-term
debt is based upon current rates for instruments of the same remaining maturity
or quoted market prices for the same or similar issues.

     The carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company's financial
instruments are as follows:

(1) The forward LIBOR rate shown above reflects the implied forward yield      
    curve for that index at December 31, 1996.  However, actual repricings     
    for ALM interest rate swaps are generally based on 3 month LIBOR.   


     The Company's financial assets and liabilities are primarily variable rate
instruments.  Fixed rate loans and deposits are issued to satisfy customer and
investor needs.  Derivative financial instruments are utilized to manage 
exposure to the effect of interest rate changes on fixed rate assets and 
liabilities, and to enhance liquidity.  The Company matches the duration of 
derivatives to that of the assets and liabilities being hedged, so that changes 
in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates will be offset.
  
     The Company uses receive fixed and pay fixed interest rate swaps, futures
contracts, and forward rate agreements to convert fixed rate loans, deposits, 
and long term debt to floating rates.  Basis swaps are used to convert various
variable rate borrowings to LIBOR which better matches the assets funded by the
borrowings. 

     The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value
of its investments in foreign subsidiaries.  The after-tax effects are shown in

the cumulative translation adjustment included in shareholders' equity.  At
December 31, 1996 and 1995, $228 million and $237 million in notional amount of
foreign exchange contracts, with fair values of $0.4 million and $0.9 million,
hedged corresponding amounts of foreign investments.  These foreign exchange
contracts had a maturity of less than three months at December 31, 1996.

     Deferred net gains on ALM derivative financial instruments amounted to 
zero and $1 million at December 31, 1996 and 1995.  

     Net interest income increased by $17 million, $17 million, and $24 million
in 1996, 1995, and 1994 as a result of ALM derivative financial instruments.

15.  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent 
liabilities are outstanding which are not reflected in the accompanying 
consolidated balance sheets.  Management does not expect any material losses 
to result from these matters.   

     The Company's significant trading and off-balance-sheet risks are
securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk management products,  
commercial lending commitments, letters of credit, and securities lending
indemnifications.  The Company assumes these risks to trade for its own 
account, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks, and to provide 
customers with the ability to meet credit and liquidity needs and to hedge 
foreign currency and interest rate risks.  These items involve, to varying 
degrees, credit, foreign exchange, and interest rate risk not recognized in 
the balance sheet.  The Company's off-balance-sheet risks are managed and 
monitored in manners similar to those used for on-balance-sheet risks.  There 
are no significant industry concentrations of such risks.

     A summary of the notional amount of the Company's off-balance-sheet credit 
transactions, net of participations, at December 31, 1996 and 1995 follows:   
                            
Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Risks

In millions                                    1996               1995 
- ------------------------------                 ----               ----
Commercial Lending Commitments               $31,604            $26,606        
Credit Card Commitments                       14,998             18,874
Standby Letters of Credit                      4,664              4,257        
Commercial Letters of Credit                   1,711              1,728        
Securities Lending Indemnifications           23,881             15,068        

     The total potential loss on undrawn commitments, standby and commercial
letters of credit, and securities lending indemnifications is equal to the 
total notional amount if drawn upon, which does not consider the value of any
collateral.  Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without 
being drawn upon, the total amount does not necessarily represent future cash
requirements.  The Company does not anticipate the use of all of its unused
credit lines available to credit card holders by individual customers at one
time.  These credit lines are contingent upon customers maintaining specific
credit standards, and the Company has the right to reduce or cancel them at
anytime.  In securities lending transactions, the Company requires the borrower
to provide collateral, thus reducing credit risk.

     The notional amounts for other off-balance-sheet risks express the dollar
volume of the transactions; however, credit risk is much smaller.  The Company
performs credit reviews and enters into netting agreements to minimize the 
credit risk of foreign currency and interest rate risk management products.  
Exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk is reduced by entering 
into offsetting positions.

     Standby letters of credit principally support corporate obligations and
include $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion that were collateralized with cash and
securities at December 31, 1996 and 1995.  At December 31, 1996 and 1995,
securities lending indemnifications were secured by collateral of $23.9 billion
and $15.1 billion.  At December 31, 1996, approximately $3.5 billion of the
standbys will expire within one year, $1.1 billion between one to five years, 
and the balance after five years.

     At December 31, 1996, approximately $14.9 billion of interest rate
contracts will mature within one year, $12.7 billion between one and five 
years, and the balance after five years.  At December 31, 1996, approximately 
$100.6 billion of foreign exchange contracts will mature within one year and 
$0.9 billion between one and five years.  There were no derivative financial
instruments on nonperforming status at year end 1996.

     Net rent expense for premises and equipment was $91 million in 1996, $94
million in 1995, and $96 million in 1994.

     At December 31, 1996, the Company and its subsidiaries were obligated 
under various noncancelable lease agreements, certain of which provide for 
additional rents based upon real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance and 
for various renewal options.  The minimum rental commitments under 
noncancelable operating leases for premises and equipment having a term of 
more than one year from December 31, 1996 are as follows:

     In the ordinary course of business, there are various claims pending
against the Company and its subsidiaries.  In the opinion of management,
liabilities arising from such claims, if any, would not have a material effect
upon the Company's consolidated financial statements.

16.  Stock Option Plans

The Company's stock option plans (the Option Plans) provide for the issuance of
stock options at fair market value at the date of grant to officers and 
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.  Under the Company's 1993 Plan, 
options to acquire common stock may be granted in amounts that do not exceed, 
on a cumulative basis, 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock per year, 
and, subject to adjustment, options covering no more than approximately 19 
million shares in the aggregate may be granted during the first five years.  
Generally, each option granted under the Option Plans is exercisable between 
one and ten years from the date of grant.

     The Company accounts for its Option Plans under Accounting Principles 
Board Opinion 25.  As a result, compensation cost is not recorded.  If 
compensation cost for these plans had been based on fair value, net income 
would have been reduced by $9 million in 1996 and $7 million in 1995.  Also, 
earnings per share would have been reduced by 2 cents per share in 1996 and 
1995.

     The assumptions used in determining the impact of accounting for the 
Option Plans at fair value for 1996 are as follows:  dividend yield of 3%; 
expected volatility of 27%; risk free interest rate of 5.40%; and expected 
option lives of 5 years.

     A summary of the status of the Company's Option Plans as of December 31,

Report of Independent Auditors                                                 


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of The Bank of New
York Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 1996, 
and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' 
equity, and cash flows for the year then ended.  These financial statements 
are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.  The 
financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 1995 and for the two 
years then ended, were audited by other auditors whose report dated February 
26, 1996, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Bank of New 
York Company, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1996, and the consolidated 
results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Company's Financial Condition and
Results of Operations
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
SUMMARY OF RESULTS

For 1996, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. (the "Company") reported record 
net income of $1,020 million or a record $2.41 per fully diluted share, 
compared with $914 million or $2.15 per fully diluted share in 1995 and $749 
million or $1.85 per fully diluted share in 1994.  For 1996, the net effect 
of the conversion of warrants, the remaining outstanding warrants, and the 
stock buyback was to dilute fully diluted earnings per share 10 cents.

     Revenues from the Company's securities processing business continued their
strong advance, growing 59% for the full year to $655 million.  This 
significant increase reflected strong internal growth as well as the 
acquisition of the corporate trust business of NationsBank and the custody 
businesses of BankAmerica and J.P. Morgan.  All areas of securities processing 
contributed to an internal growth rate of 14% with ADRs, corporate trust, and 
government securities clearance particularly strong.  Fees from other 
processing were up 9% for the year to $206 million.  Trust and investment 
management continued its strong performance in 1996 with fees growing 18% over 
last year to $161 million reflecting new business and generally strong markets.
In 1996, net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis declined to $1,999 
million reflecting the sale of the $3.4 billion AFL-CIO Union Privilege 
affinity credit card portfolio.  The provision for loan losses increased to 
$600 million due largely to a deterioration in the Company's credit card 
portfolio.  Operating expenses continued to remain under good control.     

     In 1996, return on average common equity was a record 19.98% compared with
19.42% in 1995 and 18.49% in 1994, while return on average assets was a record
1.90% compared with 1.72% in 1995 and 1.49% in 1994.

     Tangible fully diluted earnings per share (earnings before the 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles) were $2.61 per share in 1996 compared 
with $2.29 per share in 1995.  Tangible return on average assets was 2.10% in 
1996 and 1.86% in 1995; and tangible return on average common equity was 27.94% 
in 1996 compared with 24.14% in 1995.

     In 1995, net interest income, the net interest rate spread, and net yield
on interest earning assets reached record levels.  Loan demand was strong in
1995, particularly in corporate lending across the United States, and in all 
of the special industry lending areas.  Revenues from the Company's securities
processing business grew 14% in 1995.  All areas of securities processing
increased, led by ADRs, corporate trust, and master trust.  Other processing 
fees grew 11% over the previous year led by increases in funds transfer and 
trade finance revenues.  The provision for loan losses increased to $330 
million.  Operating expenses were strictly controlled.

     In 1994, net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased to
$1,763 million as the net interest spread increased to 3.30% and the net yield
on interest earning assets was 4.11%.  These increases reflect a continued 
shift in the asset mix toward higher yielding assets, including strong growth 
in credit cards.  A reduction in nonperforming assets also contributed to the 
increase in net interest income.  Revenues from the Company's securities and 
other processing businesses remained strong.  A lower provision for loan losses 
and continued control of operating expenses contributed to higher earnings.

NET INTEREST INCOME

                                              ----          ----         ----
Net Interest Income on a Taxable
 Equivalent Basis                           $1,999        $2,068       $1,763
Net Interest Rate Spread                      3.37%         3.41%        3.30%
Net Yield on Interest-Earning Assets          4.35%         4.53%        4.11%


     On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income was $1,999 million in
1996 compared with $2,068 million in 1995.  Average loans grew to $36.7 billion
in 1996 up from $35.4 billion in 1995.  Year end 1996 loans were $36.1 billion
down from $36.9 billion in 1995 reflecting the sale of $3.4 billion of credit
card receivables in the second quarter of 1996.  The net interest rate spread 
and yield were 3.37% and 4.35% in 1996 compared with 3.41% and 4.53% in 1995.  
These declines are primarily attributable to the sale of credit card 
receivables partially offset by the expiration of promotional rates on credit 
cards, and the repricing of certain segments of the credit card portfolio.  
The decline in the net yield also reflects the financing of the stock buyback 
program.

     Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased 17% in 1995 to
$2,068 million.  Continuing growth in the loan portfolio and wider interest 
rate spreads contributed to the increase during 1995.  Average loans grew 11% 
to $35.4 billion in 1995 from $32.0 billion in 1994.  Managed credit card 
outstandings were up 13% to $8.7 billion.  Other loan growth was attributable 
to strong demand in corporate lending across the United States and in all of 
the special industries lending areas.  The increase in the yield also reflected 
an increase in the volume of interest-free sources of funds by $813 million 
(a portion attributable to compensating balances in lieu of servicing fees), 
and higher returns on these funds.

     On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income increased 14% in 1994. 
Credit card growth, the large decline in nonperforming loans, and wider 
interest rate spreads contributed to this growth during 1994.  Average loans 
grew 5% to $32.0 billion in 1994.  The net interest rate spread and net yield 
on interest-earning assets increased by 6% and 7% in 1994.

     The credit card securitizations reduced net interest income by $5 million
in 1995 and $87 million in 1994.  Interest income would have been increased by
$11 million, $19 million, and $17 million if loans on nonaccrual status at
December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994 had been performing for the entire year.  

<PAGE> 31

NONINTEREST INCOME

Noninterest income is provided by a wide range of fiduciary and processing
services, other fee-based services, and trading activities.  Revenues from 
these activities were $2,130 million in 1996, compared with $1,491 million in 
1995 and $1,289 million in 1994.    

     Securities processing fees were $655 million, $411 million, and $359
million in 1996, 1995, and 1994.  Internal growth in all areas and acquisitions
contributed to the significant increase in revenue in 1996.  Other processing
fees, principally funds transfer, deposit services, and trade finance, were 
$206 million in 1996, $189 million in 1995, and $171 million in 1994.  Trust 
and investment management fees were $161 million in 1996, $136 million in 1995, 
and $126 million in 1994.  Service charges and fees were $424 million in 1996,
compared with $423 million in 1995 and $465 million in 1994.  For further
discussion of fee revenue see Sector Profitability.

     Securities gains totaled $97 million, $115 million, and $15 million in
1996, 1995, and 1994, including gains on equity securities of $87 million in 
1996 and $97 million in 1995.  There were no net equity security gains recorded 
in 1994.

     Other noninterest income was $587 million in 1996, $217 million in 1995,
and $153 million in 1994.  A $400 million pre-tax gain was recorded in 1996 on
the sale of the Union credit card portfolio.  Profits from foreign exchange and
other trading activities were $67 million, $60 million, and $44 million in 
1996, 1995, and 1994.  Other noninterest income for 1996 and 1994 included 
gains of $21 million and $22 million related to the sale of portions of the 
Company's interest in Wing Hang Bank, Ltd.  A gain of $58 million on the sale 
of the Company's mortgage servicing portfolio was recorded in 1995.

     Noninterest income attributable to credit card securitizations decreased
to $3 million in 1995 from $38 million in 1994 primarily due to maturities.  

NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME TAXES

Total noninterest expense was  $1,835 million in 1996, $1,708 million in 1995,
and $1,646 in 1994.  The rise in expenses in 1996 was principally due to salary
and other expenses related to acquisitions of securities processing businesses
from J.P. Morgan, BankAmerica, and NationsBank as well as the acquisition of 
the Putnam Trust Company.  Salaries and employee benefits increased 11% to 
$1,014 million in 1996.  Net occupancy and furniture and fixture expenses fell 
by a combined $2 million to $260 million.  Other expenses were up 5% in 1996 to 
$561 million.   

     Total noninterest expense increased 4% in 1995 compared with 1994.  In
1995, expenses related to the settlement of litigation with Northeast Bancorp
were $15 million.  Net occupancy and furniture and fixture expenses fell by a
combined $4 million to $262 million in 1995.  Salaries and employee benefits
increased 7% in 1995.

     Deposit insurance premiums were $2 million in 1996 compared with $32
million and $52 million in 1995 and 1994.  The FDIC substantially reduced the
assessment rate for deposit insurance premiums in 1996.

     The efficiency ratio was 50.5% in 1996 compared with 50.0% in 1995 and
53.8% in 1994.  The efficiency ratios exclude the gain on the sale of the 
credit card portfolio in 1996, and the settlement with Northeast Bancorp and 
the gain on the sale of the ARCS mortgage servicing in 1995.

     The Company's consolidated effective tax rates for 1996, 1995, and 1994
were 38.3%, 38.3%, and 37.5%.  The 1996 rate reflects higher taxes on foreign
operations offset by the reduced impact of state and local taxes.  The 1995 
rate increased primarily from the reduced impact of tax-exempt income partially 
offset by the reduced impact of state and local taxes.

LIQUIDITY

The Company maintains its liquidity through the management of its assets and
liabilities, utilizing worldwide financial markets.  The diversification of
liabilities reflects the flexibility of the Company's funding sources under
changing market conditions.  Stable core deposits, including demand, retail 
time, and trust deposits from processing businesses, are generated through the
Company's diversified network and managed with the use of trend studies and
deposit pricing.  The use of derivative products such as interest rate swaps 
and financial futures enhances liquidity through the issue of long-term 
liabilities without exposure to interest rate risk.  Liquidity also results 
from the maintenance of a portfolio of assets which can be easily reduced and 
the monitoring of unfunded loan commitments, thereby reducing unanticipated 
funding requirements.

     Average savings, time, and noninterest-bearing deposits declined slightly
by $333 million in 1996.  Medium-term notes declined $416 million and foreign
deposits increased by $829 million.  More volatile sources of interest-bearing
deposits and borrowings decreased by $361 million. 

     In 1996, the Company's average commercial paper borrowings were $605
million compared with $656 million in 1995.  The Company has backup lines of
credit of $350 million at financial institutions supporting these borrowings.

     The following comments relate to the information disclosed in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

     Cash flows from earnings and other operating activities were $0.9 billion
in 1996, compared with $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion in 1995 and 1994.  The
decrease in 1996 is primarily attributable to changes in accruals and other.  
The decrease in 1995 reflects a larger decline in trading activities in 1994 
compared to 1995.

     In 1996, cash provided by investing activities was $0.1 billion, 
reflecting the sale of credit card loans which was offset by additions to 
loans, securities and interest bearing deposits.  The 1995 cash flows used by 
investing activities were $2.4 billion, reflecting additions to loans and 
securities partially offset by a decline in federal funds sold and securities 
purchased under resale agreements.  The 1994 cash flows used by investing 
activities were $5.4 billion reflecting additions to loans and an increase in 
federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements.  Cash 
provided by financing activities was $0.4 billion, $2.3 billion, and $1.7 
billion in 1996, 1995, and 1994 as the Company used deposits to finance its 
investing activities.  In 1996, financing activities used cash to buy back the 
Company's common shares, and provided cash through the issuance of trust 
preferred securities.  Federal funds purchased and securities sold under 
repurchase agreements were a source of funds in 1995 and a use of funds in 
1996 and 1994.

     Restrictions on the ability of the Company to obtain funds from its
subsidiaries are discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

Shareholders' equity was $5,127 million at December 31, 1996, compared with
$5,232 million at December 31, 1995 and $4,296 million at December 31, 1994.  
In January 1997, the Company increased its quarterly common stock dividend to 
24 cents per share, up 20% from the beginning of 1996.  During 1996, the 
Company retained $682 million of earnings and issued $600 million of trust 
preferred securities and $100 million of subordinated debt.  Warrant holders 
converted 5 million warrants into 21 million common shares, providing $325 
million in capital, and $114 million of subordinated debentures converted into 
common stock.  In addition, 48 million common shares were repurchased for $1.3 
billion.  The Company plans to buy back through the end of 1997 up to 30 
million additional shares.

     In 1995, the Company retained $641 million of earnings and issued $200
million of subordinated debt.  Subordinated debentures totaling $136 million 
were converted to common stock.  Also in 1995, 9 million common shares were
repurchased.

     In 1994, the Company increased its quarterly stock dividend to 16 cents 
per share, a 42% increase.  Seven million shares of common stock were 
repurchased.  The Company retained $512 million of earnings and issued $300 
million of subordinated debt.  Two issues of preferred stock were redeemed in 
1994, reducing preferred stock by $156 million and retained earnings by $17 
million.

     The Company can issue up to $1.2 billion of debt and preferred stock
(including convertible preferred stock) and $400 million of trust preferred
securities pursuant to shelf registration statements.

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

The provision for loan losses was $600 million in 1996, compared with $330
million in 1995 and $162 million in 1994.  The increase in the provision 
compared with 1995 principally relates to a higher level of anticipated losses 
on certain Consumers Edge (registered trademark) credit card accounts opened in 
1994 and 1995, and on the credit card portfolio generally.  The increased 
provision also covered $78 million of net charge-offs of Union receivables that 
were not sold.  In 1996, the Company continued to experience improvement in the 
asset quality of business loans as nonperforming loans declined.

     Net charge-offs were $455 million in 1996, $377 million in 1995, and $354
million in 1994.  In 1996 and 1995, net charge-offs were primarily attributable
to credit card loans while in 1994 net charge-offs primarily related to credit
card and other commercial loans.  The total allowance for loan losses was $901
million and $756 million at year-end 1996 and 1995.  The $145 million increase
in the allowance for loan losses in 1996 is mainly attributable to an increased
provision for credit card loans.  The $36 million decrease in the allowance for
loan losses in 1995 resulted primarily from net charge-offs exceeding the
provision for loan losses and the decline in the level of nonaccrual loans.  
The ratio of the total allowance for loan losses to year-end loans was 2.43% 
and 2.01% at December 31, 1996 and 1995.

     Credit card securitization reduced the provision for loan losses by
approximately $2 million and $32 million in 1995 and 1994.

<PAGE> 34

TRADING ACTIVITIES

The Company expanded its offering of foreign exchange risk management products
in 1996 as a result of an agreement it entered into with Susquehanna Trading, 
a firm with significant expertise in foreign exchange options.  Activity 
related to this agreement is the primary reason for the increase in the 
notional amounts and trading account balances for foreign exchange option 
contracts and commitments to purchase and sell foreign exchange in 1996.

     The Company manages trading risk through a system of position limits, an
earnings at risk methodology, stop loss advisory limits, and other market
sensitivity measures.  Earnings at risk is designed to measure with 95% 
certainty the Company's exposure to changes in earnings resulting from price 
fluctuations in the trading portfolio over a 24 hour period.  The trading 
portfolio's average pre-tax earnings at risk amounted to approximately $2.4 
million and represented the combination of interest rate risk of $1.5 million 
and foreign exchange risk of $0.9 million.  During 1996, pre-tax earnings at 
risk ranged from approximately $1.1 million to $4.5 million, consisting of a 
range of $0.6 million to $2.9 million for the interest rate risk component and 
a range of $0.2 million to $1.8 million for the foreign exchange risk 
component.  During 1996, daily trading revenue averaged approximately $0.3 
million, and ranged from a gain of approximately $2.5 million to a loss of 
approximately $1.9 million.  During this period, daily trading revenue did not 
exceed the Company's earnings at risk estimates on any given day.

ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

The Company's activities other than trading include lending, investing in
securities, accepting deposits, raising money as needed to fund assets, and
processing securities and other transactions.  The market risk that arises from
these activities is interest rate risk, and to a lesser degree foreign exchange
risk.  The Company actively manages interest-rate sensitivity (the exposure of
net interest income to interest rate movements).  The Company uses complex
simulation models to adjust the structure of its assets and liabilities in
response to interest rate exposures.

     The Company considers base line, high rate, and low rate scenarios to 
model interest rate sensitivity.  The base line scenario is the estimated most 
likely path for future short-term interest rates.  The base line scenario 
forecast in January 1997 assumes rates will rise.  The "high rate" scenario 
assumes a 77 basis point increase from the base line scenario.  The "low rate" 
scenario assumes the average rate declines 125 basis points under the base line 
scenario.  Other scenarios are also reviewed to examine the impact of various 
interest rate shocks.  The Company quantifies interest rate sensitivity by 
calculating the change in net interest income between the three scenarios over 
a 12 month measurement period.  Net interest income as calculated by the 
earnings simulation model under the base line scenario becomes the standard.  
The measurement of interest rate sensitivity is the percentage change in net 
interest income calculated by the model under high rate versus base-line 
scenario and under low rate versus base-line scenario.  The scenarios do not 
include the adjustments that management would make as rate expectations change.
The Company's policy limit for fluctuations in net interest income resulting 
from either the high rate or low rate scenario is 6 percent.  Based upon the 
January 1997 outlook, if interest rates were to rise to follow the high rate 
scenario, then net interest income during the policy measurement period would 
be positively affected by 0.93 percent.  If interest rates were to follow the 
low rate scenario, then net interest income would be negatively affected by 
2.75 percent (assuming management took no actions.)

     To manage foreign exchange risk, the Company funds foreign currency-
denominated assets with liability instruments denominated in the same currency. 
The Company utilizes various foreign exchange contracts if a liability
denominated in the same currency is not available or desired, and to minimize 
the earnings impact of translation gains or losses created by investments in 
overseas markets.

Allowance/Nonperforming Assets         355.3       254.5


     Nonperforming assets declined to $254 million at December 31, 1996.  The
decrease in nonperforming assets during 1996 is attributable to charge-offs and
writedowns of $27 million and paydowns, sales, and returns to accrual status of
$175 million.  The decrease was partially offset by $159 million of loans 
placed on nonperforming status.    

     Credit card loans are not placed on nonperforming status, but are charged
off when they become past due for certain periods.  Additional information
regarding the credit quality of the Company's credit card portfolio is provided
in the sections "Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses" and "Sector
Profitability".


SECTOR PROFITABILITY

The Company has an internal information system used for management purposes 
that produces sector performance data for Trust, and Securities and Other 
Processing, Retail Banking, Corporate Banking, and Other Sectors.  A set of 
measurement principles has been developed to help ensure that reported results 
of the sectors track their economic performance.  Sector results are subject 
to restatement whenever improvements are made in the measurement principles 
or organizational changes are made.  Prior year results have been restated to 
reflect the transfer of custom banking from the Retail Sector to the Trust, 
and Securities and Other Processing Sector and middle market and certain real 
estate lending from the Retail Sector to the Corporate Sector.  Changes were 
also made in the allocation of long-term debt and certain foreign branch costs. 

     Net interest income is computed on a taxable equivalent basis.  Support 
and other indirect expenses are allocated to sectors based on general 
guidelines.  The provision for loan losses is based on net charge-offs incurred 
by each sector.  Assets and liabilities are match funded.

     The Trust, and Securities and Other Processing Sector provides a broad
array of fee based services.  Trust includes personal trust and investment
management.  Securities processing includes services to both institutional
issuers and investors.

     The Retail Banking Sector includes credit card financing, consumer 
lending, and residential mortgage lending.

     The Corporate Banking Sector is divided into special industries banking,
U.S. commercial banking, middle market banking, international banking, and
factoring.

     The Other Sector includes trading and investing activities, treasury
services to other sectors, general administration, and the difference between

the recorded provision for loan losses and that allocated to the other sectors.

     The sectors contributed to the Company's profitability as follows: 

                         Trust, and 
                       Securities and                              Corporate

     In the Trust, and Securities and Other Processing Sector, securities
processing fees increased 59% over last year to $655 million compared with $411
million in 1995 and $359 million in 1994.  The increase in revenue reflects
continued internal growth as well as the acquisition of the corporate trust
business of NationsBank and the custody businesses of BankAmerica and J.P.
Morgan.  Internally generated growth was 14% led by ADRs, corporate trust, and
government securities clearance.  In 1996, fee revenue from issuer services,
custody, and securities industry products was $223 million, $240 million, and
$191 million compared with $154 million, $119 million, and $136 million in 
1995.  Fees from other processing increased 9% over last year to $206 million.  
Fees from trust and investment management grew 18% to $161 million, reflecting 
new business and generally strong markets.  The rise in noninterest expense was
principally due to salary and other expenses related to the acquisitions from
J.P. Morgan, BankAmerica, and NationsBank.

     In 1995, all areas of securities processing increased led by ADRs,
corporate trust, and master trust.  Fees from the acquisition of NationsBank's
corporate trust business were included in securities processing revenue for the
month of December.  In other processing, fees grew by 11% led by increases in
funds transfer and trade finance revenues.  Trust and investment management 
fees increased to $136 million in 1995 from $126 million in 1994 primarily due 
to higher market valuation of assets under management and the acquisition of 
Putnam.

     The decrease in net interest income in the Retail Banking Sector
principally reflects the sale of approximately $3.4 billion in credit card
receivables in the second quarter of 1996.  The decrease in net interest income
is also attributable to the decline in value of noninterest bearing sources of
funds in a declining rate environment.  Lower FDIC insurance premiums 
contributed to the decline in noninterest expense in the Retail Sector.  The 
provision for loan losses in the Retail Banking Sector reflects increased 
charge-offs on Consumers Edge (registered trademark) accounts opened in 1994 
and 1995.  The 1996 provision also reflects $78 million of net charge-offs 
related to past due and bankrupt Union credit card accounts not sold.  The 
table and discussion below provide information relating to the Company's credit 
card portfolio based on managed outstandings and excluding the Union portfolio:

     During 1996, the Company's credit card portfolio experienced rising
delinquencies and charge-offs.  Loans delinquent more than 30 days increased to
$378 million from $265 million in 1995.  Loans past due more than 90 days
increased to $214 million from $145 million in 1995.  Credit card loans
delinquent more than 90 days have a significant risk of loss.

     This adverse trend in credit quality reflects an industry-wide
deterioration in consumer credit performance as well as increased losses
attributable to bankruptcies resulting from a 1994 change in the bankruptcy 
laws.  Bankrupt accounts at December 31, 1996 were 78% higher than at December 
31, 1995.  At December 31, 1996 bankrupt accounts included $5 million that were 
not yet 30 days past due, up more than 56% from 1995.  As a result of rising 
delinquencies related to its Consumers Edge (registered trademark) accounts, 
the Company reduced Consumers Edge (registered trademark) new account 
originations to 330 thousand in 1996 down from 851 thousand accounts in 1995 
and 1.029 million accounts in 1994.

      Future levels of charge-offs are difficult to predict because they depend
upon future economic trends, consumer behavior, growth in the portfolio,
competition, and other factors.  Some of these factors are beyond the control 
of the Company.  The rising trend in credit card delinquencies and personal
bankruptcies may result in future charge-offs exceeding historic levels.

     In 1995, the increase in net interest income in the Retail Sector
principally reflected growth in the credit card business and the higher value 
of noninterest-bearing balances.  Charge-offs increased in 1995 and net credit 
card charge-offs as a percentage of average managed outstandings excluding the 
Union portfolio increased to 4.18% from 3.44% in 1994.  Maturities in the 
credit card securitization program shifted revenue from noninterest income to 
net interest income in 1995.

     Net interest income declined in the Corporate Banking Sector in 1996.  The
Special Industries and U.S. Commercial Banking sectors demonstrated growth with
average outstandings increasing 8% from last year.  The decrease in the 
provision reflects a net recovery primarily due to the settlement with the 
Republics of Croatia and Slovenia related to Yugoslavian debt in 1996.  Income 
from the Company's offshore banking subsidiaries was lower in 1996 compared to 
1995.

     In 1995, the increase in net interest income in the Corporate Banking
Sector was attributable to increased loan demand, higher yields, and a decline
in nonperforming assets.  Loan demand was strong in 1995, particularly in
corporate lending across the United States, in the middle market, and in all of
the special industry lending areas.

     The Other Sector reflects the difference between the total provision for
loan losses and that charged off by the sectors.  Noninterest income for 1996
includes a $400 million pre-tax gain on the sale of credit card loans.  Pre-tax
gains of $21 million and $22 million related to the sale of portions of the
Company's interest in Wing Hang Bank, Ltd. were included in noninterest income
in 1996 and 1994.  Securities gains and foreign exchange and other trading
activities decreased $10 million from 1995.

     In 1995, the Other Sector had an increase in revenues from trading and
investing.  Included in noninterest income for 1995 was a pre-tax gain of $58
million on the sale of the ARCS mortgage servicing.

                   The Businesses of The Bank of New York
  

                       SECURITIES AND OTHER PROCESSING                       
  
     The Bank of New York is the largest overall processor of securities 
offering a complete range of processing and operating services.
  
     These businesses are presented through nine securities processing product
lines within the broader categories of: shareholder services, custody and the
related securities lending activities, and broker/dealers and investment
companies.  Record keeping and reporting are common functions to each of
these.  Our other processing businesses include funds transfer, trade services
and cash management.
  
     We have become a much larger global participant in both custody and
corporate trust and operate these businesses from a single platform around the
world with processing centers in New York, London, Brussels and Singapore.
  
     We are the number one provider of American Depositary Receipts, corporate
trust and government securities clearance services and a market leader in our
remaining businesses, including stock transfer, domestic and international
custody, securities lending, unit investment trusts and mutual funds custody. 
We experienced internal growth in 1996 in all of these products, most in
excess of 10%.  High growth rates in these businesses are expected to
continue with American Depositary Receipts, stock transfer, corporate trust
and government securities clearance being particularly strong.
  
     We have also grown through acquisitions.  In 1996 we agreed to acquire the
corporate and municipal trust businesses of Riggs Bank and Wells Fargo &
Company.  We also successfully completed the conversion process for our
acquisitions of the custody businesses of BankAmerica and J.P. Morgan, both
announced in 1995. 
  
     We have built the critical mass and invested in the technology that will 
enable us to maintain growth in all of our processing businesses.  As the
consolidation trend continues, we are well positioned to take advantage of
strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise.
  
SHAREHOLDER SERVICES
  
American Depositary Receipts:
  
     Depositary receipts enable U.S. investors to invest in dollar-denominated
equity and debt securities of foreign companies and government agencies, and
provide the issuers of these securities access to the U.S. capital markets.
  
     Growth in this business has been very strong, driven by the increased
globalization of the capital markets.  Trading volume for listed depositary
receipts has been growing at a compound annual rate of 22% since 1990 and
this growth rate reached 24% in 1996.  Trading volume on U.S. exchanges
totaled 10.8 billion depositary receipts in 1996, valued at
$341 billion.
  
     We continue to lead the industry, establishing 161 sponsored programs for 
companies in 35 countries in 1996, over 62% of all new public sponsored 
depositary receipt programs.  For the last five years our share of all new 
programs has averaged over 60%.  We now issue depositary receipts for 
more than 1,000 non-U.S. companies in over 50 countries, representing 57% 
of total sponsored programs.
       
     We believe that our leadership position is the result of four strategies: 
our ability to open and develop new markets, diversify our client base by 
market and by industry, win business from competitors and focus on service 
quality.
  
     Fees increased over 20% in 1996 and, with our backlog at a record level, 
we expect strong growth in the future.
  
<PAGE> 42

Corporate Trust:
  
     As corporate trustee, the Bank provides registrar, custodial, escrow and
paying agent services to corporate and government issuers of debt securities.
Our corporate trust services include eight businesses providing a balanced
platform for growth.  We are capable of serving any customer needs.
  
- -Asset-backed and mortgage-backed finance
- -International finance
- -Bankruptcy administration
- -Corporate and municipal finance 
- -Derivative products
- -Escrow services
  
     The Bank is a leading supplier of corporate trust services, handling
approximately 40,000 issues with over $500 billion in principal amount
outstanding.  The number of issues increased 18% in 1996 while principal
grew 11%.
  
     Growth in our existing book of business was strong with fees up over 20% 
in 1996.  We achieved a leading position among our competitors being named
trustee on over 1,600 corporate and municipal issues in 1996 amounting to
more than $150 billion.  
  
     In October we announced the acquisition of the corporate trust business of
Riggs Bank and in December the corporate and municipal trust business of
Wells Fargo & Company.  These transactions will add 6,000 issues and $90 
billion in principal.  Overall fees grew 105% for the year.
  
Stock Transfer:
  
     As stock transfer agent, we provide shareholder record keeping, dividend
paying and reinvestment, proxy tabulation, and exchange services to
corporate issuers of equity securities.
  
     Demand for individual record keeping services is increasing with numerous
spin-offs creating new public equities.  Also, many companies that had
performed these services in-house are turning to outsourcing.  Add-on
services such as stock option plans, dividend reinvestment plans, employee
stock purchase plans, odd-lot buybacks, tenders, and exchange offers have
expanded and diversified our revenue stream.
  
     Quality is now a key driver of revenue growth in stock transfer.  In 1996 
we incorporated image processing into our operations, a technology which
increased processing speed, improved service quality and added to our
capacity.  We are the only transfer agent with three investor relations phone
centers, in New York, New Jersey and Texas.  We also have the largest
mailing operation in the stock transfer industry, located in New Jersey. 
Based upon customer surveys, an independent study ranked the quality of our
services number one among the leading stock transfer agents in 1996.  This is
the second consecutive year that we have achieved this recognition.
  
     During 1996 our client base grew 28% in both the number of companies and
the number of shareholder accounts.  We now perform these services for
more than 450 companies with over 10 million shareholders.  Fees grew 12%
in 1996 with the expanded customer base providing a solid platform for
future growth.
  
THE BANK IS AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED SECURITIES CUSTODIAN
  
     We offer a comprehensive array of services through a worldwide settlement
network.  Our services for a diversified client base include custody,
settlement of trades, income collection, corporate action processing, proxy
management, pricing and performance analysis for securities portfolios.  Our
reporting systems allow us to tailor information to meet the specific
requirements of our custody customers.  In addition, we provide our custody
clients with securities lending, cash management, foreign exchange and credit
services.
  
<PAGE> 43

Custody:
  
     We are a leading custodian, both in the U.S. and around the world, and 
serve a variety of customers including insurance companies, central banks,
commercial banks and government agencies.  We also provide custody and
trustee services to clients with multiple investment portfolios such as public
funds, corporate pension funds, Taft-Hartley funds, foundations and
endowments.  Services for these clients include daily portfolio valuations,
enhanced regulatory compliance reporting and on-line portfolio performance
analysis.
  
     In U.S. Custody, we serve our domestic clients from strategic locations
across the country.  In 1996 we introduced a variety of custody related
functions to the Bank's Office Manager (registered trademark), an interactive 
communications system that uses the latest technology to deliver integrated 
trade communication, reporting and portfolio analytic capabilities.  Early in 
1996 we completed the conversion of the BankAmerica custody business which
was primarily domestic but included some global clients.  This acquisition
added significantly to our size.
     
     Already a leader in International Custody, we enhanced our capabilities
further through the acquisition of the custody business of J.P. Morgan, greatly
expanding our presence in Europe and Asia.  The conversion of these clients
to our systems was completed ahead of schedule in December.  
  
     Through the J.P. Morgan transaction we acquired its Brussels operations
center which has become our primary point of operations in Europe.   We
now service all the major international markets from processing centers in
New York, London, Brussels and Singapore and are one of the few
organizations that operates from a single processing system worldwide.
  
     We have one of the largest networks of subcustodians in the world enabling
us to serve 81 markets; 15 of which were added in 1996.  Total cross-border
assets now exceed $350 billion.
  
     On a combined basis, internal growth in our custody businesses was strong 
as we added 84 new clients in 1996 unrelated to acquisitions.  At year end, 
total assets under custody exceeded $3 trillion.  Fees from these businesses 
more than doubled in 1996, increasing 123%.
  
Securities Lending:
  
     In conjunction with its custody businesses, the Bank operates one of the
largest securities lending programs in the world.  Lending securities that are
held in custody, or that are otherwise available to us, increases the yield on
customers' portfolios by investing the cash collateral exchanged for those
securities.  Our services include loan solicitation, negotiation of terms,
transaction settlement, loan administration, credit analysis of borrowers, and
receipt and investment of cash collateral.  We operate this business through
our offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.  Fees increased 56% in
1996.
  
WE ARE A LEADING PROVIDER OF SERVICES TO 
BROKER/DEALERS AND INVESTMENT COMPANIES
  
Government Securities Clearance:
  
     We continue to be the market leader in the clearance of U.S. government 
and certain other government agency securities as well as in the administration 
of tri-party repurchase agreements.  In the former role we serve as the agent 
for the movement of securities from the U.S. Treasury and other government
agency issuers to the dealer community and for the movement of securities
among dealers.  In tri-party repurchase programs, the Bank acts as an
intermediary between dealers and investors, holding the securities in custody
until the termination of the repurchase agreement.  We provide valuation and
segregation services as long as the securities held as collateral are under our
custody management.
  
     In 1996 we processed 9,000 tri-party contracts, an increase of 12% over
1995.  We continued to see significant growth in our global collateral
management service for international investors.  On an average day we
cleared over 60,000 transactions representing approximately $600 billion of
securities and held $180 billion of tri-party collateral under management.
  
<PAGE> 44

     Revenue growth in our core business continued strong at over 14%.  With the
J.P. Morgan and BankAmerica acquisitions included, fees increased 68% in 1996.
  
Unit Investment Trust:
  
     We are the second largest provider of trustee services for unit investment
trusts, which are passive securities portfolios created by broker/dealer
sponsors.  Our role as trustee is to provide portfolio custody, accounting and
administration services as well as transfer agency and unit-holder relations
services.
  
     In March 1996 we acquired 580 unit investment trusts sponsored by Everen
Securities, Inc.  Overall, at year end we were trustee for approximately 4,500
trusts with assets of over $32 billion.  Fees rose 9% in 1996.
  
Mutual Funds Custody:
  
     We are one of the largest custodians for mutual fund management companies,
providing domestic and global custody, portfolio accounting and pricing, and
fund administration services.  In total, we act as custodian for well over 
1,000 mutual funds for 83 management companies.  We have an office in Dublin,
Ireland for servicing non-U.S. registered mutual funds which are sold to 
non-U.S. citizens.  We also provide our stock transfer service for closed end 
mutual funds.
  
     During 1996 we achieved 11 new fund manager appointments and increased
the number of portfolios by 279.  Total assets under custody rose 18% to
$531 billion at year end.  Fees increased 23% in 1996.
  

OTHER PROCESSING
  
     Our other processing products serve financial institutions and 
corporations around the world as well as middle market companies and small 
businesses located in the greater New York metropolitan area.  
  
Funds Transfer:
  
     This service involves the electronic payment of U.S. dollars within the 
U.S. and around the world on behalf of our customers for the settlement of
financial transactions.  On an average day we clear over 80,000 transactions
with a dollar volume of $300 billion for domestic and foreign financial
institutions, corporations and individuals.  Primarily an international 
business, we interface with financial institutions throughout the world, 
including our network of over 2,300 correspondent banks.  
  
     Our level of activity among U.S. commercial banks has risen steadily over 
the past several years.  We have become a leading funds transfer bank in the
United States.  Fees increased 15% in 1996.
  
Trade Services:
  
     The Bank provides a broad range of trade services for financial 
institutions and corporations through its global network of branches and 
representative offices.  Our major product is letters of credit, which 
expedite payment for customers' imports and exports.  Asia, Latin America, 
the Middle East and Europe are our primary foreign markets and are serviced 
through ten processing centers around the world.
  
     Traditionally, our involvement in trade finance transactions has been with
U.S. imports and exports.  We now act as an intermediary for correspondents
in non-U.S. trade with over 40% of our 1996 revenues coming from trade
transactions between foreign countries.
  
     Fees were down slightly in 1996 due to market conditions.  We expect
improving conditions will lead to a rebound in fees in 1997.

<PAGE> 45

Cash Management:
  
     We offer a full range of cash management services to corporate and
institutional customers, primarily located in the United States.  This business 
includes the receipt and disbursement of cash along with sophisticated 
reporting.  The Bank's position is particularly strong among middle market 
companies and small businesses in the greater New York metropolitan area, 
financial institutions of all types and large corporations for which we serve 
as a lead bank.
  
     We have seen strong growth in electronic payment and information 
reporting.  In 1996 we launched a series of new products employing the most
sophisticated technology available in the market today.  The Bank of New
York Office Manager (registered trademark) is a Windows (registered trademark) 
based family of services providing the customer with integrated access to the 
Bank's electronic payment, information reporting, and check imaging services.  
This product has proven to be highly popular.  We also enhanced our electronic 
data interchange capabilities and developed a PC-based remote banking product 
designed to meet the needs of small businesses.  Revenues increased 8% for the 
year.


                      TRUST, INVESTMENT AND PRIVATE BANKING
  
     The Bank of New York has provided private banking services since it was
founded.  Today, we offer individuals and institutions a broad range of
investment management, custody, estate and financial planning, trust and
estate settlement, and income tax preparation services, provided through
offices in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Florida.   We work with
some of the nation's largest corporations to manage liquidity and with their
senior executives to manage their personal financial situations. 
  
     We are among the largest bank managers of discretionary assets in the 
nation.  Total assets under management grew by 17% during 1996 and now exceed
$54 billion, the result of a very successful investment strategy, generally
strong stock and bond markets, and an effective new business effort.  
  
     The Bank's Private Banking, International Private Banking, Personal Trust
and Personal Asset Management divisions provide high net worth individuals
in the U.S. and around the world with a full range of services in banking,
investment management, trust and estate, and personal financial planning. 
We have also developed a family of customized mortgage products for these
clients.
  
     A key strategy is the interaction within the Bank to leverage existing
relationships with other areas.  For instance, we have private banking groups
that address the needs of executives of corporations we serve in our Special
Industries and U.S. Corporate Banking areas. 
  
     Our Tax-Exempt Bond Management service assists individuals and
corporations in maximizing after-tax returns on their municipal bond
portfolios.  This service is delivered by a dedicated team who combine the
disciplines of municipal bond research, trading and portfolio management to
provide better returns by taking advantage of inefficiencies that exist in the
tax-exempt bond market.  Fees again reached a record level in 1996.
  
     The full range of Institutional Investment services we provide includes 
active management for fixed income, equity and balanced accounts, passive
investment products, commingled funds for ERISA accounts and short-term
money management.  Our customers include corporations, public funds, 
Taft-Hartley clients, foundations and endowments and other domestic and
international institutions.  A highlight in 1996 was the outstanding
performance of the Bank's Collective Trust Emerging Growth Fund which
returned over 30%.  
  
     Our Short-Term Money Management service provides institutional clients
with a liquidity management vehicle that maximizes returns on short-term
funds on a cost effective basis.  We customize this product to meet each
client's specific needs.  Fees from this service rose 30% in 1996.  Overall, 
fees from our trust, investment and private banking activities were up a 
strong 18%.

                              CORPORATE BANKING
  
     The Bank of New York serves the global banking needs of domestic and
multinational corporations and institutions.  We focus on lending relationships
with companies where we can position ourselves as a lead bank.  Our
leadership position in securities and other processing provides a unique niche
enabling us to meet our corporate customers' securities processing, cash
management, trade finance, foreign exchange, and other banking and
transactional needs.
  

CORPORATE BANKING TARGETS THESE MARKET SEGMENTS
  
Special Industries Banking:
  
     The Bank of New York is a leading provider of credit and operating 
services to the following industries.
  
- -Media and entertainment
- -Telecommunications
- -Securities
- -Energy and public utilities
- -Financial institutions
- -Insurance
- -Marine transportation
- -Real estate
- -Retailing
- -Mortgage banking
- -Government banking 
     
     We bring a depth of experience and expertise to these industries that 
provides added value for our clients. 
  
     We are a primary lender, arranger and syndicator of bank loans to the 
rapidly expanding media, entertainment and telecommunications industries.  
Here, we experienced our highest volume ever in 1996, underwriting 29 credits 
as agent totaling $24.5 billion.  We currently act as agent or co-agent in 
these areas on 92 transactions aggregating $100 billion.  Our energy division 
also performed well with average loan increasing by 15%.  Overall, Special
Industries average loan volume grew a strong 9%.
  
U.S. Commercial Banking:
  
     This area remains a key strategic focus of the Bank as we pursue a 
targeted marketing effort to the nation's largest corporations, primarily 
located in nine major urban markets.  Credit is an important part of our 
efforts here and did well in 1996 with average loan volume expanding by 8%.  
Importantly, these corporations are major existing and future users of all of 
our securities processing, funds transfer, trade finance, foreign exchange, and 
cash management services.  The establishment of broad ranging and integrated
relationships with this pool of customers is essential to our continued 
overall success.
  
Middle Market Banking:
  
     We offer middle market customers throughout the New York metropolitan
area, Connecticut and New Jersey a broad range of sophisticated banking
services including traditional lending, asset-based finance, cash management,
securities processing, trade finance, leasing and investment banking.  Average

foreign correspondent banks.   This international franchise provides us with a
marketing platform for all our processing businesses including American
Depositary Receipts, global custody, funds transfer, trade finance, foreign
exchange and securities lending.  We continue to benefit from the increased
globalization of the capital markets and are well positioned for a continuation
of this trend.
  
<PAGE> 47

Factoring:
  
     BNY Financial Corporation is the second largest factor in the U.S. and 
the largest in Canada.  In addition to factoring, we provide accounts
receivable management and secured lending services.  Major customer
diversification has been accomplished in this business in recent years.  The
apparel industry, historically two-thirds of our volume, today accounts for
43% as a result of our diversifying into other industries.  Operating from
offices in New York, Boston, Atlanta, Charlotte, Los Angeles, Toronto and
Montreal we have achieved a geographic diversification in our client base as
well.  In March 1996 we acquired the factoring business of Midlantic Bank. 
Factoring volume was $11.2 billion in 1996, similar to the volume in 1995. 
Earnings from this operation continued the strong growth trend of the last
several years, rising 12%.
  
Asset Based Lending:
  
     The Bank of New York Commercial Corporation provides secured lending to
mid-size companies.  Our customers include retailers, distributors,
manufacturers and service companies.  Net income in 1996 was down
slightly.
  
Capital Markets:
  
     BNY Capital Markets, Inc., established in 1996 under Section 20 of the
Glass-Steagall Act, provides a wide array of financial services to corporate
clients.  Services include the structuring and syndication of credit
facilities, private placement of debt and equity securities, merger, 
acquisition and restructuring advisory services, fairness opinions and 
valuations.  In 1996 we ranked seventh among major banks in acting as agent 
or co-agent on credit facilities.  We currently act as administrative agent 
on 182 broadly syndicated loans, of which 24 were new appointments in 1996.
  
     In addition, the company has a Municipal Securities Group which 
specializes in underwriting and dealing in investment grade tax-exempt 
securities for both high net worth individuals and institutional investors.


                                RETAIL BANKING
  
     The Bank of New York is the leading retail bank in the suburban New York
area and is a source of stable deposits for the Bank as a whole.  Through our
extensive branch network we offer a broad range of products and services for
consumers and small businesses.  
  
     Our branch network comprises 375 offices serving 25 counties of New York,
New Jersey and Connecticut.
  
     In 1996 the strongest segment of our consumer loan portfolio was 
EquityLink, the Bank's home equity credit line.  As a result of the highly 
successful promotion of our Prime for Life pricing, sales of this product 
increased sharply.  This special pricing continues in 1997.  Approximately 40% 
of our personal checking households now take advantage of our Priority Value
Banking service which, by linking accounts, enables them to receive our most
favorable loan and savings rates and offset account service charges.
  
     We continue to streamline our lending process for small businesses and 
offer credit approvals on most applications in under three days.  We have 
increased our direct marketing efforts to small businesses both through the 
branch system and a small business telephone sales unit.
  
     In an effort to reach as many customers and prospects as possible and to
provide the convenient banking that consumers demand we will establish two
new alternative service delivery methods.  Our first full service branches 
located in supermarkets will open in the second quarter of 1997 with more in 
the near future.  In 1997 we will introduce Direct 24 PC banking enabling 
consumers and small businesses to access account information, transfer balances 
and pay bills through their personal computers.  The Bank's 24 hour telephone 
service will also provide the ability to pay bills by telephone.  
  
     In 1996 our Personal Investment Centers had increased sales volume of over

<PAGE> 48

50%, and the service was expanded into Connecticut.  Each center is staffed
with licensed investment representatives and offers a wide variety of mutual
funds as well as fixed rate and variable rate annuities.  Among their product
offerings are our own BNY Hamilton Funds. 
  
     BNY Mortgage Company provides financing for one to four family homes,
condominiums and cooperative apartments through ten loan production
offices in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.  The company offers a
broad range of programs serving all market segments from the first time home
buyer to the large mortgage borrower.  We are the leading originator of New
York State-backed loans for first-time home buyers and we provide other
affordable lending products to meet housing finance needs within the New
York metropolitan region.
  

                                 CREDIT CARDS
  
     The Bank of New York (Delaware) services over 4.5 million credit card
accounts with managed credit card receivables outstanding of $5.4 billion at 
the end of 1996.
  
     These balances were down from a year ago as in June the contract we had 
to issue and manage the AFL-CIO Union Privilege Card was terminated and the
portfolio was sold.  We received a gain of $400 million from the sale.
  
     At the same time we established a loan loss reserve of $350 million as a
conservative measure to offset the rising delinquencies and charge-offs in the
remaining portfolio.
  
     We continue to be pleased with the growth of our highly successful 
co-branded cards issued in partnership with Toys-R-Us (registered trademark) 
and Stop & Shop (registered trademark).  The Toy-R-Us Visa (registered 
trademark) card is a no annual fee credit card that rewards customers with free 
toys and free clothes.  Customers can also earn points toward discounted 
cruises, airline tickets and hotel stays.  The Stop & Shop (registered 
trademark) SupeRewards Master Card (registered trademark), with no annual fee, 
was the first credit card issued by a leading supermarket chain enabling

and Asia.  Revenues rose 36% in 1996.
  
     In February we signed an agreement with Susquehanna Partners to provide a
variety of foreign exchange risk management products allowing us to offer a 
multi-disciplinary approach to currency risk management.  We  provide a full
range of hedging and yield-enhancement strategies tailored to the needs of
clients.  In 1997 we expanded the agreement to include interest rate hedging
products to help corporate treasurers and investment managers control and
reduce their exposure to interest rate risk.  These products can be transacted
in U.S. dollars as well as selected foreign currencies.  
  
     Through BNY Overlay Associates we offer an effective hedging tool 
assisting internationally-diversified portfolio managers in identifying and 
managing currency risk as a separate asset class.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Bank of
New York Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31,
1995, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period
then ended.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Bank
of New York Company, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in
the period then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
