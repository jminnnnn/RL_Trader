PART I
- ------
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
- -----------------

     The business of The Bank of New York Company, Inc. (the "Company") and
its subsidiaries is described in the "Business Review" section of the
Company's 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders which description is included in
Exhibit 13 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.  Also, the
"Management's Discussion and Analysis" section included in Exhibit 13
contains financial and statistical information on the operations of the
Company.  Such information is herein incorporated by reference.

COMPETITION

     The retail and commercial businesses in which the Company operates are
strongly competitive.  Competition is provided by both unregulated and
regulated financial services organizations, whose products and services span
the local, national, and global markets in which the Company conducts
operations.

     Savings banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions actively
compete for deposits, and money market funds and brokerage houses offer
deposit-like services.  These institutions, as well as consumer and
commercial finance companies, national retail chains, factors, insurance
companies and pension trusts, are important competitors for various types of
loans.  Issuers of commercial paper compete actively for funds and reduce
demand for bank loans.  For personal and corporate trust services and
investment counseling services, insurance companies, investment counseling
firms, and other business firms and individuals offer active competition.

CERTAIN REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

General

     As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to the regulation and
supervision of the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act
("BHC Act").  The Company is also subject to regulation by the New York State
Department of Banking.  Under the BHC Act, bank holding companies may not
directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of
the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company,
including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. 
In addition, bank holding companies are generally prohibited under the BHC
Act from engaging in nonbanking activities, subject to certain exceptions.

     The Company's subsidiary banks are subject to supervision and
examination by applicable federal and state banking agencies.  The Bank of
New York ("BNY") is a state-chartered New York banking corporation and a
member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to regulation and
supervision principally by the Federal Reserve Board.  The Bank of New York
(Delaware) ("BNY Del.") is a Delaware chartered FDIC insured non-member bank
and therefore is subject to regulation and supervision principally by the
FDIC.  The Bank of New York National Association ("BNYNA") is organized as a
national association under the laws of the United States and therefore is
subject to regulation and supervision principally by the Comptroller of the
Currency ("Comptroller").

Capital Adequacy

     Bank regulators have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for bank
holding companies and banks.  The minimum ratio of qualifying total capital
to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items) is 8%. 
At least half of the total capital is to be comprised of common stock,
retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stocks, minority
interests and for bank holding companies, a limited amount of qualifying
cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less certain intangibles including
goodwill ("Tier I capital").  The remainder ("Tier II capital") may consist
of other preferred stock, certain other instruments, and limited amounts of
subordinated debt and the loan and lease loss allowance.

     In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum Leverage
Ratio (Tier I capital to average total assets) guidelines for bank holding
companies and banks.  These guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio
of 3% for bank holding companies and banks that meet certain specified
criteria, including that they have the highest regulatory rating.  All other
banking organizations will be required to maintain a leverage ratio of 3%
plus an additional cushion of at least 100 to 200 basis points.  The
guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal
growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital
positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without
significant reliance on intangible assets.  Furthermore, the guidelines
indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will continue to consider a "Tangible
Tier I Leverage Ratio" in evaluating proposals for expansion or new
activities.  The Tangible Tier I Leverage Ratio is the ratio of Tier I
capital, less intangibles not deducted from Tier I capital, to average total
assets.  The Federal Reserve Board has not advised the Company of any
specific minimum leverage ratio applicable to it.

     Federal banking agencies have proposed regulations that would modify
existing rules related to risk-based and leverage capital ratios.  The
Company does not believe that the aggregate impact of these modifications
would have a significant impact on its capital position.

     Bank regulators continue to indicate their desire to raise capital
requirements applicable to banking organizations beyond their current levels. 
However, management is unable to predict whether and when higher capital
requirements would be imposed and, if so, at what level and on what schedule.

FDICIA

     The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
("FDICIA"), which was enacted in December 1991, substantially revised the
depository institution regulatory and funding provisions of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act ("FDIA") and made revisions to several other federal
banking statutes.  Among other things, FDICIA requires the federal banking
regulators to take prompt corrective action in respect of FDIC-insured
depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. 
FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: "well capitalized," "adequately
capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" and
"critically undercapitalized."  Under applicable regulations, an FDIC-insured
bank is defined to be well capitalized if it maintains a Leverage Ratio of at
least 5%, a risk-adjusted Tier I Capital Ratio of at least 6% and a Total
Capital Ratio of at least 10% and is not otherwise in a "troubled condition"
as specified by its appropriate federal regulatory agency.  A bank is
generally considered to be adequately capitalized if it is not defined to be
well capitalized but meets all of its minimum capital requirements, i.e., if
it has a total risk-based Capital Ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier I risk-based
Capital Ratio of 4% or greater and a Leverage Ratio of 4% or greater.  A bank
will be considered undercapitalized if it fails to meet any minimum required
measure, significantly undercapitalized if it is significantly below such
measure and critically undercapitalized if it maintains a level of tangible
equity capital equal to or less than 2% of total assets.  A bank may be
deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by
its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination
rating.

<PAGE> 4.

     FDICIA generally prohibits an FDIC-insured depository institution from
making any capital distribution (including payment of dividends) or paying
any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would
thereafter be undercapitalized.  Undercapitalized depository institutions are
subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System.  In
addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth
limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans.  For an
undercapitalized depository institution's capital restoration plan to be
acceptable, its holding company must guarantee the capital plan up to an
amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution's assets at
the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency
when the institution fails to comply with the plan.  In the event of the
parent holding company's bankruptcy, such guarantee would take priority over
the parent's general unsecured creditors.  The federal banking agencies may
not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the
plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring
the depository institution's capital.  If a depository institution fails to
submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly
undercapitalized.

     Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to
a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell
sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to
reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent
banks.  Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to
appointment of a receiver or conservator.

     The Company's significant banking subsidiaries are well capitalized.

     The table below indicates capital ratios of the Company and its
significant banking subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the
respective guidelines for well capitalized institutions under FDICIA.

     Subsequent to December 31, 1993, the Company redeemed $173 million of
preferred stock and BNY acquired the domestic factoring business of the Bank
of Boston.  After giving pro forma effect to these actions, the Company's and
BNY's captial ratios at December 31, 1993 were as follows:
                                    Company        BNY
                                    -------        ----
Tier 1                               8.33%         7.82%
Total Capital                       13.08         12.41
Leverage                             7.51          6.89
Tangible Common Equity               6.88          7.58

     A discussion of the Company's capital position is incorporated by
reference from the caption "Capital Resources" in the "Management's
Discussion and Analysis" section of Exhibit 13.

Brokered Deposits

     The FDIC has adopted regulations under FDICIA governing the receipt of
brokered deposits.  Under the regulations, a bank cannot accept, rollover or
renew brokered deposits unless (i) it is well capitalized or (ii) it is
adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC.  A bank that
cannot receive brokered deposits also cannot offer "pass-through" insurance
on certain employee benefit accounts.  Whether or not it has obtained such a
waiver, an adequately capitalized bank may not pay an interest rate on any
deposits in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates
specified by regulation.  There are no such restrictions on a bank that is
well capitalized.  Because BNY and BNY Del. are well capitalized, the Company
believes the brokered deposits regulation will have no material effect on the
funding or liquidity of BNY and BNY Del.  BNYNA is well capitalized, but has
no brokered deposits.

FDIC Insurance Assessments

     BNY, BNY Del., and BNYNA are subject to FDIC deposit insurance
assessments.  As required by FDICIA, the FDIC has adopted a risk-based
premium schedule which has increased the assessment rates for most FDIC-
insured depository institutions.  Under the schedule, the premiums initially
range from $.23 to $.31 for every $100 of deposits.  Each financial
institution is assigned to one of three capital groups --- well capitalized,
adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized --- and further assigned to one
of three subgroups within a capital group, on the basis of supervisory
evaluations by the institution's primary federal and, if applicable, state
supervisors and other information relevant to the institution's financial
condition and the risk posed to the applicable insurance fund.  The actual
assessment rate applicable to a particular institution will, therefore,
depend in part upon the risk assessment classification so assigned to the
institution by the FDIC.

     The FDIC is authorized to raise insurance premiums in certain
circumstances.  Any increase in premiums would have an adverse effect on the
Company's earnings.

     Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon
a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices,
is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated
any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a bank's
federal regulatory agency.

Depositor Preference

     The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 provides for a national
depositor preference on amounts realized from the liquidation or other
resolution of any depository institution insured by the FDIC.  That act
requires claims to be paid in the following order of priority: the receiver's
administrative expenses; deposits; other general or senior liabilities of the
institution; obligations subordinated to depositors or general creditors; and
obligations to shareholders.  Under an FDIC interim rule, which became
effective August 13, 1993, "administrative expenses of the receiver" are
defined as those incurred by the receiver in liquidating or resolving the
affairs of a failed insured depository institution.  

<PAGE> 7.

Acquisitions

     The BHC Act generally limits acquisitions by the Company to commercial
banks and companies engaged in activities that the Federal Reserve Board has
determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident
thereto.  The Company's direct activities are generally limited to furnishing
to its subsidiaries services that qualify under the "closely related" and
"proper incident" tests.  Prior Federal Reserve Board approval is required
under the BHC Act for new activities and acquisitions of most nonbanking
companies.

     The BHC Act, the Federal Bank Merger Act, and the New York Banking Law
regulate the acquisition of commercial banks.  The BHC Act requires the prior
approval of the Federal Reserve Board for the direct or indirect acquisition
of more than 5% of the voting shares of a commercial bank.  The BHC Act
generally prohibits the acquisition of a domestic bank located outside the
Company's state of principal operations, New York State, unless authorized by
the law of the state of the target bank.  Most states have enacted interstate
banking laws that permit the Company to acquire banks located in their
states, but some states (particularly in the Southeast) presently do not
permit entry by New York bank holding companies.  The New York Banking Law
requires state regulatory approval before the Company can acquire more than
5% of the voting shares of a commercial bank in New York.

     The merger of BNY with another bank would require the approval of the
Federal Reserve Board or other federal bank regulatory authority and, if the
surviving bank is a state bank, the New York Superintendent of Banks.  With
respect to BNYNA, the approval of the Comptroller is required for branching
of national banks, purchasing the assets of other banks and for bank mergers
in which the continuing bank is a national bank.

     In reviewing bank acquisition and merger applications, the bank
regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive
effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the
combined organization, and the applicant's record under the Community
Reinvestment Act.

     Under Federal Reserve Board policy, the Company is expected to act as a
source of financial strength to its banks and to commit resources to support
such banks in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy.  In
addition, any loans by the Company to its banks would be subordinate in right
of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of its banks.

Regulated Banking Subsidiaries

     As a New York State chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve
System, BNY is subject to the supervision of, and is regularly examined by,
the New York State Banking Department and the Federal Reserve Board.  As a
bank insured by the FDIC, BNY is also subject to examination by that agency. 
BNY Del. is subject to the supervision of, and is regularly examined by, the
FDIC and the Office of State Bank Commissioner of the State of Delaware. 
BNYNA is a national bank subject to the regulation and supervision of, and
regular examination by, the Comptroller and subject to regulations of the
FDIC and Federal Reserve Board.

     Both federal and state laws extensively regulate various aspects of the
banking business, such as permissible types and amounts of loans and
investments, permissible activities, and reserve requirements.  These
regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather
than the Company's stockholders.

Restrictions on Transfer of Funds

     Restrictions on the transfer of funds to the Company are discussed in
Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Exhibit 13. 
Such discussion is incorporated herein by reference.

<PAGE> 8.

FIRREA

     A depository institution insured by the FDIC can be held liable for any
loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in
connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled institution or (ii)
any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled, FDIC-insured
depository institution in danger of default.  "Default" is defined generally
as the appointment of a conservator or receiver, and "in danger of default"
is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that
a "default" is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.

GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICIES

     The Federal Reserve Board has the primary responsibility for monetary
policy; accordingly, its actions have an important influence on the demand
for credit and investments and the level of interest rates.

Interest-Rate Sensitivity
- -------------------------

     The Company actively manages interest-rate sensitivity (the exposure of
net interest income to interest rate movements).  The relationship of
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities between repricing
dates is monitored, and is flexible enough to capitalize on profit
opportunities, while minimizing adverse effects on earnings when changes in
short-term and long-term interest rates occur.  The Company uses complex
simulation models to adjust the structure of its assets and liabilities in
response to interest rate changes.
     The following table reflects the year-end position of the Company's
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that either reprice
or mature within the designated time periods.  A positive interest
sensitivity gap, for a particular time period, is one in which more interest-
earning assets reprice or mature than interest-bearing liabilities.  A
negative interest sensitivity gap results from a greater amount of
liabilities repricing or maturing.  Further, within the time periods shown
below, assets and liabilities reprice on different dates and at different
levels.  Interest sensitivity gaps change daily.  A negative gap will result
in an increase in net interest income in periods of declining rates and a
decrease in net interest income in periods of rising rates.  The opposite is
true for positive gaps.

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES
- ---------------------------------------

     Risk factors other than less developed country (LDC) loans and highly
leveraged transaction (HLT) loans are discussed below.  LDC and HLT loans are
discussed under the captions "Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses" and
"Highly Leveraged Transactions" in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis"
section included in Exhibit 13, which discussion is incorporated herein by
reference.

     At December 31, 1993, the domestic commercial real estate portfolio had
approximately 74% of its loans in New York and New Jersey, 6% in California,
5% in Pennsylvania, 3% in New England, and 2% in Florida; no other state
accounts for more than 2% of the portfolio.  This portfolio consists of the
following types of properties:

                         Business loans secured by real estate      47%
                         Offices                                    24

                                                                  ----
                                                                   100%
                                                                  ====

     At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the Company's nonperforming real estate
loans and real estate acquired in satisfaction of loans aggregated $171
million and $411 million, respectively.  Net charge-offs of real estate loans
were $69 million in 1993 and $90 million in 1992.  In addition, other real
estate charges were $53 million and $106 million in 1993 and 1992.  A
discussion of other real estate charges under "Noninterest Expense and Income
Taxes" in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis" section included in
Exhibit 13 is incorporated herein by reference.

     The Company's consumer loan portfolio is comprised principally of credit
card, other installment, and residential loans.  Residential and auto loans
are collateralized, thereby reducing the risk.  Credit card net charge-offs
were $121 million in 1993 compared to $118 million in 1992.  The 1993 and
1992 amounts exclude $56 million and $57 million in net charge-offs related
to the portion of the portfolio that is securitized.  As a percentage of
average credit card outstandings, net charge-offs decreased to 2.88% in 1993
from 3.74% in 1992.  On a managed receivables basis, net charge-offs as a
percentage of average outstandings were 3.19% in 1993 compared to 3.89% in
1992.  Other consumer net charge-offs were $23 million in 1993 and $37
million in 1992.

     Lending to the utility industry is concentrated in investor-owned
electric utilities.  The Company also makes loans to gas and telephone
utilities.  Nonperforming loans in this industry amounted to $2 million at
year-end 1993 compared to $3 million in 1992.  Charge-offs of loans to the
utility industry were $14 million in 1992.  There were no charge-offs in
1993.

<PAGE> 14.

     The Company's loans to the communications, entertainment, and publishing
industries primarily consist of credits with cable television operators,
broadcasters, magazine and newspaper publishers and motion picture theaters. 
There were no nonperforming communications loans at December 31, 1993. 
Nonperforming communication loans amounted to $8 million at December 31,
1992.  Charge-offs of communications loans were $1 million and $23 million in
1993 and 1992.  None of these amounts represent HLTs.

     The Company's portfolio of loans for purchasing or carrying securities
is comprised largely of overnight loans which are fully collateralized, with
appropriate margins, by marketable securities.  Throughout its many years of
experience in this area, the Company has rarely experienced a loss.

     The Company makes short-term, collateralized loans to mortgage bankers
to fund mortgages sold to investors.  Nonperforming loans and charge-offs
have not been significant.

     Based on an evaluation of individual credits, historical loan losses,
and global economic factors, the Company has allocated its allowance for loan
losses as follows:

     Such an allocation is inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance
for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses regardless of the nature
of the loan.

                                                             Exhibit 10(g)

<PAGE> 1.
                 1994 MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
                   OF THE BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY, INC.
  
  
          1.  Purpose.  The purpose of the 1994 Management
  Incentive Compensation Plan of The Bank of New York Company,
  Inc. (the "Plan") is to promote the financial interests of
  The Bank of New York Company, Inc. (the "Company") and its
  subsidiaries, including its growth, by (i) attracting and
  retaining officers and key personnel possessing outstanding
  ability; (ii) motivating officers and key personnel by means
  of performance-related incentives; and (iii) providing
  incentive compensation opportunities which are competitive
    with those of other major banking companies.
          2.  Definitions.  The following definitions are
    applicable to the Plan:
          "Average Shareholders' Equity" means the average of
       the daily amounts of shareholders' equity during the
       Plan Year as shown on the Company's consolidated balance
         sheet.
          "Board of Directors" means the Board of Directors
         of the Company.
          "Compensation Committee" means the Compensation
         Committee of the Board of Directors.
          "Covered Employee" means, for any Plan Year, the
       Company's Chief Executive Officer (or an individual
       acting in such capacity) and any employee of the Company
       or its subsidiaries who, in the discretion of the

<PAGE> 2

       Committee for purposes of determining those employees
       who are "covered employees" under Section 162(m) of the
       Internal Revenue Code, is likely to be among the four
       other highest compensated officers of the Company for
         such Plan Year.
          "Incentive Fund" means the amount available for
       awards under the Plan with respect to each Plan Year. 
       Such amount shall in no event, however, exceed 10% of
       the amount by which Income exceeds 7% of the Average
         Shareholders' Equity for the Plan Year.
          "Income" for any year means the consolidated net
       income of the Company for such year, as reported to
       shareholders.  This amount shall be adjusted to exclude
       to the extent, if any, determined by the Compensation
       Committee, unusual or non-recurring items of income and
         expense.
          "Participant" means an employee of the Company or
       its subsidiaries who is selected to participate in the
         Plan.
            "Plan Year" means the calendar year.
          3.  Administration.  The Plan shall be administered
  by the Compensation Committee, which shall in no event have
  as a member a person entitled to an award under the Plan.  A
  majority of the Compensation Committee shall constitute a
  quorum, and the acts of a majority of the members present, or
  acts approved in writing by a majority of the Compensation

<PAGE> 3

  Committee without a meeting, shall be the acts of the
    Compensation Committee.
          Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the
    Compensation Committee shall have authority to:
            (i)  select the Participants;
         (ii)  determine the size of the awards to be made
         under the Plan, subject to Section 5 hereof; and
        (iii)  establish from time to time regulations for
       the administration of the Plan, interpret the Plan, and
       make all determinations deemed necessary or advisable
         for the administration of the Plan.
          4.  Participation.  Participants in the Plan shall
  be selected for each Plan Year from those employees of the
  Company and its subsidiaries who have contributed, or have
  the capacity for contributing, in a substantial measure to
  the successful performance of the Company for that Plan Year. 
  No director who is not an employee of the Company or any of
  its subsidiaries may be a Participant in the Plan.  No
  employee shall at any time have a right to be selected as a
  Participant in the Plan for any Plan Year, to be entitled
  automatically to an award, nor, having been selected as a
  Participant for one Plan Year, to be a Participant in any
    other Plan Year.
          5.  Maximum Amount Available for Awards.  The
  maximum amount which may be paid as awards for any Plan Year
  shall be limited to the amount of the Incentive Fund for that

<PAGE> 4

  year.  If the accounting rules or principles to which the
  Company is subject are changed, or if the Company elects to
  change its method of accounting, after the effective date of
  the Plan so as to materially change, in the judgment of the
  Compensation Committee, the manner in which Income is
  determined, the Compensation Committee may make such
  adjustments as it deems advisable in order to arrive at
  substantially the same amounts as would have been derived if
  the accounting rules, principles or methods applicable on the
  effective date of the Plan were in effect.  The amount of the
  Incentive Fund shall be computed by the Company in accordance
    with the Plan.
          6.  Determination of Awards.  Subject to the
  provisions of Section 5 hereof, (i) the Compensation
  Committee, with the approval of the Board of Directors, shall
  determine the total amount of awards for each Plan Year, and
  (ii) the Compensation Committee shall determine the award for
  each Participant, taking into consideration, as it deems
  appropriate, the individual performance for the Plan Year of
    the Participant.
          7.  Awards to Covered Employees.  Notwithstanding
  anything contained herein to the contrary, the award for any
  Plan Year to a Participant who is a Covered Employee may be
  determined on the basis of (A) the achievement by the Company
  of a specified target earnings per share, return on equity or
  net income, (B) the achievement by a business unit of the

<PAGE> 5

  Company of a specified target net income or market share, or
  (C) any combination of the goals set forth in (A) and (B)
  above.  If an award is made on such basis, the Compensation
  Committee shall establish such goals prior to the beginning
  of the Plan Year (or such later date as may be prescribed by
  the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of Section 162(m)
  of the Internal Revenue Code).  The Compensation Committee
  may, in its discretion, reduce or eliminate an award to a
  Covered Employee, notwithstanding the achievement of a
  specified target.  Awards to each Covered Employee for each
  Plan Year will be limited to a maximum of 200% of the Covered
  Employee's annual salary at the rate in effect on the first
  day of such Plan Year.  An award for a Plan Year to a
  Participant who is a Covered Employee may, in the discretion
  of the Compensation Committee, provide that in the event of
  the Participant's termination of employment during the Plan
  Year for any reason, such award will be payable only (A) if
  the applicable target is achieved and (B) to the extent, if
  any, as the Compensation Committee shall determine.  Any
  award paid with respect to a Plan Year under this Section
  shall not be subject to the provisions of Section 5, 6 or 9
  hereof, but shall reduce the amount of the Incentive Fund for
    such Plan Year.
          8.  Payment of Awards.  Awards under the Plan shall
    be paid in cash within 90 days of the close of the Plan Year.

<PAGE> 6

          9.  Termination of Employment.  A Participant shall
  not be entitled to receive payment of an award, unless the
  Compensation Committee determines otherwise, if at any time
  prior to payment of the award (i) the Participant's
  employment terminates for any reason, including retirement,
  or (ii) the Participant gives or receives notice of
    termination for any reason, including retirement.
          10.  No Assignments and Transfers.  A Participant
  shall not assign, encumber or transfer his rights and
  interests under the Plan and any attempt to do so shall
    render those rights and interests null and void.
          11.  No Rights to Awards or Employment.  No
  employee of the Company or its subsidiaries or other person
  shall have any claim or right to be granted an award under
  this Plan.  Neither the Plan nor any action taken thereunder
  shall be construed as giving any employee any right to be
    retained in the employ of the Company or its subsidiaries.
          12.  Withholding Tax.  The Company shall deduct
  from all amounts paid any taxes required by law to be
    withheld with respect to such payments.
          13.  Amendment or Termination.  The Board of
  Directors may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any
    portion thereof at any time.
          14.  Effective Date.  The Plan shall be effective
    as of January 1, 1994.

<PAGE> 7

          15.  Term.  Subject to earlier termination pursuant
  to the provisions of Section 13, the Plan shall have a term
    of ten years from its effective date.

<PAGE> 1.

                        AMENDMENT TO
             THE BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY, INC.
           SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN


          WHEREAS, The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "Plan") was
adopted by the Board of Directors of The Bank of New York
Company, Inc., effective as of June 9, 1992; and
          WHEREAS, Section 9 of the Plan provides that the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may amend
the Plan at any time, except in certain respects not material
hereto; and
          WHEREAS, the Compensation Committee desires to
amend the Plan;
          NOW, THEREFORE, the Plan is hereby amended in the
following respects, effective as of March 9, 1993:
          1.  Section 4 of the Plan is amended by deleting
the second sentence thereof and substituting therefor the
following:
     A Participant listed on Exhibit A whose employment
     terminates prior to attaining age 60, other than by
     reason of death, shall also be entitled to a Benefit
     under the Plan.  Any other Participant whose employment
     terminates prior to attaining age 60, other than by
     reason of death, shall not be entitled to a Benefit
     under the Plan except as determined by the Committee in
     its discretion.

          2.  Section 5(b) of the Plan is amended by the
deletion of the first sentence thereof and the substitution
therefor of the following:
     The Benefit payable under the Plan to a Participant
     listed on Exhibit A whose employment terminates prior to

<PAGE> 2.
     attaining age 60, other than by reason of death, shall
     be equal to the amount of the Benefit provided in
     paragraph (a) of this Section, subject to reduction (if
     any) in accordance with the provisions of the Retirement
     Plan for payment as of the first day of the month coin-
     ciding or following the later of the date the Partici-
     pant attains age 55 or the date of the Participant's
     termination of employment.  If the Committee determines
     that any other Participant whose employment terminates
     prior to attaining age 60, other than by reason of
     death, is entitled to a Benefit under the Plan, the
     amount thereof shall be equal to the amount of the
     Benefit provided in paragraph (a) of this Section,
     subject to reduction (if any) in accordance with the
     provisions of the Retirement Plan for payment as of such
     date as determined by the Committee.

          3.  Section 5(c) of the Plan is amended in its
entirety to read as follows:
          (c)  Unless the Committee, in its discretion,
     directs payment in a different form or at a different
     time, payment of a Benefit to a Participant shall be
     made in the form of a lump sum within 30 days after:

               (i)  the Participant's termination of
          employment with the Company, if his employment
          terminates on or after the date he attains age 60,
          other than by reason of death,

              (ii)  the first day of the month coinciding
          with or following the later of the date the
          Participant attains age 55 or the date of the
          Participant's termination of employment, if the
          Participant is listed on Exhibit A and his
          employment terminates prior to attaining age 60,
          other than by reason of death, or

             (iii)  as of such date as determined by the
          Committee, if the Committee determines that a
          Participant who is not listed on Exhibit A and
          whose employment terminates prior to attaining
          age 60, other than by reason of death, is entitled
          to a Benefit under the Plan.

     In the event of the Participant's death while an active
     employee of the Company, payment of a Benefit to a
     Participant's spouse shall, unless the Committee, in its
     discretion, directs payment in a different form or at a

<PAGE> 3.

     different time, be made in a lump sum within 30 days
     after the later of:

               (i)  the date of the Participant's death,

              (ii)  the date on which benefits are payable to
          the Participant's spouse under the Retirement Plan,
          or

             (iii)  the date on which benefits would have
          been payable to the Participant's spouse under the
          Retirement Plan if the service with the Company of
          a Participant who is or has been a member of the
          Irving Plan were taken into account as provided
          under the Retirement Plan.

     Lump sum payments under this paragraph shall be deter-
     mined based on the actuarial assumptions in effect under
     the Retirement Plan immediately prior to the date of
     payment.

          Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
     contrary, in the event of a change of control of the
     Company (as defined below), the Committee may not direct
     payment of a Benefit to a Participant or to a Parti-
     cipant's spouse in a different form or at a different
     time.  For purposes of this Section, a "change of
     control" of the Company shall mean a change in control
     of a nature that would be required to be reported in
     response to Item 1(a) of the Current Report on Form 8-K,
     as in effect on March 9, 1993, pursuant to Sections 13
     or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;
     provided that, without limitation, such change of
     control shall be deemed to have occurred at such time as
     (a) any "person" (within the meaning of Section 14(d) of
     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), other than the
     Company or an employee benefit plan sponsored by the
     Company, acquires more than 25% of combined voting power
     of the outstanding securities of The Bank of New York
     Company, Inc. ordinarily having the right to vote at
     elections of directors, including shares of common stock
     of The Bank of New York Company, Inc.; (b) there is a
     sale or divestiture of all or substantially all of the
     assets of the Company; or (c) during any two-year
     period, individuals who constitute the Board of
     Directors of The Bank of New York Company, Inc. (the
     "Incumbent Board") as of the beginning of the period
     cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority
     thereof, provided that any person becoming a director
     during such period whose election or nomination for
     election by the shareholders of The Bank of New York

<PAGE> 4.

     Company, Inc. was approved by a vote of at least three-
     quarters of the Incumbent Board (either by a specific
     vote or by approval of the proxy statement of The Bank
     of New York Company, Inc. in which such person is named
     as a nominee for director without objection to such
     nomination) shall be, for purposes of this clause (c),
     considered as though such person were a member of the
     Incumbent Board.

          4.  Exhibit A is added to the Plan to read as
follows:
                          Exhibit A

                     Vested Participants

          The following Participants shall be entitled to a
     Benefit under the Plan in the event of their termination
     of employment prior to attaining age 60, other than by
     reason of death:

               Alan R. Griffith
               Samuel F. Chevalier
               Thomas A. Renyi
               Richard D. Field
               Richard A. Pace
               Robert J. Mueller

Inc. has caused this Amendment to be executed by its duly
authorized officers this 9th day of March, 1993.

<PAGE> 1.

                   GRANTOR TRUST AGREEMENT


          THIS AGREEMENT, made as of the  16th day of
November, 1993, by and between THE BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY,
INC., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of
the State of New York (hereinafter referred to as the "Com-
pany"), and UNITED STATES TRUST COMPANY OF NEW YORK, a cor-
poration organized and existing under the laws of the State
of New York (hereinafter referred to as the "Trustee"),
                    W I T N E S S E T H :
          WHEREAS, the Company is obligated under certain
executive compensation plans and agreements, which are listed
on Exhibit I hereto (the "Plans"), to make payment of certain
amounts to current employees of the Company and its sub-
sidiaries (the "Participants") under certain circumstances;
and
          WHEREAS, the Company wishes to provide a separate
source of funds to enable payment of such amounts to certain
Participants who are intended to be covered by this Agreement
(the "Covered Participants"); and
          WHEREAS, the Trustee is not a party to the Plans
and makes no representations with respect thereto, and all
representations and recitals with respect to the Plans shall
be deemed to be those of the Company;
          NOW, THEREFORE, the Company and the Trustee agree
as follows:

<PAGE> 2.
          FIRST:    Definition of Change in Control.  For
purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall be
deemed to occur if (i) a change in control of the Company
would be required to be reported in response to item 1(a) of
the Current Report of Form 8-K, as in effect on the date
hereof, pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act");
(ii) any "person" within the meaning of Section 14(d) of the
Exchange Act (x) becomes the "beneficial owner" as defined in
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, directly or indirectly, of
more than 25% of the then combined voting power of the out-
standing securities of the Company ordinarily having the
right to vote at the election of directors ("Voting Secu-
rities"), otherwise than through a transaction or trans-
actions arranged by, or consummated with the prior approval
of, the Board of Directors of the Company, or (y) acquires by
proxy or otherwise the right to vote for the election of
directors, for any merger or consolidation of the Company or
for any other matter or question more than 35% of the then
outstanding voting securities of the Company, otherwise than
through an arrangement or arrangements consummated with the
prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company; or
(iii) during any two-year period, individuals who constitute
the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Incumbent Board")
as of the beginning of the period cease for any reason to

<PAGE> 3. 

constitute at least a majority thereof, provided that any
person becoming a director during such period whose election
or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was
approved by a vote of at least three-quarters of the Incum-
bent Board (either by a specific vote or by approval of the
proxy statement of the Company in which such person is named
as a nominee for director without objection to such nomina-
tion) shall be, for purposes of this clause (iii), considered
as though such person were a member of the Incumbent Board.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this
Agreement, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge
that a Change in Control has occurred until it has received
written notice thereof from the Company or a Covered
Participant.
          SECOND:   Creation of Trust.  (a)  The Company
hereby establishes with the Trustee and the Trustee hereby
accepts a trust consisting of such cash, Letters of Credit
(as defined herein) or other property acceptable to the
Trustee as shall be paid or delivered to the Trustee from
time to time (hereafter called the "Fund").  The Company may,
in its discretion, deliver to the Trustee one or more
irrevocable letters of credit, which shall be substantially
in the form of Exhibit II hereto (referred to hereinafter as
the "Letters of Credit").  Each Letter of Credit shall name
the Trustee as beneficiary and shall provide that any notices

<PAGE> 4.

to the Trustee thereunder shall be sent to it at the address
specified in Article TENTH.
          (b)  The Trustee shall hold the Fund in trust and
manage and administer it in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement.
          (c)  The trust created herein is intended to be a
Grantor Trust under the provisions of Sections 671 through
677 of the Internal Revenue Code.
          (d)  The Company may, prior to a Change in Control,
revoke the trust by written notice to the Trustee.  Upon such
revocation, the Trustee shall cancel all Letters of Credit,
the trust shall terminate and all assets of the Fund, after
payment of any unpaid fees and expenses of the Trustee, shall
be paid to the Company.
          (e)  After a Change in Control, the trust shall
become irrevocable and shall be held for the exclusive
purpose of providing benefits to Covered Participants in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
          THIRD:  Payments from Fund.  (a)  The Company shall
provide the Trustee with a schedule (the "Payment Schedule")
of Participants, indicating (i) the amount payable to or in
respect of each Covered Participant upon such Covered Par-
ticipant's termination of employment or providing formulae,
or instructions, acceptable to the Trustee, utilizing readily
determinable and objective information, for determining such

<PAGE> 5.

amounts, (ii) the form in which such amount is to be paid (as
provided for or available under the Plans), and (iii) the
time for commencement of such payment.  As appropriate, based
upon the terms of the Plans and the implementation of those
terms by the Company, and at least annually, the Company
shall adjust the amounts payable to or in respect of
Participants, shall add or delete Participants at any time
prior to a Change in Control and, if appropriate, shall
change the formulae or instructions for determining such
amounts (provided such formulae or instructions are
acceptable to the Trustee) by submitting a new or amending
the existing Payment Schedule.  The Company shall provide
promptly to each Covered Participant the information on the
Payment Schedule pertaining to that Covered Participant,
including all changes and adjustments.  In the event of any
change in the Payment Schedule after a Change in Control or
if after a Change in Control the Payment Schedule is not
adjusted or changed at a time when a Covered Participant
believes it should, the Covered Participant affected thereby
shall have the right, if he disagrees with such adjustment or
change or failure to make an adjustment or change, to furnish
information to the Trustee concerning the appropriate amount
payable to the Covered Participant.  The Trustee shall be
obligated to pay from the Fund amounts based upon a Payment
Schedule as adjusted, if applicable, to reflect information

<PAGE> 6.

supplied by the Covered Participant.  After a Change in
Control, no additions to or deletions from the list of
Covered Participants shall be permitted.
          (b)  The Trustee shall create a separate account
(the "Account") in the Fund for each Covered Participant.  At
the time of each contribution to the Fund or establishment
and delivery to the Trustee of a Letter of Credit, the
Company shall designate in writing the allocation among the
Accounts of such contribution and Letter of Credit.  The
Trustee shall hold all Accounts as a consolidated single
fund.  The Fund shall be revalued by the Trustee as of the
last business day of each calendar quarter at current market
values, as determined by the Trustee.  For valuation
purposes, a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to have a fair
market value equal to the remaining amount available for draw
under the Letter of Credit on the last business day of the
applicable calendar quarter.  Net investment gains and losses
shall be allocated by the Trustee proportionately among the
Accounts as of the end of each calendar quarter based on the
value of the Accounts as of the last business day of the
preceding calendar quarter.  The Trustee shall maintain a
record of the value of each Account based on the aggregate
value of the Trust Fund, the information provided by the
Company as to its contributions and its establishment and
delivery of Letters of Credit with respect to each Account

<PAGE> 7.

and any payments therefrom.  To the extent an amount remains
credited to a Covered Participant's Account after the
Company's liability to him under all Plans has been paid in
full, such excess shall, as of the end of the calendar
quarter in which final payment has been made, be reallocated
to the Accounts of all other Covered Participants in
proportion to the amounts credited to the Accounts of such
Covered Participants, unless the Company directs the Trustee,
prior to a Change in Control, to cancel or reduce a Letter of
Credit allocated to the Covered Participant's Account in an
amount equal to such excess.  Notwithstanding the amount
credited to a Covered Participant's Account pursuant to this
paragraph, in no event shall a Covered Participant be
entitled to payment hereunder of more than the Company's
liability to him under the Plans.
          (c)(1)  In the event it shall be determined prior
to a Change In Control that any Covered Participant is sub-
ject to any tax under the terms of the trust created here-
under, then the Trustee, upon receipt of written direction
from the Company, shall make payments from the Fund to such
persons, in such manner and in such amounts as the Company
shall direct, for purposes of paying the amount of federal,
state and local tax and interest and any penalties thereon
which such Covered Participant may incur arising out of such
determination.  In the event such a determination is made

<PAGE> 8.

after a Change In Control occurs, then the Trustee shall make
payments from the Fund to such Covered Participant for the
purposes set forth in the preceding sentence upon notice
thereof from the Covered Participant.
          (2)  Any payment from the Fund pursuant to Sec-
tion (c)(1) of this Article shall be charged to the Accounts
of those Participants to whom (or on whose behalf) such a
distribution is made, under the appropriate Plan or Plans.
          (d)  The Company may, by notice to the Trustee
prior to a Change in Control, direct the Trustee to pay the
Company such amount as is specified in the notice, cancel one
or more Letters of Credit as specified in the notice, or
reduce one or more Letters of Credit by such amount as is
specified in the notice.  In addition, such notice shall set
forth the Account or Accounts which shall be debited with
respect to such payment, cancellation or reduction.  If the
amount which would remain in the Fund after any such payment
would be less than the unpaid fees and expenses of the
Trustee, then the Trustee may deduct such fees and expenses
from the payment that would otherwise be made to the Company.
          (e)  Any direction, designation or notice by the
Company required under this Article shall be in writing.  Any
direction by the Company with respect to a payment from the
Fund shall be accompanied by a certification by the Company
that the payment directed is in conformity with Article

<PAGE> 9.

THIRTEENTH hereof.  The Trustee shall not be liable in any
way for any payment made pursuant to any such direction of
the Company.  In addition, the Trustee shall not be liable in
any way for any payment made based on information supplied to
it by the Company.
          FOURTH:  (a)  Management of Assets of Fund.  Sub-
ject to paragraph (b) of this Article, the Trustee, prior to
a Change In Control, shall have exclusive authority and
discretion to manage and control the assets of the Fund,
other than Letters of Credit, and pursuant to such authority
and discretion may exercise from time to time and at any time
power:
          (i)  To invest and reinvest the Fund, without
     distinction between principal and income, in shares of
     stock (whether common or preferred) or other evidences
     of ownership, bonds, debentures, notes or other
     evidences of indebtedness, unsecured or secured by
     mortgages on real or personal property wherever situated
     (including any part interest in a bond and mortgage or
     note and mortgage whether insured or uninsured) and
     other property, or part interest in property, real or
     personal, foreign or domestic, whether or not productive
     of income or consisting of wasting assets, and in order
     to reduce the rate of interest rate fluctuations,
     contracts, as either buyer or seller, for the future

<PAGE> 10.

     delivery of United States Treasury securities and com-
     parable United States Government-backed securities;
         (ii)  To sell, convey, redeem, exchange, grant
     options for the purchase or exchange of, or otherwise
     dispose of, any real or personal property, at public or
     private sale, for cash or upon credit, with or without
     security, without obligation on the part of any person
     dealing with the Trustee to see to the application of
     the proceeds of or to inquire into the validity,
     expediency or propriety of any such disposition;
        (iii)  To manage, operate, repair and improve, and
     mortgage or lease for any length of time any real prop-
     erty held in the Fund; to renew or extend any mortgage,
     upon any terms the Trustee may deem expedient; to agree
     to reduction of the rate of interest or any other modi-
     fication in the terms of any mortgage or of any guar-
     antee pertaining to it; to enforce any covenant or
     condition of any mortgage or guarantee or to waive any
     default in the performance thereof; to exercise and
     enforce any right of foreclosure; to bid in property on
     foreclosure; to take a deed in lieu of foreclosure with
     or without paying consideration therefor and in connec-
     tion therewith to release the obligation on the bond
     secured by the mortgage; and to exercise and enforce in
     any action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity any

<PAGE> 11.

     rights or remedies in respect of any mortgage or
     guarantee;
         (iv)  To exercise, personally or by general or
     limited proxy, the right to vote any shares of stock,
     bonds or other securities held in the Fund; to delegate
     discretionary voting power to trustees of a voting trust
     for any period of time; and to exercise, personally or
     by power of attorney, any other right appurtenant to any
     securities or other property of the Fund;
          (v)  To join in or oppose any reorganization,
     recapitalization, consolidation, merger or liquidation,
     or any plan therefor, or any lease, mortgage or sale of
     the property of any organization the securities of which
     are held in the Fund; to pay from the Fund any assess-
     ments, charges or compensation specified in any plan of
     reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, merger
     or liquidation; to deposit any property with any
     committee or depositary; and to retain any property
     allotted to the Fund in any reorganization, recapital-
     ization, consolidation, merger or liquidation;
         (vi)  To exercise or sell any conversion or sub-
     scription or other rights appurtenant to any stock,
     security or other property held in the Fund;
        (vii)  To borrow from any lender (other than the
     Trustee in its individual capacity or the Company or any

<PAGE> 12.

     of its affiliates) money, in any amount and upon any
     reasonable terms and conditions, for purposes of this
     Agreement, and to pledge or mortgage any property held
     in the Fund to secure the repayment of any such loan;
        (viii)  To compromise, settle or arbitrate any claim,
     debt, or obligation of or against the Fund; to enforce
     or abstain from enforcing any right, claim, debt or
     obligation; and to abandon any property determined by it
     to be worthless; and
         (ix)  To make loans of securities held in the Fund
     to registered brokers and dealers upon such terms and
     conditions as are permitted by applicable law and regu-
     lations, and in each instance to permit the securities
     so lent to be registered in the name of the borrower or
     a nominee of the borrower, provided that in each
     instance the loan is adequately secured and neither the
     borrower nor any affiliate of the borrower has discre-
     tionary authority or control with respect to the assets
     of the Fund involved in the transaction or renders
     investment advice with respect to those assets.
          (b)  The Company shall deliver to the Trustee each
Letter of Credit established for the Fund as executed by the
bank issuing such credit.  On the last business day of each
month, the Trustee shall draw on the Letters of Credit to the
extent the assets of the Fund are not sufficient to make

<PAGE> 13.

payments required to be made under the Payment Schedule
during the next six months.  Amounts received on the draw of
any Letter of Credit shall reduce the allocation of the
Letter of Credit to those Covered Participants for whom such
Letter of Credit was previously allocated and shall be allo-
cated to the Accounts of such Covered Particiipants as if
such amounts were contributions to the Fund.
          If the Trustee receives written notice prior to the
expiration or cancellation of a Letter of Credit from the
bank which issued such Letter of Credit, referencing the
Letter of Credit by number, signed by an officer of such
bank, and stating that such Letter of Credit is due to expire
and has not been extended, or is being cancelled (other than
a cancellation pursuant to paragraph (d) of Article THIRD),
the Trustee shall draw on such Letter of Credit to the full
extent thereof prior to the expiration of such Letter of
Credit (but in no event earlier than the fifth business day
prior to such expiration) unless, prior to taking such
action, the Trustee has received a replacement Letter of
Credit or cash or other property in at least the remaining
amount available to be drawn under the Letter of Credit which
is due to expire or is being cancelled.
          The Trustee shall have no obligation to earn any
income with respect to any Letters of Credit which are held
by it as part of the Fund.  In the event that the Trustee

<PAGE> 14.

shall resign or be removed, and a successor trustee shall be
appointed hereunder, the rights and obligations of the
Trustee under each Letter of Credit shall automatically
become the rights and obligations of the successor trustee,
and the Trustee shall have no further rights, duties, obli-
gations or liabilities with respect to any Letter of Credit.
          (c)  After a Change In Control occurs and subject
to paragraph (g) of Article SIXTH hereof, the Trustee shall
invest and reinvest the Fund, other than Letters of Credit,
without distinction between principal and income, in direct
obligations of the United States of America or agencies or
instrumentalities thereof, obligations unconditionally and
fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United
States of America, and certificates of deposit and bankers'
acceptances of a bank organized and existing under the laws
of the United States of America or any State thereof which
has a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000,
all having respective maturities of not more than one year
when purchased.
          FIFTH:  Administrative Powers.  The Trustee shall
have and in its sole and absolute discretion may exercise
from time to time and at any time the following administra-
tive powers and authority with respect to the Fund:
          (a)  To continue to hold any property of the Fund
whether or not productive of income; to reserve from

<PAGE> 15.

investment and keep unproductive of income, without liability
for interest, cash temporarily awaiting investment and such
cash as it deems advisable or as the Company from time to
time may specify prior to a Change In Control in order to
meet the administrative expenses of the Fund or anticipated
distributions therefrom.
          (b)  To hold property of the Fund in its own name
or in the name of a nominee or nominees, without disclosure
of the trust, or in bearer form so that it will pass by
delivery, but no such holding shall relieve the Trustee of
its responsibility for the safe custody and disposition of
the Fund in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; 
the Trustee's books and records shall at all times show that
such property is part of the Fund; and the Trustee shall be
absolutely liable for any loss occasioned by the acts of its
nominee or nominees with respect to securities registered in
the name of the nominee or nominees;
          (c)  To organize and incorporate under the laws of
any state it may deem advisable one or more corporations (and
to acquire an interest in any such corporation that it may
have organized and incorporated) for the purpose of acquiring
and holding title to any property, interests or rights that
the Trustee is authorized to acquire under Article FOURTH
hereof;

<PAGE> 16.

          (d)  To employ in the management of the Fund
suitable agents, without liability for any loss occasioned by
any such agents selected by the Trustee with the care, skill,
prudence and diligence under the circumstances then pre-
vailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and
familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an
enterprise of a like character and with like aims;
          (e)  To make, execute and deliver, as Trustee, any
deeds, conveyances, leases, mortgages, contracts, waivers or
other instruments in writing that the Trustee may deem
necessary or desirable in the exercise of its powers under
this Agreement;
          (f)  To hold and draw upon any Letter of Credit in
accordance with paragraph (b) of Article FOURTH; and
          (g)  To do all other acts that the Trustee may deem
necessary or proper to carry out any of the powers set forth
in Articles FOURTH, FIFTH and SIXTH hereof or otherwise in
the best interests of the Fund.
          SIXTH:  Annuity Contracts.  (a)  The Trustee, upon
written direction of the Company prior to a Change In Con-
trol, shall pay from the Fund such sums to such insurance
company or companies as the Company may direct for the pur-
pose of procuring individual or group annuity contracts for
any retirement allowance payable under a Plan (hereinafter in
this Article referred to as "Contracts").  The Company shall

<PAGE> 17.

prepare, or cause to be prepared in such form as it shall
prescribe, the application for any Contract to be applied
for.  The Trustee shall receive and hold in the Fund, subject
to the provisions hereinafter set forth in this Article, all
Contracts so obtained.
          (b)  The Trustee shall be the complete and absolute
owner of Contracts held in the Fund and, upon written direc-
tion of the Company prior to a Change In Control, shall have
power, without the consent of any other person, to exercise
any and all of the rights, options or privileges that belong
to the absolute owner of any Contract held in the Fund or
that are granted by the terms of any such Contract or by the
terms of this Agreement.  The Trustee shall have no discre-
tion with respect to the exercise of any of the foregoing
powers or to take any other action permitted by any Contract
held in the Fund, but shall exercise such powers or take such
action only upon the written direction of the Company prior
to a Change In Control; the Trustee shall have no duty to
exercise any of such powers or to take any such action unless
and until it shall have received such direction.  The
Trustee, upon the written direction of the Company prior to a
Change In Control, shall deliver any Contract held in the
Fund to such person or persons as may be specified in the
direction.

<PAGE> 18.

          (c)  The Trustee shall hold in the Fund the pro-
ceeds of any sale, assignment or surrender of any Contract
held in the Fund and any and all dividends and other payments
of any kind received in respect of any Contract held in the
Fund.
          (d)  Upon the written direction of the Company
prior to a Change In Control, the Trustee shall pay from the
Fund premiums, assessments, dues, charges and interest, if
any, upon any Contract held in the Fund.  After a Change In
Control occurs, the Trustee shall pay from the Fund premiums,
assessments, dues, charges and interest, if any, upon any
Contract held in the Fund, without direction from the
Company.
          (e)  No insurance company that may issue any
Contract or Contracts held in the Fund shall be deemed to be
a party to this Agreement for any purpose, or to be respon-
sible in any way for the validity of this Agreement or to
have any liability under this Agreement other than as stated
in each Contract that it may issue.  Any insurance company
may deal with the Trustee as sole owner of any Contract
issued by it and held in the Fund, without inquiry as to the
authority of the Trustee to act, and may accept and rely upon
any written notice, instruction, direction, certificate or
other communication from the Trustee believed by it to be
genuine and to be signed by an officer of the Trustee and

<PAGE> 19.

shall incur no liability or responsibility for so doing.  Any
sums paid out by any insurance company under any of the terms
of a Contract issued by it and held in the Fund either to the
Trustee, or, in accordance with its direction, to any other
person or persons designated as payees in such Contract shall
be a full and complete discharge of the liability to pay such
sums, and the insurance company shall have no obligation to
look to the disposition of any sums so paid.  No insurance
company shall be required to look into the terms of this
Agreement, to question any action of the Trustee or to see
that any action of the Trustee is authorized by the terms of
this Agreement.
          (f)  Anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be
liable for the refusal of any insurance company to issue or
change any Contract or Contracts or to take any other action
requested by the Trustee; nor for the form, genuineness,
validity, sufficiency or effect of any Contract or Contracts
held in the Fund; nor for the act of any person or persons
that may render any such Contract or Contracts null and void;
nor for the failure of any insurance company to pay the
proceeds and avails of any such Contract or Contracts as and
when the same shall become due and payable; nor for any delay
in payment resulting from any provision contained in any such
Contract or Contracts; nor for the fact that for any reason

<PAGE> 20.

whatsoever (other than their own negligence or willful
misconduct) any Contract or Contracts shall lapse or
otherwise become uncollectible.
          (g)  After a Change In Control occurs, the Trustee
may exercise any of the powers set forth in paragraphs (a)
through (f) of this Article without direction from the Com-
pany, including the power to purchase Contracts the rates of
return and maturity dates of which may reasonably be expected
to yield assets of the Fund sufficient to discharge all or a
portion of the Company's obligations for retirement allow-
ances under the Plans as set forth in the most recent infor-
mation furnished to the Trustee by the Company prior to such
Change In Control.
          SEVENTH:  Taxes, Expenses and Compensation of
Trustee.  (a)  The Company shall pay any federal, state,
local or other taxes imposed or levied with respect to the
corpus and/or income of the Fund or any part thereof under
existing or future laws and, the Company in its discretion,
or the Trustee, in its discretion, may contest the validity
or amount of any tax, assessment, claim or demand respecting
the Fund or any part thereof.
          (b)  The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time
to time such reasonable compensation for its services as
trustee as shall be agreed upon by the Company and the
Trustee.  The Company shall also pay the reasonable and

<PAGE> 21.

necessary expenses incurred by the Trustee in the performance
of its duties under the Agreement, including reasonable fees
of counsel engaged by the Trustee pursuant to paragraph (b)
of Article EIGHTH of this Agreement.  Such compensation and
expenses shall be charged against and paid from the Fund to
the extent not paid by the Company.
          EIGHTH:  General Duties of Trustee.  (a)  The
Trustee shall discharge its duties under this Agreement
solely in the interest of the beneficiaries of the Fund and
(i) for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to such
beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of admini-
stering the Fund; (ii) with the care, skill, prudence and
diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a
prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such
matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like
character and with like aims; and (iii) by diversifying the
investments of the Fund so as to minimize the risk of large
losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent
not to do so.
          (b)  The Trustee may consult with counsel, who may
be counsel for the Company or for the Trustee in its indivi-
dual capacity, and shall not be deemed imprudent by reason of
its taking or refraining from taking any action in accordance
with the opinion of counsel.  The Trustee shall not be
required to give any bond or any other security for the

<PAGE> 22.

faithful performance of its duties under this Agreement,
except as required by law.
          (c)  The Trustee shall be under no duties whatso-
ever, except such duties as are specifically set forth as
such in this Agreement, and no implied covenant or obligation
shall be read into this Agreement against the Trustee.  The
Trustee shall not be compelled to take any action toward the
execution or performance of the trust created hereunder or to
prosecute or defend any suit or claim in respect thereof,
unless indemnified to its satisfaction against loss,
liability, and reasonable costs and expenses. 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event
that the bank issuing a Letter of Credit shall fail or refuse
to pay upon any draw thereunder, the Trustee will not be
obligated to pursue any remedy against such issuing bank
unless it shall have first received from the Company, the
Participants or any of them security or indemnity to its
satisfaction against the costs and expenses (including
attorney's fees) which may be incurred therein or thereby. 
The Trustee shall be under no liability or obligation to
anyone with respect to any failure on the part of the Company
to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement.
          (d)  The Company shall pay and shall protect,
indemnify and save harmless the Trustee and its officers,
directors or trustees, employees and agents from and against

<PAGE> 23.

any and all losses, liabilities (including liabilities for
penalties), actions, suits, judgments, demands, damages,
reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) of any nature
arising from or relating to any action or failure to act by
the Trustee, its officers, directors or trustees, employees
and agents or the transactions contemplated by this Agree-
ment, except to the extent that any such loss, liability,
action, suit, demand, damage, cost or expense is the result
of the negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee, its
officers, directors or trustees, employees or agents.
          NINTH:  Accounts of Trustee.  (a)(i)  The Trustee
shall keep accurate and detailed accounts of all its
receipts, investments and disbursements under this Agreement. 
Such person or persons as the Company shall designate shall
be allowed to inspect the books of account relating to the
Fund upon request at any reasonable time during the business
hours of the Trustee.
         (ii)  Within 120 days after the close of each
calendar year, the Trustee shall transmit to the Company, and
certify the accuracy of, a written statement of the assets
and liabilities of the Fund at the close of that year,
showing the current value of each asset at that date, and a
written account of all the Trustee's transactions relating to
the Fund during the period from the last previous accounting

<PAGE> 24.

to the close of that year.  (For the purposes of this
paragraph, the date of the Trustee's resignation or removal
as provided in Article ELEVENTH hereof shall be deemed to be
the close of a calendar year.)
        (iii)  Unless the Company shall have filed with the
Trustee written exceptions or objections to any such
statement and account within 60 days after receipt thereof,
the Company shall be deemed to have approved such statement
and account; and in such case or upon the written approval by
the Company of any such statement and account, the Trustee
shall be forever released and discharged with respect to all
matters and things embraced in such statement and account as
though it had been settled by decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction in an action or proceeding to which the Company
and all persons having any beneficial interest in the Fund
were parties.
          (b)  Nothing contained in this Agreement or in the
Plans shall deprive the Trustee of the right to have a judi-
cial settlement of its accounts.  In any proceeding for a
judicial settlement the Trustee's accounts or for instruc-
tions in connection with the Fund, the only other necessary
party thereto in addition to the Trustee shall be the
Company.  If the Trustee so elects, it may bring in as a
party or parties defendant any other person or persons.  No
person interested in the Fund, other than the Company, shall

<PAGE> 25.

have a right to compel an accounting, judicial or otherwise,
by the Trustee, and each such person shall be bound by all
accounting by the Trustee to the Company, as herein provided,
as if the account had been settled by decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction in an action or proceeding to which
such person was a party.
          TENTH:  Administration of the Plans; Communica-
tions.  (a)  The Company shall administer the Plans as pro-
vided therein, and subject to paragraph (b) of Article THIRD
hereof or subject to any delegation by the Company and
assumption by the Trustee of the duties of administering the
Plans, the Trustee shall not be responsible in any respect
for administering the Plans nor shall the Trustee be
responsible for the adequacy of the Fund to meet and dis-
charge all payments and liabilities under the Plans.  The
Trustee shall be fully protected in relying upon any written
notice, instruction, direction or other communication signed
by an officer of the Company.  The Company from time to time
shall furnish the Trustee with the names and specimen
signatures of the officers of the Company authorized to act
or give directions hereunder and shall promptly notify the
Trustee of the termination of office of any such officer of
the Company and the appointment of a successor thereto. 
Until notified to the contrary, the Trustee shall be fully

<PAGE> 26.

protected in relying upon the most recent list of the
officers of the Company furnished to it by the Company.
          (b)  Any action required by any provision of this
Agreement to be taken by the Board of Directors of the Com-
pany shall be evidenced by a resolution of the Board of
Directors certified to the Trustee by the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary of the Company under its corporate seal,
and the Trustee shall be fully protected in relying upon any
resolution so certified to it.  Unless other evidence with
respect thereto has been specifically prescribed in this
Agreement, any other action of the Company under any provi-
sion of this Agreement, including any approval of or excep-
tions to the Trustee's accounts, shall be evidenced by a
certificate signed by an officer of the Company, and the
Trustee shall be fully protected in relying upon such
certificate.  The Trustee may accept a certificate signed by
an officer of the Company as proof of any fact or matter that
it deems necessary or desirable to have established in the
administration of the trust (unless other evidence of such
fact or matter is expressly prescribed herein), and the
Trustee shall be fully protected in relying upon the state-
ments in the certificate.
          (c)  The Trustee shall be entitled conclusively to
rely upon any written notice, instruction, direction,
certificate or other communication believed by it to be

<page. 27.

genuine and to be signed by the proper person or persons, and
the Trustee shall be under no duty to make investigation or
inquiry as to the truth or accuracy of any statement con-
tained therein.
          (d)  Until notice be given to the contrary, com-
munications to the Trustee shall be sent to it at its office
at 770 Broadway, New York, New York 10003-9548, Attention: 
Department Manager, Employee Benefits Services; communica-
tions to the Company shall be sent to it at its office at
48 Wall Street, New York, New York 10005, Attention:  General
Counsel.
          ELEVENTH:  Resignation or Removal of Trustee. 
(a)  The Trustee may resign at any time upon 60 days' written
notice to the Company, or upon shorter notice if acceptable
to the Company.  The Company, by action of its Board of
Directors, may remove the Trustee at any time upon 60 days'
written notice to the Trustee, or upon shorter notice if
acceptable to the Trustee.  In the event it resigns or is
removed, the Trustee shall have a right to have its accounts
settled as provided in Article NINTH hereof.
          (b)  Upon the resignation or removal of the
Trustee, the Company, by action of its Board of Directors,
shall appoint a successor trustee which shall be a bank as
defined under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, having a

excess of $2,000,000,000, other than the Company or any
corporation that, directly or through one or more inter-
mediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common
control with the Company, to act hereunder after the effec-
tive date of such removal or resignation.  Each successor
trustee shall have the powers and duties conferred upon the
Trustee in this Agreement, and the term "Trustee" as used in
this Agreement shall be deemed to include any successor
trustee.  Upon designation or appointment of a successor
trustee, the Trustee shall transfer and deliver the Fund to
the successor trustee, reserving such sums as the Trustee
shall deem necessary to defray its expenses in settling its
accounts, to pay any of its compensation due and unpaid and
to discharge any obligation of the Fund for which the Trustee
may be liable.  If the sums so reserved are not sufficient
for these purposes, the Trustee shall be entitled to recover
the amount of any deficiency from either the Company or the
successor trustee, or both.  When the Fund shall have been
transferred and delivered to the successor trustee and the
accounts of the Trustee have been settled as provided in
Article NINTH hereof, the Trustee shall be released and
discharged from all further accountability or liability for
the Fund and shall not be responsible in any way for the
further disposition of the Fund or any part thereof.

          TWELFTH:  Amendment of Agreement.  (a)  Subject to
paragraph (b) of this Article TWELFTH, the Company expressly
reserves the right at any time to amend this Agreement and
the trust created thereby to any extent that it may deem
advisable.  No such amendment shall be made that affects the
duties or responsibilities of the Trustee without its consent
thereto in writing.  Such amendment shall become effective
upon delivery to the Trustee of a written instrument of
amendment, duly executed and acknowledged by the Company and
accompanied by a certified copy of a resolution of the Board
of Directors of the Company authorizing such amendment.
          (b)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement and the trust
created thereby may not be amended after the date a Change In
Control occurs without the written consent of two-thirds in
number of the Covered Participants.  The Trustee may request
that the Company furnish evidence to establish that such a
majority in number of such Covered Participants have granted
written consent to such an amendment.
          THIRTEENTH:  Prohibition of Diversion.  (a)  Except
as provided in paragraph (b) below and in paragraphs (b)
and (d) of Article THIRD, at no time prior to the satisfac-
tion of all liabilities with respect to Covered Participants
and their beneficiaries shall any part of the corpus and/or
income of the Fund be used for, or diverted to, purposes

<PAGE> 30.

other than for the exclusive benefit of Covered Participants
and their beneficiaries and the assets of the Fund shall
never inure to the benefit of the Company and shall be held
for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to Covered
Participants and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable
expenses of administering the Fund.  Upon satisfaction of all
liabilities with respect to Covered Participants and their
beneficiaries under the Plans, this Agreement and the trust
shall be terminated and the remaining assets of the Fund
shall be distributed to the Company.
          (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the corpus and/or income of the
Fund shall at all times be subject to the claims of creditors
of the Company.  In the event that (i) a final judicial
determination is entered that the Company is unable to pay
its debts as such debts mature or (ii) there shall have been
filed by or against the Company in any court or other tri-
bunal either of the United States or of any State or of any
other authority now or hereafter exercising jurisdiction, a
petition in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or for
reorganization or for the appointment of a receiver or
trustee of all or substantially all of the Company's property
under the present or any future federal bankruptcy code or
any other present or future applicable federal, state or
other bankruptcy or insolvency statute or law, then the

<PAGE> 31.

Trustee shall not make payments from the Fund to any bene-
ficiary, but under either of such circumstances, the Trustee
shall deliver any property held in the Fund only as a court
or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction may direct to
satisfy the claims of the Company's creditors.  The Board of
Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company
shall furnish the Trustee with written notice of such final
judicial determination or filing described herein.
          If the Trustee receives a written allegation from a
person claiming to be a creditor of the Company that the
Company is unable to pay its debts as they mature, the
Trustee shall, within the 30-day period from the date of
receipt of such allegation, determine whether the Company is
in fact unable to pay its debts as they mature.  During such
period, the Trustee shall suspend all payments from the Fund. 
If the Trustee determines the Company is able to pay its
debts as they mature, payments from the Fund will resume. 
Otherwise, the Trustee will deliver the assets of the Fund as
a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction may
direct to satisfy the claims of the Company's creditors, and,
in the absence of such direction, the Trustee shall continue
to suspend payments from the Fund.
          FOURTEENTH:  Sufficiency of Fund.  Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement, the Company shall remain
obligated to pay Participants the amounts due to them under

<PAGE> 32.

the Plans.  If the assets of an Account are insufficient to
fulfill the Company's obligations to a Covered Participant
when due, then the Company shall pay to such Covered Par-
ticipant (and his beneficiaries) the amount of such
insufficiency.
          FIFTEENTH:  Prohibition of Assignment of Interest. 
No interest, right or claim in or to any part of the Fund or
any payment therefrom shall be assignable, transferable or
subject to sale, mortgage, pledge, hypothecation, commuta-
tion, anticipation, garnishment, attachment, execution or
levy of any kind, and the Trustee shall not recognize any
attempt to assign, transfer, sell, mortgage, pledge, hypo-
thecate, commute or anticipate the same, except to the extent
required by law.
          SIXTEENTH:  Affiliates.  Prior to a Change in
Control, any corporation that, directly or through one or
more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under
common control with the Company may adopt and become a party
to this Agreement by delivering to the Trustee an instrument
in writing, duly executed and acknowledged, adopting and
assuming jointly and severally the obligations of the Company
under this Agreement and constituting and appointing the
Company to be the agent and attorney in fact of such
corporation for the purposes of giving or receiving notices,
instructions, directions and other communications to or from

<PAGE> 33.

the Trustee and approving the accounts of the Trustee, accom-
panied by duly certified copies of resolutions of the Board
of Directors of such corporation adopting the Agreement and
approving and authorizing execution, acknowledgment and
delivery of such instrument and a duly certified copy of a
resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company approving
and consenting to the same.
          SEVENTEENTH:  Miscellaneous.  (a)  This Agreement
shall be interpreted, construed and enforced, and the trust
hereby created shall be administered, in accordance with the
laws of the United States and of the State of New York.
          (b)  The titles to Articles of this Agreement are
placed herein for convenience of reference only, and the
Agreement is not to be construed by reference thereto.
          (c)  This Agreement shall bind and inure to the
benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company and the
Trustee, respectively, and the Covered Participants and their
beneficiaries under the Plans.
          (d)  This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which together shall constitute but one
instrument, which may be sufficiently evidenced by any
counterpart.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused
this Agreement to be executed in their respective names by

                   RETIREMENT PLAN FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS
     
               1.  Eligibility for Benefits.
          (a)  A member of the Board of Directors (the
     "Board") of The Bank of New York Company, Inc. (the
     "Company") shall be eligible to receive benefits under The
     Bank of New York Company, Inc. Retirement Plan for Non-
     Employee Directors (the "Plan") if the member (i) has served
     for at least five years on the Board, (ii) has retired from
     the Board (A) following attainment of age 60 or (B) by
     reason of disability (as defined in paragraph (c) of this
     Section) after completing 10 years of service as a member of
     the Board and (iii) is not an employee of the Company or its
     subsidiaries or a former employee of the Company or its
     subsidiaries entitled to retirement benefits under a
     retirement plan of the Company or a subsidiary with respect
          to his prior service as an employee.
          (b)  For purposes of the Plan, service shall
     include all service as a member of the Board, including
          service prior to the effective date of the Plan.
          (c)  A person shall be considered to have incurred
     a disability for purposes of the Plan if the Pension
     Committee of the Board (the "Committee"), in its sole
     discretion, has determined that the person is unable to
     engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any
     physical or mental impairment which can be expected to

<PAGE> 2

     result in death or be of long-continued and indefinite
          duration.
               2.  Retirement Benefits.
          (a)  A retired member of the Board who is eligible
     for benefits under the Plan shall receive an annual
     retirement benefit equal to the following percentage of the
     annual cash retainer payable to non-employee Board members 
          at the date he ceased to be a member of the Board:
          Length of Service             % of Annual Retainer
     
               5 years                            50%
               6 years                            60%
               7 years                            70%
               8 years                            80%
               9 years                            90%
              10 years                           100%
     
          (b)  Retirement benefits for a member of the Board
     who retires after age 70 shall be paid for the life of the
     member of the Board.  Retirement benefits for a member of
     the Board who (i) retires between the ages of 60 and 70 or
     (ii) retires by reason of disability shall be paid for a
     number of years following retirement equal to the number of
          years of service as a member of the Board.
          (c)  Retirement benefits under the Plan shall
     commence to be paid on a quarterly basis on the first day of
     the calendar quarter following the retirement of the member
          of the Board.

<PAGE> 3

          (d)  Payment of retirement benefits under the Plan
     shall cease upon the death of the retired member of the
          Board.
          3.  Forfeitures.  If, in its sole discretion, the
     Board determines that a person has been removed from the
     Board for cause, such person shall forfeit all existing or
          future entitlement to benefits under the Plan.
          4.  Disability.  In the event that a person who is
     receiving benefits or is eligible to begin receiving
     benefits under the Plan has incurred a disability, the
     Committee may direct any or all of the benefits to which the
     person may be entitled to be paid in any one or more of the
     following ways: (a) to the person, or (b) to the person's
     legal guardian or conservator, or (c) to the person's spouse
     or to any other individual or entity to be expended for his
          or her benefit.
          5.  Administration.  The Committee shall
     administer the Plan, resolve any ambiguities or incon-
     sistencies, and decide all questions arising in its admin-
     istration, interpretation or application.  Any decision of
     the Committee shall be conclusive and binding on members of
     the Plan and all other persons having or claiming any right
          to payments under the Plan.
          6.  Amendment and Termination.  The Board may
     amend or terminate the Plan in whole or in part at any time,
     except that no amendment or termination may reduce or

<PAGE> 4

     terminate benefits to which a current or retired member of
     the Board is then entitled without the written consent of
          the member.
          7.  Source of Payment of Benefits.  The
     obligations of the Company to pay the retirement benefits
     provided under the Plan shall be contractual only and all
     payments of retirement benefits hereunder shall be made by
     the Company from its general assets at the time and in the
          manner provided herein.
          8.  No Assignment.  No right, benefit or payment
     under the Plan shall be subject to assignment, sale or other
     transfer, nor shall it be liable or subject in any manner to
          attachment, garnishment or execution.
          9.   Governing Law.  The Plan shall be governed
     by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws
          of the State of New York.

               3.  Participation.
          (a)  A Director may elect to participate in the
     Plan by filing a written election with the Company, on such
     form as may be prescribed by the Committee, to defer 50%,
          75% or 100% of his or her Director Compensation.  
          (b)  A deferral election shall become effective on
     the first day of the calendar year following the date the
     election is made.  A deferral election for a Participant
     shall remain effective for each subsequent calendar year
     unless the Participant files another election in which the
     Participant elects to cease deferring Director Compensation
     or to change the percentage of Director Compensation which
     is deferred.  The new deferral election shall become
     effective on the first day of the calendar year following
          the date the election is made.  

<PAGE> 4

          (c)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
     the contrary, in the case of each individual who is a
     Director as of December 1, 1993, a deferral election will be
     effective for Director Compensation for 1994 if it is made
     by February 15, 1994; provided, however, such election shall
     not be effective for any Director Compensation earned before
     the election is made.  An individual who becomes a Director
     after the Effective Date may make a deferral election within
     30 days after becoming a Director; such election, however,
     shall be effective only with respect to Director
          Compensation earned after the date such election is made.  
               4.  Deferral Account. 
          (a)  The portion of Director Compensation that
     would otherwise be paid in cash except that it is deferred
     pursuant to a deferral election, shall be credited to the
     Participant's Deferral Account and shall be allocated in
     multiples of 25% in accordance with the Participant's
     deferral election, among (i) the Investment Fund Accounts
     maintained for the Participant, as if invested in the
     applicable Investment Fund as of the first business day of
     the month in which such Director Compensation would have
     been paid and (ii) the Stock Account maintained for the
     Participant, in Stock Units, the number of which shall be
     determined by dividing (A) the portion of such Director
     Compensation to be allocated to the Stock Account of the
     Participant by (B) an amount equal to 95% of the closing

<PAGE> 5

     price of the Company Stock, as reported on the New York
     Stock Exchange on the date such Director Compensation would
          have been paid.  
          The portion of Director Compensation that would
     otherwise be paid in Company Stock except that it is
     deferred pursuant to a deferral election, shall be credited
     to the Participant's Deferral Account and shall be allocated
     to the Stock Account maintained for the Participant in Stock
     Units.  The number of Stock Units shall be determined by
     (A) multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Stock
     which the Participant elected to defer by (y) the closing
     price of the Company Stock as reported on the New York Stock
     Exchange on the date such Director Compensation would have
     been paid, and (B) dividing (z) the amount determined in
     clause (A) above by (xx) an amount equal to 95% of the
     closing price of the Company Stock as reported on the New
     York Stock Exchange on the date such Director Compensation
          would have been paid.
          (b)  The balance credited to a Participant's
     Investment Fund Accounts and Stock Account shall be adjusted
     from time to time to reflect the equivalent investment
     performance of the applicable Investment Fund or of Fund D
     of the Profit-Sharing Plan.  No transfers may be made among
     the Investment Fund Accounts or between the Investment Fund
          Accounts and the Stock Account.

<PAGE> 6

          (c)  The Company shall submit to each Participant,
     within 120 days after the close of each calendar year, a
     statement, setting forth the balance to the credit of such
     Participant in his Deferral Account, as well as the
     allocation thereof among the Investment Fund Accounts and
          the Stock Account as of the last business day of such year.
               5.  Payment of Deferred Compensation.
          (a)  Payment of a Participant's Deferral Account
     shall be made or commenced within 60 days after the
     Participant's retirement, death, or other termination of
     service as a Director (other than by reason of Disability). 
     Payment shall be made in a lump sum or in substantially
     equal installments over a period not to exceed ten years, in
     accordance with the Participant's election made at the time
          of his deferral election.
          (b)  In the event of a Participant's death prior
     to payment of the balance credited to his Deferral Account,
     the amount remaining in his Deferral Account shall be paid
     to his Beneficiary in accordance with the Participant's
          payment election.
          (c)  In the event of the Disability of a
     Participant, the Participant's Deferral Account shall be
          paid in a lump sum within 60 days of such Disability.
          (d)  A Participant may request that payment be
     made of all or a portion of his Deferral Account due to
     financial hardship occurring prior to his retirement, death,

<PAGE> 7

     or other termination as a Director by submitting a written
     request to the Committee.  Payment of the amount determined
     by the Committee necessary to relieve such financial
          hardship shall be made in a lump sum.
         (e)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
     the contrary, in the event of the Participant's retirement,
     death, or other termination as a Director after a Change of
     Control (as defined in paragraph (g) of this Section), his
     Deferral Account shall be paid in a lump sum within 60 days
          of such retirement, death, or other termination.
          (f)  Payments from the Plan with respect to the
     Participant's Investment Fund Accounts shall be made in cash
     equal to the value of the Participant's Investment Fund
     Accounts as of the last business day of the month following
     the date of the Participant's retirement, death, Disability
     or other termination of service as a Director (and each
     anniversary of such date if payments are made in
     installments).  Payments from the Plan with respect to a
     Participant's Stock Account shall be made in shares of
     Company Stock equal to the number of Stock Units in the
     Participant's Stock Account as of the date on which payment
     is made; provided, however, that cash payments shall be made
          in lieu of fractional shares.
          (g)  A "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have
     occurred if (i) any "person" (within the meaning of Section
     14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange

<PAGE> 8

     Act")), other than the Company, a subsidiary of the Company
     or an employee benefit plan of the Company, acquires more
     than 25% of the shares of the Company's common stock; (ii)
     there is a sale or divestiture of all or substantially all
     of the assets of the Company; (iii) during any two-year
     period, individuals who constituted the Board of Directors
     of the Company (the "Incumbent Board") as of the beginning
     of the period cease for any reason to constitute at least a
     majority thereof, provided that any person becoming a
     director during such period whose election or nomination for
     election by the Company's shareholders was approved by a
     vote of at least three-quarters of the Incumbent Board
     (either by a specific vote or by approval of the proxy
     statement of the Company in which such person is named as a
     nominee for director without objection to such nomination)
     shall be, for purposes of this clause (iii), considered as
     though such person were a member of the Incumbent Board; or
     (iv) a change in control of the Company would be required to
     be reported in response to item 1(a) of the Current Report
     on Form 8-K, as in effect on the Effective Date pursuant to
          Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
               6.  Beneficiary Designation
          Each Participant shall have the right, at any
     time, to designate any person or persons as his beneficiary
     or beneficiaries to whom payment under this Plan shall be
     paid in the event of his death prior to complete

<PAGE> 9

     distribution to Participant of his Deferral Account.  Any
     beneficiary designation may be made or changed by a
     Participant by a written instrument in such form prescribed
     by the Committee which is filed with the Company prior to
     the Participant's death.  If a Participant fails to
     designate a beneficiary, or if all designated beneficiaries
     predecease the Participant, then any amounts otherwise
     payable to the Participant's beneficiary shall be paid to
          the Participant's estate.
               7.  Amendment and Termination of Plan
          (a)  The Board may at any time amend the Plan in
          whole or in part.
          (b)  The Board may, in its sole discretion,
     terminate the Plan at any time, and upon any such
     termination, the Company shall immediately pay to each
     Participant in a lump sum the then remaining balance in the
          Participant's Deferral Account.
               8.   Miscellaneous
          (a)  The Company's obligation to make payments
     under the Plan shall be contractual only and all payments
     hereunder shall be made by the Company from its general
     assets at the time and in the manner provided for in the
          Plan.  
          (b)  Neither a Participant nor any other person
     shall have any right to sell, assign, transfer, pledge,
     anticipate, or otherwise encumber, the amounts, if any,

<PAGE> 10

     payable hereunder, to the Participant or such other person. 
     No part of the amounts payable under the Plan shall be
     subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any
     debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a
     Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by
     operation of law in the event of a Participant's or any
          other person's bankruptcy or insolvency.
          (c)  This Plan shall be governed by, and construed
     and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of
          New York.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies

The following is a summary of the Company's more significant accounting and
reporting policies.

Securities - Debt securities, which the Company has the ability and intent to
hold until maturity or on a long-term basis, are classified as held for
investment and stated at cost, adjusted for discount accrued and premium
amortized.  Remaining debt securities are classified as securities held for sale
and are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value.  Debt securities
held for sale include those management uses as part of its asset/liability
management.  Marketable equity securities are stated at the lower of aggregate
cost or market value.  Other equity securities are stated at cost.  Gains and
losses on the sale of securities are determined by the specific identification
method.  Investments of less than a majority but at least 20% ownership are
accounted for by the equity method and classified as other assets.

    In 1994, the Company will change its accounting for securities held for sale
from the lower of aggregate cost or market to fair value.  The after-tax amount
of net unrealized gains or losses will be reported as a separate component of
shareholders' equity.  Shareholders' equity at December 31, 1993, would have 
been increased by $1 million if securities held for sale at that date had been
recorded at fair value.

Allowance for Loan Losses - The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a
level that, in management's judgment, is adequate to absorb future losses. 
Management's judgment is based on an evaluation of existing risks of individual
credits; past loan loss experience; the volume, composition, and growth of the
loan portfolio; current and projected economic conditions; and other relevant
factors.

    In 1995, a new accounting standard will require the Company to introduce the
time value of money into the determination of the portion of the allowance for
loan losses which relates to impaired, non-consumer loans.  The loss component
of impaired, non-consumer loans will be measured by the difference between their
recorded value and fair value.  Fair value would be either the present value of
the expected future cash flows from borrowers, market value of the loan, or the
fair value of the collateral.  At the present time, the impact of the new method
on the Company's results of operations and financial condition is not expected
to be material.

Nonperforming Assets - Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status when
collateral is insufficient and principal or interest is past due 90 days or 
more, or when there is reasonable doubt that interest or principal will be 
collected.  Accrued interest is usually reversed when a loan is placed on 
nonaccrual status.  Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans may be 
recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's 
judgment.  Loans are not restored to accruing status until principal and 
interest are current or they become fully collateralized.  Consumer loans are 
not classified as nonperforming assets, but are charged off when they are 
between 120 and 185 days past due, depending on the product.  Interest accrual 
on consumer loans is suspended when the loans are 120 days past due.  Real 
estate acquired in satisfaction of loans is carried in other assets at the 
lower of the recorded investment in the property or fair value.

Interest Rate Contracts - Interest rate swaps and forward and futures contracts
are used as part of the Company's asset/liability management.  Gains and losses
on hedge transactions are deferred and amortized as adjustments to net interest
income over the lives of the hedged assets or liabilities.  Other gains and
losses are recognized currently in noninterest income.

Other - Certain 1992 and 1991 information has been reclassified to conform its
presentation with the 1993 financial statements.

2.  Mergers and Acquisitions

On August 11, 1993, the 10,730,668 outstanding shares of National Community
Banks'(NCB) common stock were exchanged for 10,301,441 shares of the Company's
common stock and the 1,149,750 outstanding shares of NCB's preferred stock were
exchanged for an equal number of shares of the Company's Class A preferred 
stock.  The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and prior period 
financial statements were restated.  Previously reported revenue (total 
interest and noninterest income) and net income for the years ended 
December 31, 1992 and 1991, for the Company and NCB are as follows:

- ---------------------------------------------------------
In millions                                1992      1991
- ---------------------------------------------------------
Revenue
  Company                                $3,566    $4,230
  NCB                                       304       354

Net Income
  Company                                   369       122
  NCB                                        24        12


     In December 1992, the Company acquired substantially all of the banking
activities of Barclays Bank of New York, N.A. (Barclays). This transaction added
deposits of $1.9 billion and assets of $1.8 billion.  The pro forma effect of
this acquisition had it occurred January 1, 1991 would not have been material.

     In early 1994, the Company acquired the factoring business of the
Bank of Boston.
  
3.  Cash Balance Requirements

The subsidiary banks of the Company are required to maintain balances with
Federal Reserve Banks under the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation D.  Required
balances averaged $769 million and $679 million for the years 1993 and 1992. 

4.  Securities

A comparison of the carrying amount and market value of securities for the years
1993, 1992, and 1991; 1993 and 1992 gross unrealized gains and losses; and a
maturity schedule of investments in debt securities is incorporated by reference
from "Securities" in the Management's Discussion and Analysis Section of this
Report.  Assets, including securities sold under repurchase agreements, carried
at $3 billion, $2 billion, and $3 billion at December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991
were pledged for various purposes as required or permitted by law.

5.  Loans

The Company's loan distribution and industry concentrations of credit risk at
December 31, 1993 and 1992 are incorporated by reference from "Loans" and
"Highly Leveraged Transactions" in the Management's Discussion and Analysis
Section of this Report.  The Company's retail, community, and middle market
banking operations in the New York metropolitan area create a significant
geographic concentration.

Transactions in the allowance for loan losses are summarized as follows:

- -------------------------------------------------------------

                                   ======    ======    ======

     Nonaccrual and reduced rate loans outstanding at December 31, 1993, 1992,
and 1991 were $540 million, $788 million, and $1,173 million.  Nonperforming
loans at December 31, 1993 and 1992 exclude $117 million of reduced rate
Philippine obligations secured by zero coupon U. S. Treasury bonds.  At December
31, 1993, commitments to borrowers whose loans were classified as nonaccrual or
reduced rate were not material.

     Interest income received on nonaccrual and reduced rate loans exceeded
reversals by $4 million in 1993, $7 million in 1992, and $5 million in 1991. 
Interest income would have been increased by $27 million, $89 million, and $167
million if loans on nonaccrual status at December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991 had
been performing for the entire year.  At year end, foreign (including LDC) loans
on nonperforming status were $130 million in 1993, $198 million in 1992, and 
$146 million in 1991.  Interest income received on foreign nonperforming loans 
equaled reversals in 1993, and exceed reversals by $1 million in 1992, and $3 
million in 1991.  Interest income would have been increased by $6 million, $10 
million, and $15 million if foreign loans on nonaccrual status at 
December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991 had been performing for the entire year.

     Other real estate was $99 million, $268 million, and $369 million, at
December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991.  Writedowns of and expenses related to other
real estate included in noninterest expense were $53  million, $106 million, and
$103 million, in 1993, 1992, and 1991.

                          ====         ====        ======      ======    ======


     Fixed-rate debt at December 31, 1993 had interest rates ranging from 6.50%
to 8.50%. The weighted average interest rates on fixed-rate debt at December 31,
1993 and 1992 were 7.29% and 7.70%.  To reduce exposure to interest rate
movements, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements for some of its
debt issues.  As a result of these agreements, the effective interest rates
differ from those stated.  The weighted average interest rates on variable-rate
debt at December 31, 1993 and 1992 were 5.58% and 5.14%.

     The Company's $250 million of 7.50% subordinated debentures due 2001 are
convertible at the option of the holder into common stock of the Company at a
price of $39.10 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.  The
debentures may be redeemed, at the option of the Company, on or after August 15,
1996 at an initial redemption price of 103.75% of the principal amount, 
declining by 0.75% per annum.

The other preferred stocks at December 31, 1993 were redeemed in the first
quarter of 1994.  All holders of cumulative preferred stock have cumulative
dividend rights in preference to holders of common stock.  

     The 8.60% cumulative preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $625
per share and is redeemable at the option of the Company on and after December
1, 1997 at $625 per share, plus cumulative and unpaid dividends.

    The Class A 7.75% cumulative convertible preferred stock has a liquidation
preference of $25 per share.  It is redeemable at the option of the Company on
or after July 1, 1996 at $26.16 per share and at decreasing prices thereafter to
$25 per share on or after July 1, 2002, plus cumulative and unpaid dividends. 
Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into 0.9232 shares of
common stock of the Company subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.

     Warrants expiring in 1998 (exercise price $62 per share) to purchase
approximately 14,120,539 shares of the Company's common stock were outstanding
at December 31, 1993.  

     At December 31, 1993, the Company had reserved for issuance 27 million
common shares pursuant to the terms of securities and employee benefit plans.

     The Company has a preferred stock purchase rights plan.  The plan provides
that if any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the
Company's common stock (an "acquiring person"), then on and after the tenth day
thereafter, each right would entitle the holder to purchase $400 in market value
of the Company's common stock for $200.  In addition, if there is a business
combination between the Company and an acquiring person, or in certain other
circumstances, each right (if not previously exercised) would entitle the holder
to purchase $200 in market value of the common stock of the acquiring person for
$100.  The rights are redeemable by the Company at $0.05 per right until they 
are exercisable, and will expire in 2004.

     The effect of common stock equivalents (stock options and warrants) on
earnings per share is not dilutive. Fully diluted earnings per share give effect
to the assumed conversion of the convertible debentures and convertible 
preferred stock.  The effect of the assumed conversion of the convertible 
preferred stock and the 7.50% convertible debentures was antidilutive in 1991.

8.  Stock Option Plans

The Company has stock option plans (the Plans) which provide for the issuance of
stock options at fair market value at the date of grant to officers and key
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.  All options related to plans
adopted prior to 1993 have been granted.  Under the Company's 1993 Plan, options
to acquire common stock may be granted in amounts that do not exceed, on a
cumulative basis, 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock per year, and,
subject to adjustment, options covering no more than approximately 4.2 million
shares in the aggregate may be granted during the first five years.  Generally,
each option granted under the Plans is exercisable between one and 10 years from
the date of grant.  The following is a summary of activity under the Plans for
the years 1993, 1992, and 1991:

9.  Income Taxes

In the first quarter of 1993, the Company changed retroactively from the 
deferred method to the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
and restated its financial statements.  Shareholders' equity was reduced by a 
$46 million charge to retained earnings in prior period financial statements.  

     Income taxes included in the consolidated statements of income consist of
the following:

10.  Employee Benefit Plans

Pension Plans
- -------------
The Company has defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all full
time employees.  The Company has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), which
may provide additional benefits.  The Company's funding policy is to annually
contribute an amount necessary to satisfy the Internal Revenue Service's funding
standards.

    The following table presents the income (expense) components included in net
pension income:

     The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in computing
pension income was 10.5% in 1993, 1992, and 1991.  The ESOP provision was $1
million in 1993, compared with $3 million in 1992 and 1991.

Other Postretirement Benefits
- -----------------------------
     The Company provides health care and life insurance benefits for certain
retired employees.  In the first quarter of 1993, the Company changed to the
accrual from the cash method of accounting for these benefits.  

     The cost of these benefits for the year ended December 31, 1993 consisted
of the following components:
(in millions)
Service Cost - Benefits Earned                         $ 3
Accumulated Benefit Obligation:
  Interest                                              11
  Amortization                                           7
                                                       ---
    Total                                              $21
                                                       ===

     The assumed health care cost trend rates to be used in determining cost of
these benefits for 1994 is 9%, decreasing proportionately in each successive 
year to 6% in 2010 and thereafter.  A change of one percentage point in this 
rate for each year would change the benefit obligation by 13% and the cost of 
the benefits by 9%.

     The Bank of New York (Bank), a significant subsidiary, is subject to
dividend limitations under the Federal Reserve Act and the New York Banking Law.
The Bank of New York National Association (BNYNA) is subject to dividend
limitations under the National Bank Act.  Under these statutes, prior regulatory
approval is required for dividends in any year that would exceed either bank's
net profits for such year combined with retained net profits for the prior two
years.  Also, both banks are prohibited from paying a dividend in an amount
greater than "undivided profits then on hand" less "bad debts" (generally loans
six months or more past due).

     Under the first of these two standards, in 1994 the Bank could declare
dividends of $365 million plus net profits earned in 1994 and BNYNA could 
declare dividends of $56 million plus net profits earned in 1994.  Neither bank 
is restrained from paying dividends under the second of these two standards.  

     In addition to these statutory tests, each bank's primary federal regulator
(the Federal Reserve Board, in the case of the Bank, and the Comptroller of the
Currency, in the case of BNYNA) could prohibit a dividend if they determined 
that the payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.  Bank
regulators have indicated that, generally, dividends should be paid by banks 
only to the extent of earnings from continuing operations.

    Each of the Company, the Bank, and BNYNA must comply with risk based capital
and leverage ratio guidelines established by bank regulators for bank holding
companies and banks.  In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") restricts dividend payments that would cause
certain capital ratios to fall below "adequate" capital ratio standards.  Each
of the Company, the Bank, and BNYNA is in compliance with the capital and
leverage ratio standards applicable to it.

     The dividend policy of The Bank of New York (Delaware) is to declare
dividends that, at a minimum, allow it to meet capital guidelines established by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC").  The Bank of New York
(Delaware) is also in compliance with the capitalization requirements set by
FDICIA.

     Consistent with its policy regarding bank holding companies serving as a
source of financial strength for their subsidiary banks, the Federal Reserve
Board has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company
generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income
available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the 
dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent 
with the bank holding company's capital needs, asset quality, and overall 
financial condition.

     The Federal Reserve Act limits amounts of, and requires collateral on,
extensions of credit by the Company's insured bank subsidiaries to the Company
and, with certain exceptions, its nonbank affiliates; also, there are
restrictions on the amounts of investments by such banks in stock and other
securities of the Company and such affiliates, and restrictions on the 
acceptance of their securities as collateral for loans by such banks.  
Extensions of credit by insured bank subsidiaries to each of the Company and 
such affiliates are limited to 10% of such bank subsidiary's capital and 
surplus, and in the aggregate for the Company and all such affiliates to 20%.

13.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The carrying amount of the Company's financial instruments (i.e., monetary
assets and liabilities) is determined under different accounting methods-see 
Note 1.  The following disclosure discusses these instruments on a uniform basis
- - fair value.  However, active markets do not exist for the greatest portion of
these instruments.  As a result, fair value determinations require significant
subjective judgments regarding future cash flows.  Other judgments would result

<PAGE> 20

in different fair values. Among the assumptions used by the Company are discount
rates ranging principally from 3% to 11% at December 31, 1993 and 1992. The fair
value information supplements the basic financial statements and other
traditional financial data presented throughout this Report.

     A summary of the practices used for determining fair value is as follows:

Securities and Trading Activities
- ---------------------------------
The fair value of securities and trading assets is based on quoted market 
prices, dealer quotes, or pricing models.  The fair value of financial 
instruments such as options, future and forward rate contracts, commitments to 
purchase and sell foreign exchange, and foreign currency swaps, are similarly 
determined.  The fair value of interest rate swaps is the amount that would 
be received or paid to terminate the agreement.

Loans and Commitments
- ---------------------
For certain categories of consumer loans, fair value includes consideration of
the quoted market prices for securities backed by similar loans.  The fair value
of other types of loans is determined by discounting the future cash flows
(including those related to off-balance-sheet activities that serve as hedges)
and using secondary market values.  The fair value of commitments to extend
credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit is based 
upon the cost to settle the commitment.

Other Financial Assets
- ----------------------
The fair value of these assets are assumed to equal their carrying value due to
their short maturity.

Deposits, Borrowings, and Long-Term Debt
- ----------------------------------------
The fair value of noninterest-bearing deposits is assumed to be their carrying
amount.  The fair value of interest-bearing deposits, borrowings, and long-term
debt is estimated based upon the current rates for instruments of the same
remaining maturity or quoted market prices for the same or similar issues and 
the effect of hedges.

The carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company's financial
instruments are as follows:

Commitments and contingent items reduced the fair value of loans and commitments
by $62 million in 1993 and $85 million in 1992.
 
14.  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent liabilities
are outstanding which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.  Management does not expect any material losses to result from these
matters.

     A summary of the notional amount of the Company's off-balance-sheet
transactions, net of participations, at December 31, 1993 and 1992 follows:

     The total potential loss on undrawn commitments, standby and commercial
letters of credit, and securities lending indemnifications is equal to the total
notional amount, which does not consider the value of any collateral.  The
Company's exposure to credit loss for interest rate contracts and foreign
exchange contracts amounted to $264 million and $468 million in 1993 and $288
million and $1,103 million in 1992.  These amounts represent net unrealized 
gains with counterparties.

     A discussion of the credit, interest rate, and foreign exchange risks
inherent in off-balance-sheet financial transactions is presented under "Off-
Balance-Sheet Risks" in the Management's Discussion and Analysis Section of this
Report.

     Standby letters of credit principally support corporate obligations and
include $1.0 billion that were collateralized with cash and securities at
December 31, 1993 and 1992.  At December 31, 1993 and 1992, securities lending
indemnifications were secured by collateral of $15.0 billion and $13.7 billion. 

    At December 31, 1993, approximately $2.5 billion of the standbys will expire
within one year, $0.6 billion between one to five years, and the balance after
five years.  At December 31, 1993, approximately $1.9 billion of interest rate
swaps will mature within one year, $6.7 billion between one to five years, and
the balance after five years.  Substantially all futures, forward, and option
contracts mature within two years.  

     The table below summarizes the carrying amount of
items hedged and the related notional amount of interest rate swaps and
futures and foreign exchange contracts that were designated as hedges at 
December 31, 1993:

     In 1994, a new accounting standard will require the Company to recognize
unrealized gains and losses related to certain interest rate and foreign 
currency contracts as assets and liabilities on its balance sheet.  The new 
standard allows the netting of unrealized gains and losses with the same 
counterparty when a master netting agreement is in effect.  The Company's 
current policy is to present all unrealized gains and losses on a net basis.
If the standard had been in effect on December 31, 1993, reported assets and
liabilities would have increased by approximately $732 million.

     Net rent expense for premises and equipment was $99 million in 1993, $91
million in 1992, and $96 million in 1991.

     At December 31, 1993, the Company and its subsidiaries were obligated under
various noncancelable lease agreements, certain of which provide for additional
rents based upon real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance and for various
renewal options.  The minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating
leases for premises and equipment having a term of more than one year from 
December 31, 1993 are as follows:

     In April 1990, the Company notified Northeast Bancorp., Inc. (NEB) that NEB
had materially breached its obligation under a merger agreement.  Following
denial by the Federal Reserve Board of the Company's application for approval to
acquire NEB and failure by state regulators to approve the proposed merger prior
to the August 15, 1990 termination date, the Company's Board of Directors
notified NEB in September 1990 that it had terminated the merger agreement.

    In May 1990, NEB brought suit against the Company in the United States Court
for the District of Connecticut seeking money damages of $350 million relating
to NEB's allegations that the Company breached its obligations.  In November
1990, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment to have the lawsuit
dismissed; in June 1991, this motion was granted as to NEB's Connecticut Unfair
Trade Practices Act and libel claims and denied as to NEB's other claims.  In
March 1993, the Company's motion for summary judgment on NEB's contract claims
was denied.  In May 1993, as part of the acquisition of NEB's Class A voting
common stock by First Fidelity Bancorporation, NEB's interest in the suit was
transferred to a trust funded with $2 million for the benefit of former NEB
shareholders.  The action will continue.  In the opinion of management, NEB's
claims are without merit.

    In the ordinary course of business, there are various claims pending against
the Company and its subsidiaries.  In the opinion of management, liabilities
arising from such claims, if any, would not have a material effect upon the
Company's consolidated financial statements.

Independent Auditors' Report                            Deloitte & Touche


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
New York, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Bank of New
York Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 1993 and
1992,and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31, 1993. 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.  The consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to
the merger of the Company and National Community Banks, Inc., which has been
accounted for as a pooling of interests as described in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements.  We did not audit the consolidated balance
sheets of National Community Banks, Inc. as of December 31, 1992, or the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash
flows of National Community Banks,Inc. for the years ended December 31, 1992 and
1991, which statements reflect total assets of $4,181,508,000 as of December 31,
1992 and net income of $23,785,000, and $12,384,000 for the years ended December
31, 1992, and 1991, respectively.  Those statements were audited by other
auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it
relates to the amounts included for National Community Banks, Inc. for 1992 and
1991, is based solely on the report of such other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1993 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, in the first
quarter of 1993 the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes to
conform with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 and
retroactively, restated the 1992 and prior financial statements for the change.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Company's Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
SUMMARY OF RESULTS

For the year 1993, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. (the Company) reported
record net income of $559 million or a record $5.44 per fully diluted share,
compared with $393 million or $4.00 per fully diluted share in 1992 and $134
million or $1.27 per share in 1991.
     In 1993, spreads widened reflecting a continuing shift in asset mix toward
higher yielding assets and a lower level of nonperforming assets. Fee income was
strong, especially from credit cards and securities and other processing.  A
lower provision for loan losses, continued control of operating expenses, and 
the acquisition of 62 branches of Barclays Bank of New York, N.A. (Barclays) on
December 11, 1992, also helped to increase earnings.
     Earnings at the 105-branch National Community Banks (BNYNA) increased
significantly in 1993.  In 1993, BNYNA added $36 million to net income compared
with $24 million in 1992 and $12 million in 1991.  The Company's results for
1993, 1992, and 1991 have been restated to reflect the acquisition, which was
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.  
     In 1993, nonperforming assets declined by $417 million, or 39%, to $639
million. December 31, 1993 marked the tenth consecutive quarter that
nonperforming assets declined.
     During 1993, the Company continued to strengthen its capital position.  The
Company retained $383 million of earnings and issued $550 million of 
subordinated debt while $655 million of long-term debt matured or was redeemed 
and $75 million of preferred stock was redeemed.  In addition, $58 million of 
preferred stock was converted into $46 million of common stock.  The Tier I and 
total capital ratios for the Company at December 31, 1993 were 8.87% and 13.65% 
compared with 7.59% and 12.30% last year and 5.79% and 9.40% in 1991.  Tangible 
common equity as a percent of total assets was 7.00% at December 31, 1993 
compared with 5.83% one year ago and 4.49% in 1991.
     In 1992, noninterest income from personal trust, funds transfer, trade
finance, securities lending, mutual fund custody, stock transfer, government
securities clearance, and corporate trust grew significantly.  Net interest
income increased, reflecting increases in the net interest rate spread and the
net yield on interest-earning assets.  Strict control of operating expenses
resulted in a modest increase in compensation expense and declines in furniture
and fixture and occupancy expense.  The provision for loan losses was
significantly lower in 1992.  
     In 1992, the Company sold 9.2 million shares of common stock for $339
million, $600 million of subordinated debt, and $143 million of preferred stock.
It redeemed $100 million of subordinated debt and $100 million of preferred
stock. 
     The Company's 1991 results were affected by an adverse change in asset
quality.  As a result, the Company recorded a significant provision for loan
losses.  Net interest income declined, reflecting a lower volume of earning
assets, including the impact of those that were nonperforming; the decline was
reduced by an improvement in spreads and yields from the low interest rate
environment. Noninterest income from credit cards, American depositary receipts,
mutual fund custody, personal trust, securities lending, and master trust showed
special strength.  Operating expenses remained under tight control.  The
Company's capital position was improved with the issuance of $250 million of
convertible subordinated debentures.  
     Return on average assets for 1993 was 1.20% - a record for the Company -
compared with .85% in 1992 and .29% in 1991, while return on average common
equity was 14.98% in 1993 compared with 12.00% in 1992 and 3.85% in 1991.

Net Interest Income
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dollars in millions                           1993          1992         1991
                                              ----          ----         ----
Net Interest Income on a Taxable
 Equivalent Basis                          $ 1,550        $1,434       $1,427
Net Interest Rate Spread                      3.12%         2.91%        2.56%
Net Yield on Interest-Earning Assets          3.84%         3.61%        3.52%

Net interest income increased 8%, the spread by 7%, and the yield by 6% in 1993.
Contributing to these increses were a $0.7 billion rise in the level of average
interest-earning assets, the Company being liability sensitive in a declining
rate environment, and the large decline in nonperforming loans.  The increase in
yield also reflects a higher volume of interest-free sources of funds, partially
offset by lower returns on these funds in a low interest rate environment.  
    Average earning assets increased to $40.4 billion in 1993 from $39.7 billion
in 1992, primarily resulting from a $0.8 billion increase in federal funds sold
and securities purchased under resale agreements. Although average loans did not
grow ($30.4 billion in 1993) the mix improved, contributing to the growth in
spread and yield.  Special strength was noted in wholesale mortgage lending,
securities industries banking, factoring, and credit card lending, which
increased $1.1 billion.  Credit card outstandings are expected to increase
further in 1994 due to account growth and the maturities of asset 
securitizations ($0.6 billion). 
     Net interest income increased slightly in 1992.  A $0.9 billion decline in
the level of average interest-earning assets was more than offset by the 
increase in the spread and yield, the result of the Company being liability 
sensitive in a declining rate environment.  The smaller increase in yield 
reflects the lower returns on interest-free sources of funds in a low interest 
rate environment.  Also the effect of the large decline in nonperforming loans 
had a positive impact on interest rate spreads.  Loans declined to $30.3 billion
in 1992 from $32.7 billion in 1991, primarily due to weak commercial loan 
demand and the full year effect of credit card securitizations entered into 
in 1991.  This decline was partially offset by a $1.5 billion increase in 
securities.  New credit card lending, which increased average outstandings by 
$0.5 billion, was offset by the full year effect of credit card securitizations 
entered into in 1991.
     The credit card securitizations reduced net interest income by $162 million
in 1993, $164 million in 1992, and $79 million in 1991.  
     Interest income would have been increased by $27 million, $89 million, and
$167 million if loans on nonaccrual status at December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991
had been performing for the entire year.

NONINTEREST INCOME

Noninterest income is provided by a wide range of fiduciary and processing
services, other fee-based services, and trading activities.  These revenues
increased 11% to $1,319 million in 1993, compared with $1,183 million in 1992 
and $1,094 million in 1991.    
      Securities processing fees were $307 million, $273 million, and $244
million in 1993, 1992, and 1991.  Contributing to the increase in 1993 were
American depositary receipts, government securities clearance, master trust,
mutual fund custody, stock transfer, and corporate trust.  Other processing
fee principally funds transfer, deposit services, and trade finance, were $161
million in 1993, $148 million in 1992, and $124 million in 1991.  All three
performed strongly in 1993.
     Trust and investment fees were $131 million in 1993, $118 million in 1992,
and $110 million in 1991.  During 1993, increases occurred in institutional
investment management, while personal trust was strong in 1992. 
     Service charges and fees were $460 million in 1993, compared with $442
million in 1992 and $385 million in 1991.  The increase in 1993 resulted
primarily from growth in the Company's credit card business and the Barclays
acquisition.  The number of credit card accounts increased by 22% to 4.8 million
and managed outstandings were up 19% from 1992 to $6.2 billion.  The 1991 credit
card securitizations increased noninterest income by $64 million in 1993, $70
million in 1992, and $48 million in 1991.  Part of the decrease in the
noninterest income from securitizations in 1993 compared with 1992 was due to
maturities.  The 1992 increase in service charges and fees resulted primarily
from increases in syndication fees and the full year effect of credit card
securitization.  The Barclays acquisition made a modest contribution to the
increase in service charges and fees.
     Securities gains in 1992 totaled $64 million, $42 million, and $95 million
in 1993, 1992, and 1991, including $28 million, $1 million, and $26 million of
gains on equity securities.  The 1992 results include a $31 million writedown of
the Company's investment in Northeast Bancorp, Inc.
     Other noninterest income was $196 million in 1993, $160 million in 1992, 
and $136 million in 1991.  Foreign exchange profits were $54 million, $66 
million, and $47 million in 1993, 1992, and 1991.  Profits from trading interest
rate contracts amounted to $18 million, $7 million, and $4 million in 1993, 
1992, and 1991.  Trading in debt and equity securities resulted in gains of $7 
million, $21 million, and $20 million in 1993, 1992, and 1991.  Other 
noninterest income for 1993 included a pre-tax gain of $24 million related to 
the sale of a portion of the Company's interest in Wing Hang Bank, Ltd. during 
the second quarter.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME TAXES

     Noninterest expense was $1,646 million, $1,519 million, and $1,458 million
in 1993, 1992, and 1991.
     Total noninterest expense increased 8% in 1993 compared with 1992. 
Furniture and equipment expense declined by 2% to $95 million for the year. 
Other real estate expense declined substantially by 50% to $53 million from $106
million in 1992.  Salaries increased 10% in 1993 to $601 million from $546
million in 1992, and profit sharing increased to $58 million from $38 million. 
Other employee benefits - primarily incentive compensation and health care
expenses - were up 19% to $154 million from $129 million in 1992.  Occupancy
expense increased by 6% to $178 million.  The Barclays acquisition was a
significant factor in the increase in noninterest expense.
     In 1992, significant cost savings were realized in occupancy and furniture
and equipment expense.  Salaries and employee benefits were up 9%.  Other real
estate expenses increased 3%.  The Barclays acquisition was a modest factor in
the increase in noninterest expense.
     Deposit insurance premiums were $57 million in 1993 compared with $50
million and $48 million in 1992 and 1991.

     Other real estate charges were $53  million, $106 million, and $103 million
in 1993, 1992, and 1991.  Operating expenses related to other real estate owned

<PAGE> 28

were approximately $8 million in 1993, compared with $25 million in 1992 and $19
million in 1991. Writedowns and losses on sales of other real estate at NCB were
$15 million, $25 million, and $20 million in 1993, 1992, and 1991.  In 1993,
other real estate charges include declines in the estimates of value of hospital
properties in Texas ($9 million) and an office building in New Jersey ($3
million), and losses on the sale of a shopping mall in Ohio ($7 million), and 
two properties in New Jersey ($5 million).  The 1992 other real estate charges
include declines in the estimates of value of a shopping center ($7 million) and
a mixed-use property ($7 million), and losses on the sale of a mixed-use 
property ($12 million), a hotel ($7 million), and an office building ($4 
million).  The 1991 other real estate charges include declines in the estimates 
of the values of shopping centers ($20 million), a mixed-use project ($10 
million), and office buildings ($9 million), and losses on the sale of shopping 
centers ($12 million), and an office building ($4 million).  
     The Company remains committed to strong cost controls.  For 1994, the
Company has adopted an incentive program to encourage employees to reduce
controllable costs.  Additional cost savings are expected in 1994 from the
consolidation of 12 retail branches and the closing of the Company's Sioux 
Falls, South Dakota credit card operations center in November 1993.
    The Company's consolidated effective tax rates for 1993, 1992, and 1991 were
36.9%, 33.2%, and 35.6%.  The increase in the effective tax rate for 1993 is
attributable to the increase in the federal tax rate from 34% to 35%, a decline
in the proportion of tax-exempt income to total income, and lower foreign tax
credits.  These increases were partially offset by a lower proportion of state
and local income taxes and nondeductible expenses to total income.  The decrease
in 1992 compared with 1991 reflects a lower proportion of state and local income
taxes and nondeductible expenses to total income, as well as higher foreign tax
credits, partially offset by a decline in the ratio of tax-exempt income to 
total income.

LIQUIDITY

The Company maintains its liquidity through the management of its assets and
liabilities, utilizing worldwide financial markets.  The diversification of
liabilities reflects the flexibility of the Company's funding sources under
changing market conditions.  Stable core deposits, including demand and retail
time, are generated through the Company's diversified network and managed with
the use of trend studies and deposit pricing.  The use of derivative products
such as interest rate swaps and financial futures enhances liquidity through the
issue of long-term liabilities without exposure to interest rate risk. Liquidity
also results from the maintenance of a portfolio of assets which can be easily
reduced and the monitoring of unfunded loan commitments, thereby reducing
unanticipated funding requirements.
     Reflecting plans to improve liquidity, average savings and noninterest-
bearing deposits increased by $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion during 1993.  Also,
medium-term bank notes grew by $0.7  billion. More volatile sources of interest-
bearing deposits and borrowings decreased by $2.9 billion. 
     In 1993, the Company's average commercial paper borrowings were $93 million
compared with $107 million in 1992.  The Company has backup lines of credit at
financial institutions supporting these borrowings.
     The following comments relate to the information disclosed in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
     Cash flows from earnings and other operating activities were $2.1 billion
in 1993 and $0.7 billion in 1992, compared with an outflow of $0.7 billion in
1991.  The 1993 and 1992 increases in cash flows reflect a reduction in assets
held for sale.
     The 1993 cash flows used by investing activities were $2.4 billion,
reflecting additions to loans and securities. In 1992, investing activities were
the source of $3.7 billion of cash flow, reflecting a decrease in federal funds
sold and securities purchased under resale agreements and a reduction of loans. 
In 1991, a net reduction of loans and securities held for investment contributed

<PAGE> 29

to the generation of $3.6 billion of cash from investing activities.  Cash used
by financing activities was $0.7 billion, $1.1 billion, and $3.9 billion in 
1993, 1992, and 1991 as the Company reduced its deposit borrowings.
     Restrictions on the ability of the Company to obtain funds from its
subsidiaries are discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     The significant improvement in these ratios in 1993 is the result of growth
in shareholders' equity, the issuance of $550 million of subordinated debt, and
modest growth in assets. The Company's common equity ratio is one of the highest
among money center banks.  The Company's banks' capital ratios exceed "well
capitalized", the highest of five regulatory capital categories.
     Shareholders' equity was $4,072 million at December 31, 1993, compared with
$3,730 million at December 31, 1992 and $3,071 million at December 31, 1991.  
The change in shareholders' equity in 1993 is primarily attributable to growth
in retained earnings of $383 million offset in part by the redemption of $75
million of adjustable rate, noncumulative preferred stock.  In addition, the
Company issued $300 million of 6 5/8% long-term debt and $250 million of 6 1/2%
long-term debt to replace $655 million of debt that was redeemed or matured in
1993.  In February 1993, $58 million of preferred stock was converted into $46
million of common stock.  Two issues of preferred stock were redeemed in the
first quarter of 1994 reducing preferred stock by $156 million and additional
capital by $17 million.
     The change in shareholders' equity in 1992 is primarily attributable to the
issuance of 9.2 million shares of common stock in June 1992, resulting in
proceeds of $339 million, and growth in retained earnings of $240 million.  In
addition, the Company issued $115 million of 8.6% preferred stock and $29 
million of 7.75% convertible preferred stock, while redeeming $100 million of 
9.45% preferred stock.  During 1992, the Company also issued $600 million of
subordinated notes at a weighted average rate of 7.72%, and redeemed $100 
million of 12.38% subordinated debentures.  
     The Company can issue up to $750 million of debt and preferred stock
(including convertible preferred stock) pursuant to a shelf registration
statement.

CREDIT CARD OPERATIONS

Credit card receivables sold in the form of a security is a technique for
financing the Company's credit card operations.  For accounting purposes, the
underlying assets and liabilities are removed from the balance sheet, and 
amounts otherwise reported in the income statement as net interest income, fees,
and provision for loan losses are reflected in noninterest income.
     The Company securitized $1,350 million of credit card receivables in 1991;
$1,225 million were outstanding at December 31, 1993, and $1,025 million are
scheduled to mature in 1994.  The Company expects to return these assets to its
balance sheet and to replace these financings with lower cost funds.  The impact

<PAGE> 30

of the securitizations on the Company's financial statements assuming the funds
received from the securitizations were used to replace short-term borrowings, is
summarized below:

In millions                              1993        1992       1991

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

     In 1993, the Company continued to experience significant improvement in
asset quality.  Both charge-offs and nonperforming loans dropped sharply.  The
provision for loan losses was $284 million in 1993, compared with $443 million
in 1992 and $778 million in 1991.  Net charge-offs were $387 million in 1993,
$511 million in 1992, and $777 million in 1991.  In these years net charge-offs
were primarily attributable to HLT, other commercial, real estate, and consumer
loans.  The total allowance for loan losses was $970 million and $1,072 million
at year-end 1993 and 1992.  This decrease of $102 million resulted from net
charge-offs exceeding the provision for loan losses and reflects the sharp
decline in the level of nonaccrual loans.  The decrease in 1992 ($12 million)
resulted from net charge-offs exceeding the provision for loan losses ($68
million), partially offset by an increase in the allowance ($56 million)
resulting from the Barclays  acquisition.  The ratio of the total allowance for
loan losses to year-end loans was 3.17% and 3.63% at December 31, 1993 and 1992.
The allowance for loan losses was 152% of total nonperforming assets at December
31, 1993, compared with 102% at December 31, 1992.
     At December 31, 1993, the Company's LDC exposures consisted of $151 million
in medium-term loans (and no material commitments), $193 million in short-term
loans, $11 million in accrued interest, and $49 million in equity investments. 
At December 31, 1993, the allowance for loan losses associated with medium-term
LDC loans was $116 million (approximately 77% of such loans).  The LDC exposure
excludes $266 million (face value) of bonds whose principal payments are
collateralized by U.S. Treasury zero coupon obligations and interest payments 
are partially collateralized.  These include $117 million of reduced rate 
Philippine bonds which were received in exchange for the same amount of 
Philippine loans in 1992.  The Company restructured $59 million of Argentine 
debt and sold $27 million of medium-term LDC loans in 1991.

HIGHLY LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS

At year-end 1993, HLT loans outstanding were $1,314 million and commitments were
$349 million, compared with $1,658 million and $414 million at year-end 1992. 
At December 31, 1993, borrowers in the communication industry represented 57% of
the HLT portfolio. Nonperforming HLT loans at December 31, 1993 were $52 million
(nine customers), compared with $92 million (thirteen customers) at December 31,
1992.  In 1993, net charge-offs of HLTs decreased to $22 million, versus $94
million in 1992 and $174 million in 1991.
     The carrying value of equity investments associated with HLTs was $22
million at December 31, 1993, compared with $44 million at December 31, 1992. 
There were no debt investments associated with HLT's at December 31, 1993,
compared with $33 million at the end of 1992.  Commitments to fund additional
equity investments were $7 million at December 31, 1993.

(*) Excludes $117 million of reduced rate Philippine obligations secured by U.S.
    Treasury bonds.

     Nonperforming assets declined for the tenth consecutive quarter to $639
million at December 31, 1993.
     The decrease in nonperforming assets during 1993 is attributable to charge-
offs and writedowns of $264 million and paydowns, sales, and returns to accrual
status of $456 million.  The decrease was partially offset by $303 million of
loans placed on nonperforming status.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of the Company's financial instruments are disclosed in Note 13
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The fair values, if realized, would
improve the Company's capital resources and results of operations because the
excess of fair value over the carrying amount for its assets is greater than the
corresponding excess for liabilities.  The fair values would not affect
liquidity.
     In both 1993 and 1992, the interest rate environment produced unrecognized
fair value gains in the securities and loan portfolios.  Higher values
attributable to consumer loans more than offset the declines in value associated
with credit-impaired commercial loans.  The increase in fair value of long-term
debt primarily reflects the influence of the Company's stock price on the fair
value of its convertible subordinated debentures.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISKS

The Company's significant off-balance-sheet risks are commercial lending
commitments, letters of credit, securities lending indemnifications, and foreign
currency and interest rate risk management products.  The Company assumes these
risks to reduce its own interest rate and foreign currency risks and to enable
its customers to meet their credit and liquidity needs and hedge their foreign
currency and interest rate risks.  These items involve, to varying degrees,
credit, foreign exchange, and interest rate risk not recognized in the balance
sheet.  There are no significant industry concentrations of such risks.
     The Company's off-balance-sheet risks are managed and monitored in manners
similar to those used for on-balance-sheet risks.
     The Company's exposure to credit loss for lending commitments, letters of
credit, and securities lending indemnification is represented by the contractual
amount of those transactions.  Since many of the commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total amount does not necessarily represent
future cash requirements.  In securities lending transactions, the Company
requires the borrower to provide collateral, thus reducing the credit risk.
     The notional amounts for other off-balance-sheet risks express the dollar
volume of the transactions; however, the credit risk is much smaller.
     The Company performs credit reviews and enters into netting agreements to
minimize the credit risk of foreign currency and interest rate risk management
products.  Exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk is reduced by   
entering into offsetting positions.
     The amounts associated with off-balance-sheet risks are disclosed in Note
14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

                         Securities and Other Processing
Highlights:

 * Revenues in Government Securities Clearance were up 36% from 1992 as a
   result of higher volume from existing customers and many important new
   relationships.  We also experienced significant growth in tri-party
   repurchase agreements where we act as custodian.

 * For the fourth consecutive year The Bank of New York captured over 60% of the
   new public sponsored American Depositary Receipt business by establishing 75 
   new programs from 26 countries.

 * The Bank established the first two depositary receipt programs in the Peoples
   Republic of China and the first program in Turkey.  The Bank also acted as 
   custodian for the first Argentine company to use depositary receipts 
   to raise capital in the U.S. private market. 

 * Funds Transfer fees grew by 15% in 1993.  An important part of this 
   improvement resulted from increased dollar clearing activities in Russia, 
   Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Eastern Europe.  Also, we developed new and 
   expanded relationships with companies in the mortgage banking and securities 
   industries.     

<PAGE> 40

 * Growth in our Trade Finance area was due to an increase in market share and a
   significant increase in letters of credit and collections from Hong Kong, 
   China, Thailand, the Philippines, India, and Brazil.  

 * Corporate Trust fees increased 20% in 1993, due to an increase in market 
   share and a large volume of bond refinancings because of lower interest 
   rates.

 * The Bank of New York solidified its position as the leading provider of trust
   services for the debt derivative market with over $34 billion in securities 
   outstanding by year end, a fourfold increase over the previous year.  Debt 
   derivatives are secondary market products created for the purpose of 
   increasing investor yields. 

 * The Mutual Fund Division's revenues increased by 28% in  1993 largely due to 
   new business from companies in the insurance and securities industries.

 * In Stock Transfer, revenue increased 29%.  The Bank of New York received over
   50 new transfer agency appointments in 1993.  

<PAGE> 41

 * Fees in Master Trust/Master Custody increased by 18% due in large part to 
   new relationships in both the public and corporate sectors.

Overview:                                    
The Bank of New York is the leader in securities processing, and among the top
providers of other processing products, such as trade finance and funds
transfer.  In nearly all our businesses, the Bank is either the market leader
or among the top five providers of processing services.

Depositary Receipts  -- Commonly referred to as ADRs, they allow  foreign 
companies to offer their dollar denominated securities to investors in the 
United States.  In 1993 we continued to expand our leadership position and 
increased our market share to over 53% of all public sponsored Depositary 
Receipt programs.

Securities Lending -- Our global programs are designed for customers whose 
assets are held in custody at the Bank to increase the yield on their portfolio 
by lending their U.S. and non-U.S. dollar denominated securities.  Average daily
loan outstandings in the domestic market total approximately $25 billion.  
Overseas, we experienced significant growth in London and expanded our
securities lending operations to Hong Kong.

<PAGE> 43

Government Securities Clearance -- The Bank of New York is the market leader in 
government securities clearance and administration of tri-party repurchase 
agreements.  Through our highly automated systems and direct links to the 
Federal Reserve network, we clear a daily average of $400 billion in U.S. 
Government and Agencies securities.  This represents a 14% increase over the 
1992 level of $350 billion.

Mutual Fund Custody -- The Bank of New York is the second largest provider of 
mutual fund custody with $305 billion in assets under administration.  Services 
include securities safekeeping, payment of dividends to customers and portfolio 
valuation.

Unit Investment Trust -- The Bank provides trustee and custody services for  
over 3,800 trusts with an aggregate value of $25 billion.  Lower interest 
rates in 1993 triggered record redemptions of municipal bonds and slowed 
the number of new trusts established.

<PAGE> 44

Corporate Trust --  The Bank is the trustee for debt instruments issued 
by corporations and municipal, state, and federal government agencies. 
We offer a complete  product line that can be customized to meet issuers' 
requirements for all types of fixed-income securities.  We have
expanded our services to include the fast-growing market for such products 
as mortgage-backed, asset-backed and debt derivative securities.

Stock Transfer -- We provide complete record keeping and dividend disbursement 
services for 350 public companies with 7 million shareholders. This represents
an increase over 1992 of 27% in the number of companies as well as a 20% 
increase in the number of shareholders.

Master Trust/Master Custody  -- We provide custody and accounting services to 
public and corporate pension funds, foundations, endowments, and organizations 
having special compliance or tax reporting requirements.  The Bank is a leader 
in the public funds market.  We have been increasing our share of business with 
corporate retirement funds, and in 1993 added a substantial number of new 
relationships.

<PAGE> 45

Cash Management -- CA$H-Register (registered trademark) , one of the Bank's
proprietary electronic banking systems, provides corporate customers with a
computerized connection to the Bank to make payments and obtain information
on their banking activities. In 1993, the Bank introduced an enhancement to
CA$H-Register (registered trademark) that allows customers to access
information on their multicurrency accounts at banks worldwide.  

Funds Transfer -- The Bank clears an average of over $185 billion each day 
for domestic and foreign financial institutions.  Volume increased by 25% in 
1993 to a record 10 million transactions.

Trade Finance -- We provide a range of trade finance services, such as letters 
of credit, to many of America's leading corporations.  In addition, we 
are emphasizing the sale of these products to middle market companies located 
primarily in the New York metropolitan area. Our extensive international 
network of correspondent banks enables us to expedite customers' imports and 
exports around the globe, particularly in  Asia, Latin America and 
the Middle East.

                                   Retail Banking

Highlights:
* The Bank of New York introduced the sale of annuities* into its branch network
  with specially trained Investment Product Specialists.  They also sell three
  proprietary mutual funds:  the BNY Hamilton Equity Income Fund**, the BNY
  Hamilton Intermediate Government Fund** and the BNY Hamilton Intermediate New
  York Tax-Exempt Fund**.  Investment Product Specialists may be reached by
  calling 1-800-BNY-4IPS (1-800-269-4477).

*The Bank's 24-hour bank by phone service, 1-800-CALL-BNY, was enhanced with new
  features such as the ability to obtain information on IRA accounts as well as
  to obtain information or to place stop payments on Instant Credit checks.  

* ARCS Mortgage, Inc., our residential mortgage banking subsidiary, closed $3.7
  billion in single- and multi-family home mortgages in 1993, up 20% over 1992. 
  ARCS' loan servicing portfolio was $10.3 billion at year end.

retail network and expanded our presence to a two- state network of 
383 offices serving 24 counties.  

We offer the same full range of sophisticated products and services that are 
available to large corporations to individuals, professionals, small 
businesses, and municipalities. 

The Custom Banking and International Private Banking areas, based in New York, 
provide high-net-worth individuals with a customized range of private 
banking products and services -- from deposit products to personal trust and 
asset management, as well as tailored loan products.  The Bank's
asset management services have been of particular value to our 
clients in the current low-rate environment, as they seek to 
maximize returns on their investments.

                                   Credit Cards

                         The Bank of New York (Delaware)

Highlights:

         *    Credit card accounts increased in 1993 by 22% to a total of 4.8
              million, while managed credit card outstandings rose by 19% to a
              year-end total of $6.2 billion.  

         *    Over the last few years, we have experienced rapid growth in our
              credit card business.  Since 1991, compound growth rates of both
              accounts and outstandings have been more than twice those of the 
              industry.

         *    The Bank of New York (Delaware) has been a consistent leader in
              credit quality.  The charge-off rate of the entire card portfolio
              decreased to 3.2% in 1993 from 3.9% in 1992, and was approximately
              100 basis points below the industry average.

<PAGE> 49

         *   Two new products were introduced in the highly popular Consumers
             Edge family of cards: Consumers Edge 25 (registered trademark)
             and Consumers Edge Gold (registered trademark).  Like the
             original Consumers Edge card, both have no annual fee and
             offer one of the lowest rates nationally available.  Both new 
             cards also have a 25-day grace period.

         *   Three new major unions were added to the successful Union Privilege
             program: the American Teachers Federation, the Carpenters Union,
             and the Teamsters Union.  Aggressive marketing campaigns to solicit
             these unions' members showed excellent results in 1993 and
             additional campaigns are underway in 1994.

Overview:

The Bank of New York (Delaware) is the seventh-largest commercial bank issuer of
credit cards in the United States.  Its strategy is to be the nation's leading
provider of low rate, no annual fee credit cards.

<PAGE> 50

The Bank's portfolio includes two key programs:

         *    Consumers Edge is a no annual fee card with no grace period that
              appeals to customers who maintain outstanding balances. It offers
              one of the lowest annual percentage rates in the country.  

              Excellent growth in this portfolio during 1993 was driven by
              aggressive advertising and direct mail campaigns.  The response
              rate was more than twice that of the industry average.

         *    The Union Privilege MasterCard (registered trademark), also
              low rate with no annual fee, is offered on an exclusive basis
              to 13 million members of the AFL-CIO.  With more than 75
              affiliated unions participating, the Union Privilege program
              is the largest single affinity card program the country.
              Charge-offs in the Union Privilege program are lowest of all
              of our card portfolios.  

In 1993 we closed our credit card processing facility in South Dakota and
consolidated its operations into our Delaware facilities.  This action will 
reduce operating costs going forward.

                             Corporate Banking

Highlights:

        *    The Mortgage Banking Division, part of the Bank's Special
             Industries Sector, is a market leader in financing mortgage banking
             companies.  In 1993, we were lead agent on credit transactions
             totaling $1.4 billion.   Loan fee and service product income
             increased 50% over 1992 levels.

        *    The Bank of New York continued to expand its role as a leader in
             the broadly syndicated loan market.  Syndicated loan volume for
             1993 increased by over 50% from the previous year for transactions
             in which the Bank acted as arranger, agent or co-agent.  The number
             of administrative agencies we handle more than doubled and our fee
             income was up 36%.

<PAGE> 52

        *    The Bank is a leading lender to the Communications, Entertainment
             and Publishing industries.   The Bank's strong relationships with
             these industries and a history of successful lending resulted in
             the division more than doubling the number of new transactions at
             the agent or co-agent level during 1993. 

        *    BNY Financial Corporation, our factoring subsidiary, completed its
             tenth consecutive year of record earnings. Factored sales volume
             grew by 7% to an annual level of $7.6 billion.  Over one-half of
             new business was due to the introduction of a new proprietary
             product -- Accounts Receivable Management System -- which assists
             clients with back-office operations and financing their
             receivables.

        *    The Bank continued as a major user of The Export-Import Bank of the
             United States ("Eximbank") providing the only two bank-to-bank
             credit facilities approved for Russian banks.

<PAGE> 53

        *    As a result of intensive efforts to cross-sell processing and
             operating services, Middle Market Banking produced more than a 20%
             increase in cash management and trade fees.
