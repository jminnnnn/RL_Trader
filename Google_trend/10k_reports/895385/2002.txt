<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>The Company  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a leading owner and operator of six riverboat casinos located in the central United States. We pioneered riverboat gaming in St. Louis, Kansas City, Baton
Rouge and Sioux City by opening the first casino in each of those markets. Our riverboat casino that serves the Cincinnati market from Lawrenceburg, Indiana is one of the largest revenue producing
riverboats in the United States gaming industry. In the first quarter of 2001, we purchased our minority partners' collective 42.5% interest in the Lawrenceburg casino for approximately
$365&nbsp;million, giving us 100% ownership of the Lawrenceburg Partnership. As a result we now own 100% of all our casinos. On July&nbsp;31, 2001, we acquired 100% of the Empress Casino Joliet
for approximately $463.8&nbsp;million. The Empress Casino serves the Chicago, Illinois market. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are a Delaware corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 219 Piasa Street, Alton, Illinois 62002 and our telephone number is (618)&nbsp;474-7500. You

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lawrenceburg casino is located on the Ohio River in Lawrenceburg, Indiana approximately 15 miles west of
Cincinnati and is the closest casino to the Cincinnati metropolitan area. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>
The Lawrenceburg casino is one of the largest riverboats in the United States with 74,300 square feet of gaming space on three levels with 2,143 slot machines and 98 table games. We typically conduct
9 two-hour cruises seven days a week, with an additional cruise on Friday and Saturday evenings, for a total of 65 cruises per week. Each cruise lasts two hours including a 30 minute
boarding time and during peak periods we charge admission fees. Indiana gaming law permits dockside gaming only when inclement weather or water conditions prevent a riverboat from cruising. At such
times, the Lawrenceburg casino remains dockside and operates on its normal schedule. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
complex also features a 300 room hotel, a 200,000 square foot land-based entertainment pavilion and support facility offering a 350 seat buffet restaurant, two specialty
restaurants, an entertainment lounge and a 1,800 space parking garage. Employee and overflow parking is provided at a 1,400 space remote lot that is accessed by shuttle bus. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the first quarter of 2001, we acquired the minority interests in Indiana Gaming Company, L.P., the Indiana partnership that owns and operates the Lawrenceburg casino. Prior to this
acquisition, we were the 57.5% majority partner with Conseco Entertainment, L.L.C. and Centaur,&nbsp;Inc. owning 29% and 13.5% limited partnership interests, respectively. We completed our purchase
of Conseco's and Centaur's minority interests on February&nbsp;22, 2001 and March&nbsp;8, 2001, respectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital Improvements:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, we spent approximately $6.4&nbsp;million on capital improvements including
$3.4&nbsp;million on slot machines and related systems. In 2002, we intend to spend approximately $6.6&nbsp;million on capital improvements at the casino, including $3.5&nbsp;million on slot
machines and related equipment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaming Market:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lawrenceburg casino draws from a population of approximately 1.6&nbsp;million residents in the
Cincinnati metropolitan area and an additional 5.4&nbsp;million people who reside within 100 miles of Lawrenceburg, including the major metropolitan markets of Dayton and Columbus, Ohio and, to a
lesser extent, Indianapolis, Indiana and Lexington, Kentucky. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the Cincinnati market, the Lawrenceburg casino directly competes with two other riverboat casinos. The three riverboat casinos operating in the Cincinnati market generated
$573&nbsp;million of gaming revenues in 2001, a 12% increase from 2000. In 2001, the Lawrenceburg casino represented 44% of gaming position capacity in the Cincinnati market, and captured 60% of the
market's gaming revenues. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Lawrenceburg Casino is the closest casino to the Cincinnati metropolitan area. Our nearest competitor is located approximately 15 miles further south of Lawrenceburg in Rising Sun,
Indiana. The newest competitor, which opened in October&nbsp;2000, is located 40 miles from Lawrenceburg in Switzerland County, Indiana. Secondarily, we compete with a riverboat casino in

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alton Belle Casino is located on the Mississippi River in Alton, Illinois approximately 20 miles northeast of
downtown St. Louis. We commenced operations in Alton, Illinois in September&nbsp;1991 as the first gaming facility in Illinois and the St. Louis metropolitan market. Following the success of our
original Alton riverboat casino, we built and opened a larger three-deck contemporary style cruise liner. The cruise liner features 26,700 square feet of gaming space, 1,013 slot machines
and 28 table games. In June&nbsp;1999, Illinois passed a law permitting casinos to offer continuous dockside gaming. As a result, the Alton Belle Casino remains dockside and offers its customers
unlimited ingress and egress during its hours of operation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Alton property includes an approximately 60,000 square foot entertainment pavilion and features a 124 seat buffet, a fine dining restaurant and a 400 seat main showroom. Parking is
available at an adjacent city-owned surface parking facility and at two sites in the city of Alton, to and from which we provide valet parking as well as free shuttle service. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital Improvements:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, we completed an approximately $4.5&nbsp;million renovation to improve the Alton casino,
including the addition of 100 slot machines. Additionally, we plan to spend approximately $2.6&nbsp;million in maintenance capital in 2002, including $1.0&nbsp;million on slot machines. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaming Market:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alton Belle Casino generally draws from a population of approximately 2.5&nbsp;million within the St.
Louis metropolitan area and an additional 1.2&nbsp;million within a 100-mile radius of the City of St. Louis. The target customers of the Alton Belle Casino are drawn largely from the
northern and eastern regions of the greater St. Louis metropolitan area, as well as portions of central and southern Illinois. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Alton Belle Casino faces competition from four other riverboat casino companies currently operating in the St. Louis area, including one other Illinois licensee. As an Illinois
licensee, the Alton Belle Casino is not subject to Missouri's $500 loss limit and therefore has a competitive advantage in attracting high-end customers over the three competitors
operating under Missouri licenses. The riverboat casinos operating in the St. Louis market generated $766&nbsp;million of gaming revenues in 2001,
a 12% increase from 2000. The Alton Belle Casino represented approximately 12% of gaming position capacity in the St. Louis market, and captured approximately 16% of the market's gaming revenues. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulatory Update:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illinois gaming law currently limits the number of gaming licenses to be issued in the state to ten. Each
license permits the operation of up to two boats as part of a single riverboat gaming operation with a combined maximum of 1,200 gaming positions as defined by the state. Our Illinois gaming license
is subject to renewal in October&nbsp;2003. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
June&nbsp;1999, Illinois passed an amendment to the Illinois Riverboat Gambling Act to permit casinos to offer continuous dockside gaming with unlimited ingress and egress. As a
result of litigation challenging certain provisions of the 1999 amendment, dockside gaming could be overturned and we could be required to suspend dockside gaming activities at our Alton casino until
such time as the Illinois legislature reauthorized dockside gaming. We are unable to determine what the ultimate resolution of the litigation will be; however, the loss of dockside gaming at our Alton
casino would adversely affect our financial results. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital Improvements:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2001, we spent $2.0&nbsp;million on maintenance capital, including $0.9&nbsp;million on slot

Additionally, we anticipate beginning a major expansion and renovation of our Kansas City property in 2002. The new project will allow us to replace our existing riverboat casino with a single level
58,000 square foot
barge, accommodating approximately 2,000 gaming positions. A major renovation and expansion of the existing pavilion will add new dining options, plus additional surface and VIP parking. Our master
plan for this property would allow for a future hotel and additional garage space if the need or opportunity arises. </FONT></P>

primarily attracts customers who reside in the northern and western regions of the Kansas City metropolitan area. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
currently face competition from three other casinos in the Kansas City area. The four riverboat casinos operating in the Kansas City market generated $582&nbsp;million of gaming

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Argosy Casino Baton Rouge is located on the Mississippi River in downtown Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The riverboat
features approximately 28,000 square feet of gaming space, 778 slot machines and 37 table games. The Baton Rouge casino began operations in September&nbsp;1994 as the first riverboat gaming facility
in the Baton Rouge market. Louisiana recently adopted legislation effective April&nbsp;1, 2001, that permits dockside gaming, allowing customers unlimited ingress and egress, and eliminating the
three hour cruising requirements. This legislation also increased the tax on riverboat operations from 18.5% to 21.5%. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital Improvements:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2001, we spent approximately $1.8&nbsp;million in capital improvements including approximately

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaming Market:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baton Rouge casino draws from a population of approximately 540,000 in the Baton Rouge metropolitan area.
The Baton Rouge casino faces competition from one casino located in downtown Baton Rouge, a nearby Native American casino and operators of video poker machines in non-casino locations in
certain Baton Rouge parishes. The two riverboat casinos operating in the Baton Rouge market generated approximately $172&nbsp;million of gaming revenues in 2001, a 5% increase from 2000. The Argosy
Casino Baton Rouge represented 45% of gaming position capacity in the Baton Rouge market and generated 45% of the market's gaming revenues. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Belle of Sioux City is located on the Missouri River in downtown Sioux City, Iowa. The riverboat features
12,500 square feet of gaming space, 419 slot machines and 21 table games. The Belle of Sioux City typically conducts one two-hour cruise each day for 100&nbsp;days per year. At all other
times the Belle of Sioux City remains dockside and operates with unlimited ingress and egress. The casino is complemented by adjacent barge facilities featuring buffet dining facilities, meeting space
and administrative support offices. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
July&nbsp;2000, we purchased the 30% minority interest in the Belle of Sioux City Casino from Sioux City Riverboat Corp.,&nbsp;Inc. for $9.2&nbsp;million. Prior to this
acquisition, we were a 70% general partner and received a management fee of 4.5% based upon the facility's adjusted gross gaming revenues. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital Improvements:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, we spent approximately $1.1&nbsp;million to enhance our customers' gaming experience at the
Belle of Sioux City. Specifically, we spent $0.2&nbsp;million on slot machines. We expect to spend approximately $1.0&nbsp;million in capital improvements in 2002, including $0.4&nbsp;million on
slot machines and related upgrades. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaming Market:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Belle of Sioux City draws from a population of approximately 80,000 in Sioux City and an estimated 100,000
residents within a 40-mile radius of Sioux City. The Belle of Sioux City competes primarily with land-based Native American casinos that are not required to report gaming
revenues and other operating statistics, therefore market comparisons cannot be made. We also compete with certain providers and operators of video gaming in the neighboring state of South Dakota. In
addition, we compete with slot machines at a pari-mutuel race track in Council Bluffs, Iowa and with two riverboat casinos in the Council Bluffs/Omaha, Nebraska market. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulatory Update:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Iowa gaming license is subject to annual renewal each March. In addition, Iowa law stipulates that a
referendum must be held every eight years to reaffirm gaming in each county with gaming. This referendum is scheduled for November&nbsp;2002. We expect to campaign for the passage of the referendum
supporting gaming in the county in which our Sioux City casino operates. Should this gaming referendum fail, we would be unable to continue our gaming operations in Sioux City. </FONT></P>

southwest of Chicago and approximately two miles from the intersection of Interstate 55 and Interstate 80. The casino consists of two adjacent riverboat vessels providing a combined 36,066 square feet
of gaming space with 1,113 slot machines and 32 table games. Both riverboats remain dockside and offer customers unlimited ingress and egress. The complex features a 150,000 square foot Egyptian
themed pavilion with three restaurants, an entertainment lounge and banquet/conference facilities. The pavilion also contains an off-track pari-mutuel betting parlor. The
complex also includes a 102 room hotel, surface parking areas with approximately 2,350 spaces and an 80 space recreational vehicle park. We acquired 100% of the Empress Casino Joliet as of
July&nbsp;31, 2001 for approximately $463.8&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

including approximately $4.0&nbsp;million on slot machines and related equipment. During 2002, we anticipate beginning construction of a barge complex to replace the current gaming vessels. This new
barge will be a single-level 75,000 square foot facility accommodating more than 1,300 gaming positions. This new facility will enhance customer appeal in this competitive market and will deliver a
number of operational efficiencies at the same time. This will be the first step in our long-range development plan for the 300 surrounding acres. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaming Market:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Empress Casino Joliet draws from a population of approximately eight million people who reside within 50

Empress Casino Joliet are drawn largely from the southern and western regions of the greater Chicago metropolitan area, as well as portions of north central Illinois. The eight riverboat casinos
operating in the Chicago market generated approximately $2.0&nbsp;billion of gaming revenues in 2001, an 8% increase from 2000. The Empress Casino Joliet had 1,305 gaming positions in the Chicago
market as of December&nbsp;31, 2001 and captured 11% of the market's casino revenues for the five months ended December&nbsp;31, 2001. </FONT></P>

and do not anticipate making, material expenditures in order to comply with applicable provisions of these laws and regulations. However, the coverage and attendant compliance costs associated with
these laws, regulations and ordinances may result in future additional costs. The Department of Transportation has proposed regulations requiring owners and operators of certain vessels to establish
through the U.S. Coast Guard evidence of financial responsibility in the amount of $5.5&nbsp;million for clean-up of oil pollution. This requirement can be satisfied by either proof of adequate
insurance, including self-insurance, or the posting of a surety bond or guaranty. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
riverboats must comply with U.S. Coast Guard requirements as to boat design, on-board facilities, equipment, personnel and safety. Each riverboat must hold a certificate of
seaworthiness or must be approved by the American Bureau of Shipping ("ABS") for stabilization and flotation, and may also be subject to local zoning and building codes. The U.S. Coast Guard
requirements establish design standards, set limits on the operation of the vessels and require individual licensing of all personnel involved with the operation of the vessels. Loss of a vessel's
certificate of seaworthiness or ABS approval would preclude its use as a floating casino. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanently
moored vessels are not required to hold certificates of documentation and inspection from the U.S. Coast Guard. However, the permanently moored vessels are inspected by a
third party and certified with respect to stability and single compartment flooding integrity. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
marine operation employees may be subject to the Jones Act which, among other things, exempts those employees from state limits on workers' compensation awards. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations
adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Treasury Department require us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 by a single customer
occurring within a gaming day, including identifying the customer by name and social security number. The regulation provides that substantial penalties can be imposed for each instance of a failure
to report. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Insurance  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We carry property and casualty insurance on our land-based assets and our vessels, generally in the amount of their replacement costs, with a nominal
deductible with respect to our land-based assets and a deductible equal to 2% of the replacement value of the vessels. Our land-based assets are covered by flood and earthquake
insurance. Our general liability insurance with respect to land-based operations
has a limit of $1&nbsp;million per occurrence and $2&nbsp;million as an annual aggregate with a $50,000 self-insured retention. Our general liability insurance with respect to our
marine operations has a $100,000 per occurrence self-insured retention with per occurrence coverage up to a $200&nbsp;million limit. With respect to worker's compensation, we have a
$100,000 per occurrence deductible with a $1&nbsp;million per occurrence limit. We carry business interruption insurance at our properties which carry a deductible ranging from 14 to 30&nbsp;days
depending on the location and maximum coverage up to $35&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

class action lawsuits pending in Las Vegas, Nevada. The suits allege that the Gaming Industry Defendants violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO") by engaging in a
course of fraudulent and misleading conduct intended to induce people to play their gaming machines based upon a false belief concerning how those gaming machines actually operate, as well as to the
extent to which there is actually an opportunity to win on any given play. The suits seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. On January&nbsp;14, 1997, the Court consolidated all three
actions under the case name </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>William H. Poulos, etc. v. Caesars World,&nbsp;Inc., et al.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> On February&nbsp;13, 1997, the plaintiffs filed a

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;21, 1997, Deborah S. Whitacre filed an action in the Circuit Court of Dearborn County, Indiana as Cause
No.&nbsp;15CO1-9703-CP-073, challenging the validity of a lease to the City by the Conservancy District of Lawrenceburg, Indiana (the "District") of certain land
owned by the District, which land has in turn been subleased by the City to the Company's affiliate Indiana Gaming, L.P. and is being used for development and operation of the riverboat gaming
facility in the City for which Indiana Gaming, L.P. has been awarded a riverboat owner's license by the Commission. Defendants are
the District and its individual directors. In 1998, Indiana Gaming, L.P. was permitted to intervene and is now contesting the action. The District and its directors have advised that they are
contesting the action and intend to continue to do so. An adverse ruling in this matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;26, 1997, Capitol House filed an amended petition in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for East Baton Rouge Parish, State of Louisiana, on
November&nbsp;26, 1997, amending its previously filed but unserved suit against Richard Perryman, the person selected by the Louisiana Gaming Division to evaluate and rank the applicants seeking a
gaming license for East Baton Rouge Parish, and now adding its state law claims against Jazz, the Former Jazz Shareholders, Argosy Gaming Company, Argosy of Louisiana,&nbsp;Inc. and Catfish Queen
Partnership in Commendam, d/b/a the Belle of Baton Rouge Casino. This suit alleges that these parties violated the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act in connection with obtaining the gaming license
that was issued to the Company. The defendants have filed exceptions which contest the right of Capitol House to attack in this lawsuit the final decision of the Louisiana Gaming Enforcement Division
in granting a gaming license to the defendants and denying the license to Capitol House. The trial court overruled the defendants' exceptions, but the defendants have applied to the Louisiana First
Circuit Court of Appeal for a writ of review. The Court has not acted upon the writ application at this time. If the First Circuit grants the writ and rules in favor of the defendants, the claims of
Capitol House will be dismissed. </FONT></P>

Company intends to seek indemnification from the Former Jazz Shareholders for any liability the Company, Argosy Louisiana or Jazz suffers as a result of such cause of action. As part
of the consideration payable by the Company to the Former Jazz Shareholders for the acquisition of Jazz, the Company agreed at the time of such acquisition to annual deferred purchase price payments
of $1,350,000 for each of the first ten years after closing and $500,000 for each of the next ten years. Payments are to be made quarterly by the Company. The definitive acquisition documents provide

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
the Company's initial public offering in February&nbsp;1993, the Company has not declared any cash dividends or distributions on its Common Stock. Although the Company currently
intends to retain its earnings to finance future growth and therefore has no present intention of paying dividends, this policy will be reviewed quarterly by the Company's Board of Directors in light
of, among other things, its results of operations, capital requirements, any restrictions imposed by applicable gaming regulations and restrictions imposed by the Company's indentures and loan
documents. At present the Company's Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated July&nbsp;31, 2001, requires the consent of the lenders in order to declare a dividend. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Overview  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We own and operate the Alton Belle Casino in Alton, Illinois; the Argosy Casino in Riverside, Missouri; the Argosy Casino in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; the Belle of
Sioux City Casino in Sioux City, Iowa; the Argosy Casino and Hotel in Lawrenceburg, Indiana; and the Empress Casino Joliet in Joliet, Illinois. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
acquired the minority interests in our Lawrenceburg, Indiana Casino and Hotel during the first quarter of 2001. Following the acquisition of these minority interests, we now own 100%
of all our operations and are no longer required to record minority interest expense. On July&nbsp;31, 2001, we acquired the Empress Casino Joliet. The results of our operations include the results
of Empress Casino Joliet for the five months ended December&nbsp;31, 2001. </FONT></P>

minority interests and our acquisition of the Empress Casino Joliet. Also during 2001, we spent $20.6&nbsp;million in financing fees related to the Lawrenceburg and Empress Casino Joliet
acquisitions. Cash flows in 2001 and 2000 were used for payment of long-term debt, repayment of partner loans and distributions related to the Lawrenceburg partnership. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent
with gaming industry practice, we conduct our operations with a net working capital deficit. Unlike traditional industrial companies, a gaming company's balance sheet has
limited accounts
receivable and inventories. In addition, casinos generate significant cash on a daily basis. We generally apply our daily cash flows to pay down indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and
pay our current liabilities pursuant to their normal cycles. Given the significant daily cash flows generated by our operations and the financial flexibility provided by our credit facility, the
existence of a working capital deficit has no impact on our ability to operate our business or meet our obligations as they become due. We believe that cash on hand, operating cash flows, and funds
available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our current operating, capital expenditure and debt service obligations for the next 12&nbsp;months. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Critical Accounting Policies  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which requires our management
to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have summarized our significant accounting policies in Note&nbsp;1 to our consolidated financial
statements. Of our accounting policies, we believe the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Goodwill</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&#151;We have approximately $727&nbsp;million of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet at December&nbsp;31, 2001,
related to acquisitions. We regularly evaluate our acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators. Additionally, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets," on January&nbsp;1, 2002, that requires us to perform impairment testing at least annually. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on, among
other things, the regulatory and market status and operational performance of each of our acquired businesses. Future events could significantly impact our judgments and any resulting impairment loss
could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Property and Equipment</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&#151;Our operations are capital intensive and we have made significant capital investments in each of our
properties. At December&nbsp;31, 2001, we have approximately $443&nbsp;million of net property and equipment recorded on our balance sheet. We depreciate our assets on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimate of the useful lives is based on the nature of the asset as well as our current operating strategy. Future events, such as property expansions, new
competition and new regulations, could result in a change in the manner in which we are using certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets. In assessing the
recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. If these estimates or the related assumptions change
in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Insurance Accruals</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&#151;Our insurance for workers' compensation and general patron liability has significant deductible levels on
an individual claim basis. We accrue a liability for known workers' compensation and general patron liability based upon claims reserves established by the third party administrator processing our
claims. Additionally, we accrue an amount for incurred but not reported claims based on our historical experience and other factors. Our employee health insurance benefit accrual is based on our
historical claims experience rate including an estimated lag factor. These accruals involve
complex estimates and could be significantly affected should current claims vary from historical levels. Our insurance accruals are reviewed by management for adequacy at the end of each reporting
period. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Market Risk&#151;Interest Rate Sensitivity  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market risk inherent in our financial instruments is the potential loss in fair value arising from adverse changes in interest rates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
use interest rate swap agreements from separate financial institutions to manage our interest rate risk associated with our term loan as required under the credit facility. We have
entered into three interest rate swaps that have fixed the interest rate as of October&nbsp;31, 2001, for $200&nbsp;million of our variable rate term loan under our credit facility. The three
separate swap agreements carry original notional amounts of $100&nbsp;million, $50&nbsp;million and $50&nbsp;million. For each swap agreement, we agree to receive a floating rate of interest on
the notional principal amount based upon a three month LIBOR rate (plus a 2.75% spread) in exchange for fixed rates ranging from 6.19% to 6.27%. All three swap agreements mature on
September&nbsp;30, 2004. Two of the three swap agreements have reductions in the notional amounts proportionally with the quarterly payments on the term loan beginning December&nbsp;31, 2001. The
total notional amounts are $199.8&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2001. As a result of all three swap agreements, we have, in effect, converted 45.8% of our variable rate debt under our credit
facility to fixed rate debt at December&nbsp;31, 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December&nbsp;31, 2001, the fair value of our swap agreements is reported on the balance sheet in other assets ($3.1&nbsp;million pretax) and the related change in fair value of
these agreements is deferred in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ($1.8&nbsp;million net of taxes of $1.3&nbsp;million). </FONT></P>

the public and, through our subsidiaries, operates riverboat casinos in Alton and Joliet, Illinois; Lawrenceburg, Indiana; Riverside, Missouri; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Sioux City, Iowa. Except
where otherwise noted, the words "we," "us," "our" and similar terms, as well as "Argosy" or the "Company", refer to Argosy Gaming Company and all of its subsidiaries. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our controlled
subsidiaries and partnerships. We have eliminated all significant intercompany transactions. Under certain conditions, our subsidiaries are required to obtain approval from state gaming authorities
before making distributions to Argosy. </FONT></P>

2000, 1999 and quarterly financial information amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2001 presentation. </FONT></P>

long-lived assets, including goodwill, to be held and used might not be recoverable, the expected future undiscounted cash flows from the assets is estimated and compared with the carrying
amount of the assets. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recorded. The impairment loss is measured on a
location-by-location basis by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying amount. Long-lived assets that are held for disposal are reported at the
lower of the assets' carrying amount or fair value less costs related to the assets' disposition. </FONT></P>

effective beginning with the first quarter 2001, which requires the cash-back component of our "Argosy Preferred Card" customer loyalty program, including promotional coupons, be
classified as a reduction of revenues. These amounts had previously been classified as casino and selling, general and
administrative expenses. The new guidance impacts only the classification of these amounts on our income statement with no impact on income from operations. We reclassified $44,211 and $34,903 for the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, from cost and expenses to promotional allowances to reflect the impact of implementing this new guidance. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
June&nbsp;2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.&nbsp;141, "Business Combinations", No.&nbsp;142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" and
No.&nbsp;143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No.&nbsp;141 requires all business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. SFAS No.&nbsp;141
is required to be implemented for all acquisitions initiated after June&nbsp;30, 2001, and all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is
July&nbsp;1, 2001, or later. We applied SFAS No.&nbsp;141 for our acquisition of the Empress Casino Joliet. Our consolidated financial statements were not impacted by the adoption of SFAS
No.&nbsp;141. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
SFAS No.&nbsp;142, goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer subject to amortization over their useful lives, rather, they are subject to assessments
for impairment at least annually. Also, under SFAS No.&nbsp;142, an intangible asset should be recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights
or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. Such intangibles will be amortized over their useful lives. Under SFAS No.&nbsp;142, our acquisition of the
Empress Casino Joliet was immediately subject to the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;142. For all goodwill and intangible assets acquired before June&nbsp;30, 2001, SFAS No.&nbsp;142 will be
implemented on January&nbsp;1, 2002. We will test these assets for impairment at least annually. Other than during any periods in which we may record a charge for impairment, we expect the adoption
of SFAS No.&nbsp;142 will result in increased income as a result of reduced amortization expense. Based on our preliminary evaluation, we expect amortization expense for the year ended </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application
of the nonamortization provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;142 to goodwill acquired prior to June&nbsp;30, 2001, is expected to result in an increase in net income of $8,559 in
2002. We will test goodwill for impairment using the two-step process prescribed in SFAS No.&nbsp;142. The first step is a screen for potential impairment, while the second step measures
the amount of the impairment, if any. We expect to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of January&nbsp;1, 2002, in the first
quarter of 2002. Impairment charges, if any, resulting from these transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of
2002. We have not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on our earnings and our financial position. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
SFAS No.&nbsp;143, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is required to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of
fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. SFAS No.&nbsp;143 will be implemented by us on
January&nbsp;1, 2003. Adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;143 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>6. Derivative Financial Instruments  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2001, we adopted SFAS&nbsp;133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS&nbsp;133 requires all derivative financial
instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measured at fair value. As we had no outstanding derivative financial instruments at
January&nbsp;1, 2001, the adoption of SFAS&nbsp;133 had no impact on our financial statements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
use interest rate swap agreements from separate financial institutions to manage our interest rate risk associated with our term loan as required under the credit facility. We have
entered into three interest rate swaps that have fixed the interest rate as of October&nbsp;31, 2001, for $200,000 of our variable rate term loan under our credit facility. The three separate swap
agreements carry original notional amounts of $100,000, $50,000 and $50,000. For each swap agreement, we agree to receive a floating rate of interest on the notional amount based upon a three month
LIBOR rate (plus a 2.75% spread) in exchange for fixed rates ranging from 6.19% to 6.27%. All three swap agreements mature on September&nbsp;30, 2004. Two of the three swap agreements have
reductions in the notional amounts proportionally with the quarterly payments on the term loan beginning December&nbsp;31, 2001. The total notional amounts are $199,750 at December&nbsp;31, 2001. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
present interest rate swap agreements are cash flow hedges as we agree to pay fixed rates of interest, which are hedging against changes in the amount of future cash flows associated
with variable interest obligations. Accordingly, the fair value of our swap agreements is reported on the balance sheet in other assets ($3,066 pretax at December&nbsp;31, 2001) and the related
change in fair value of these agreements is deferred in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ($1,809, net of taxes of $1,257, at December&nbsp;31, 2001).
These deferred amounts are then recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period in which the related interest payments being hedged are recorded in income. If any of these
agreements are determined to have hedge ineffectiveness, the gains or losses associated with the ineffective portion of these agreements are </FONT></P>

Preferred Shares had been converted into 1,331,980 shares of common stock. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 1999, the remaining Preferred Shares were converted into 2,310,011 shares of common

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We adopted the Argosy Gaming Company Stock Option Plan, as amended, ("Stock Option Plan"), which provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options
for up to 2,500,000 shares of common stock to our key employees. These options expire 10&nbsp;years after their respective grant dates and become exercisable over specified vesting periods. At
December&nbsp;31, 2001, options for 452,187 shares are exercisable under the Stock Option Plan at a weighted-average price of $5.83. The weighted-average contractual life of outstanding options at
December&nbsp;31, 2001, is approximately 6.9&nbsp;years and the weighted-average exercise price of options outstanding is $7.57. The weighted-average fair value of options granted was $11.61,
$9.90 and $3.07, during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
also have adopted the Argosy Gaming Company 1993 Directors Stock Option Plan ("Directors Option Plan"), which provides for a total of 50,000 shares of common stock to be authorized
and reserved for issuance. The Directors Option Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options at fair market value to our non-employee directors. These options
expire five years after their respective grant dates and become exercisable over a specified vesting period. At December&nbsp;31, 2001, no options are exercisable. The weighted-average contractual
life of outstanding options at December&nbsp;31, 2001, is approximately 4.2&nbsp;years and the weighted-average exercise price of options outstanding is $22.30. The weighted-average fair value of
options granted during 2001 was $11.51. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"), and related interpretations in accounting for employee stock options.
Under APB 25, we do not recognize compensation expense when the exercise price of employee stock options equals or exceeds the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have adopted the disclosure only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123 ("SFAS&nbsp;123"), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation." Accordingly,
no compensation expense has been recognized for either stock plan. Had the valuation methods under SFAS&nbsp;123 been used for our stock option grants, our fiscal 2001 pro forma net income
attributable to common stockholders would
have been $65,425 and pro forma diluted net income per share would have been $2.23. The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following assumptions: dividend yield of zero; expected volatility 51.3%; risk-free interest rate of 4.75%; and expected option life of five years. Our fiscal 2000 pro forma net income
attributable to common stockholders would have been $45,007 and the pro forma diluted net income per share would have been $1.54. The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of zero; expected volatility 57.0%; risk-free interest rate of 6%; and expected option life of five
years. The fiscal 1999 pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders would have been $11,089 and the pro forma diluted net income per share would have been $0.38. The fair value of each
option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of zero; expected volatility 56.5%; risk-free interest

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2000, 99,000 shares of restricted stock issued by us in 1997 vested. Compensation expense was amortized for restricted stock issued over the period from
the date of grant until the respective vesting dates. Compensation expense of $39 and $113 was recognized in 2000 and 1999, respectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>14. Employees Benefit Plan  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We established a 401(k) defined-contribution plan, which covers substantially all of our full-time employees. Participants can contribute a portion of
their eligible salaries (as defined) subject to maximum limits, as determined by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. We match a portion of participants' contributions in an amount determined
annually by us. Expense recognized under the plan was approximately $1,935, $1,715 and $1,145 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>15. Acquisitions  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, we purchased the 42.5% limited partnership interests in the Argosy Casino and Hotel in Lawrenceburg, Indiana (the "Lawrenceburg Casino") for an aggregate

preferred equity interests and outstanding partner loans. As a result of these acquisitions, we now own 100% of the Lawrenceburg Casino. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
purchase prices for the minority interests were determined based upon estimates of future cash flows and evaluations of the net worth of the assets acquired. The purchases were
accounted for under the purchase method. Our purchase price allocation resulted in approximately $298,000 in goodwill, which was being amortized over a 40-year life. In accordance with
SFAS&nbsp;142, amortization of the remaining book value of goodwill will cease as of January&nbsp;1, 2002, and will be tested for impairment at least annually. The purchases were funded with

July&nbsp;31, 2001, we diversified our operations and cash flows by completing the acquisition of 100% of the Empress Casino Joliet Corporation (with casino operations located in
Joliet, Illinois) for approximately $463,764. The purchase price was determined based upon estimates of future cash flows and the net worth of the assets acquired. We funded this acquisition through
the issuance of subordinated notes and borrowings under the credit facility. The results of operations for the Empress Casino Joliet for the five months ended December&nbsp;31, 2001, since the
acquisition, are included in our consolidated statements of income. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
Third party valuations have been obtained for property and equipment and intangible assets. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Board of Directors<BR>
Argosy Gaming Company </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Argosy Gaming Company as of December&nbsp;31, 2001 and 2000 and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2001. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item&nbsp;14(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule
based on our audits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Argosy Gaming Company at December&nbsp;31,
2001 and 2000 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly
in all material respects the information set forth therein. </FONT></P>

                             NOTES AND INSTRUCTIONS

NOTE 1: State the true exact corporate name as it appears on the records of
        the office of the Secretary of State, BEFORE any amendments herein
        reported.

NOTE 2: Incorporators are permitted to adopt amendments ONLY before any
        shares have been issued and before any directors have been named or
        elected.                                                 (Section 10.10)

NOTE 3: Directors may adopt amendments without shareholder approval in only
        six instances, as follows:

     (a) to remove the names and addresses of directors named in the articles of
         incorporation;

     (b) to remove the name and address of the initial registered agent and
         registered office, provided a statement pursuant to Section 5.10 is
         also filed;

     (c) to split the issued whole shares and unissued authorized shares by
         multiplying them by a whole number, so long as no class or series is
         adversely affected thereby;

     (d) to change the corporate name by substituting the word "corporation",
         "incorporated", "company", "limited", or the abbrevation "corp.",
         "inc.", "co.", or "ltd." for a similar word or abbreviation in the
         name, or by adding a geographical attribution to the name;

     (e) to reduce the authorized shares of any class pursuant to a cancellation
         statement filed in accordance with Section 9.05,

     (f) to restate the articles of incorporation as currently amended.
                                                                 (Section 10.15)

NOTE 4: All amendments not adopted under Section 10.10 or Section 10.15 require
        (1) that the board of directors adopt a resolution setting forth the
        proposed amendment and (2) that the shareholders approve the amendment.

        Shareholder approval may be (1) by vote at a shareholders' meeting
        (EITHER ANNUAL OR SPECIAL) or (2) by consent, in writing, without a
        meeting.

        To be adopted, the amendment must receive the affirmative vote or
        consent of the holders of at least 2/3 of the outstanding shares
        entitled to vote on the amendment (BUT IF CLASS VOTING APPLIES, THEN
        ALSO AT LEAST A 2/3 VOTE WITHIN EACH CLASS IS REQUIRED).

        The articles of incorporation may supercede the 2/3 vote requirement by
        specifying any smaller or larger vote requirement not less than a
        majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote and not less than a
        majority within each class when class voting applies.    (Section 10.20)

NOTE 5: When shareholder approval is by consent, all shareholders must be
        given notice of the proposed amendment at least 5 days before the
        consent is signed. If the amendment is adopted, shareholders who have
        not signed the consent must be promptly notified of the passage of the
        amendment.                                       (Sections 7.10 & 10.20)

NOTE 1: State the true exact corporate name as it appears on the records of
        the office of the Secretary of State, BEFORE any amendments herein
        reported.

NOTE 2: Incorporators are permitted to adopt amendments ONLY before any
        shares have been issued and before any directors have been named or
        elected.                                                 (Section 10.10)

NOTE 3: Directors may adopt amendments without shareholder approval in only
        six instances, as follows:

        (a)  to remove the names and addresses of directors named in the
             articles of incorporation;

        (b)  to remove the name and address of the initial registered agent and
             registered office, provided a statement pursuant to Section 5.10
             is also filed;

        (c)  to split the issued whole shares and unissued authorized shares by
             multiplying them by a whole number, so long as no class or series
             is adversely affected thereby:

        (d)  to change the corporate name by substituting the word
             "corporation", "incorporated", "company", "limited", or the
             abbrevation "corp.", "inc.", "co.", or "ltd." for a similar word or
             abbreviation in the name, or by adding a geographical attribution
             to the name;

        (e)  to reduce the authorized shares of any class pursuant to a

NOTE 4: All amendments not adopted under Section 10.10 or Section 10.15 require

        To be adopted, the amendment must receive the affirmative vote or
        consent of the holders of at least 2/3 of the outstanding shares
        entitled to vote on the amendment (BUT IF CLASS VOTING APPLIES, THEN
        ALSO AT LEAST A 2/3 VOTE WITHIN EACH CLASS IS REQUIRED).

        The articles of incorporation may supercede the 2/3 vote requirement by

        majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote and not less than a
        majority within each class when class voting applies.    (Section 10.20)

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     The Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") is dated as
of _______________, 1994 and is entered into by and between River Casino
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("RCC"), and Empress River Casino
Corporation, an Illinois corporation (the "corporation" or, in its capacity as
the surviving corporation of the Merger, the "Surviving Corporation").

                                 R E C I T A L S

     A. RCC and the Corporation currently have identical equity ownership. The
outstanding capital stock of RCC consists only of one class of common stock,
$.01 par value per share ("RCC Common"), of which 1,150 shares of RCC Common are
issued and outstanding as of the date hereof. The outstanding capital stock of
the Corporation consists only of one class of common stock, no par value per
share ("Company Common"), of which 1,150 shares of company common are issued and
outstanding as of the date hereof.

     B. RCC desires to merge with and into the Corporation with the Corporation
as the surviving entity of the merger (the "Merger"), all on the terms and
subject to the conditions contained in this Merger Agreement.

                               A G R E E M E N T S

     Therefore, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                             THE MERGER TRANSACTION

     1.1 THE MERGER. RCC shall be merged into the Corporation pursuant to
Section 11.25 of the Business Corporation Act of 1983 of the State of Illinois
(the "BCA") and Section 252(c) of the General Corporation Law of the state of
Delaware, and the separate corporate existence of RCC will cease.

     1.2 EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall be effective at 10:00
a.m., Central Daylight Savings Time, on the date the Articles of Merger
providing for the Merger are filed with the Secretary of State of the state of
Illinois in accordance with the BCA ("Effective Time").

<Page>

                                   ARTICLE II

          SURVIVAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

     2.1 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION. At the Effective Time, the Articles of
Incorporation of the Corporation as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be the Articles or Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, and
thereafter may be amended in accordance with their terms and as provided by law.

     2.2 BY-LAWS. At the Effective Time, the By-laws of the Corporation as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation, and thereafter may be amended or repealed in accordance
with their terms.

     2.3 OFFICERS. At the Effective Time, the officers of the Corporation
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation and will hold office from the Effective Time until their successors
shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided
in the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, or as
otherwise provided by law, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.

     2.4 DIRECTORS. At the Effective Time, the directors of the Corporation
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation and will hold office from the Effective Time for the balance of the
respective terms for which they were previously elected as directors of the
Corporation and until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified in the manner provided in the Articles of Incorporation and
By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, or as otherwise provided by law, or until

                              CONVERSION OF SHARES

     3.1 CONVERSION OF RCC COMMON. Both the shareholders of RCC and the number
of shares of RCC common owned by such shareholders are identical to the
shareholders of the Corporation and the number of shares of Company Common owned
by such shareholders. Since the ownership structure of RCC and the Corporation
is identical, upon consummation of the Merger, shareholders of RCC will not
receive any consideration for the Merger and each share of RCC Common will be
cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and such holder of RCC Common
will thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to his or her shares of
RCC Common.

of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common will remain issued and

agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter contained
herein.

NOTE 1: State the true exact corporate name as it appears on the records of
        the office of the Secretary of State, BEFORE any amendments herein
        reported.

NOTE 2: Incorporators are permitted to adopt amendments ONLY before any
        shares have been issued and before any directors have been named or
        elected. (Section 10.10)

NOTE 3: Directors may adopt amendments without shareholder approval in only
        seven Instances, as follows:

        (a) to remove the names and addresses of directors named in the
            articles of incorporation;
        (b) to remove the name and address of the initial registered agent and
            registered office, provided a statement pursuant to Section 5.10 is
            also filed;
        (c) to increase, decrease, create or eliminate the par value of the
            shares of any class, so long as no class or series of shares is
            adversely affected.
        (d) to split the issued whole shares and unissued authorized shares by
            multiplying them by a whole number, so long as no class or series
            is adversely affected thereby;
        (e) to change the corporate name by substituting the word "corporation",
            "incorporated", "limited", or the abbreviation "corp.", "inc.",

        (g) to restate the articles of incorporation as currently amended.
            (Section 10.15)

NOTE 4: All amendments not adopted under Section 10.10 or Section 10.15
        require (1) that the board of directors adopt a resolution setting forth
        the proposed amendment and (2) that the shareholders approve the
        amendment.

        Shareholder approval may be (1) by vote at a shareholders' meeting
        (EITHER ANNUAL OR SPECIAL) or (2) by consent, in writing, without a
        meeting.

        To be adopted, the amendment must receive the affirmative vote or
        consent of the holders of a least 2/3 of the outstanding shares entitled
        to vote on the amendment (BUT IF CLASS VOTING APPLIES, THEN ALSO AT
        LEAST A 2/3 VOTE WITHIN EACH CLASS IS REQUIRED).

        The articles of Incorporation may supersede the 2/3 vole requirement by
        specifying any smaller or large vote requirement not less than a
        majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote and not less than a
        majority within each class when class voting applies. (Section 10.20)

NOTE 5: When shareholder approval is by consent, all shareholders must be
        given notice of the proposed amendment at least 5 days before the
        consent is signed. If the amendment is adopted, shareholders who have
        not signed the consent must be promptly notified of the passage of the
        amendment. (Sections 7.10 & 10.20)

Delaware corporation ("Horseshoe"), Horseshoe Acquisition Illinois, Inc., an
Illionis corporation ("Horseshoe Illinois" and together with Parent and
Horseshoe, the "Buyers"), Empress Entertainment, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Empress") and Empress Casino Joliet Corporation, an Illinois corporation
("Empress Joliet" and together with Empress, the "Sellers").

                                    RECITALS:

     A. Horseshoe Illinois is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Horseshoe (the
"Horseshoe Subsidiary"); and

     B. Empress Joliet is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Empress (the "Empress
Subsidiary") (the Horseshoe Subsidiary and the Empress Subsidiary are sometimes
collectively referred to herein as the "Subsidiaries"); and

     C. The Board of Directors of each of Empress Joliet and Horseshoe Illinois
have determined that a business combination between the parties is in the best
interest of their respective companies and stockholders and accordingly have
agreed to effect the merger provided for herein upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein; and

     D. Empress, as the sole shareholder of Empress Joliet, has determined the
merger to be in the best interests of Empress and has approved the merger
provided for herein.

                                   AGREEMENTS:

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and mutual
covenants contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto do hereby agree as
follows:

<Page>

     SECTION 1.01. THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.03 of this
Agreement), Horseshoe Illinois shall be merged with and into Empress Joliet in
accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois and the terms of this
Agreement (the "Merger"), whereupon the separate corporate existence of
Horseshoe Illinois shall cease (the "Merging Corporation") and Empress Joliet
shall be the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

     SECTION 1.02. CLOSING. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing Date") shall take place (a)
at the offices of D'Ancona & Pflaum LLC, 111 East Wacker Drive, Suite 2800,
Chicago, Illinois 60601 on such date as is determined in accordance with this
Agreement, or (b) at such other place, time and/or date as the parties hereto
may otherwise agree (the "Closing Time").

     SECTION 1.03. EFFECTIVE TIME. The parties hereto shall cause articles of
merger (the "Articles of Merger") to be properly executed and filed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois and the terms of this
Agreement on or before the Closing Date. The parties hereto also shall take such
further actions as may be required under the laws of the State of Illinois in
order to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
Articles of Merger have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of Illinois
(the "Effective Time").

     SECTION 1.04. LEGAL EFFECT. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, privileges, powers and
franchises and be subject to all of the restrictions, disabilities and duties of
the Merging Corporation, all as provided under applicable law and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

     SECTION 1.05. MERGER CONSIDERATION. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the aggregate consideration to be received by Empress
from Horseshoe upon the

<Page>

consummation of the Merger shall be an aggregate amount equal to Two Hundred
Thirty-One Millions Dollars ($231,000,000.00) subject to adjustment based on the
working capital of Empress Joliet from September 3, 1998 to the Closing Date.

     SECTION 1.06. CONVERSION OF SHARES.

          (a) At the Effective Time (i) each share of common stock of Horseshoe
Illinois outstanding at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holders thereof, shall be converted into and
exchanged for one share of newly issued common stock of the Surviving
Corporation; and (ii) the shares of common stock, without par value per share,
of Empress Joliet (the "Shares") outstanding at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, shall be
converted and exchanged into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

          (b) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, at the Effective Time, all Shares shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
Empress shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares,
except for the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration.

     SECTION 1.07. EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING SHARES. Upon surrender
of the Certificates representing Shares duly endorsed for transfer or
accompanied by validly executed stock powers, Empress shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration. Until so surrendered,
each Certificate that, at the Effective Time, represented Shares will be deemed
from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only
the right to receive a proportionate share of the Merger Consideration.

     SECTION 1.08. TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION. Each of the
Buyers and each of the Sellers shall take all such action as may be reasonably
necessary or appropriate in order to

<Page>

effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which shall include
but not be limited to the Sellers providing reasonable assistance of the Buyers
in the process of obtaining all necessary gaming board and commission approvals
and consents; provided, that such actions do not unreasonably increase the
liability of such party. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carryout the purposes of this Agreement and
to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Merging
Corporation, except as provided herein, the officers and directors of the
appropriate entity are fully authorized in the name of their respective
corporation or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary
action, so long as such action is consistent with this Agreement.

     SECTION 1.09. FAIR CONSIDERATION. The parties acknowledge and agree that
the Merger Consideration represents fair consideration and reasonably equivalent
value for the Shares and the transactions, covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement, which consideration was agreed upon as the result of
arm's-length, good faith negotiations between the parties and their respective
representatives.

     SECTION 1.10. CERTAIN MATTERS RELATING TO THE SURVIVING CORPORATION.

          (a) ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. The
Articles of Incorporation of Empress Joliet in effect at the Effective Time
shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until
amended in accordance with the terms and pursuant to applicable law.

          (b) BY-LAWS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. The By-Laws of Empress
Joliet in effect at the Effective Time shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving

applicable law and the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

          (c) DIRECTORS OF THE ILLINOIS CORPORATION. The directors of the
Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the same as
the directors of Horseshoe Illinois, immediately prior to the Effective Time, to
hold office until their successors are duly appointed or elected in accordance
with applicable law and the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation, as applicable.

          (d) OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. The officers of the
Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the same as

to do is contained in an appropriate order of the court by which such receiver
was appointed.

shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and
thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.

     Section 13. INFORMAL ACTION BY SHAREHOLDERS. Unless otherwise provided in
the articles of incorporation, any action required to be taken at a meeting of

proposed action is given in writing to all of the shareholders entitled to vote
with respect to the subject matter thereof, by the holders of outstanding shares
having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote

approved or ratified, the fact that a director of the corporation is directly or
indirectly a party to the transaction is not grounds for invalidating the
transaction. The presence of the director, who is directly or indirectly a party
to the transaction described above, or a director who is otherwise not
disinterested, may be counted in determining whether a quorum is present but
shall not be counted when the board of directors or a committee of the board
takes action on the transaction. For purposes of this Article, a director is
"indirectly" a party to a transaction if the other party to the transaction is
an entity in which the director has a material financial interest or in which
the director is an officer, director or general partner.

                                   ARTICLE XII

     Section 1. POWER TO INDEMNIFY. The corporation shall have the power to
indemnify any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation, or who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, to the full extent permitted by law.

     Section 2. LIABILITY INSURANCE. The corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the corporation, or who is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability
asserted against him or her and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or
arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would
have the power to indemnify such person against such liability.

     contribution from any non-paying Subsidiary Guarantor so long as the
     exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the
     Guarantee.

          (i)  Pursuant to Section 11.03 of the Indenture, after giving effect
     to any maximum amount and any other contingent and fixed liabilities that

          (a)  The Guaranteeing Subsidiary may not consolidate with or merge
with or into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person)
another corporation, Person or entity whether or not affiliated with such
Subsidiary Guarantor unless:

          (i)  subject to Sections 11.05 and 11.06 of the Indenture, the Person
     formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than a
     Subsidiary Guarantor or the Company) unconditionally assumes all the
     obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor, pursuant to a supplemental

     under the Notes, the Indenture and the Subsidiary Guarantee on the terms

performance of all of the covenants and conditions of the Indenture to be
performed by the Subsidiary Guarantor, such successor corporation shall succeed

had been named herein as a Subsidiary Guarantor. Such successor corporation
thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Subsidiary Guarantees to be
endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not
have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the Subsidiary
Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit
under the Indenture as the Subsidiary Guarantees theretofore and thereafter
issued in accordance with the terms of the Indenture as though all of such
Subsidiary Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.

Article 11 of the Indenture, and notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above,

another Subsidiary Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the
property of a Subsidiary Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an
entirety to the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor.

of any Subsidiary Guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a
sale or other disposition of all to the capital stock of any Subsidiary
Guarantor, in each case to a Person that is not (either before or after giving
effect to such transaction) a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, then such
Subsidiary Guarantor (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of
merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all of the capital stock of such
Subsidiary Guarantor) or the corporation acquiring the property (in the event of
a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such
Subsidiary Guarantor) will be released and relieved of any obligations under its
Subsidiary Guarantee; PROVIDED that the Net Proceeds of such sale or other
disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of the

delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such sale or other disposition was made by
the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, including
without limitation Section 4.15 of the Indenture, the Trustee shall execute any
documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of any Subsidiary
Guarantor from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee.

          (b)  Any Subsidiary Guarantor not released from its obligations under
its Subsidiary Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of principal of
and interest on the Notes and for the other obligations of any Subsidiary
Guarantor under the Indenture as provided in Article 11 of the Indenture.

          6.   NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. No past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder or agent of the Guaranteeing
Subsidiary, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company
or any Guaranteeing Subsidiary under the Notes, any Subsidiary Guarantees, the
Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of the
Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and
release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may
not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it
is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

          7.   NEW YORK LAW TO GOVERN. THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
SHALL GOVERN AND BE USED TO CONSTRUE THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE BUT WITHOUT
GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT
THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY.

          8.   COUNTERPARTS The parties may sign any number of copies of this
Supplemental Indenture. Each signed copy shall be an original, but all of them
together represent the same agreement.

          9.   EFFECT OF HEADINGS. The Section headings herein are for
convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.

          10.  THE TRUSTEE. The Trustee shall not be responsible in any manner
whatsoever for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental
Indenture or for or in respect of the recitals contained herein, all of which
recitals are made solely by the Guaranteeing Subsidiary and the Company.

                            (SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS)

SECTION 2.01.   FORM AND DATING.

        (a)     GENERAL. The Notes and the Trustee's certificate of
authentication shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto. The Notes
may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule
or usage. Each Note shall be dated the date of its authentication. The Notes
shall be in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof.

        The terms and provisions contained in the Notes shall constitute, and
are hereby expressly made, a part of this Indenture and the Company, the
Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee, by their execution and delivery of this
Indenture, expressly agree to such terms and provisions and to be bound thereby.
However, to the extent any provision of any Note conflicts with the express
provisions of this Indenture, the provisions of this Indenture shall govern and
be controlling.

        (b)     GLOBAL NOTES. Notes issued in global form shall be substantially
in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (including the Global Note Legend
thereon and the "Schedule of Exchanges of Interests in the Global Note" attached
thereto). Notes issued in definitive form shall be substantially in the form of

aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes from time to time endorsed
thereon and that the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes represented
thereby may from time to time be reduced or increased, as appropriate, to
reflect exchanges and redemptions. Any endorsement of a Global Note to

                                       18

reflect the amount of any increase or decrease in the aggregate principal amount
of outstanding Notes represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee or the
Custodian, at the direction of the Trustee, in accordance with instructions
given by the Holder thereof as required by Section 2.06 hereof.

SECTION 2.02.   EXECUTION AND AUTHENTICATION.

        An Officer shall sign the Notes for the Company by manual or facsimile
signature. The Company's seal shall be reproduced on the Notes and may be in
facsimile form. If an Officer whose signature is on a Note no longer holds that
office at the time a Note is authenticated, the Note shall nevertheless be
valid. A Note shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of
the Trustee. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Note has been
authenticated under this Indenture. The Trustee shall, upon a written order of
the Company signed by an Officer (an "Authentication Order"), authenticate Notes
for original issue up to the aggregate principal amount stated in paragraph 4 of
the Initial Notes plus the aggregate principal amount stated in paragraph 4 of
any Additional Notes permitted to be issued under this Indenture. The aggregate
principal amount of Notes outstanding at any time may not exceed such amount
except as provided in Section 2.07 hereof. The Trustee may appoint an
authenticating agent acceptable to the Company to authenticate Notes. An
authenticating agent may authenticate Notes whenever the Trustee may do so. Each
reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes

Agent to deal with Holders or an Affiliate of the Company.

SECTION 2.03.   REGISTRAR AND PAYING AGENT.

        The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Notes may be
presented for registration of transfer or for exchange ("Registrar") and an
office or agency where Notes may be presented for payment ("Paying Agent"). The
Company may act as its own Registrar or Paying Agent. The Registrar shall keep a
register of the Notes and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may
appoint one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The
term "Registrar" includes any co-registrar and the term "Paying Agent" includes
any additional paying agent. The Company may change any Paying Agent or
Registrar without notice to any Holder. The Company shall notify the Trustee in
writing of the name and address of any Agent not a party to this Indenture. If
the Company fails to appoint or maintain another entity as Registrar or Paying
Agent, the Trustee shall act as such. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may
act as Paying Agent or Registrar.

        The Company initially appoints The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") to
act as Depositary with respect to the Global Notes.

        The Company initially appoints the Trustee to act as the Registrar and
Paying Agent and to act as Custodian with respect to the Global Notes.

SECTION 2.04.   PAYING AGENT TO HOLD MONEY IN TRUST.

        The Company shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to
agree in writing that the Paying Agent will hold in trust for the benefit of
Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, and will notify the
Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. While any such
default continues, the Trustee may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held
by it to the Trustee. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay
all money held by it to the Trustee. Upon payment over to the Trustee, the
Paying Agent (if other than the Company or a Subsidiary) shall have no further
liability for the money. If the Company or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it
shall segregate and hold in a separate

                                       19
<Page>

trust fund for the benefit of the Holders all money held by it as Paying Agent.
Upon any bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings relating to the Company, the
Trustee shall serve as Paying Agent for the Notes.

SECTION 2.05.   HOLDER LISTS.

        The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably
practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of
all Holders and shall otherwise comply with TIA Section 312(a). If the Trustee
is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee at least seven
Business Days before each interest payment date and at such other times as the
Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the
Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of the Holders of
Notes and the Company shall otherwise comply with TIA Section 312(a). The
Trustee, the Registrar and the Company shall provide a current list of all
Holders to any Gaming Authority upon demand.

SECTION 2.06.   TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE.

        (a)     TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF GLOBAL NOTES. A Global Note may not be
transferred as a whole except by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary,
by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or to another nominee of the
Depositary, or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary
or a nominee of such successor Depositary. All Global Notes will be exchanged by
the Company for Definitive Notes if (i) the Company delivers to the Trustee
notice from the Depositary that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
Depositary or that it is no longer a clearing agency registered under the
Exchange Act and, in either case, a successor Depositary is not appointed by the
Company within 120 days after the date of such notice from the Depositary or
(ii) the Company in its sole discretion determines that the Global Notes (in
whole but not in part) should be exchanged for Definitive Notes and delivers a
written notice to such effect to the Trustee. Upon the occurrence of either of
the preceding events in (i) or (ii) above, Definitive Notes shall be issued in
such names as the Depositary shall instruct the Trustee. Global Notes also may
be exchanged or replaced, in whole or in part, as provided in Sections 2.07 and
2.10 hereof. Every Note authenticated and delivered in exchange for, or in lieu
of, a Global Note or any portion thereof, pursuant to this Section 2.06 or
Section 2.07 or 2.10 hereof, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form
of, and shall be, a Global Note. A Global Note may not be exchanged for another
Note other than as provided in this Section 2.06(a), however, beneficial
interests in a Global Note may be transferred and exchanged as provided in
Section 2.06(b) or (c) hereof.

        (b)     TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE GLOBAL
NOTES. The transfer and exchange of beneficial interests in the Global Notes
shall be effected through the Depositary, in accordance with the provisions of
this Indenture and the Applicable Procedures.

        (c)     TRANSFER OR EXCHANGE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS FOR DEFINITIVE
NOTES.

        If any holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Note proposes to
exchange such beneficial interest for a Definitive Note or to transfer such
beneficial interest to a Person who takes delivery thereof in the form of a
Definitive Note, then the Trustee shall cause the aggregate principal amount of
the applicable Global Note to be reduced accordingly pursuant to Section 2.06(g)
hereof, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver to the Person designated in the instructions a Definitive Note in the
appropriate principal amount. Any Definitive Note issued in exchange for a
beneficial interest shall be registered in such name or names and in such
authorized denomination or denominations as the holder of such beneficial
interest shall instruct the Registrar through instructions

                                       20
<Page>

from the Depositary and the Participant or Indirect Participant. The Trustee
shall deliver such Definitive Notes to the Persons in whose names such Notes are
so registered.

        (d)     TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF DEFINITIVE NOTES FOR BENEFICIAL
INTERESTS.

        A Holder of a Definitive Note may exchange such Note for a beneficial
interest in a Global Note or transfer such Definitive Notes to a Person who
takes delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Global Note at
any time. Upon receipt of a request for such an exchange or transfer, the
Trustee shall cancel the applicable Definitive Note and increase or cause to be
increased the aggregate principal amount of one of the Global Notes.

        (e)     TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF DEFINITIVE NOTES FOR DEFINITIVE NOTES.
Upon request by a Holder of Definitive Notes and such Holder's compliance with
the provisions of this Section 2.06(e), the Registrar shall register the
transfer or exchange of Definitive Notes. Prior to such registration of transfer
or exchange, the requesting Holder shall present or surrender to the Registrar
the Definitive Notes duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instruction of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Registrar duly executed by such Holder or
by its attorney, duly authorized in writing. Upon receipt of a request to
register such a transfer, the Registrar shall register the Unrestricted
Definitive Notes pursuant to the instructions from the Holder thereof.

        (f)     LEGENDS. The following legends shall appear on the face of all
Global Notes and Definitive Notes issued under this Indenture.

"THIS GLOBAL NOTE IS HELD BY THE DEPOSITARY (AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE
GOVERNING THIS NOTE) OR ITS NOMINEE IN CUSTODY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE BENEFICIAL
OWNERS HEREOF, AND IS NOT TRANSFERABLE TO ANY PERSON UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
EXCEPT THAT (I) THE TRUSTEE MAY MAKE SUCH NOTATIONS HEREON AS MAY BE REQUIRED

        (g)     CANCELLATION AND/OR ADJUSTMENT OF GLOBAL NOTES. At such time as
all beneficial interests in a particular Global Note have been exchanged for
Definitive Notes or a particular Global Note has been redeemed, repurchased or
canceled in whole and not in part, each such Global Note shall be returned to or
retained and canceled by the Trustee in accordance with Section 2.11 hereof. At
any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Note
is exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in
the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Note or for Definitive
Notes, the principal amount of Notes represented by such Global Note shall be
reduced accordingly and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Note by the
Trustee or by the Depositary at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such
reduction; and if the beneficial interest is being exchanged for or transferred
to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest
in another Global Note, such other Global Note shall be increased accordingly
and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Note by the Trustee or by the
Depositary at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such increase.

        (h)     GENERAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO TRANSFERS AND EXCHANGES.

                (i)   To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the
        Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Global Notes
        and Definitive Notes upon the Company's order or at the Registrar's
        request.

                (ii)  No service charge shall be made to a holder of a
        beneficial interest in a Global Note or to a Holder of a Definitive Note
        for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may
        require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar
        governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such
        transfer taxes or similar governmental charge payable upon exchange or
        transfer pursuant to Sections 2.10, 3.06, 4.15, 4.21 and 9.05 hereof).

                (iii) The Registrar shall not be required to register the
        transfer of or exchange any Note selected for redemption in whole or in
        part, except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part
        or upon the order of any Gaming Authority.

                (iv)  All Global Notes and Definitive Notes issued upon any
        registration of transfer or exchange of Global Notes or Definitive Notes
        shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt,
        and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Global
        Notes or Definitive Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer
        or exchange.

                (v)   The Company shall not be required (A) to issue, to
        register the transfer of or to exchange any Notes during a period
        beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of any
        selection of Notes for redemption under Section 3.02 hereof and ending
        at the close of business on the day of selection, (B) to register the
        transfer of or to exchange any Note so selected for redemption in whole
        or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in
        part or (C) to register the transfer of or to exchange a Note between a
        record date and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.

                (vi)  Prior to due presentment for the registration of a
        transfer of any Note, the Trustee, any Agent and the Company may deem
        and treat the Person in whose name any Note is registered as the
        absolute owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of
        principal of and interest on such Notes and for all other purposes, and
        none of the Trustee, any Agent or the Company shall be affected by
        notice to the contrary.

                (vii) The Trustee shall authenticate Global Notes and Definitive
        Notes in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.02 hereof.

SECTION 2.07.   REPLACEMENT NOTES.

        If any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee or the Company and
the Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or
theft of any Note, the Company shall issue and the Trustee, upon receipt of an
Authentication Order, shall authenticate a replacement Note if the Trustee's
requirements are met. If required by the Trustee or the Company, an indemnity
bond must be supplied by the Holder that is sufficient in the judgment of the
Trustee and the Company to protect the Company, the Trustee, any Agent and any
authenticating agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Note is
replaced. The Company may charge for its expenses in replacing a Note.

                                       22
<Page>

        Every replacement Note is an additional obligation of the Company and
shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture equally and
proportionately with all other Notes duly issued hereunder.

SECTION 2.08.   OUTSTANDING NOTES.

        The Notes outstanding at any time are all the Notes authenticated by the
Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation,
those reductions in the interest in a Global Note effected by the Trustee in
accordance with the provisions hereof, and those described in this Section as
not outstanding. Except as set forth in Section 2.09 hereof, a Note does not
cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds
the Note. If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07 hereof, it ceases to be
outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the
replaced Note is held by a bona fide purchaser. If the principal amount of any
Note is considered paid under Section 4.01 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding
and interest on it ceases to accrue. If the Paying Agent (other than the
Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate of any thereof) holds, on a redemption
date or maturity date, money sufficient to pay Notes payable on that date, then
on and after that date such Notes shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding
and shall cease to accrue interest.

SECTION 2.09.   TREASURY NOTES.

        In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of
Notes have concurred in any direction, amendment, supplement, waiver or consent,
Notes owned by the Company, or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling
or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company,
shall be considered as though not outstanding, except that for the purposes of
determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such
direction, amendment, supplement, waiver or consent, only Notes that the Trustee
knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.

SECTION 2.10.   TEMPORARY NOTES.

        Until certificates representing Notes are ready for delivery, the
Company may prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order,
shall authenticate temporary Notes. Temporary Notes shall be substantially in
the form of certificated Notes but may have variations that the Company
considers appropriate for temporary Notes and as shall be reasonably acceptable
to the Trustee. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the
Trustee shall authenticate definitive Notes in exchange for temporary Notes.

        Holders of temporary Notes shall be entitled to all of the benefits of
this Indenture.

SECTION 2.11.   CANCELLATION.

        The Company at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for
cancellation. The Registrar and Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any
Notes surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The
Trustee and no one else shall cancel all Notes surrendered for registration of
transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and shall destroy
canceled Notes (subject to the record retention requirement of the Exchange
Act). Certification of the destruction of all canceled Notes shall be delivered
to the Company. Subject to Section 2.07, the Company may not issue new Notes to
replace Notes that it has paid or that have been delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation.

                                       23
<Page>

SECTION 2.12.   DEFAULTED INTEREST.

        If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Notes, it shall
pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent lawful,
interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons who are Holders on a
subsequent special record date, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes
and in Section 4.01 hereof. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of
the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Note and the date
of the proposed payment. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed each such
special record date and payment date, PROVIDED that no such special record date
shall be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date for such defaulted
interest. At least 15 days before the special record date, the Company (or, upon
the written request of the Company, the Trustee in the name and at the expense
of the Company) shall mail or cause to be mailed to Holders a notice that states
the special record date, the related payment date and the amount of such
interest to be paid.

                            REDEMPTION AND PREPAYMENT

SECTION 3.01.   NOTICES TO TRUSTEE.

        If the Company elects to redeem Notes pursuant to the optional
redemption provisions of Section 3.07 hereof, it shall furnish to the Trustee, a
reasonable time prior to the redemption notice period set forth in Section 3.03

SECTION 3.02.   SELECTION OF NOTES TO BE REDEEMED.

        If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed or purchased in an
Offer to Purchase at any time, the Trustee shall select the Notes to be redeemed
or purchased among the Holders of the Notes in compliance with the requirements
of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are
listed or, if the Notes are not so listed, on a PRO RATA basis, by lot or in
accordance with any other method the Trustee considers fair and appropriate. In
the event of partial redemption by lot, the particular Notes to be redeemed
shall be selected, unless otherwise provided herein, not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days prior to the redemption date by the Trustee from the outstanding
Notes not previously called for redemption.

        The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Notes
selected for redemption and, in the case of any Note selected for partial
redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Notes and portions of
Notes selected shall be in amounts of $1,000 or whole multiples of $1,000;
except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be redeemed, the entire
outstanding amount of Notes held by such Holder, even if not a multiple of
$1,000, shall be redeemed. Except as provided in the preceding sentence,
provisions of this Indenture that apply to Notes called for redemption also
apply to portions of Notes called for redemption.

SECTION 3.03.   NOTICE OF REDEMPTION.

        Subject to the provisions of Section 4.15 hereof, at least 30 days but
not more than 60 days before a redemption date or such other time as shall be
required by order of any applicable Gaming

                                       24

Authority, the Company shall mail or cause to be mailed, by first class mail, a
notice of redemption to each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its
registered address.

        The notice shall identify the Notes to be redeemed and shall state:

        (a)     the redemption date;

        (b)     the redemption price;

        (c)     if any Note is being redeemed in part, the portion of the
principal amount of such Note to be redeemed and that, after the redemption date
upon surrender of such Note, a new Note or Notes in principal amount equal to
the unredeemed portion shall be issued upon cancellation of the original Note;

        (d)     the name and address of the Paying Agent;

        (e)     that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the
Paying Agent to collect the redemption price;

        (f)     that, unless the Company defaults in making such redemption
payment, interest on Notes called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after
the redemption date;

        (g)     the paragraph of the Notes and/or Section of this Indenture
pursuant to which the Notes called for redemption are being redeemed; and

        (h)     that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy
of the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Notes.

        At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of
redemption in the Company's name and at its expense; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Company shall have delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 3.01, an
Officers' Certificate requesting that the Trustee give such notice and setting
forth the information to be stated in such notice as provided in the preceding
paragraph.

SECTION 3.04.   EFFECT OF NOTICE OF REDEMPTION.

        Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.03
hereof, Notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the
redemption date at the redemption price. A notice of redemption may not be
conditional.

SECTION 3.05.   DEPOSIT OF REDEMPTION PRICE.

        One Business Day prior to the redemption date, the Company shall deposit
with the Trustee or with the Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the redemption
price of and accrued interest on all Notes to be redeemed on that date. The
Trustee or the Paying Agent shall promptly return to the Company any money
deposited with the Trustee or the Paying Agent by the Company in excess of the
amounts necessary to pay the redemption price of, and accrued interest on, all
Notes to be redeemed.

        If the Company complies with the provisions of the preceding paragraph,
on and after the redemption date, interest shall cease to accrue on the Notes or
the portions of Notes called for redemption. If a Note is redeemed on or after
an interest record date but on or prior to the related interest payment date,
then any accrued and unpaid interest shall be paid to the Person in whose name
such Note was registered at the close of business on such record date. If any
Note called for redemption shall not be

                                       25
<Page>

so paid upon surrender for redemption because of the failure of the Company to
comply with the preceding paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid
principal, from the redemption date until such principal is paid, and to the
extent lawful on any interest not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at
the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof.

SECTION 3.06.   NOTES REDEEMED IN PART.

        Upon surrender of a Note that is redeemed in part, the Company shall

amount to the unredeemed portion of the Note surrendered.

owner will not be licensed, qualified or found suitable, the holder or
beneficial owner will have no further rights (1) to exercise any right conferred
by the Notes, directly or indirectly, through any trustee, nominee or any other
Person or entity, or (2) to receive any interest or other distribution or
payment with respect to the Notes or any remuneration in any form from the
Company for services rendered or otherwise, except the redemption price of the

lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such
law, and covenants that it shall not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay
or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall

                Company and its Subsidiaries thereunder) not to exceed $675.0
                million less any amount of such Indebtedness permanently repaid

        (ii)    Indebtedness owed to the Company evidenced by a promissory note

                Subsidiary Guarantor and (B) any event which results in any such
                Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or

                of payment to, the Notes shall only be permitted under this
                clause (iii) if: (A) in case the Notes are refinanced in part or
                the Indebtedness to be refinanced is PARI PASSU with the Notes,

                agreement or instrument pursuant to which such new Indebtedness
                is outstanding, is expressly made PARI PASSU with, or
                subordinate in right of payment to, the remaining Notes, (B) in
                case the Indebtedness to be refinanced is subordinated in right
                of payment to the Notes, such new Indebtedness, by its terms or
                by the terms of any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
                such new Indebtedness is issued or remains outstanding, is
                expressly made subordinate in right of payment to the Notes at
                least to the extent that the Indebtedness to be refinanced is
                subordinated to the Notes and (C) such new Indebtedness,

                the Indebtedness to be refinanced or refunded, and the Average
                Life of such new Indebtedness is at least equal to the remaining
                Average Life of the Indebtedness to be refinanced or refunded;
                and PROVIDED FURTHER that in no event may Indebtedness of the
                Company that is PARI PASSU or subordinated in right of payment
                to the Notes be refinanced by means of any Indebtedness of any
                Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to this clause (iii);

        (x)     Indebtedness of the Company (in addition to Indebtedness
                permitted under clauses (i) through (ix) above) in an aggregate
                principal amount outstanding at any time (together with
                refinancings thereof) not to exceed $25.0 million.

        (b)     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.07, the
maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may
Incur pursuant to this Section 4.07 shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with
respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, due solely to the result of
fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies.

        (c)     For purposes of determining any particular amount of
Indebtedness under this Section 4.07, (1) Indebtedness incurred under the Credit

to clause (i) of the second paragraph of this Section 4.07, (2) Guarantees,
Liens or obligations with respect to letters of credit supporting Indebtedness
which is included in the determination of such particular amount shall not be
included and (3) any Liens granted pursuant to the equal and ratable provisions
referred to in Section 4.14 hereof shall not be treated as Indebtedness.

        (d)     For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.07,
in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of
the types of Indebtedness described in the above clauses (other than
Indebtedness referred to in clause (1) of the preceding sentence), the Company,
in its sole discretion, shall classify, and from time to time may reclassify,
such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of
such Indebtedness in one of such clauses.

into Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company, or from the
issuance after June 8, 1999 to a Person who is not a Subsidiary of the Company

(in each case, exclusive of any Disqualified Stock or any options, warrants or
other rights that are redeemable at the option of the holder, or are required to
be redeemed, prior to the Stated Maturity of the Notes); PLUS (3) an amount
equal to the net reduction in Investments treated as Restricted Payments under
the Indenture or the Existing Indenture in any Person resulting from payments of
interest on Indebtedness, dividends, repayments of loans or advances, or other
transfers of assets, in each case to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or

case, to the extent any such payment or proceeds are included in the calculation
of Adjusted Consolidated Net Income and except, in each case, for any such sale
that is not included in the definition of "Asset Sales"), or from redesignations
after June 8, 1999 of Unrestricted Subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries
(valued in each case as provided in the definition of "Investments"), not to

Restricted Payments. In the event the proceeds of an issuance of Capital Stock
of the Company are used for the redemption, repurchase or other acquisition of
the Notes, or Indebtedness that is PARI PASSU with the Notes, then the Net Cash
Proceeds of such issuance shall be included in clause (C) of the first paragraph
of this Section 4.08 only to the extent such proceeds are not used for such
redemption, repurchase or other acquisition of Indebtedness.

SECTION 4.09.   LIMITATION ON DIVIDEND AND OTHER PAYMENT RESTRICTIONS AFFECTING
                RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES

        The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary
to, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any

owned by the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary; (ii) pay any
Indebtedness owed to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary; (iii) make
loans or advances to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary; or (iv)
transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any other Restricted
Subsidiary.

        The foregoing provisions shall not restrict any encumbrances or
restrictions: (i) existing on the Closing Date in the Credit Facility, the
Indenture or any other agreements in effect on the Closing Date, and any
extensions, refinancings, renewals or replacements of such agreements; PROVIDED
that the encumbrances and restrictions in any such extensions, refinancings,
renewals or replacements are no less favorable in any material respect to the
Holders than those encumbrances or restrictions that are then in effect and that
are being extended, refinanced, renewed or replaced; (ii) existing under or by
reason of applicable law or by order of any Gaming Authority; (iii) imposed
pursuant to the Trust Agreements upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event; (iv)
existing with respect to any Person or the property or assets of such Person
acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, existing at the time of
such acquisition and not incurred in contemplation thereof, which encumbrances
or restrictions are not applicable to any Person or the property or assets of
any Person other than such Person or the property or assets of such Person so
acquired; (v) in the case of clause (iv) of the first paragraph of this Section
4.09, (A) that restrict in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or
transfer of any property or asset that is a lease, license, conveyance or
contract or similar property or asset, (B) existing by virtue of any transfer
of, agreement to transfer, option or right with respect to, or Lien on, any
property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary not otherwise
prohibited by the Indenture or (C) arising or agreed to in the ordinary course

in the aggregate, detract from the value of property or assets of the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary in any manner material to the Company or any
Restricted

                                       33
<Page>

Subsidiary; (vi) with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary and imposed pursuant to
an agreement that has been entered into for the sale or disposition of all or
substantially all of the Capital Stock of, or property and assets of, such
Restricted Subsidiary; or (vii) contained in the terms of any Indebtedness or
any agreement pursuant to which such Indebtedness was issued if (A) the
encumbrance or restriction applies only in the event of a payment default or a
default with respect to a financial covenant contained in such Indebtedness or
agreement, (B) the encumbrance or restriction is not materially more
disadvantageous to the Holders of the Notes than is customary in comparable
financings (as determined by the Company) and (C) the Company determines that
any such encumbrance or restriction will not materially affect the Company's
ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes).

        Nothing contained in this Section 4.09 shall prevent the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary from (1) creating, incurring, assuming or suffering to
exist any Liens otherwise permitted in Section 4.14 or (2) restricting the sale
or other disposition of property or assets of the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries that secure Indebtedness of the Company or any of its

subordinated basis (pursuant to the subordination provisions described below
under Article 10 hereof), of the Company's payment obligations under the Notes

        Any such designation by the Board of Directors shall be evidenced to the
Trustee by promptly filing with the Trustee a copy of the resolution of the
Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officers'
Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the foregoing
provisions.

Company or with any Affiliate of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary,
unless: (i) such Affiliate transaction is on fair and reasonable terms that are
no less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than
those that would have been obtained, at the time of such transaction or, if such

agreement providing therefor, in a comparable transaction by the Company or such
Subsidiary with a Person that is not such a holder or an Affiliate; and (ii) the
Company delivers to the Trustee: (a) with respect to any transaction or series

covenant and that such Affiliate transaction has been approved by a majority of
the disinterested members of the Board of Directors; and (b) with respect to any
Affiliate transaction or series of related Affiliate transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of $15.0 million, an opinion as to the

payment of reasonable and customary regular fees and indemnities to directors of
the Company who are not employees of the Company; (iii) any payments or other

SECTION 4.15.   LIMITATION ON ASSET SALES

        The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary

the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is irrevocably and unconditionally
released from all liability under such Indebtedness.

        Notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate a Permitted Asset Swap
without complying with such paragraph if (i) immediately after giving effect to
such Permitted Asset Swap, the Company could Incur least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to Section 4.07 hereof and (ii) the Company or the
applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives assets at the
time of such Permitted Asset Swap of a value at least equal to the fair market
value of the assets or other property sold or otherwise disposed of (as
evidenced by a resolution of the Company's Board of Directors set forth in an
Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee, or, in the event that the fair
market value of such Permitted Asset Swap exceeds $100.0 million, such fair
market value has been determined by a written opinion of an investment banking
firm of national standing or other recognized independent expert with experience
appraising the terms and conditions of the type of transaction contemplated

or more Asset Sales occurring on or after the Closing Date, the Company shall or

Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or Indebtedness of any other Restricted
Subsidiary, in each case owing to a Person other than the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries; or (B) invest an equal amount, or the amount not so
applied pursuant to clause (A) (or enter into a definitive agreement committing
to so invest within 12 months after the date of such agreement), in property or
assets (other than current assets) of a nature or type or that are used in a
business (or in a company having property and assets of a nature or type, or
engaged in a business) similar or related to the nature or type of the property
and assets of, or the business of, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
existing on the date of such investment and (ii) apply (no later than the end of
the 12-month period referred to in clause (i)(B)) such excess Net Cash Proceeds
(to the extent not applied pursuant to clause (i)) as provided in the following
paragraph of this Section 4.15. The amount of such excess Net Cash Proceeds
required to be applied (or to be committed to be applied) during such 12-month
period as set forth in clause (i) of the preceding sentence and not applied as
so required by the end of such period shall constitute "Excess Proceeds."

        If, as of the first day of any calendar month, the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds not theretofore subject to an Offer to Purchase pursuant to this
Section 4.15 totals at least $10.0 million (or at least $25.0 million in the
event that at such time there is no Indebtedness of the Company or its
Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding that is PARI PASSU with or subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes with a comparable limitation of less than $25.0
million), the Company must commence, not later than the fifteenth Business Day
of such month, and consummate an Offer to Purchase from the Holders (and if
required by the terms of any Indebtedness that is PARI PASSU with the Notes
("Pari Passu Indebtedness"), from the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness)
on a PRO RATA basis an aggregate principal amount of Notes (and Pari Passu
Indebtedness) equal to the Excess Proceeds on such date, at a purchase price
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus, in each case, accrued
interest and Additional or Special Interest, if any, to the Payment Date. If the
aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness
tendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Notes and
Pari Passu Indebtedness shall be purchased on a PRO RATA basis. Upon the
completion of any such Offers to Purchase, regardless of the amount of Notes
validly tendered, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero.

transaction if: (i) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable,
could have incurred Indebtedness in an amount equal to the Attributable Debt
relating to such sale and leaseback transaction under (i) the Interest Coverage
Ratio test in the first paragraph of Section 4.07 hereof or (ii) clause (ix) of
the second paragraph of Section 4.07 hereof; (ii) the gross cash proceeds of

Senior Indebtedness of the Company that exist by reason of any Liens or
Guarantees arising or created in respect of some but not all such Senior
Indebtedness.

SECTION 4.18.  LIMITATION ON BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

(including, without limitation, developing and operating dining, amusement,
sports or entertainment facilities, transportation services or other related
activities or enterprises and any additions or improvements thereto), except to
such extent as would not be material to the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

SECTION 4.19.   LIMITATION ON STATUS AS INVESTMENT COMPANY

        The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to
take any action that may require either the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor
to register as an "investment company" (as that term is defined in the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended) or from otherwise becoming subject
to regulation under the Investment Company Act.

SECTION 4.20.   PAYMENTS FOR CONSENT

        The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the
benefit of any Holder of Notes for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or
amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless
such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders of the Notes
that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the
solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.

all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect (i) its
corporate existence, and the corporate, partnership or other existence of each
of its Subsidiaries, in accordance with the respective organizational documents
(as the same may be amended from time to time) of the Company or any such
Subsidiary and (ii) the rights (charter and statutory), licenses and franchises
of the Company and its Subsidiaries; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall
not be required to preserve any such right, license or franchise, or the
corporate, partnership or other existence of any of its Subsidiaries, if the
Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer
desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, and that the loss thereof is not adverse in any material
respect to the Holders of the Notes.

first paragraph of Section 4.07; PROVIDED that this clause (iii) shall not apply
to a consolidation, merger or sale of all (but not less than all) of the assets
of the Company if all Liens and Indebtedness of the Company or any Person
becoming the successor obligor on the Notes, as the case may be, and its
Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding immediately after such transaction would
have been permitted (and all such Liens and Indebtedness, other than Liens and
Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding
immediately prior to the transaction, shall be deemed to have been Incurred) for
all purposes of the Indenture; and (iv) the Company delivers to the Trustee an
Officers' Certificate (attaching the arithmetic computations to demonstrate
compliance with clause (iii)) and opinion of counsel, in each case stating that
such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture complies
with this provision and that all conditions precedent provided for herein
relating to such transaction have been compiled with; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
clause (iii) above will not apply if, in the good faith determination of the
Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be evidenced by a
resolution of the Board of Directors, the principal purpose of

                                       38

such transaction is to change the state of incorporation of the Company and any
such transaction shall not have as one of its purposes the evasion of the
foregoing limitations.

        In addition, the Company may not, directly or indirectly, lease all or
substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related
transactions, to any other Person. This Section 5.01 shall not apply to a sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets between or among
the Company and any of the Subsidiary Guarantors.

SECTION 5.02.   SUCCESSOR CORPORATION SUBSTITUTED.

        Upon any consolidation or merger, or any sale, assignment, transfer,
lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Company in accordance with Section 5.01 hereof, the successor corporation
formed by such consolidation or into or with which the Company is merged or to
which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition is
made shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date
of such consolidation, merger, sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition, the
provisions of this Indenture referring to the "Company" shall refer instead to
the successor corporation and not to the Company), and may exercise every right
and power of the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such
successor Person had been named as the Company herein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the predecessor Company shall not be relieved from the obligation to pay the
principal of and interest on the Notes except in the case of a sale of all of
the Company's assets that meets the requirements of Section 5.01 hereof.

SECTION 6.02.   ACCELERATION

        If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in
clause (g) or (h) of Section 6.01 that occurs with respect to the Company)
occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes, then outstanding, by
written notice to the Company (and to the Trustee if such notice is given by the
Holders), may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the
principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the Notes to be
immediately due and payable. Upon a declaration of acceleration, such principal
of, premium, if any, and accrued interest shall be immediately due and payable.
In the event of a declaration of acceleration because an Event of Default set
forth in clause (e) of Section 6.01 has occurred and is continuing, such
declaration of acceleration shall be automatically rescinded and annulled if the
event of default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (e) of
Section 6.01 shall be remedied or cured by the Company or the relevant
Significant Subsidiary or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness
within 60 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto. If an
Event of Default specified in clause (g) or (h) of Section 6.01 occurs with
respect to the Company, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest
on the Notes then outstanding shall IPSO FACTO become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
Holder. The Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may waive
all past defaults and rescind and annul a declaration of acceleration and its
consequences if (i) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of
the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the Notes that have
become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived
and (ii) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

SECTION 6.03.   OTHER REMEDIES.

        If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue
any available remedy to collect the payment of principal, premium, if any, and
interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the
Notes or this Indenture.

        The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of
the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission
by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or remedy
accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are
cumulative to the extent permitted by law.

SECTION 6.04.   WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS.

        Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of
all of the Notes waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its
consequences hereunder, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the
payment of the principal of, premium, or interest on, the Notes (including in
connection with an offer to purchase) (PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may rescind
an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that
resulted from such acceleration). Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease
to exist,

                                       41
<Page>

and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured
for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 6.05.   CONTROL BY MAJORITY.

        Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power
conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that
conflicts with law or this Indenture that the Trustee determines may be unduly
prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of Notes or that may involve the
Trustee in personal liability.

SECTION 6.06.   LIMITATION ON SUITS.

        A Holder of a Note may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or
the Notes only if:

        (a)     the Holder of a Note gives to the Trustee written notice of a
continuing Event of Default;

        (b)     the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

        (c)     such Holder of a Note or Holders of Notes offer and, if
requested, provide to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against
any loss, liability or expense;

        (d)     the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days
after receipt of the request and the offer and, if requested, the provision of
indemnity; and

        (e)     during such 60-day period the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes do not give the Trustee a direction
inconsistent with the request.

        A Holder of a Note may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of
another Holder of a Note or to obtain a preference or priority over another
Holder of a Note.

SECTION 6.07.   RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF NOTES TO RECEIVE PAYMENT.

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, but subject to
Article 10 hereof, the right of any Holder of a Note to receive payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Note, on or after the respective
due dates expressed in the Note (including in connection with an offer to
purchase), or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after
such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of
such Holder.

SECTION 6.08.   COLLECTION SUIT BY TRUSTEE.

        If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a) or (b) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as
trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount of
principal of, premium, if any, and interest remaining unpaid on the Notes and
interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such
further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of
collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

                                       42
<Page>

SECTION 6.09.   TRUSTEE MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.

        The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers
or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the
Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the
Holders of the Notes allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company
(or any other obligor upon the Notes), its creditors or its property and shall
be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other
property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in any such
judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to
the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of
such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to
it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under
Section 7.07 hereof. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and
any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof out of the estate in
any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall
be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions,
dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Holders may be
entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan
of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on
behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or
composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder, or to authorize the
Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

SECTION 6.10.   PRIORITIES.

        If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article, it shall pay
out the money in the following order:

                First: to the Trustee, its agents and attorneys for amounts due
        under Sections 6.08 and 7.07 hereof, including payment of all
        compensation, expense and liabilities incurred, and all advances made,
        by the Trustee and the costs and expenses of collection;

                Second: to Holders of Notes for amounts due and unpaid on the
        Notes for principal, premium, if any, and interest, ratably, without
        preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and
        payable on the Notes for principal, premium, if any and interest,
        respectively; and

                Third: to the Company or to such party as a court of competent
        jurisdiction shall direct.

        The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to
Holders of Notes pursuant to this Section 6.10.

SECTION 6.11.   UNDERTAKING FOR COSTS.

        In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this
Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by
it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party
litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the
court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to
the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant.
This Section does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder of a
Note pursuant to

                                       43

Section 6.07 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount
of the then outstanding Notes.

                                     TRUSTEE

SECTION 7.01.   DUTIES OF TRUSTEE.

        (a)     If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this
Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise, as a
prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of
such person's own affairs.

        (b)     Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:

                (i)   the duties of the Trustee shall be determined solely by
        the express provisions of this Indenture and the Trustee need perform
        only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and

        this Indenture against the Trustee; and

                (ii)  in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may
        conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness
        of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions
        furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this
        Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and
        opinions to determine whether or not they appear on their face to
        conform to the requirements of this Indenture.

        (c)     The Trustee may not be relieved from liabilities for its own
negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful
misconduct, except that:

        of this Section;

                (ii)  the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment
        made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it is proved that

                (iii) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action
        it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction
        received by it pursuant to Section 6.05 hereof.

this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraphs
(a), (b), and (c) of this Section.

        (e)     No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to
expend or risk its own funds or incur any liability. The Trustee shall be under

security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or
expense.

received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company.

any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in
reliance thereon.

        The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner
or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Company or any Affiliate of
the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. However,
in the event that the Trustee has or acquires any conflicting interest within
the meaning of the TIA and the Notes are in default, it must eliminate such
conflict within 90 days if the default to which such conflicting interest
relates has not been cured or duly waived or otherwise eliminated before the end
of such 90-day period, apply to the SEC for permission to continue as trustee or
resign. Any Agent may do the same with like rights and duties. The Trustee is

SECTION 7.05.   NOTICE OF DEFAULTS.

        If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and if it is
known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to Holders of Notes and the agent
bank under the Credit Facility (the "Agent Bank"), a notice of the Default or
Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default
or Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on
any Note, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of
its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is
in the interests of the Holders of the Notes. The name and address of the Agent
Bank for purposes of this Section 7.05 is Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., One East First
Street, Reno, Nevada 89501, Attention: Casey Potter. Any change in the identity
or address of the Agent Bank shall be effective only if the Trustee receives
written notice of the change, specifically providing that the change is
effective for any notices to the Agent Bank under the Indenture. If payment of
the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Trustee shall
promptly notify the Agent Bank in accordance with this Section of such
acceleration.

SECTION 7.06.   REPORTS BY TRUSTEE TO HOLDERS OF THE NOTES.

        Within 60 days after each May 15 beginning with the May 15 following the
date of this Indenture, and for so long as Notes remain outstanding, the Trustee
shall mail to the Holders of the Notes a brief report dated as of such reporting
date that complies with TIA Section 313(a) (but if no event described in TIA
Section 313(a) has occurred within the twelve months preceding the reporting
date, no report need be transmitted). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA
Section 313(b)(2). The Trustee shall also transmit by mail all reports as
required by TIA Section 313(c).

        A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to the Holders of Notes
shall be mailed to the Company and filed with the SEC and each stock exchange on
which the Notes are listed in accordance with TIA Section 313(d). The Company
shall promptly notify the Trustee when the Notes are listed on any stock
exchange.

SECTION 7.07.   COMPENSATION AND INDEMNITY.

        The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable
compensation for its acceptance of this Indenture and services hereunder or as
agreed to in writing from time to time. The Trustee's compensation shall not be
limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company
shall reimburse the Trustee promptly upon request for all reasonable
disbursements, advances and expenses incurred or made by it in addition to the
compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the reasonable
compensation for ordinary and extraordinary services, disbursements and expenses
of the Trustee's agents and counsel.

liabilities or expenses incurred by it arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of its duties under this Indenture, including the

this Section 7.07) and defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by
the Company or any Holder or any other person) or liability in connection with
the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder, except to
the extent any such loss, liability or expense may be attributable to its
negligence or bad faith. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any
claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the
Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company
shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The
Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made
without its consent;

                                       46
<Page>

PROVIDED that the Company will not be required to pay such fees and expenses if
it assumes the Trustee's defense and there is no conflict of interest between
the Company and the Trustee in connection with such defense. The Company need
not reimburse any expense or indemnify any loss or liability to the extent
incurred by the Trustee through its gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct.

        The obligations of the Company under this Section 7.07 shall survive the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.

        To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee
shall have a Lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected
by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal and interest on
particular Notes. Such Lien shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture.

        When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of
Default specified in Section 6.01(g) or (h) hereof occurs, the expenses and the
compensation for the services (including the fees and expenses of its agents and
counsel) are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any
Bankruptcy Law.

        The Trustee shall comply with the provisions of TIA Section 313(b)(2) to
the extent applicable.

SECTION 7.08.  REPLACEMENT OF TRUSTEE.

        A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor Trustee's acceptance of
appointment as provided in this Section.

        The Trustee may resign in writing at any time and be discharged from the
trust hereby created by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may remove the Trustee by so
notifying the Trustee and the Company in writing. The Company may remove the
Trustee if:

        (a)     the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10 hereof;

        (b)     the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order
for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law;

        (c)     a custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its
property; or

        (d)     the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.

        If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the
office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor
Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may appoint a
successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.

        If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the
retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company, or
the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor Trustee.

                                       47
<Page>

        If the Trustee, after written request by any Holder who has been a
Holder for at least six months, fails to comply with Section 7.10, such Holder
may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee
and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

        A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its
appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon, the
resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the
successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee
under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its
succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property
held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, PROVIDED all sums owing to the
Trustee hereunder have been paid and subject to the Lien provided for in Section
7.07 hereof. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section
7.08, the Company's obligations under Section 7.07 hereof shall continue for the
benefit of the retiring Trustee.

SECTION 7.09.   SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE BY MERGER, ETC.

        If the Trustee consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all
or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation,
the successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor
Trustee.

SECTION 7.10.   ELIGIBILITY; DISQUALIFICATION.

        There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder that is a corporation
organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or
of any state thereof that is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate
trustee power, that is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state
authorities and that has a combined capital and surplus of at least $100 million
as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition.

        This Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the
requirements of TIA Section 310(a)(1), (2) and (5). The Trustee is subject to
TIA Section 310(b).

SECTION 7.11.   PREFERENTIAL COLLECTION OF CLAIMS AGAINST COMPANY.

        The Trustee is subject to TIA Section 311(a), excluding any creditor
relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been
removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated therein.

                                    ARTICLE 8
                    LEGAL DEFEASANCE AND COVENANT DEFEASANCE

SECTION 8.01.   OPTION TO EFFECT LEGAL DEFEASANCE OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE.

        The Company may, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a
resolution set forth in an Officers' Certificate, at any time, elect to have
either Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof be applied to all outstanding Notes upon
compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article 8.

SECTION 8.02.   LEGAL DEFEASANCE AND DISCHARGE.

        Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option
applicable to this Section 8.02, the Company shall, subject to the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be deemed to have been
discharged from its obligations with respect to all outstanding Notes on the
date the

                                       48
<Page>

conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Legal Defeasance"). For
this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have
paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding
Notes, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the
purposes of Section 8.05 hereof and the other Sections of this Indenture
referred to in (a) and (b) below, and to have satisfied all its other
obligations under such Notes and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of
and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments
acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which shall survive
until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of
outstanding Notes to receive solely from the trust fund described in
Section 8.04 hereof, and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in
respect of the principal of, interest and premium, if any, on such Notes when
such payments are due, (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Notes
under Article 2 and Section 4.02 hereof, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties
and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Company's and the Subsidiary
Guarantors' obligations in connection therewith and (d) this Article 8. Subject
to compliance with this Article 8, the Company may exercise its option under
this Section 8.02 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under
Section 8.03 hereof.

SECTION 8.03.   COVENANT DEFEASANCE.

        Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option
applicable to this Section 8.03, the Company shall, subject to the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be released from its
obligations under the covenants contained in Sections 4.03(a), 4.04, 4.07, 4.08,
4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17, 4.18, 4.19, 4.20 and 4.21
hereof and clause (iii) of Section 5.01 hereof with respect to the outstanding
Notes on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 are
satisfied (hereinafter, "Covenant Defeasance"), and the Notes shall thereafter
be deemed not "outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, amendment,
waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any
thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed
"outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such
Notes shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this
purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes,
the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of
any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether
directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such
covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other
provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not
constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01 hereof, but,
except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Notes shall
be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Company's exercise under Section
8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.03 hereof, subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, Sections
6.01(c) through 6.01(f) hereof shall not constitute Events of Default.

SECTION 8.04.   CONDITIONS TO LEGAL OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE.

        The following shall be the conditions to the application of either
Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof to the outstanding Notes:

        In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

        (a)     the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust,
for the benefit of the Holders, cash in United States dollars, non-callable
Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be
sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the
outstanding Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable
redemption date, as the case may be;

                                       49
<Page>

        (b)     in the case of an election under Section 8.02 hereof, the
Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United
States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (A) the Company has
received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a
ruling or (B) since the date of this Indenture, there has been a change in the
applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based
thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of the
outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax
purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal
income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

        (c)     in the case of an election under Section 8.03 hereof, the
Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United
States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the Holders of the
outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax
purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal
income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

        (d)     no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing on the date of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default
resulting from the incurrence of Indebtedness all or a portion of the proceeds
of which will be used to defease the Notes pursuant to this Article 8
concurrently with such incurrence) or insofar as Sections 6.01(g) or 6.01(h)
hereof is concerned, at any time in the period ending on the 91st day after the
date of deposit;

        (e)     such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in
a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement
or instrument (other than this Indenture) to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound;

        (f)     the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that, assuming no intervening bankruptcy of the Company or
any Subsidiary between the date of deposit and the 91st day following the
deposit and assuming that no Holder is an "insider" of the Company under
applicable bankruptcy law, after the 91st day following the deposit, the trust
funds will not be subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally;

        (g)     the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the
intent of preferring the Holders over any other creditors of the Company or with
the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any other creditors
of the Company or others; and

        (h)     the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance have been complied with.

SECTION 8.05.   DEPOSITED MONEY AND GOVERNMENT SECURITIES TO BE HELD IN TRUST;
                OTHER MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.

        Subject to Section 8.06 hereof, all money and non-callable Government
Securities (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other
qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 8.05, the
"Trustee") pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof in respect of the outstanding Notes
shall be

                                       50
<Page>

held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of
such Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any
Paying Agent (including the Company acting as Paying Agent) as the Trustee may
determine, to the Holders of such Notes of all sums due and to become due
thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest, but such money
need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

        The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or
other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or non-callable Government
Securities deposited pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof or the principal and
interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other
charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Notes.

        Anything in this Article 8 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee
shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the request of the
Company any money or non-callable Government Securities held by it as provided
in Section 8.04 hereof which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof
delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under Section
8.04(a) hereof), are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required
to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.

SECTION 8.06.   REPAYMENT TO COMPANY.

        Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held
by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any,
or interest on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such
principal, and premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be
paid to the Company on its request or (if then held by the Company) shall be
discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note shall thereafter look
only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or
such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the
Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment,
may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in the New York
Times and The Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such money
remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be
less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any
unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

SECTION 8.07.   REINSTATEMENT.

        If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any United States
dollars or non-callable Government Securities in accordance with Section 8.02 or
8.03 hereof, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court
or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such
application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes
shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to
Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is
permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03
hereof, as the case may be; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if the Company makes any
payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note following the
reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights
of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money held by the
Trustee or Paying Agent.

                                    ARTICLE 9
                        AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER

SECTION 9.01.   WITHOUT CONSENT OF HOLDERS OF NOTES.

        Notwithstanding Section 9.02 of this Indenture, the Company, the
Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture,
the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes without the consent of any Holder of a
Note to:

        (a)     cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency in the Indenture;
PROVIDED that such amendments do not adversely affect the interests of the
Holders in any material respect;

        (b)     comply with the provisions of Article 5 hereof;

        (c)     comply with any requirements of the SEC in connection with the
qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act;

        (d)     evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a
successor Trustee;

        (e)     make any change that, in the good faith opinion of the Board of
Directors, does not materially and adversely affect the rights of any Holder;

        (f)     provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of
certificated Notes or to alter the provisions of Article 2 hereof (including the
related definitions) in a manner that does not materially and adversely affect
the rights of any Holder;

        (g)     provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with
the limitations set forth in this Indenture as of the date hereof; or

        (h)     allow any Subsidiary Guarantor to execute a supplemental
indenture and/or a Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to the Notes.

        Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board
of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental
Indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section
7.02 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Subsidiary
Guarantors in the execution of any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized
or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further appropriate
agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall
not be obligated to enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture that
affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.

SECTION 9.02.   WITH CONSENT OF HOLDERS OF NOTES.

        Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company, the
Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture
(including Section 4.15 and 4.21 hereof), the Subsidiary Guarantees and the
Notes with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount
of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class (including consents
obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase
of, the Notes), and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, any existing
Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the
payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, except a
payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or
compliance with any provision of this Indenture, the Subsidiary

                                       52
<Page>

Guarantees or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes voting as a single
class (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange
offer for, or purchase of, the Notes). Section 2.08 hereof shall determine which
Notes are considered to be "outstanding" for purposes of this Section 9.02.

        Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board
of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental
Indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the
Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Notes as aforesaid, and upon receipt by
the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee shall
join with the Company in the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture
unless such amended or supplemental Indenture directly affects the Trustee's own
rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case
the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into
such amended or supplemental Indenture.

        It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under
this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or
waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance
thereof.

        After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section becomes
effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of Notes affected thereby a
notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of
the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in
any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental
Indenture or waiver. Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a
single class may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with
any provision of this Indenture or the Notes. However, without the consent of
each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not
(with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):

        (a)     change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any
installment of interest on, any Note;

        (b)     reduce the principal amount of, or premium, if any, or interest
on, any Note;

        (c)     change the place or currency of payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on, any Note;

        (d)     impair Holders' right to institute suit for the enforcement of
any payment on or after the Stated Maturity (or, in the case of a redemption, on
or after the Redemption Date) of any Note;

        (e)     waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal
of or premium, interest or Additional or Special Interest, if any, on the Notes
(except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including
Additional Notes, if any) and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from
such acceleration);

        (f)     modify Article 10 in any manner adverse to the Holders; or

        (g)     reduce the principal amount or percentage of Notes whose Holders
must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver hereunder.

                                       53
<Page>

SECTION 9.03.   COMPLIANCE WITH TRUST INDENTURE ACT.

        Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes shall be
set forth in a amended or supplemental Indenture that complies with the TIA as
then in effect.

SECTION 9.04.   REVOCATION AND EFFECT OF CONSENTS.

        Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to
it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and
every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same
debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not
made on any Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a
Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written
notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes
effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance
with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.

SECTION 9.05.   NOTATION ON OR EXCHANGE OF NOTES.

        The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment,
supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Company in
exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an
Authentication Order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment,
supplement or waiver.

        Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not
affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.

SECTION 9.06.   TRUSTEE TO SIGN AMENDMENTS, ETC.

        The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized
pursuant to this Article Nine if the amendment or supplement does not adversely
affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Company
may not sign an amendment or supplemental Indenture until the Board of Directors
approves it. In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee
shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01 hereof) shall be fully
protected in relying upon, in addition to the documents required by Section
12.04 hereof, an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that
the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or
permitted by this Indenture.

                                   ARTICLE 10
                                  SUBORDINATION

SECTION 10.01.  AGREEMENT TO SUBORDINATE.

        The Company agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Note agrees, that the
payment of the Senior Subordinated Obligations will, to the extent set forth
herein, be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full, in
cash or cash equivalents, of all Obligations due in respect of existing and
future Senior Indebtedness (whether outstanding on the date hereof or hereafter
created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed), and that the subordination is for the
benefit of the holders of Senior Indebtedness.

        Upon any distribution to creditors of the Company in a liquidation or
dissolution of the Company or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
receivership or similar proceeding relating to the Company or its property, in
an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshaling of the Company's
assets and liabilities:

                (i)   holders of Senior Indebtedness will be entitled to receive
        payment in full in cash or cash equivalents of all Obligations due in
        respect of Senior Indebtedness (including, with respect to Designated
        Senior Indebtedness, any interest accruing after the commencement of any
        proceeding described below at the rate specified in the applicable
        Designated Senior Indebtedness whether or not interest is an allowed
        claim enforceable against the Company in such proceeding) before the
        Holders of Notes will be entitled to receive any payment on account of
        Senior Subordinated Obligations or any payment to acquire any of the
        Notes for cash, property or securities, or any distribution with respect
        to the Notes of any cash, property or securities (except that Holders of
        Notes may receive and retain (A) Permitted Junior Securities and (B)
        payments made from the trust described in Article 8 hereof), in the
        event of any distribution to creditors of the Company: (1) in a
        liquidation or dissolution of the Company; (2) in a bankruptcy,
        reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating
        to the Company or its property; (3) in an assignment for the benefit of
        creditors; or (4) in any marshaling of the Company's assets and
        liabilities.

                (ii)  until all Obligations due with respect to Senior
        Indebtedness (including, with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness,
        any interest accruing after the commencement of any proceeding described
        before at the rate specified in the applicable Designated Senior
        Indebtedness whether or not interest is an allowed claim enforceable
        against the Company in such proceeding) are paid in full in cash or cash
        equivalents, any such distribution to which Holders would be entitled
        shall be made to the holders of Senior Indebtedness (except that Holders
        may receive and retain (A) Permitted Junior Securities and (B) payments
        made from the trust described in Article 8 hereof).

SECTION 10.03.  DEFAULT ON DESIGNATED SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS.

        (a)     The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors may not make any
payment in respect of any Senior Subordinated Obligations (except in (A)
Permitted Junior Securities or (B) from the trust described in Article 8 hereof)
nor may any amounts be set aside or deposited pursuant to Article 8 if:

                (i)   a payment default on Designated Senior Indebtedness occurs
        and is continuing beyond any applicable grace period; or

                (ii)  any other default occurs and is continuing on any series
        of Designated Senior Indebtedness that permits holders of that series of
        Designated Senior Indebtedness to accelerate its maturity and the
        Trustee receives a notice of such default (a "Payment Blockage Notice")
        from the trustee or other representative for the holders of any
        Designated Senior Indebtedness, or the holders of at least a majority of
        the outstanding principal amount of such Designated Senior Indebtedness.
        No new Payment Blockage Notice may be delivered unless and until: (A)
        360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior
        Payment Blockage Notice; and (B) all scheduled payments of principal,
        interest and premium and Additional or Special Interest, if any, on the
        Notes that have come due have been paid in full in cash. No nonpayment

                                       55
<Page>

        default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any
        Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee shall be, or be made, the basis
        for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice.

        (b)     Payments on the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees may and
shall be resumed:

                (i)   in the case of a payment default, upon the date on which
        such default is cured or waived; and

                (ii)  in case of a nonpayment default, the earlier of the date
        on which such nonpayment default is cured or waived or 179 days after
        the date on which the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received.

        (c)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will be permitted to
redeem any Notes to the extent required to do so by any Gaming Authority as
described in Section 3.08 hereof.

SECTION 10.04.  ACCELERATION OF NOTES.

        If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default,
the Company shall promptly notify holders of Senior Indebtedness of the
acceleration.

SECTION 10.05.  WHEN DISTRIBUTION MUST BE PAID OVER.

        In the event that the Trustee or any Holder receives any payment of any
Senior Subordinated Obligations with respect to the Notes at a time when the
Trustee or such Holder, as applicable, has actual knowledge that such payment is
prohibited by Section 10.03 hereof, such payment shall be held by the Trustee or
such Holder, in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid forthwith over and
delivered, upon written request, to, the holders of Senior Indebtedness as their
interests may appear or their Representative under the indenture or other
agreement (if any) pursuant to which Senior Indebtedness may have been issued,
as their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of all
Obligations with respect to Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid to the extent
necessary to pay such Obligations in full in accordance with their terms, after
giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of
Senior Indebtedness.

        With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, the Trustee
undertakes to perform only such obligations on the part of the Trustee as are
specifically set forth in this Article 10, and no implied covenants or
obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be read
into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe
any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and shall not be
liable to any such holders if the Trustee shall pay over or distribute to or on
behalf of Holders or the Company or any other Person money or assets to which
any holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article
10, except if such payment is made as a result of the willful misconduct or
gross negligence of the Trustee.

SECTION 10.06.  NOTICE BY COMPANY.

        The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee, holders of Senior
Indebtedness and the Paying Agent of any facts known to the Company that would
cause a payment of any Senior Subordinated Obligations with respect to the Notes
to violate this Article 10, but failure to give such notice shall not affect the
subordination of the Notes to the Senior Indebtedness as provided in this
Article 10.

                                       56
<Page>

SECTION 10.07.  SUBROGATION.

        Subject to the payment in full, in cash or cash equivalents, of all
Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of Notes shall be subrogated to the rights of
the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of
assets of the Company applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until all amounts
owing on the Notes shall be paid in full, in cash or cash equivalents, and for
the purpose of such subrogation no payments or distributions to the holders of
Senior Indebtedness by or on behalf of the Holders by virtue of this Article 10,
which otherwise would have been made to the Holders, shall, as between the
Company and the Holders, be deemed to be payment by the Company to holders or on
account of the Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of
this Article 10 are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the
relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of Senior
Indebtedness, on the other hand.

        If any payment or distribution to which the Holders would otherwise have
been entitled but for the provisions of this Article 10 shall have been applied,
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 10, to the payment of all amounts
payable under the Senior Indebtedness, then the Holders shall be entitled to
receive from the holders of such Senior Indebtedness any payments or
distributions received by such holders of Senior Indebtedness in excess of the
amount sufficient to pay all amounts payable under or in respect of the Senior
Indebtedness in full, in cash or cash equivalents.

SECTION 10.08.  RELATIVE RIGHTS.

        This Article 10 defines the relative rights of Holders of Notes and
holders of Senior Indebtedness. Nothing in this Indenture shall:

                (i)   impair, as between the Company and Holders of Notes, the
        obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay
        principal of and interest on the Notes in accordance with their terms;

                (ii)  affect the relative rights of Holders of Notes and
        creditors of the Company other than their rights in relation to holders
        of Senior Indebtedness; or

                (iii) prevent the Trustee or any Holder of Notes from exercising
        its available remedies upon a Default or Event of Default, subject to
        the rights of holders and owners of Senior Indebtedness to receive
        distributions and payments otherwise payable to Holders of Notes.

        If the Company fails because of this Article 10 to pay principal of or
interest on a Note on the due date, the failure is still a Default or Event of
Default.

SECTION 10.09.  SUBORDINATION MAY NOT BE IMPAIRED BY COMPANY.

        No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness to enforce the
subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes shall be impaired by
any act or failure to act by the Company or any Holder or by the failure of the
Company or any Holder to comply with this Indenture.

SECTION 10.10.  DISTRIBUTION OR NOTICE TO REPRESENTATIVE.

        Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of
Senior Indebtedness, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their
Representative.

                                       57
<Page>

        Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in
this Article 10, the Trustee and the Holders of Notes shall be entitled to rely
upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any
certificate of such Representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or
other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders of Notes
for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such
distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of
the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid
or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article
10.

SECTION 10.11.  RIGHTS OF TRUSTEE AND PAYING AGENT.

        Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 10 or any other provision
of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the
existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment or
distribution by the Trustee, and the Trustee and the Paying Agent may continue
to make payments on the Notes, unless the Trustee shall have received at its
Corporate Trust Office at least two Business Days prior to the date of such
payment written notice of facts that would cause the payment of any Senior
Subordinated Obligations with respect to the Notes to violate this Article 10.
Only the Company or a Representative may give the notice. Nothing in this
Article 10 shall impair the claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or
pursuant to Section 7.07 hereof.

        The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior
Indebtedness with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any
Agent may do the same with like rights.

SECTION 10.12.  AUTHORIZATION TO EFFECT SUBORDINATION.

        Each Holder of Notes, by the Holder's acceptance thereof, authorizes and
directs the Trustee on such Holder's behalf to take such action as may be
necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this
Article 10, and appoints the Trustee to act as such Holder's attorney-in-fact
for any and all such purposes. If the Trustee does not file a proper proof of
claim or proof of debt in the form required in any proceeding referred to in
Section 6.09 hereof at least 30 days before the expiration of the time to file
such claim, the Representatives are hereby authorized to file an appropriate
claim for and on behalf of the Holders of the Notes.

SECTION 10.13.  AMENDMENTS.

        The provisions of this Article 10 shall not be amended or modified
without the written consent of the holders of all Senior Indebtedness.

                                   ARTICLE 11
                              SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES

SECTION 11.01.  SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEE.

        Subject to this Article 11, each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby,
jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note
authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors
and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture,
the Notes or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that: (a)
the principal of and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid in full when
due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest
on the overdue principal of and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and
all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or
thereunder

                                       58
<Page>

will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms
hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or
renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be
promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the
extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise.
Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so
guaranteed for whatever reason, the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be jointly and
severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Subsidiary Guarantor
agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.

        The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder
shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to
enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect
to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the
Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Subsidiary
Guarantor. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment,
demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or
bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the
Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this
Subsidiary Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of
the obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture.

        If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to
return to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any custodian, trustee,
liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or
the Subsidiary Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such
Holder, this Subsidiary Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall
be reinstated in full force and effect.

        Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any
right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations
guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Subsidiary
Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand,
(x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as
provided in Article 6 hereof for the purposes of this Subsidiary Guarantee,
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such
acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the
event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in
Article 6 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall
forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary Guarantors for the purpose of
this Subsidiary Guarantee. The Subsidiary Guarantors shall have the right to
seek contribution from any non-paying Subsidiary Guarantor so long as the
exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the
Guarantee.

SECTION 11.02.  SUBORDINATION OF SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEE.

        The Obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary
Guarantee pursuant to this Article 11 shall be junior and subordinated to the
Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor on the same basis as the Notes
are junior and subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as if and to
the same extent the same provisions were set out in this Article 11. For the
purposes of the foregoing sentence, but without limiting the generality thereof,
the Trustee and the Holders shall have the right to receive and/or retain
payments by any of the Subsidiary Guarantors only at such times as they may
receive and/or retain payments in respect of the Notes pursuant to this
Indenture, including Article 10 hereof, and are subject to the same turnover
provisions.

                                       59
<Page>

SECTION 11.03.  LIMITATION ON SUBSIDIARY GUARANTOR LIABILITY.

        Each Subsidiary Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder,
hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Subsidiary
Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or
conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance
Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to
the extent applicable to any Subsidiary Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing
intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby
irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor will, after
giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed
liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and
after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from
or payments made by or on behalf of any other Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of
the obligations of such other Subsidiary Guarantor under this Article 11, result
in the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee
not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

SECTION 11.04.  EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEE.

        To evidence its Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01, each
Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee
substantially in the form included in Exhibit B shall be endorsed by an Officer
of such Subsidiary Guarantor on each Note authenticated and delivered by the
Trustee and that this Indenture shall be executed on behalf of such Subsidiary
Guarantor by an Officer thereof.

        Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee
set forth in Section 11.01 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding
any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee.

        If an Officer whose signature is on this Indenture or on the Subsidiary
Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the
Note on which a Subsidiary Guarantee is endorsed, the Subsidiary Guarantee shall
be valid nevertheless.

        The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication
thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Subsidiary Guarantee set
forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Subsidiary Guarantors.

        In the event that the Company creates or acquires any new Subsidiaries
subsequent to the date of this Indenture, if required by Section 4.11 hereof,
the Company shall cause such Subsidiaries to execute supplemental indentures to
this Indenture and Subsidiary Guarantees in accordance with Section 4.11 hereof
and this Article 11, to the extent applicable.

SECTION 11.05.  SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS MAY CONSOLIDATE, ETC., ON CERTAIN TERMS.

        Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.06, no Subsidiary Guarantor
may consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Subsidiary
Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person whether or not affiliated with
such Subsidiary Guarantor unless:

        (a)     subject to Section 11.06 hereof, the Person formed by or
surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than a Subsidiary Guarantor
or the Company) unconditionally assumes all the obligations of such Subsidiary
Guarantor, pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and

                                       60
<Page>

substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, under the Notes, the Indenture
and the Subsidiary Guarantee on the terms set forth herein or therein; and

        (b)     immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default
or Event of Default exists.

        In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon
the assumption by the successor Person, by supplemental indenture, executed and
delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the
Subsidiary Guarantee endorsed upon the Notes and the due and punctual
performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be
performed by the Subsidiary Guarantor, such successor Person shall succeed to
and be substituted for the Subsidiary Guarantor with the same effect as if it
had been named herein as a Subsidiary Guarantor. Such successor Person thereupon
may cause to be signed any or all of the Subsidiary Guarantees to be endorsed
upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been
signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the Subsidiary
Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit
under this Indenture as the Subsidiary Guarantees theretofore and thereafter
issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such
Subsidiary Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.

        Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 hereof, and notwithstanding
clauses (a) and (b) above, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the
Notes shall prevent any consolidation or merger of a Subsidiary Guarantor with
or into the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale
or conveyance of the property of a Subsidiary Guarantor as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety to the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor.

SECTION 11.06.  RELEASES FOLLOWING SALE OF ASSETS.

        In the event of a sale or other disposition of all of the assets of any
Subsidiary Guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or
other disposition of all to the capital stock of any Subsidiary Guarantor, in
each case to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such
transactions) a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, then such Subsidiary
Guarantor (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of merger,
consolidation or otherwise, of all of the capital stock of such Subsidiary
Guarantor) or the corporation acquiring the property (in the event of a sale or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary
Guarantor) will be released and relieved of any obligations under its Subsidiary
Guarantee; PROVIDED that the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are
applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture,
including without limitation Section 4.15 hereof. Upon delivery by the Company
to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the
effect that such sale or other disposition was made by the Company in accordance
with the provisions of this Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.15
hereof, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to
evidence the release of any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under its
Subsidiary Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Subsidiary
Guarantee of Empress Casino Corporation will not be released upon the occurrence
of a Trigger Event.

        Any Subsidiary Guarantor not released from its obligations under its
Subsidiary Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of principal of and
interest on the Notes and for the other obligations of any Subsidiary Guarantor
under this Indenture as provided in this Article 11.

"Company"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at 9%
per annum from July 31, 2001 until maturity. The Company will pay interest
semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, or if any such
day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (each an
"Interest Payment Date"). Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent
date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the
date of issuance; PROVIDED that if there is no existing Default in the payment
of interest, and if this Note is authenticated between a record date referred to
on the face hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall
accrue from such next succeeding Interest Payment Date; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that
the first Interest Payment Date shall be March 1, 2002. The Company shall pay
interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any
Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal and premium, if any, from time to time on
demand at a rate that is equal to the rate then in effect; it shall pay interest
(including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on
overdue installments of interest and Additional or Special Interest, if any,
(without regard to any applicable grace periods) from time to time on demand at
the same rate to the extent lawful. Interest will be computed on the basis of a
360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

     2.     METHOD OF PAYMENT. The Company will pay interest on the Notes
(except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders of Notes
at the close of business on the February 15 or August 15 next preceding the
Interest Payment Date, even if such Notes are canceled after such record date
and on or before such Interest Payment Date, except as provided in Section 2.12
of the Indenture with respect to defaulted interest. The Notes will be payable
as to principal, premium, if any, and interest at the office or agency of the
Company maintained for such purpose within or without the City and State of New
York, or, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check
mailed to the Holders at their addresses set forth in the register of Holders,
and PROVIDED that payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds will
be required with respect to principal of and interest, premium on, all Global
Notes and all other Notes the Holders of which shall have provided wire transfer
instructions to the Company or the Paying Agent. Such payment shall be in such
coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is
legal tender for payment of public and private debts.

appear before, submit to the jurisdiction of or provide information to, such
Gaming Authority and such holder or beneficial owner either refuses to do so or
otherwise fails to comply with such request or requirement within a reasonable
period of time; or (ii) determines that any holder or beneficial owner of Notes
is not suitable or qualified with respect to beneficial ownership of the Notes,
then the Company may: (1) require that such holder or beneficial owner dispose
of its Notes within 30 days (or such earlier date as required by the Gaming
Authority) of (A) termination of the 30-day period described above for the
holder or beneficial owner to apply for a

<Page>

license, qualification or finding of suitability or (B) the receipt of the
notice from the Gaming Authority that the holder or beneficial owner will not be
licensed, qualified or found suitable; or (2) redeem the Notes of such holder or
beneficial owner at a price equal to the lesser of (A) the price at which such

such Notes or, if the Notes are listed on a national securities exchange, the
last reported sale price on the date the Company notifies such holder or
beneficial owner of the redemption.

     (b)    Immediately upon a determination that a holder or beneficial owner
will not be licensed, qualified or found suitable, the holder or beneficial
owner will have no further rights (i) to exercise any right conferred by the
Notes, directly or indirectly, through any trustee, nominee or any other Person
or entity, or (ii) to receive any interest or other distribution or payment with
respect to the Notes or any remuneration in any form from the Company for

Notes then outstanding, at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued interest to the Payment Date.

     (b)    ASSET SALE. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Sale, unless (i) the
consideration received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is at least
equal to the fair market value of the assets sold or disposed of and (ii) at
least 75% of the consideration received consists of cash or Temporary Cash
Investments or the assumption of Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary (other than Indebtedness to the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary), PROVIDED that the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is
irrevocably and unconditionally released from all liability under such
Indebtedness.

     Notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate a Permitted Asset Swap
without complying with such paragraph if (i) immediately after giving effect to
such Permitted Asset Swap, the Company could Incur least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant Section 4.07 of the Indenture and (ii) the Company or the
applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives assets at the
time of such Permitted Asset Swap of a value at least equal to the fair market
value of the assets or other property sold or otherwise disposed of (as
evidenced by a resolution of the Company's Board of Directors set forth in an
Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee, or, in the event that the fair
market value of such Permitted Asset Swap exceeds $100.0 million, such fair
market value has been determined by a written opinion of an investment banking
firm of national standing or other recognized independent expert with experience
appraising the terms and conditions of the type of transaction contemplated
thereby).

more Asset Sales occurring on or after the Closing Date, the Company shall or
shall cause the relevant Restricted Subsidiary to: (i) (A) apply an amount equal
to such Net Cash Proceeds to permanently repay Senior

<Page>

Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or Indebtedness of any
other Restricted Subsidiary, in each case owing to a Person other than the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or (B) invest an equal amount, or
the amount not so applied pursuant to clause (A) (or enter into a definitive
agreement committing to so invest within 12 months after the date of such
agreement), in property or assets (other than current assets) of a nature or
type or that are used in a business (or in a company having property and assets
of a nature or type, or engaged in a business) similar or related to the nature
or type of the property and assets of, or the business of, the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries existing on the date of such investment and (ii) apply
(no later than the end of the 12-month period referred to in clause (i)(B)) such
excess Net Cash Proceeds (to the extent not applied pursuant to clause (i)) as
provided in the following paragraph of this paragraph 8(b). The amount of such
excess Net Cash Proceeds required to be applied (or to be committed to be
applied) during such 12-month period as set forth in clause (i) of the preceding
sentence and not applied as so required by the end of such period shall
constitute "Excess Proceeds."

     If, as of the first day of any calendar month, the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds not theretofore subject to an Offer to Purchase pursuant to this
paragraph 8(b) totals at least $10.0 million (or at least $25 million in the
event that at such time there is no Indebtedness of the Company or its
Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding that is PARI PASSU with or subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes with a comparable limitation of less than $25
million), the Company must commence, not later than the fifteenth Business Day
of such month, and consummate an Offer to Purchase from the Holders (and if
required by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, from the holders of such
Pari Passu Indebtedness) on a PRO RATA basis an aggregate principal amount of
Notes (and Pari Passu Indebtedness) equal to the Excess Proceeds on such date,
at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, PLUS, in each
case, accrued interest and Additional or Special Interest, if any, to the
Payment Date. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu
Indebtedness tendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds,

     12.    AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER. Subject to certain exceptions, the
Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes may be amended or supplemented
with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of
the then outstanding Notes and Additional Notes, if any, voting as a single
class, and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the
Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes may be waived with the consent
of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
and Additional Notes, if any, voting as a single class. Without the consent of
any Holder of a Note, the Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes may
be amended or supplemented to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to
provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated
Notes, to provide for the assumption of the Company's or Subsidiary Guarantor's
obligations to Holders of the Notes in case of a merger or consolidation, to
make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the
Holders of the Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under
the Indenture of any such Holder, to comply with the requirements of the SEC in
order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust
Indenture Act, to provide for the Issuance of Additional Notes in accordance
with the limitations set forth in the Indenture, or to allow any Guarantor to
execute a supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or a Subsidiary Guarantee
with respect to the Notes.

     13.    DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES. Each of the following constitutes an Event of
Default: (a) default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on any
Note when the same becomes due and payable at maturity, upon acceleration,
redemption or otherwise whether or not such payment is prohibited by Article 10
of the Indenture; (b) default in the payment of interest on any Note when the
same becomes due and payable, or Additional or Special Interest, if any, and
such default continues for a period of 30 days whether or not such payment is
prohibited by Article 10 of the Indenture; (c) failure by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to comply with any of the provisions of Sections 4.21 or 5.01
of the Indenture or the failure to make or consummate an Offer to Purchase in

Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to observe or perform any covenant
or agreement in the Indenture or this Note (other than a default under clause
(a), (b), or (c) of this paragraph 14) for 30 days after notice to the Company
by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of
the Notes (including Additional Notes, if any) then outstanding voting as a
single class; (e) the occurrence with respect to any issue or issues of
Indebtedness of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary having an outstanding
principal amount of $20.0 million or more in the aggregate for all such issues
of all such Persons, whether such Indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be
created, (i) an event of default that has caused the holder thereof to declare
such Indebtedness to be due and payable prior to its Stated Maturity and such
Indebtedness has not been discharged in full or such acceleration has not been
rescinded or annulled within 30 days of such acceleration and/or (ii) the
failure to make a principal payment at the final (but not any interim) fixed
maturity and such defaulted payment shall not have been made, waived or extended
within 30 days of such payment default; (f) any final judgment or order (not
covered by insurance) for the payment of money in excess of $20.0 million in the
aggregate for all such final judgments or orders against all such Persons
(treating any deductibles, self-insurance or retention as not so covered) shall
be rendered against the Company or any Significant Subsidiary and shall not be
paid or discharged, and there shall be any period of 60 consecutive days
following entry of the final judgment or order that causes the aggregate amount
for all such final judgments or orders outstanding and not paid or discharged
against all such Persons to exceed $20.0 million during which a stay of
enforcement of such final judgment or order, by reason of a pending appeal or
otherwise, shall not be in effect; (g) a court having jurisdiction in the
premises enters a decree or order for (A) relief in respect of the Company or
any Significant Subsidiary in an involuntary case under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, (B)
appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee,
sequestrator or similar official of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or

Significant Subsidiary or (C) the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of

                                      A-6
<Page>

the Company or any Significant Subsidiary and, in each case, such decree or
order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 30 consecutive days;
(h) the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (A) commences a voluntary case
under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or
hereafter in effect, or consents to the entry of an order for relief in an
involuntary case under any such law, (B) consents to the appointment of or
taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee,
sequestrator or similar official of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or
for all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company or any
Significant Subsidiary or (C) effects any general assignment for the benefit of
creditors; (i) except as permitted by the Indenture, any Subsidiary Guarantee
shall be held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or shall
cease for any reason to be in full force and effect or any Guarantor, or any
Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, shall deny or disaffirm its
obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee; or (j) the revocation, termination,
suspension or other cessation of effectiveness for a period or more than 90
consecutive days of any Gaming License that results in the cessation or
suspension of gaming operations at any Material Casino; PROVIDED that any
voluntary relinquishment of or failure to renew after revocation a Gaming
License of a Material Casino if such relinquishment or failure to renew is, in
the reasonable, good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company,
evidenced by a resolution of such Board, both desirable in the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and not
disadvantageous in any material respect to the holders of the Notes shall not
constitute an Event of Default. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of
Default specified in clause (g) or (h) above that occurs with respect to the
Company) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the
Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes, then
outstanding, by written notice to the Company (and to the Trustee if such notice
is given by the Holders), may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders
shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any,
on the Notes to be immediately due and payable. Upon a declaration of
acceleration, such principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest shall be
immediately due and payable. In the event of a declaration of acceleration
because an Event of Default set forth in clause (e) above has occurred and is
continuing, such declaration of acceleration shall be automatically rescinded
and annulled if the event of default triggering such Event of Default pursuant
to clause (e) above shall be remedied or cured by the Company or the relevant
Significant Subsidiary or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness
within 60 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto. If an
Event of Default specified in clause (g) or (h) above occurs with respect to the
Company, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the Notes
then outstanding shall IPSO FACTO become and be immediately due and payable
without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
The Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may waive all past defaults
and rescind and annul a declaration of acceleration and its consequences if (i)
all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued interest on the Notes that have become due solely
by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived and (ii) the
rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any
provision of this Note or the Indenture. The Trustee may maintain a proceeding
even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in
the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in
exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not
impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the
Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.

     14.    TRUSTEE DEALINGS WITH COMPANY. The Trustee, in its individual or any
other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services
for the Company or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Company or
its Affiliates, as if it were not the Trustee.

                                      A-7
<Page>

     15.    NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. A director, officer, employee,
incorporator or stockholder, of the Company, as such, shall not have any
liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or
their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance
of the Notes.

     16.    AUTHENTICATION. This Note shall not be valid until authenticated by
the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent.

     17.    ABBREVIATIONS. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a
Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (=
tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship
and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts
to Minors Act).

     18.    CUSIP NUMBERS. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the
Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused
CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and the Trustee may use CUSIP numbers
in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made
as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as
contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the
other identification numbers placed thereon.

     The Company will furnish to any Holder upon written request and without
charge a copy of the Indenture and/or the Registration Rights Agreement.
Requests may be made to:

Trustee pursuant to this Subsidiary Guarantee and the Indenture are expressly
subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantors as set forth in
Section 11.2 and Article 10 of the Indenture and reference is hereby made to

Guarantee is noted shall have been executed by the Trustee under the Indenture
by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers.

     The Obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee
shall be limited to the extent necessary to insure that it does not constitute a
fraudulent conveyance under applicable law.

York.

Capitalized terms used herein have the same meanings given in the Indenture

                         FORM OF SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE
                    TO BE DELIVERED BY SUBSEQUENT GUARANTORS

     SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE (this "Supplemental Indenture"), dated as of
________________, among __________________ (the "Guaranteeing Subsidiary"), a
subsidiary of Argosy Gaming Company (or its permitted successor), a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), the Company, the other Subsidiary Guarantors (as
defined in the Indenture referred to herein) and Bank One Trust Company,
National Association, as trustee under the indenture referred to below (the
"Trustee").

                                   WITNESSETH

     WHEREAS, the Company has heretofore executed and delivered to the Trustee
an indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of July 31, 2001 providing for the
issuance of an initial aggregate principal amount of $200,000,000 of 9% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2011 (the "Notes");

     WHEREAS, the Indenture provides that under certain circumstances the
Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental
indenture pursuant to which the Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall unconditionally
guarantee all of the Company's Obligations under the Notes and the Indenture on
the terms and conditions set forth herein (the "Subsidiary Guarantee"); and

     WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Indenture, the Trustee is
authorized to execute and deliver this Supplemental Indenture.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the
Guaranteeing Subsidiary and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree for the
equal and ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes as follows:

     1.   CAPITALIZED TERMS. Capitalized terms used herein without definition
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

     2.   AGREEMENT TO GUARANTEE. The Guaranteeing Subsidiary hereby agrees as
follows:

          (a)   Along with all Subsidiary Guarantors named in the Indenture, to
     jointly and severally Guarantee to each Holder of a Note authenticated and
     delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns,
     the Notes or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that:

               (i)  the principal of and interest on the Notes will be promptly
          paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration,
          redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and
          interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of
          the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will
          be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the
          terms hereof and thereof; and

               (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of
          any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly
          paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the
          extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
          otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any
          performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Subsidiary
          Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same
          immediately.

                                      B-1
<Page>

          (b)   The obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective
     of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or the
     Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or
     consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or
     thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to
     enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute
     a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor.

          (c)   The following is hereby waived: diligence presentment, demand of
     payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or
     bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against
     the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever.

          (d)   This Subsidiary Guarantee shall not be discharged except by
     complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and the
     Indenture, and the Guaranteeing Subsidiary accepts all obligations of a
     Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture.

          (e)   If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or
     otherwise to return to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, or any
     Custodian, Trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation
     to either the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors, any amount paid by
     either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Subsidiary Guarantee, to the
     extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and
     effect.

          (f)   The Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall not be entitled to any right
     of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations
     guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed
     hereby.

          (g)   As between the Subsidiary Guarantors, on the one hand, and the
     Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the
     obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6
     of the Indenture for the purposes of this Subsidiary Guarantee,
     notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such
     acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in
     the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as
     provided in Article 6 of the Indenture, such obligations (whether or not
     due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary
     Guarantors for the purpose of this Subsidiary Guarantee.

          (h)   The Subsidiary Guarantors shall have the right to seek
     contribution from any non-paying Subsidiary Guarantor so long as the
     exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the
     Guarantee.

          (i)   Pursuant to Section 11.03 of the Indenture, after giving effect
     to any maximum amount and any other contingent and fixed liabilities that
     are relevant under any applicable Bankruptcy Law or fraudulent conveyance
     laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive
     contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Subsidiary
     Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Subsidiary Guarantor
     under Article 11 of the Indenture, this new Subsidiary Guarantee shall be
     limited to the maximum amount permissible such that the obligations of such
     Subsidiary Guarantor under this Subsidiary Guarantee will not constitute a
     fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

          (j)   Pursuant to Section 11.02 of the Indenture, the Obligations of
     the Guaranteeing Subsidiary under the Subsidiary Guarantee shall be junior
     and subordinated to the Senior Indebtedness of the Guaranteeing Subsidiary
     on the same basis as the Notes are junior and

                                      B-2
<Page>

     subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as if and to the same
     extent the same provisions were set out in this Section 2.

     3.   EXECUTION AND DELIVERY. Each Guaranteeing Subsidiary agrees that the
Subsidiary Guarantees shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any
failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee.

     4.   GUARANTEEING SUBSIDIARY MAY CONSOLIDATE, ETC. ON CERTAIN TERMS.

     (a)  The Guaranteeing Subsidiary may not consolidate with or merge with
or into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person)
another corporation, Person or entity whether or not affiliated with such
Subsidiary Guarantor unless:

          (i)   subject to Sections 11.05 and 11.06 of the Indenture, the
     Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other
     than a Subsidiary Guarantor or the Company) unconditionally assumes all the
     obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor, pursuant to a supplemental
     indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
     under the Notes, the Indenture and the Subsidiary Guarantee on the terms
     set forth herein or therein; and

          (ii)  immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no
     Default or Event of Default exists.

     (b)  In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and
upon the assumption by the successor corporation, by supplemental indenture,
executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee,
of the Subsidiary Guarantee endorsed upon the Notes and the due and punctual
performance of all of the covenants and conditions of the Indenture to be
performed by the Subsidiary Guarantor, such successor corporation shall succeed
to and be substituted for the Subsidiary Guarantor with the same effect as if it
had been named herein as a Subsidiary Guarantor. Such successor corporation
thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Subsidiary Guarantees to be
endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not
have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the Subsidiary
Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit
under the Indenture as the Subsidiary Guarantees theretofore and thereafter
issued in accordance with the terms of the Indenture as though all of such
Subsidiary Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.

     (c)  Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 and Section 11.05 of
Article 11 of the Indenture, and notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above,
nothing contained in the Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any
consolidation or merger of a Subsidiary Guarantor with or into the Company or
another Subsidiary Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the
property of a Subsidiary Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an
entirety to the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor.

     5.   RELEASES.

     (a)  In the event of a sale or other disposition of all of the assets of
any Subsidiary Guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a
sale or other disposition of all to the capital stock of any Subsidiary
Guarantor, in each case to a Person that is not (either before or after giving
effect to such transaction) a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, then such
Subsidiary Guarantor (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of
merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all of the capital stock of such
Subsidiary Guarantor) or the corporation acquiring the property (in the event of
a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such
Subsidiary Guarantor) will be released and

                                      B-3
<Page>

relieved of any obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee; PROVIDED that the
Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture, including without limitation Section
4.15 of the Indenture. Upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such sale or
other disposition was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of
the Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.15 of the Indenture, the
Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the
release of any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under its Subsidiary
Guarantee.

     (b)  Any Subsidiary Guarantor not released from its obligations under its
Subsidiary Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of principal of and
interest on the Notes and for the other obligations of any Subsidiary Guarantor
under the Indenture as provided in Article 11 of the Indenture.

     6.   NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. No past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder or agent of the Guaranteeing
Subsidiary, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company
or any Guaranteeing Subsidiary under the Notes, any Subsidiary Guarantees, the
Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of the
Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and
release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may
not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it
is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

     7.   NEW YORK LAW TO GOVERN. THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
SHALL GOVERN AND BE USED TO CONSTRUE THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE BUT WITHOUT
GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT
THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY.

     8.   COUNTERPARTS The parties may sign any number of copies of this
Supplemental Indenture. Each signed copy shall be an original, but all of them
together represent the same agreement.

     9.   EFFECT OF HEADINGS. The Section headings herein are for convenience
only and shall not affect the construction hereof.

     10.  THE TRUSTEE. The Trustee shall not be responsible in any manner
whatsoever for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental
Indenture or for or in respect of the recitals contained herein, all of which
recitals are made solely by the Guaranteeing Subsidiary and the Company.

                                      B-4

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Supplemental
Indenture to be duly executed and attested, all as of the date first above
written.

semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, or if any such
day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (each an
"Interest Payment Date"). Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent
date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the
date of issuance; PROVIDED that if there is no existing Default in the payment
of interest, and if this Note is authenticated between a record date referred to
on the face hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall
accrue from such next succeeding Interest Payment Date; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that
the first Interest Payment Date shall be March 1, 2002. The Company shall pay
interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any
Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal and premium, if any, from time to time on
demand at a rate that is equal to the rate then in effect; it shall pay interest
(including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on
overdue installments of interest and Additional or Special Interest, if any,
(without regard to any applicable grace periods) from time to time on demand at
the same rate to the extent lawful. Interest will be computed on the basis of a
360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

     2.   METHOD OF PAYMENT. The Company will pay interest on the Notes (except
defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders of Notes at the
close of business on the February 15 or August 15 next preceding the Interest
Payment Date, even if such Notes are canceled after such record date and on or
before such Interest Payment Date, except as provided in Section 2.12 of the
Indenture with respect to defaulted interest. The Notes will be payable as to
principal, premium, if any, and interest at the office or agency of the Company
maintained for such purpose within or without the City and State of New York,
or, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check
mailed to the Holders at their addresses set forth in the register of Holders,
and PROVIDED that payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds will
be required with respect to principal of and interest, premium on, all Global
Notes and all other Notes the Holders of which shall have provided wire transfer
instructions to the Company or the Paying Agent. Such payment shall be in such
coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is
legal tender for payment of public and private debts.

appear before, submit to the jurisdiction of or provide information to, such
Gaming Authority and such holder or beneficial owner either refuses to do so or
otherwise fails to comply with such request or requirement within a reasonable
period of time; or (ii) determines that any holder or beneficial owner of Notes
is not suitable or qualified with respect to beneficial ownership of the Notes,
then the Company may: (1) require that such holder or beneficial owner dispose
of its Notes within 30 days (or such earlier date as required by the Gaming
Authority) of (A) termination of the 30-day period described above for the
holder or beneficial owner to apply for a license, qualification or finding of
suitability or (B) the receipt of the notice from the Gaming Authority

                                       A-3
<Page>

                                                                     EXHIBIT 4.9

the date the Company notifies such holder or beneficial owner of the redemption.

     (b)  Immediately upon a determination that a holder or beneficial owner
will not be licensed, qualified or found suitable, the holder or beneficial
owner will have no further rights (i) to exercise any right conferred by the

or entity, or (ii) to receive any interest or other distribution or payment with
respect to the Notes or any remuneration in any form from the Company for

Notes then outstanding, at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued interest to the Payment Date.

Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Sale, unless (i) the consideration received
by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is at least equal to the fair
market value of the assets sold or disposed of and (ii) at least 75% of the
consideration received consists of cash or Temporary Cash Investments or the
assumption of Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other
than Indebtedness to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary), PROVIDED that
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is irrevocably and unconditionally
released from all liability under such Indebtedness.

     Notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate a Permitted Asset Swap
without complying with such paragraph if (i) immediately after giving effect to
such Permitted Asset Swap, the Company could Incur least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant Section 4.07 of the Indenture and (ii) the Company or the
applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives assets at the
time of such Permitted Asset Swap of a value at least equal to the fair market
value of the assets or other property sold or otherwise disposed of (as
evidenced by a resolution of the Company's Board of Directors set forth in an
Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee, or, in the event that the fair
market value of such Permitted Asset Swap exceeds $100.0 million, such fair
market value has been determined by a written opinion of an investment banking
firm of national standing or other recognized independent expert with experience
appraising the terms and conditions of the type of transaction contemplated
thereby).

     Within twelve months after the receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds from one or
more Asset Sales occurring on or after the Closing Date, the Company shall or
shall cause the relevant Restricted Subsidiary to: (i)(A) apply an amount equal

<Page>

                                                                     EXHIBIT 4.9

or (B) invest an equal amount, or the amount not so applied pursuant to clause
(A) (or enter into a definitive agreement committing to so invest within 12
months after the date of such agreement), in property or assets (other than
current assets) of a nature or type or that are used in a business (or in a
company having property and assets of a nature or type, or engaged in a
business) similar or related to the nature or type of the property and assets
of, or the business of, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries existing on
the date of such investment and (ii) apply (no later than the end of the
12-month period referred to in clause (i)(B)) such excess Net Cash Proceeds (to
the extent not applied pursuant to clause (i)) as provided in the following
paragraph of this paragraph 8(b). The amount of such excess Net Cash Proceeds
required to be applied (or to be committed to be applied) during such 12-month
period as set forth in clause (i) of the preceding sentence and not applied as
so required by the end of such period shall constitute "Excess Proceeds."

     If, as of the first day of any calendar month, the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds not theretofore subject to an Offer to Purchase pursuant to this
paragraph 8(b) totals at least $10.0 million (or at least $25 million in the
event that at such time there is no Indebtedness of the Company or its
Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding that is PARI PASSU with or subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes with a comparable limitation of less than $25
million), the Company must commence, not later than the fifteenth Business Day
of such month, and consummate an Offer to Purchase from the Holders (and if
required by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, from the holders of such
Pari Passu Indebtedness) on a PRO RATA basis an aggregate principal amount of
Notes (and Pari Passu Indebtedness) equal to the Excess Proceeds on such date,
at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, PLUS, in each
case, accrued interest and Additional or Special Interest, if any, to the
Payment Date. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu
Indebtedness tendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds,
the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness shall be purchased on a PRO RATA basis.
Upon the completion of any such Offers to Purchase, regardless of the amount of
Notes validly tendered, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero.

     9.   NOTICE OF REDEMPTION. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30
days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder whose
Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address. Notes in denominations
larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of
$1,000, unless all of the Notes held by a Holder are to be redeemed. On and
after the redemption date interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions thereof
called for redemption.

     10.  DENOMINATIONS, TRANSFER, EXCHANGE. The Notes are in registered form
without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. The

things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the

transfer of any Note or portion of a Note selected for redemption, except for
the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part. Also, the Company
need not exchange or register the transfer of any Notes for a period of 15 days
before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or during the period between a record
date and the corresponding Interest Payment Date.

Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes may be amended or supplemented
with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of
the then outstanding Notes and Additional Notes, if any, voting as a single
class, and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the
Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes may be waived with the consent
of the Holders of a majority in

<Page>

                                                                     EXHIBIT 4.9

principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and Additional Notes, if any,

Holder, to comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or
maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, to
provide for the Issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations
set forth in the Indenture, or to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental
indenture to the Indenture and/or a Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to the

created, (i) an event of default that has caused the holder thereof to declare
such Indebtedness to be due and payable prior to its Stated Maturity and such
Indebtedness has not been discharged in full or such acceleration has not been
rescinded or annulled within 30 days of such acceleration and/or (ii) the
failure to make a principal payment at the final (but not any interim) fixed
maturity and such defaulted payment shall not have been made, waived or extended
within 30 days of such payment default; (f) any final judgment or order (not
covered by insurance) for the payment of money in excess of $20.0 million in the
aggregate for all such final judgments or orders against all such Persons
(treating any deductibles, self-insurance or retention as not so covered) shall
be rendered against the Company or any Significant Subsidiary and shall not be
paid or discharged, and there shall be any period of 60 consecutive days
following entry of the final judgment or order that causes the aggregate amount
for all such final judgments or orders outstanding and not paid or discharged
against all such Persons to exceed $20.0 million during which a stay of
enforcement of such final judgment or order, by reason of a pending appeal or
otherwise, shall not be in effect; (g) a court having jurisdiction in the
premises enters a decree or order for (A) relief in respect of the Company or
any Significant Subsidiary in an involuntary case under any applicable

                                                                     EXHIBIT 4.9

substantially all of the property and assets of the Company or any Significant
Subsidiary or (C) effects any general assignment for the benefit of creditors;
(i) except as permitted by the Indenture, any Subsidiary Guarantee shall be held
in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or shall cease for any
reason to be in full force and effect or any Guarantor, or any Person acting on
behalf of any Guarantor, shall deny or disaffirm its obligations under its
Subsidiary Guarantee; or (j) the revocation, termination, suspension or other
cessation of effectiveness for a period or more than 90 consecutive days of any
Gaming License that results in the cessation or suspension of gaming operations
at any Material Casino; PROVIDED that any voluntary relinquishment of or failure
to renew after revocation a Gaming License of a Material Casino if such
relinquishment or failure to renew is, in the reasonable, good faith judgment of
the Board of Directors of the Company, evidenced by a resolution of such Board,
both desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and not disadvantageous in any material respect
to the holders of the Notes shall not constitute an Event of Default. If an
Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (g) or (h)
above that occurs with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing under
the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes, then outstanding, by written notice to the Company (and to
the Trustee if such notice is given by the Holders), may, and the Trustee at the
request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and
accrued interest, if any, on the Notes to be immediately due and payable. Upon a
declaration of acceleration, such principal of, premium, if any, and accrued
interest shall be immediately due and payable. In the event of a declaration of
acceleration because an Event of Default set forth in clause (e) above has
occurred and is continuing, such declaration of acceleration shall be
automatically rescinded and annulled if the event of default triggering such
Event of Default pursuant to clause (e) above shall be remedied or cured by the
Company or the relevant Significant Subsidiary or waived by the holders of the
relevant Indebtedness within 60 days after the declaration of acceleration with
respect thereto. If an Event of Default specified in clause (g) or (h) above
occurs with respect to the Company, the principal of, premium, if any, and
accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding shall IPSO FACTO become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of
the Trustee or any Holder. The Holders of at least a majority in principal
amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and to the
Trustee, may waive all past defaults and rescind and annul a declaration of
acceleration and its consequences if (i) all existing Events of Default, other
than the nonpayment of the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest
on the Notes that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration,
have been cured or waived and (ii) the rescission would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. If an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect
the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes or to
enforce the performance of any provision of this Note or the Indenture. The
Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes
or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the
Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon
an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver
of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the
extent permitted by law.

     14.  TRUSTEE DEALINGS WITH COMPANY. The Trustee, in its individual or any
other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services
for the Company or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Company or
its Affiliates, as if it were not the Trustee.

     15.  NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. A director, officer, employee,
incorporator or stockholder, of the Company, as such, shall not have any
liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or
their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance
of the Notes.

in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made
as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as
contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the
other identification numbers placed thereon.

     The Company will furnish to any Holder upon written request and without
charge a copy of the Indenture and/or the Registration Rights Agreement.
Requests may be made to:

                          FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE

          SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE (this "Supplemental Indenture"), dated as of
July 31, 2001, among Empress Casino Joliet Corporation, an Illinois corporation
(the "Guaranteeing Subsidiary"), a subsidiary of Argosy Gaming Company (or its
permitted successor), a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), the Company, the
other Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined in the Indenture referred to herein) and
Bank One Trust Company, National Association, as trustee under the indenture
referred to below (the "Trustee").

                                   WITNESSETH

          WHEREAS, the Company has heretofore executed and delivered to the
Trustee an indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of July 31, 2001 providing for
the issuance of an initial aggregate principal amount of $200,000,000 of 9%
Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 (the "Notes");

          WHEREAS, the Indenture provides that under certain circumstances the
Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental
indenture pursuant to which the Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall unconditionally
guarantee all of the Company's Obligations under the Notes and the Indenture on
the terms and conditions set forth herein (the "Subsidiary Guarantee"); and

          WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Indenture, the Trustee is
authorized to execute and deliver this Supplemental Indenture.

          NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the
Guaranteeing Subsidiary and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree for the
equal and ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes as follows:

          1.  CAPITALIZED TERMS. Capitalized terms used herein without
definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

          2.  AGREEMENT TO GUARANTEE. The Guaranteeing Subsidiary hereby agrees
as follows:

          (a) Along with all Subsidiary Guarantors named in the Indenture, to
jointly and severally Guarantee to each Holder of a Note authenticated and
delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, the
Notes or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that:

              (i)  the principal of and interest on the Notes will be promptly
          paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration,
          redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and
          interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of
          the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or

<Page>

          thereunder will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in
          accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and

              (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any
          Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly
          paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the
          extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
          otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any
          performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Subsidiary
          Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same
          immediately.

          (b) The obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of
the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or the Indenture, the
absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder
of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of
any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other
circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or
defense of a guarantor.

          (c) The following is hereby waived: diligence presentment, demand of
payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy
of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company,
protest, notice and all demands whatsoever.

          (d) This Subsidiary Guarantee shall not be discharged except by
complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and the
Indenture, and the Guaranteeing Subsidiary accepts all obligations of a
Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture.

          (e) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise
to return to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, or any Custodian, Trustee,
liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or
the Subsidiary Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such
Holder, this Subsidiary Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall
be reinstated in full force and effect.

          (f) The Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall not be entitled to any right of
subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed
hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby.

          (g) As between the Subsidiary Guarantors, on the one hand, and the
Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations
guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 of the Indenture
for the purposes of this Subsidiary Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay,
injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the
obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of
acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 of the Indenture, such
obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and
payable by the Subsidiary Guarantors for the purpose of this Subsidiary
Guarantee.

<Page>

          (h) The Subsidiary Guarantors shall have the right to seek
contribution from any non-paying Subsidiary Guarantor so long as the exercise of
such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantee.

          (i) Pursuant to Section 11.03 of the Indenture, after giving effect to
any maximum amount and any other contingent and fixed liabilities that are
relevant under any applicable Bankruptcy Law or fraudulent conveyance laws, and
after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from
or payments made by or on behalf of any other Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of
the obligations of such other Subsidiary Guarantor under Article 11 of the
Indenture, this new Subsidiary Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount
permissible such that the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under this
Subsidiary Guarantee will not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

          (j) Pursuant to Section 11.02 of the Indenture, the Obligations of the
Guaranteeing Subsidiary under the Subsidiary Guarantee shall be junior and
subordinated to the Senior Indebtedness of the Guaranteeing Subsidiary on the
same basis as the Notes are junior and subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of
the Company, as if and to the same extent the same provisions were set out in
this Section 2.

          3.  EXECUTION AND DELIVERY. Each Guaranteeing Subsidiary agrees that
the Subsidiary Guarantees shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding
any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee.

          4.  GUARANTEEING SUBSIDIARY MAY CONSOLIDATE, ETC. ON CERTAIN TERMS.

          (a) The Guaranteeing Subsidiary may not consolidate with or merge with
or into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person)
another corporation, Person or entity whether or not affiliated with such
Subsidiary Guarantor unless:

              (i)  subject to Sections 11.05 and 11.06 of the Indenture, the
          Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if
          other than a Subsidiary Guarantor or the Company) unconditionally
          assumes all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor, pursuant to
          a supplemental indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
          to the Trustee, under the Notes, the Indenture and the Subsidiary
          Guarantee on the terms set forth herein or therein; and

              (ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no
          Default or Event of Default exists.

          (b) In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and
upon the assumption by the successor corporation, by supplemental indenture,
executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee,
of the Subsidiary Guarantee endorsed upon the Notes and the due and punctual
performance of all of the covenants and conditions of the Indenture to be
performed by the Subsidiary Guarantor, such successor corporation shall succeed
to and be substituted for the Subsidiary Guarantor with the same effect as if it
had been named herein as a Subsidiary Guarantor. Such successor corporation
thereupon may cause to be signed

<Page>

any or all of the Subsidiary Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes
issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company
and delivered to the Trustee. All the Subsidiary Guarantees so issued shall in
all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under the Indenture as the
Subsidiary Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture as though all of such Subsidiary Guarantees had been
issued at the date of the execution hereof.

          (c) Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 and Section 11.05 of
Article 11 of the Indenture, and notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above,
nothing contained in the Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any
consolidation or merger of a Subsidiary Guarantor with or into the Company or
another Subsidiary Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the
property of a Subsidiary Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an
entirety to the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor.

          5.  RELEASES.

          (a) In the event of a sale or other disposition of all of the assets
of any Subsidiary Guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a
sale or other disposition of all to the capital stock of any Subsidiary
Guarantor, in each case to a Person that is not (either before or after giving
effect to such transaction) a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, then such
Subsidiary Guarantor (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of
merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all of the capital stock of such
Subsidiary Guarantor) or the corporation acquiring the property (in the event of
a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such
Subsidiary Guarantor) will be released and relieved of any obligations under its
Subsidiary Guarantee; PROVIDED that the Net Cash Proceeds of such sale or other
disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.15 of the Indenture. Upon
delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such sale or other disposition was made by
the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, including
without limitation Section 4.15 of the Indenture, the Trustee shall execute any
documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of any Subsidiary
Guarantor from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee.

          (b) Any Subsidiary Guarantor not released from its obligations under
its Subsidiary Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of principal of
and interest on the Notes and for the other obligations of any Subsidiary
Guarantor under the Indenture as provided in Article 11 of the Indenture.

          6.  NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. No past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder or agent of the Guaranteeing
Subsidiary, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company
or any Guaranteeing Subsidiary under the Notes, any Subsidiary Guarantees, the
Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of the
Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and
release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may
not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it
is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

          7.  NEW YORK LAW TO GOVERN. THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
SHALL GOVERN AND BE USED TO CONSTRUE THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE BUT WITHOUT
GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT
THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY.

          8.  COUNTERPARTS The parties may sign any number of copies of this
Supplemental Indenture. Each signed copy shall be an original, but all of them
together represent the same agreement.

          9.  EFFECT OF HEADINGS. The Section headings herein are for
convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.

          10. THE TRUSTEE. The Trustee shall not be responsible in any manner
whatsoever for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental
Indenture or for or in respect of the recitals contained herein, all of which
recitals are made solely by the Guaranteeing Subsidiary and the Company.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Supplemental
Indenture to be duly executed and attested, all as of the date first above
written.

actions taken by the Company or its successor after the Change of Control, be
entitled to an amount equivalent to three (3) years of Base Salary and one (1)

     Such amount shall be paid on the Change of Control Date (i) if the Employee

Control, or is offered a position with lesser responsibility, or lesser salary
within one (1) year after the Change of Control; or (ii) the Employee elects to
terminate his/her employment on the Change of Control Date.

     In the event the Employee's employment is terminated after the public
announcement of a Change of Control but prior to the consummation of a Change of
Control for any reason other than those set forth in Sections 5, 6(a), (b), (d)
or (e), then the Employee shall be entitled to an amount equivalent to three (3)
years Base Salary and one (1) year Benefits.

     For purposes hereof, Change of Control shall mean (i) any merger or
consolidation of the company with or into any person or any sale, transfer or

transaction, any "person" or "group" (as such terms are used for purposes of
Sections 13 (d) and 14 (d) of the Exchange Act, whether or not applicable)
(other than an Excluded Person) is or becomes the "beneficial owner," directly
or indirectly, or more than 50% of the total voting power in the aggregate
normally entitled to vote in the election of directors, managers, or trustees,

or becomes the "beneficial owner," directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of
the total voting power in the aggregate normally entitled to vote in elections
of directors of the company, or (iii) during any period of 12 consecutive months
after the Issue Date, individuals who at the beginning of any such 12-month
period constituted the Board of Directors of the Company (together with any new
directors whose elections by such Board or whose nomination for election by the
shareholders of the Company was approved by a vote of a majority of the
directors then still in office who were either directors at the beginning of
such period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so
approved) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the Board of
Directors of the Company then in office.

     5.  DEATH OR TOTAL DISABILITY OF EMPLOYEE.

         (a) DEATH. In the event of the death of the Employee during the term of
this Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate effective as of the date of the
Employee's death and the Company shall have no further obligations or liability
hereunder, except the Company shall pay to the Employee's estate the portion, if
any, of the (i) Employee's Base Salary for the period up to the Employee's date
of death which remains unpaid; and (ii) amounts payable pursuant to any employee
benefits plans in which the Employee was a participant prior to his/her death.

         (b) DISABILITY. In the event the Employee suffers a Disability (as
hereinafter defined) during the term of this Agreement, the Company shall have
the right to terminate the Employee's employment hereunder by giving the
Employee ten

<Page>

(10) days written notice thereof, and upon expiration of such ten (10) day
period, the Company shall not have any further obligations or liability under
this Agreement, except the Company shall pay to Employee the portion, if any,
of: (i) the Employee's Base Salary for the period to the date of termination
which remains unpaid; and (ii) any amounts payable pursuant to any employee
benefit plans in which the Employee was a participant prior to the date of his
termination.

     The term "Disability", when used herein, shall mean when the Employee
qualifies for a benefit under the Company's long term disability plan or if the
Company does not have a long term disability plan, it shall mean a mental or
physical condition which, in the reasonable opinion of the Company's designated
medical doctor, renders the Employee unable or incompetent to carry out the job
responsibilities he/she held or tasks to which he/she was assigned at the time
the disability was incurred for a period of 60 consecutive days or 60 days in
any 12 consecutive month period.

     6.  TERMINATION. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Employee's employment under this Agreement may be terminated
by the Company upon written notice to Employee for any of the following reasons:

         (a) If the Employee is denied a gaming license by any state gaming
board or any other gaming authority having jurisdiction over the operations of
the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates ("Gaming Body"), or if the
Employee's license issued by any Gaming Body is suspended, revoked, sanctioned
or reprimanded for any period of time or for any conduct;

         (b) If the Employee commits an offense involving moral turpitude under
Federal, State or local laws or ordinances or conducts himself/herself publicly
or privately in any manner which causes him/her to be held in public ridicule or
scorn, or causes public scandal or uses liquors, narcotics or drugs to such an
extent as will have visible detrimental effect on the Company;

         (c) If the Employee fails to perform his/her job responsibilities in a
manner satisfactory to the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors;

         (d) If the Employee knowingly violates any of the internal control
procedures and/or company policies of the Company; or, knowingly violates any
statute, rule or regulation of any Gaming Body, the United States Coast Guard,
or any other governmental body having jurisdiction over the business activities
of the Company; and;

         (e) If the Employee breaches any term or condition of this agreement.

     In the event that the Company shall terminate the Employee's employment
pursuant to this Section 6, the Company shall not have any further obligations
or liabilities under this Agreement, except the Company shall (a) pay to the
Employee his/her Base Salary up to the 30th day following the date of the
Employee's termination

                                        4
<Page>

hereunder or if the termination is pursuant to Section 6(c) hereof or pursuant
to a job elimination with results in a discontinuation of employment with the
Company, then the Company shall pay to Employee his/her Base Salary for 12
months and an amount equal to his/her banked, but not yet paid bonus following
the date of the Employee's termination; and (b) any amounts or benefits payable
pursuant to any employee benefit plan in which the Employee was a participant
prior to the date of his/her termination, subject, however, to the terms and
provisions of any such employee benefit plan.

     Without limiting the foregoing, the Employee shall surrender all vehicles,
credit cards, uniforms, cellular telephones, pagers and other Company property
to the Company prior to any payment to the Employee hereunder.

     Following any notice of termination of employment hereunder, Employee shall
fully cooperate with the Company in all matters relating to the winding up of
his/her pending work on behalf of the Company and the orderly transfer of such
work to the other professional employees of the Company. On or after the giving
of notice of termination hereunder and during any applicable notice period, the
Company shall be entitled to such full-time or part-time services of Employee as
the Company may reasonably require.

     7.  DISCOVERIES. The Employee will promptly disclose in writing to the
Company each improvement, discovery, idea, concept and invention relating to the
business of the Company, made or conceived by the Employee either alone or in
conjunction with others while employed by the Company hereunder or within six
(6) months after the termination of such employment. This provision shall not
apply to an invention for which no equipment, supplies, facility or trade secret
information of the Company was used and which was developed entirely on the
Employee's own time, and (a) which does not relate (i) to the business of the
Company or (ii) to the Company's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or
development, or (b) which does not result from any work performed by the
Employee for the Company. The Employee will not disclose any such improvement,
discovery, idea, concept or invention to any person except the Company. Each
such improvement, discovery, idea, concept or invention shall be the sole and
exclusive property of, and is hereby assigned to, the Company, and at the
request of the Company, the Employee will assist and cooperate with the Company
and any person or persons (at the Company's or such other person's expense) from
time to time designated by the Company to obtain for the Company the grant of
any letters patent in the United States and/or such other country or countries
as may be designated by the Company, covering any such improvement, discovery,
idea, concept or invention and will in connection therewith execute such
applications, statements, assignments or other documents, furnish such
information and data and take all such other action (including, without
limitation, the giving of testimony) as the Company may from time to time
reasonably request.

     8.  NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETITION.

                                        5
<Page>

         (a) The Employee recognizes and acknowledges that he/she will have
access to certain confidential information of the Company, including but not
limited to, trade secrets, customer lists, sales records, future casino
development plans and other proprietary commercial information, and that such
information constitutes valuable, special and unique property of the Company.
The Employee agrees that he/she will not, for any reason or purpose whatsoever,
during or after the term of his/her employment, disclose any of such
confidential information to any party without express authorization of the
Company, except as necessary in the ordinary course of performing his/her duties
hereunder.

         (b) The Employee agrees with the Company that during the term of
his/her employment with the Company (or any affiliate or subsidiary of the
Company) and for a period of one (1) year following the termination of his/her
employment with the Company (or any affiliate or subsidiary of the Company),
he/she will not, without prior written consent of the Company, engage directly
or indirectly in any business (either financially or as a shareholder, employee,
officer, partner, independent contractor or owner, or in any other capacity
calling for the rendition of personal service or acts of management, operation
or control) which owns, operates or manages casinos, bingo parlors or other
gaming facilities within the Territory (as hereinafter defined); provided,
however, that Employee may own up to three percent (3%) of any class of
securities of a corporation engaged in such a competitive business if such
securities are listed on a national securities exchange or registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

         (c) The Employee further agrees that for a period of ninety (90) days
following the termination of his/her employment with the Company (or any
affiliate or subsidiary of the Company), he/she will not, without prior written
consent of the Company, recruit any other Company employees away from the
Company.

         (d) The term "Territory" as used herein shall mean a 150 mile radius of
each casino, bingo parlor or gaming facility being operated or managed by the
Company or for which the Company has either received a local community
endorsement or filed for a gaming license as of the date of termination.

         (e) The Employee acknowledges that his/her compliance with the
agreements in paragraphs 8(a) and 8(b) hereof is necessary to protect the good
will and other proprietary interests of the Company and that he/she is one of
the principal executives of the Company and conversant with its affairs, its
trade secrets, its customers and other proprietary information. The Employee
acknowledges that a breach of his/her agreements in paragraphs 8(a) and 8(b)
hereof will result in irreparable and continuing damage to the Company and the
business of the Company, for which there will be no adequate remedy at law; and
agrees that in the event of any breach of the aforesaid agreements in paragraphs
8(a) and 8(b), the Company and its successors and assigns shall be entitled to
injunctive relief of 50% of the Employee's annual salary and to such other and
further relief as may be proper. The Employee further agrees that in the event
of any breach of the agreement in paragraph 8(c), the

                                        6
<Page>

Company and its successors and assigns shall be entitled to injunctive relief of
100% of the Employee's annual salary and to such other and further relief as may
be proper.

of any and all other employee arrangements between the Employee and the Company
or any of their respective subsidiary and affiliated companies.

     10. AMENDMENTS. Any amendment to this Agreement, including any extensions
or renewal of the term of employment of Employee, shall be made in writing and
signed by the parties hereto.

     11. ENFORCEABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, then such provision shall be
deemed to be modified or restricted to the extent and in the manner necessary to
render the same valid and enforceable, or shall be deemed excised from the
Agreement as the case may require, and this Agreement shall be construed and
enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, as if such provision had been
originally incorporated herein as so modified or restricted, or as if such
provision had not been originally incorporated herein, as the case may be.

     12. GOVERNING LAW. The validity and effect of this Agreement shall be
governed exclusively by the laws of the State of Illinois, excluding the
"conflicts of laws" rules of that state.

     13. ASSIGNMENT.

         (a) The rights and obligations of the Company under this Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be binding upon, the successors and
assigns of the Company, subject to the provisions set forth in Section 4 hereof.

         (b) This Agreement and the obligations created hereunder may not be
assigned by the Employee.

     14. ATTORNEYS' FEES. In the event any legal action to enforce the terms and
conditions of this Agreement is commenced, reasonable attorneys' fees, court
costs and all reasonable costs of litigation shall be awarded to the prevailing
party.

     15. NOTICES. All notices required or permitted to be given hereunder shall

     16. WAIVER. No claim or right arising out of a breach or default under this
Agreement can be discharged in whole or in part by a waiver of that claim or
right unless the waiver is supported by consideration and is in writing and
executed by the aggrieved party hereto or its or his/her duly authorized agent.
