     This report on Form 10-K contains certain "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are intended to be covered by the
safe harbors created by those laws. Forward-looking statements include
information about possible or assumed future results of our operations. All
statements, other than statements of historical facts, included or incorporated
by reference in this report that address activities, events or developments that
we expect or anticipate may occur in the future, including such things as future
capital expenditures, business strategies, competitive strengths, goals, growth
of our businesses and operations, plans and references to future successes may
be considered forward-looking statements. Also, when we use words such as
"anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "probably" or
similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements.

     Many risks and uncertainties may impact the matters addressed in
forward-looking statements. Many possible events or factors could affect our
future financial results and performance. These could cause our results or
performance to differ materially from those we express in our forward-looking
statements. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying our
forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of these assumptions, and
therefore also the forward-looking statements based on these assumptions, could
themselves prove to be inaccurate. In light of the significant uncertainties
inherent in the forward-looking statements which are included in this report,
our inclusion of this information is not a representation by us or any other
person that our objectives and plans will be achieved.

     Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made and we will
not update these forward-looking statements unless the securities laws require
us to do so. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, any
forward-looking events discussed in this report may not occur.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

TERMINOLOGY

     As used in this report, unless otherwise required by the context, the terms
"we," "us," "our" and the "Company," refer to HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. and
its consolidated subsidiaries, and the term "HCC" refers only to HCC Insurance
Holdings, Inc. All trade names or trademarks appearing in this report are the
property of their respective holders.

OVERVIEW

     Our company, HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc., is a Delaware corporation formed
in 1991 as a holding company for insurance companies, underwriting agencies and
intermediary operations. It's predecessor company was formed in 1974. Our
principal and executive offices are located at 13403 Northwest Freeway, Houston,
Texas 77040 and our telephone number is (713) 690-7300. We maintain an internet
website at www.hcch.com. The reference to our website address does not
constitute the incorporation by reference of the information contained at that
site in this report.

     We provide specialized property and casualty, and accident and health
insurance coverages, underwriting agency and intermediary services and other
insurance related services both to commercial customers and individuals. We
operate primarily in the United States and in the United Kingdom, although some
of our operations have a broader international scope. We underwrite insurance on
both a direct basis, where we insure a risk in exchange for a premium, and
reinsurance basis, where we insure all or a portion of another insurance
company's risk in exchange for all or portion of the premium. We market our
products both directly to customers and through a network of independent and
affiliated agents and brokers.

     Since our founding, we have been consistently profitable, generally
reporting annual increases in gross written premium and total revenue. During
the period 1996 through 2000, we had an average statutory combined ratio of
94.7% versus the less favorable 105.2% (1996-1999) recorded by the U.S. property
and casualty insurance industry overall. During the same period, our gross
written premium increased from $337.3 million to $967.5 million, an increase of
187% while net written premium increased 55% from $183.0 million to $283.8
million. During this period, our revenues increased from $270.8 million to
$466.2 million, an increase of 72%.

     During the period December 31, 1996 through December 31, 2000, our
shareholders' equity increased from $296.5 million to $529.4 million, a 79%
increase. After giving effect to the March, 2001 public offering of our Common
Stock, our pro forma shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2000 would have
been $682.3 million. During the same four-year period, our assets increased from
$965.8 million to $2.7 billion, a 184% increase.

     Our insurance companies are risk-bearing and focus their underwriting
activities on providing insurance and/or reinsurance in the following lines of
business:

     - accident and health;

     - general aviation;

     - marine and offshore energy;

     - medical stop-loss;

     - property; and

     - workers' compensation.

                                        2

     Our principal insurance company subsidiaries are Houston Casualty Company
in Houston, Texas and London, England; HCC Life Insurance Company in Houston,
Texas; U.S. Specialty Insurance Company in Houston, Texas; and Avemco Insurance
Company in Frederick, Maryland. In the United States, certain of our insurance
companies operate on an admitted, or licensed, basis. Our other insurance
companies operate in some states on a surplus lines basis as a non-admitted, or
unlicensed, insurer offering insurance coverage not otherwise available from an
admitted insurer in the relevant state.

     Our operating property and casualty insurance companies are rated "A+
(Superior)" by A.M. Best Company and "AA (Very Strong)" by Standard and Poor's,
two nationally recognized independent rating agencies. These ratings are
intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurer's ability to meet its
obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed at investors.

     Our underwriting agencies are fee-based, non-risk bearing and underwrite on
behalf of our insurance companies and other insurance companies. Our
underwriting agencies generate revenues based entirely on management fees and
profit commissions and specialize in medical stop-loss insurance and a variety
of accident and health related insurance and reinsurance products.

     Our principal underwriting agency subsidiaries are LDG Reinsurance
Corporation in Wakefield, Massachusetts and New York City, New York; and HCC
Benefits Corporation in Atlanta, Georgia; Costa Mesa, California; Wakefield,
Massachusetts; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Dallas, Texas. We have recently
consolidated the operations of certain of our agencies with certain of our
insurance companies to improve operational efficiencies.

     Our combined gross written premium in 2000 was over $1.4 billion, after
intercompany eliminations. Our insurance company operations wrote $967.5 million
of gross written premium and our underwriting agencies wrote $1.1 billion of
written premium, before intercompany eliminations.

     Our intermediary subsidiaries are fee based and non-risk bearing and
provide insurance and reinsurance brokerage services for our insurance companies
and our clients. They earn commission income and to a lesser extent, fees for
certain services, generally paid by the insurance and reinsurance companies with
whom the business is placed. These operations consist of:

     - consulting on risks;

     - marketing risks;

     - placing risks; and

     - servicing risks.

     Our intermediaries specialize in developing and marketing employee benefit
plans on a retail basis and in placing reinsurance for both accident and health,
and property and casualty lines of business. Our principal intermediary
subsidiaries are HCC Intermediaries, Inc. in Houston, Texas; HCC Employee
Benefits, Inc. in Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia; and Rattner Mackenzie
Limited in London, England.

     We also operate insurance claims adjusting and other service operations
which support our operations as well as provide services for other clients. In
addition, we make strategic investments, usually in businesses that complement
our operations. Our revenues from these investments are comprised of dividends
from, or equity in earnings of, the company in which we invested and gains or
losses on the sale of such investments.

OUR STRATEGY

     Our business philosophy as an insurer is to maximize underwriting profits
while limiting risk in order to preserve shareholders' equity and maximize
earnings. We concentrate our insurance writings in selected, narrowly defined
lines of business where we believe we can achieve an underwriting profit. We
focus on lines of business that have relatively short lead times between the
occurrence of an insured event and the

                                        3
<PAGE>   5

reporting of claims. We market our insurance products both directly to customers
and through independent or affiliated agents and brokers.

     The property and casualty insurance industry is cyclical, and individual
lines of business experience their own cycles within that overall industry
cycle. In our insurance company operations, we believe our operational
flexibility, experienced underwriting personnel and access to, and expertise in,
the reinsurance marketplace allow us to implement a strategy of emphasizing more
profitable lines of business during periods of increased premium rates and
de-emphasizing less profitable lines of business during periods of severe
competition. In addition, we believe that our underwriting agencies and
intermediary subsidiaries complement our insurance underwriting activities. Our
ability to utilize affiliated insurers, underwriting agencies, intermediaries
and service providers permits us to retain a greater portion of the gross
revenue derived from written premium.

     We purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk we have assumed
(known as ceding) to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium
we receive in connection with the risk. We purchase reinsurance to limit the net
loss from both individual and catastrophic risks to our insurance companies. The
amount of reinsurance we purchase varies by, among other things, the particular
risks inherent in the policies underwritten, the pricing of reinsurance and the
competitive conditions within the relevant line of business. In 2000, due to a
hardening of the respective markets, premium rates in the accident and health,
general aviation and medical stop-loss lines of business increased. We
anticipate continued improvements in these markets in 2001. In response to these
changing market conditions, we plan to continue to expand the underwriting
activities in our insurance company operations.

     As part of this expansion, we have recently consolidated certain of our
underwriting agencies with certain of our insurance companies for the purpose of
streamlining our business. We have consolidated the operations of our domestic
general aviation underwriting agency, HCC Aviation, and our occupational
accident and workers' compensation underwriting agency, HCC Employer Services
into those U.S. Specialty, and the operations of our London-based accident and
health underwriting agency, LDG Re (London) with those of the London branch of
Houston Casualty. We believe that the consolidation of these operations will
result in greater efficiency in these businesses. We expect that this
consolidation will result in a reduction in our management fee revenues and the
net earnings of our underwriting agencies, but that any such reduction will be
more than offset over time by increases in the net earnings of our insurance
companies. The cost of this restructuring was $1.0 million (after-tax) and was
taken in the fourth quarter of 2000. As market conditions warrant, we anticipate
reviewing other agency operations to determine if similar consolidation
activities will provide greater operating efficiencies.

     We also acquire or make strategic investments in companies that present an
opportunity for future profits or for enhancement of our business. We expect to
continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses with established
managements and established reputations in the insurance industry. We believe
that we can enhance acquired businesses through the synergies created by our
underwriting capabilities and our other operations. However, our business plan
is shaped by our underlying business philosophy, which is to maximize
underwriting profit, while preserving shareholders' equity. As a result, our
primary objective is to increase net earnings rather than market share or gross
written premium.

     In our ongoing operations, we will continue to:

     - emphasize the underwriting of lines of business in which premium rates,
       the availability and cost of reinsurance, and market conditions warrant;

     - limit our net loss exposure to our insurance company subsidiaries from a
       catastrophe loss through the use of reinsurance; and

     - review the potential acquisition of specialty insurance operations and
       other strategic investments.

INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION

     Financial information concerning the Company's operations by industry
segment is set forth in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes
thereto.

MAJOR ACQUISITIONS

     We have made a series of strategic acquisitions that have furthered our
overall business strategy. Our recent larger transactions are described below:

     On January 31, 1999, we acquired PEPYS Holdings Limited. PEPYS is a holding
company for Rattner Mackenzie. The total initial consideration was $54.8 million
in cash and deferred payments of $8.3 million in cash and 414,207 shares of our
common stock. We may pay additional amounts in the future based upon the
attainment of certain earnings benchmarks over the ensuing four years. Rattner
Mackenzie provides intermediary services for reinsurance business placed by our
insurance company subsidiaries as well as other insurance and reinsurance
companies and underwriting agencies, primarily in the accident and health area.

     On December 20, 1999, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of the
publicly traded The Centris Group, Inc. following a tender offer at a price of
$12.50 per share in cash. We paid a total of $149.5 million for the Centris
acquisition. Centris was the parent corporation of a group of insurance
companies and underwriting agencies principally operating in the medical
stop-loss line of business. Centris' primary insurance company subsidiary was
the entity now known as HCC Life Insurance Company. HCC Life's operations were
relocated to Houston, and it has become a subsidiary of Houston Casualty. The
medical stop-loss underwriting agency operations of Centris have been combined
with HCC Benefits' operations.

     On January 19, 2001, we issued 996,805 shares of our common stock to
acquire the Schanen Consulting Corporation and its operating subsidiary, Schanen
Consulting Group, L.L.C. Schanen provides employee benefit consulting and retail
insurance intermediary services and has been consolidated with HCC Employee
Benefits' operations.

     We continue to evaluate possible acquisition candidates and we may complete
additional acquisitions during 2001. Any future acquisitions will be designed to
expand and strengthen our existing lines of business and perhaps provide access
to additional specialty sectors, which we expect to contribute to our overall
growth.

DISPOSITIONS

     In March, 2000, we sold Trafalgar Insurance Company, an Oklahoma domiciled
surplus lines insurance company subsidiary, for a price which approximated its
shareholders' equity in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States, or GAAP.

     In September, 2000, we sold a substantial portion of the assets of The
Wheatley Group, Ltd., a subsidiary of Avemco Corporation.

     Neither of these operations were material to our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

  Underwriting

  DIRECT

     We underwrite direct business produced through independent agents and
brokers, affiliated intermediaries, and by direct marketing efforts. Our direct
underwriting includes general aviation, medical stop-loss and workers'
compensation business.

  Reinsurance

     Our insurance companies participate in certain insurance and reinsurance
underwriting pools managed by our underwriting agency subsidiary, LDG Re, in the
accident and health line of business. Our insurance company subsidiaries also
write facultative, or individual account, reinsurance, particularly in the
aviation, marine and offshore energy and property lines of business. Our
facultative underwriting is typically on international business in order to
comply with local licensing requirements or as reinsurance of captive insurance
companies controlled by others, and can be considered direct business for most
purposes, since we maintain underwriting and claims control. However, we record
all of this business under the caption of "Reinsurance Assumed" in our financial
statements.

  Aviation

     Aviation underwriting was one of our largest lines of business in 2000 and
in recent years we have grown into a market leader in the aviation insurance
industry. We insure general aviation risks, both domestically and
internationally, including:

     - antique and vintage military aircraft;

     - cargo operations;

     - commuter airlines;

     - corporate aircraft;

     - fixed base operations;

     - military and law enforcement aircraft;

     - private aircraft owners and pilots; and

     - rotor wing aircraft.

     We offer coverages that include hulls, engines, avionics and other systems,
liabilities, war, cargo and other ancillary coverages. At this time, we do not
generally insure major airlines, major manufacturers or satellites. Insurance
claims related to general aviation business tend to be seasonal, with the
majority of the claims being incurred during the spring and summer months.

     We have been underwriting aviation risks through Houston Casualty, our
largest and most important insurance company subsidiary, since 1981. Avemco
Insurance has been insuring aviation risks since 1959. Our gross written premium
has remained relatively flat during the period 1998 to 2000. During this period
we have successfully re-underwritten our book of business, removing
under-performing types of business where the premium rates were insufficient,
and focusing on areas where increasing rates were able to generate profitable
business. Our aviation net written premium increased during the period because
we increased our retentions, i.e., the portion of risk that we retain for our
own account.

     We maintain reinsurance on both a proportional basis, where we share a
proportional part of the original premium and losses with reinsurers, and an
excess of loss basis, where we transfer liability, premium and loss on a
non-proportional basis above our net retention of risk to reinsurers, to protect
us against severe losses on individual risks and catastrophe exposures. We
believe that the aviation risks we underwrite carry a relatively low level of
catastrophe exposures.

  Marine and Offshore Energy

     We underwrite marine risks for ocean going vessels as well as inland,
coastal trading and fishing vessels. The marine risks we write include:

     - hull and machinery;

     - liabilities, including protection and indemnity;

     - marine cargo; and

     - various ancillary coverages.

     We have underwritten marine risks since 1984, primarily in Houston
Casualty. Competition has created downward pressure on premium rates since 1996,
causing a reduction in our gross written premium since 1997 and a corresponding
decrease in net written premium.

     We maintain marine reinsurance on both a proportional and an excess of loss
basis. We believe that the marine risks we underwrite carry a relatively low
level of catastrophe exposure.

                                        7
<PAGE>   9

     We have been underwriting offshore energy risks since 1988, primarily in
Houston Casualty. The offshore energy risks we write include drilling rigs,
production and gathering platforms, and pipelines. We underwrite physical
damage, liabilities, business interruption and various ancillary coverages.

     Rates have declined significantly during the past few years to levels where
underwriting profitability is difficult to obtain. As a result, we have
underwritten offshore energy risks on a very selective basis, striving for
quality rather than quantity.

     We maintain offshore energy reinsurance on both a proportional basis and an
excess of loss basis to protect us against severe losses on individual risks and
the catastrophe exposure that exists, for example, from a hurricane or a major
platform explosion.

  Property

     We specialize in writing risks of large, often multinational, corporations,
covering a variety of commercial risks including:

     - factories;

     - hotels;

     - industrial plants;

     - natural gas facilities;

     - office buildings;

     - petrochemical plants;

     - refineries;

     - retail locations; and

     - utilities.

     The insurance we offer includes business interruption, physical damage and
catastrophe risks including flood and earthquake.

     We have written property business since 1986, primarily through Houston
Casualty. Gross written premium declined from $106.5 million in 1998 to $53.3
million in 2000 as premium rates were soft due in a large part to excess
capacity and the absence of significant catastrophe losses. Net written premium
increased slightly from $8.4 million to $10.0 million in the same period. Our
property gross written premium exceeds our net written premium by a substantial
amount due to the amount of facultative reinsurance, which is the separately
negotiated reinsurance of all or part of the coverage provided by a single
policy, and other reinsurance purchased in order to protect us from catastrophe
losses.

     We maintain reinsurance on both a proportional basis and an excess of loss
basis to ensure adequate reinsurance protection, particularly against
catastrophe exposures. We estimate our aggregate probable maximum loss in any
individual catastrophe zone and maintain catastrophe reinsurance to cover such
exposure to any one occurrence.

  Accident and Health Reinsurance

     We began writing accident and health reinsurance risks through Houston
Casualty during 1996. LDG Re is the primary producer and underwriter of this
business. Our gross written premium increased from $114.8 million in 1998 to
$193.7 million in 2000. This growth reflects Houston Casualty's increased
participation in, and the growth of, the business written by LDG Re. Net written
premium in this area increased because Houston Casualty retained a larger
percentage of the increased gross premium.

<PAGE>   10

  Medical Stop-loss

     We write medical stop-loss business for employer sponsored self-insured
health plans. When measured on a gross written premium basis, medical stop-loss
was our largest single line of business in 2000. Our underwriting agency
subsidiary, HCC Benefits, produces and underwrites this business on behalf of
our insurance companies. We first began writing this business in our insurance
companies in 1997 and gross written premium and net written premium have
increased as a result of greater participation by our insurance company
subsidiaries, primarily HCC Life and Avemco Insurance. HCC Benefits' business
has grown both internally and through acquisitions, most notably of Centris. HCC
Benefits began underwriting this business in 1980. The 2000 gross written
premium underwritten in our insurance company subsidiaries was $368.5 million
and net written premium was $100.4 million. We maintain reinsurance on a
proportional basis and believe that these risks carry a relatively low level of
catastrophe exposure.

  Workers' Compensation and Alternative Workers' Compensation

     We began writing statutory workers' compensation business in 1998,
primarily through U.S. Specialty. We also underwrite alternative workers'
compensation and occupational accident insurance to independent truckers. As
market conditions warrant, it is our intent to grow this line of business in the
future, both internally and through acquisition. Losses in this line of business
generally take longer to develop than in our other lines of business.

     We maintain reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis.
There is a relatively low level of catastrophe exposure in our workers'
compensation line of business because we do not write significant amounts of
business in states with high potential claim concentrations such as California.

  Other Business

     Our other lines of business principally consist of discontinued operations
or disposed of lines of business including provider excess, lender's single
interest and small property and casualty business.

  Principal Insurance Company Subsidiaries

  HOUSTON CASUALTY COMPANY

     Houston Casualty is our principal insurance company subsidiary. It is rated
"A+ (Superior), IX" by A.M. Best and "AA" by Standard & Poor's. Houston Casualty

complicated exposures prevailing in many of the lines of business in which we
specialize. As of December 31, 2000, Houston Casualty's policyholders' surplus
was $231.2 million, which is its total admitted assets less total liabilities
determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles, or SAP. Houston
Casualty's GAAP shareholder's equity was $317.4 million as of December 31, 2000.

  HOUSTON CASUALTY COMPANY -- LONDON

     Houston Casualty operates a full branch office in the United Kingdom.

closely align its underwriting operations with the London market, a historical
focal point for much of the business that Houston Casualty underwrites. Houston
Casualty London underwrites accident and health reinsurance, marine and offshore
energy and property business.

  HCC LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY

     HCC Life is an Indiana domiciled life insurance company which became a
direct subsidiary of Houston Casualty in December, 1999 following the Centris

UNDERWRITING AGENCY OPERATIONS

     Our underwriting agencies act on behalf of our insurance companies and
those of other firms, and provide insurance underwriting management and claims
administration services. Our underwriting agencies do not assume any insurance
or reinsurance risk themselves and generate revenues based entirely on
management fees and profit commissions. These subsidiaries are in a position to
direct and control business that they produce. Our insurance companies serve as
policy issuing companies for most of the business written by our underwriting
agencies. Our insurance companies may retain a portion of the risk and reinsure
the remainder with unaffiliated insurance companies or reinsure all of the risk.
In instances where our insurance companies are not the policy issuing company,
our insurance companies may reinsure the business written by the underwriting
agencies. Management fees generated by our underwriting agencies in 2000
amounted to $96.1 million.

     LDG Re, with operations in Wakefield, Massachusetts and New York, New York,
acts as an underwriting manager writing accident and health special risks,
workers' compensation and alternative workers' compensation reinsurance. LDG Re

  OTHER AGENCY OPERATIONS

     We have recently consolidated certain of our underwriting agencies with
certain of our insurance companies for the purpose of streamlining our business.
We have consolidated the operations of our domestic general aviation
underwriting agency, HCC Aviation, and our occupational accident and workers'
compensation underwriting agency, HCC Employer Services, into U.S. Specialty and
the operations of our London-based accident and health underwriting agency, LDG

INTERMEDIARY OPERATIONS

     Our intermediary subsidiaries provide a variety of services, including
marketing, placing, consulting on and servicing insurance risks for their
clients, which include medium to large corporations, insurance and reinsurance
companies and other risk taking entities. The intermediary subsidiaries earn
commission income and to a lesser extent fees for certain services, generally
paid by the underwriters with whom the business is placed. Some of these risks
may be initially underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries, which may
retain a portion of the risk. Commission income generated by our intermediary
subsidiaries in 2000 amounted to $42.5 million.

  HCC Employee Benefits, Inc.

     HCC Employee Benefits, based in Houston, Texas, is a retail insurance
agency and consulting firm specializing in life, accident and health insurance
for employee benefit plans of medium and large commercial customers throughout
the United States. We acquired Schanen Consulting Corporation of Atlanta,
Georgia in January 2001 and consolidated its operations with those of HCC
Employee Benefits.

  HCC Intermediaries, Inc.

<PAGE>   13

serves as an intermediary for reinsurance business placed by unaffiliated
insurance and reinsurance companies and underwriting agencies as well as our
insurance company subsidiaries.

OTHER OPERATIONS

     Our other operations provide insurance related services to our
subsidiaries, our reinsurers and unaffiliated entities. The revenue earned from
these services primarily consists of fees or commissions. The primary operating
entities in this segment provide insurance claims adjusting services.
Additionally, this revenue may be in the form of equity in the earnings of a
company in which we invest, or dividends or gains or losses from the disposition
of these investments. Other operating income was $25.5 million in 2000. Revenue
and earnings can vary considerably from period to period depending on investment
or disposition activity.

REINSURANCE CEDED

     We purchase reinsurance to reduce our net liability on individual risks, to
protect against catastrophe losses and to achieve a desired ratio of net written
premium to policyholders' surplus. We purchase reinsurance on both a
proportional and an excess of loss basis. We believe that we reinsure our risks
to a greater extent than most of our competitors and most other insurance
companies. We use this strategy to protect our shareholders' equity. Under our
current reinsurance protections, we have limited our net retained loss, or the
amount we keep for our own account, across any single line of business to a
maximum of approximately $1.8 million for any one risk and $3.0 million for any
one event, but significantly less on most risks.

     The type, cost and limits of reinsurance we purchase can vary from year to
year based upon our desired retention levels and the availability of quality
reinsurance at an acceptable price. Our reinsurance programs renew throughout
the year and during 2001 some of those renewed contained price increases which
are not material to our underwriting results. Additionally, we retained higher
percentages of our business in connection with certain lines of business which
are reinsured on a proportional basis. We plan to continue to increase our
retentions as underwriting conditions improve.

     We consider the maintenance of reinsurance protection to be an important
part of our business plan, protecting shareholders' equity from catastrophe
losses and fluctuations in the insurance market cycles of the insurance
industry. We have built important relationships over the years with many core
reinsurers. We intend to continue to share our business with these partners as
underwriting profitability returns in an improving market in order to build even
stronger relationships for the future. We believe that increased retentions
during profitable periods are made possible not at the sacrifice of core
reinsurers but through reduction of facultative reinsurance and the natural
attrition of certain reinsurers who exit lines of business or curtail their
writings for other reasons. This reduction in reinsurance market capacity causes
rates to rise but the increased rates historically have been passed on to the
original insureds.

     We structure a specific reinsurance program for each line of business we
underwrite. We place this reinsurance in order to protect our insurance
companies from exposure to foreseeable events. We place reinsurance
proportionally to cover loss frequency and catastrophe exposure. We obtain
additional reinsurance on an excess of loss basis to cover individual risk
severity of loss and on a catastrophe basis to cover exposure from occurrences
involving multiple risks, such as those resulting from a hurricane or an
earthquake. Additionally, we may also obtain facultative reinsurance protection
on an excess of loss or proportionate basis on any single risk. We do not intend
to expose our assets to any net loss in excess of our reinsurance protection.

     We write business in areas exposed to catastrophe losses and have exposures
to this type of loss in California, the United States Atlantic Coast, certain
United States Gulf Coast states, particularly Florida and Texas, the Caribbean,
Mexico and the North Sea. We carefully assess our overall exposure to a single
catastrophic event and apply procedures that are more conservative than are
typically used by the industry to ascertain our probable maximum loss from any
single event. We maintain reinsurance protection which we believe is sufficient
to cover any foreseeable event.
                                        12
<PAGE>   14

     In general, we receive an overriding (ceding) commission on the premium
ceded to reinsurers. This compensates our insurance company for the direct costs
associated with the production of the business, the servicing of the business
during the term of the policies ceded and the costs associated with the
placement of the related reinsurance. In addition, certain of our reinsurance
treaties allow us to share with the reinsurers in any net profits generated
under such treaties.

     Various intermediaries, including HCC Intermediaries and Rattner Mackenzie,
arrange for the placement of this reinsurance coverage on our behalf and are
compensated, directly or indirectly, by the reinsurers.

     The table below shows property and casualty reinsurance balances relating
to the reinsurers with net recoverable balances greater than $10.0 million as of
December 31, 2000. The total recoverables column includes paid loss recoverable,
outstanding loss recoverable, incurred but not reported recoverables and ceded
unearned premium (dollars in thousands).

     Lloyds of London is an insurance and reinsurance marketplace composed of
many independent underwriting syndicates financially supported by a central
trust fund. As of December 31, 2000, the net recoverable due from Underwriters
at Lloyd's, aggregating $192.2 million, represented balances due from over 140
different syndicates; five of which each had a net recoverable balance in excess
of $10.0 million. The largest net recoverable balance from an individual Lloyd's
syndicate as of December 31, 2000 was $26.5 million.

     HCC Life previously sold its entire block of life insurance and annuity
business to Life Reassurance Corporation of America (rated A++ by A.M. Best) in
the form of an indemnity reinsurance contract. Ceded life and annuity benefits
amounted to $86.8 million as of December 31, 2000.

     During 2000, a number of reinsurers have delayed or suspended the payment
of amounts recoverable under certain reinsurance contracts to which we are a
party. Such delays have affected, though not materially to date, the investment
income of our insurance companies, but not to any extent their liquidity. We
limit our liquidity exposure by holding funds, letters of credit or other
security such that net balances due are significantly less than the gross
balances shown in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, a number of
reinsurers have claimed they are not liable for payment to us and, in one or
more cases, have sought arbitration of these matters. We believe these claims
are without merit and expect to collect the full amount recoverable. We are
currently in negotiations with most of these parties. If such negotiations do
not result in a satisfactory resolution of the matters in question, we will seek
a judicial or arbitral determination of these matters.

     During 1999, we recorded a provision for reinsurance totaling $29.5 million
in connection with the insolvency of a reinsurer. We expect this provision to be
sufficient. We also recorded a $14.0 million provision following a commutation
(the contractual settlement of outstanding and future liabilities) with

                                        13
<PAGE>   15

another reinsurer, the majority of which represents the present value discount
of ceded losses. Commutations are typical in the reinsurance community and
should not be construed negatively. Commutations can be used to bring finality
to an open contract or, as in this case, to negate any exposure to a reinsurer's
financial condition. A discount is given for cash settlement of future losses
and such discount is usually recovered by future investment income. However,
GAAP requires that the discount be recorded at the time of the commutation.

     While there is no statutory requirement regarding a permissible premium to
policyholders' surplus ratio, guidelines established by the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, provide that a property and casualty
insurer's annual statutory gross written premium should not exceed 900% and net
written premium should not exceed 300% of its policyholders' surplus. However,
industry standards and rating agency criteria place these ratios at 300% and
200%, respectively. In the past, our property and casualty insurance companies
have maintained premium to surplus ratios significantly lower than such
guidelines and generally below industry norms. The gross written premium ratio
has increased during 2000 with the acquisition of Centris' book of medical
stop-loss business and the increasing use of our insurance company subsidiaries
as the issuing company for business written by our underwriting agencies. This
ratio is expected to stabilize at or decrease from its 2000 level as statutory
policyholders' surplus increases due to the retention of earnings and other
increases in policyholders' surplus.

  Statutory Combined Ratio

     The underwriting experience of a property and casualty insurance company is
indicated by its SAP combined ratio, which is a combination of the loss ratio,
or the ratio of insured losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned
premium, and the expense ratio, which is the ratio of policy acquisition costs
and other underwriting expenses, net of ceding commissions, to net written
premium. Our insurance subsidiaries' loss ratio, expense ratio and combined
ratio are shown in the following table for the years indicated:

     The SAP basis ratio data is not intended to be a substitute for results of
operations on the basis of GAAP. The differences between SAP and GAAP are
described in Note (15) of our consolidated financial statements included in this
report. Including this information on a SAP basis is meaningful and useful to
allow a comparison of our operating results with those of other companies in the
insurance industry. The source of the industry average is A.M. Best. A.M. Best

comparisons among individual companies, as well as overall industry performance.

RESERVES

     Applicable insurance laws require us to maintain reserves to cover our
estimated ultimate liability for reported and incurred but not reported, or
IBNR, losses under insurance and reinsurance policies that we wrote and for loss
adjustment expenses relating to the investigation and settlement of policy
claims. In most cases, we estimate such losses and claims costs through an
evaluation of individual claims. However, for some types of claims, we use an
average reserving method until more information becomes available to permit an
evaluation of individual claims.

     We establish loss reserves for individual claims by evaluating reported
claims on the basis of:

     - jurisdiction of the occurrence;

     - our experience with the insured and the line of business and policy
       provisions relating to the particular type of claim;

     - our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim;

     - the information and reports received from ceding insurance companies
       where applicable;

     - the potential for ultimate exposure;

     - the severity of injury or damage; and

     - the type of loss.

     We establish loss reserves for incurred but not reported losses based in
part on statistical information and in part on industry experience with respect
to the probable number and nature of claims arising from occurrences that have
not been reported. We also establish our reserves based on predictions of future

                                        15
<PAGE>   17

events, our estimates of future trends in claims severity, and other subjective
factors. Currently all reserves are recorded on an undiscounted basis. The net
GAAP and SAP reserves of each of our insurance companies are established in
conjunction with and reviewed by our in-house actuarial staff, and our SAP
reserves are certified annually by our independent actuaries. In 2000,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP certified the SAP reserves of our insurance companies
with the exception of one acquired with the Centris Group. This former Centris
subsidiary's SAP reserves were certified by another independent actuary.

     With respect to some classes of risks, the period of time between the
occurrence of an insured event and the final settlement of a claim may be many
years, and during this period it often becomes necessary to adjust the claim
estimates either upward or downward. Certain classes of marine and offshore
energy and workers' compensation insurance underwritten by our insurance
companies have historically had longer lead times between the occurrence of an
insured event, reporting of the claim, and final settlement. In such cases, we
are forced to estimate reserves over long periods of time with the possibility
of several adjustments to reserves. Other classes of insurance that we
underwrite, such as most aviation, property and medical stop-loss, historically
have shorter lead times between the occurrence of an insured event, reporting of
the claim and final settlement. The reserves with respect to these classes are,
therefore, less likely to be adjusted. The majority of the risks currently
underwritten by our insurance companies tend to have shorter lead times.

     The reserving process is intended to reflect the impact of inflation and
other factors affecting loss payments by taking into account changes in
historical payment patterns and perceived trends. However, there is no precise
method for the subsequent evaluation of the adequacy of the consideration given
to inflation, or to any other specific factor, or to the way one factor may
impact another.

     We underwrite, directly and through reinsurance, risks which are
denominated in a number of foreign currencies, and therefore maintain loss
reserves with respect to these policies in the respective currencies. These
reserves are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, which may have an effect on
our earnings. We may attempt to limit our exposure to future currency
fluctuations through the use of foreign currency forward contracts.

     The loss development triangles below show changes in our GAAP reserves in
subsequent years from the prior loss estimates based on experience as of the end
of each succeeding year on the basis of generally accepted accounting
principles. The estimate is increased or decreased as more information becomes
known about the frequency and severity of losses for individual years. A
redundancy means the original estimate was higher than the current estimate; a
deficiency means that the current estimate is higher than the original estimate.

     The first line of each loss development triangle presents, for the years
indicated, the gross or net reserve liability including the reserve for incurred
but not reported losses. The first section of each table shows, by year, the
cumulative amounts of loss and loss adjustment expense paid as of the end of
each succeeding year. The second section sets forth the re-estimates in later
years of incurred losses, including payments, for the years indicated. The
"cumulative redundancy (deficiency)" represents, as of the date indicated, the
difference between the latest re-estimated liability and the reserves as
originally estimated.

</TABLE>

     The gross deficiencies reflected in the table for the years prior to 1999
result from three principal conditions:

     - The development of large claims on individual policies which were either
       reported late or for which reserves were increased as subsequent
       information became available. However, as these policies were
       substantially reinsured, there was no material effect to our net
       earnings.

     - During 1999, in connection with the insolvency of one of our reinsurers
       and the commutation of all liabilities with another, we re-evaluated all
       loss reserves and incurred but not reported loss reserves related to
       business placed with these reinsurers to determine the ultimate losses we
       might conservatively expect. These reserves were then used as the basis
       for the determination of the provision for reinsurance recorded in 1999.

     - For the years prior to 1997, the runoff of the retrocessional excess of
       loss business, which we underwrote between 1988 and 1991, experienced
       gross development. This development was due primarily to the delay in
       reporting of losses by the London insurance market, coupled with the
       unprecedented number of catastrophe losses during that period. This
       business was substantially reinsured and there was no material effect to
       our net earnings.

(2) Changes in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves on a GAAP basis, for
    losses occurring in prior years, reflect the net effect of the resolution of
    losses for other than the reserve value and the subsequent adjustments of
    loss reserves.

     Although we experienced a gross loss deficiency during 1999 and 1998, the
business was substantially reinsured and, therefore, there was no material
effect to our insurance companies on a net loss basis.

     During 2000, we had net loss and loss adjustment expense redundancy of $9.6
million relating to prior year losses compared to a deficiency of $4.6 million
in 1999 and a redundancy of $14.6 million in 1998.

                                        19
<PAGE>   21

The deficiencies and redundancies in the net reserves result from our continued
review with our actuaries of loss reserves and the increase or reduction of
reserves as losses are finally settled and claims exposures are reduced. We
believe we have provided for all material net incurred losses.

     We have no material exposure to environmental pollution losses, because
Houston Casualty only began writing business in 1981 and its policies normally
contain pollution exclusion clauses which limit pollution coverage to "sudden
and accidental" losses only, thus excluding intentional (dumping) and seepage
claims. Policies issued by HCC Life, Avemco Insurance and U.S. Specialty,
because of the types of risks insured, are not considered to have significant
environmental exposures. We do not expect to experience any material development
in reserves for environmental pollution claims.

INVESTMENTS

     Insurance company investments must comply with applicable regulations which
prescribe the type, quality and concentration of investments. These regulations
permit investments, within specified limits and subject to certain
qualifications, in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds,
and preferred and common equity securities. As of December 31, 2000, we had
$710.3 million of investment assets. The majority of our investment assets are
held by our insurance companies. All of our securities are classified as
available for sale and are recorded at market value.

     Our investment policy is determined by our Board of Directors and our
Investment Committee and is reviewed on a regular basis. In January, 2000, we
engaged a nationally prominent investment advisor, New England Asset Management,
a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., to oversee our investments and to make
recommendations to our Board's Investment Committee. Although we generally
intend to hold fixed income securities to maturity, we regularly re-evaluate our
position based upon market conditions. Beginning in the second quarter of 2000,
our purchases have been focused on taxable fixed income investments. These
purchases have had no significant effect on the average credit rating of our
investments, but have shortened the duration of our investment portfolio. Prior
to that time our investments were concentrated in obligations of states,
municipalities and political subdivisions. As of December 31, 2000, our fixed
income securities have a weighted average maturity of five years and a weighted
average duration of four years. Our financial statements reflect an unrealized
gain on fixed income securities available for sale as of December 31, 2000, of
$11.0 million.

     We have maintained a substantial level of cash and liquid short-term
instruments in our insurance company subsidiaries in order to maintain the
ability to fund losses of our insureds. Our underwriting agencies and
intermediaries typically have short-term investments, which are fiduciary funds
held on behalf of others. As of December 31, 2000, we had cash and short-term
investments of approximately $263.3 million, of which $181.5 million were in our
agency and intermediary subsidiaries.

     This table shows a profile of our investments. The table shows the average

</TABLE>

     The weighted average life of our mortgage-backed securities is four years.
The value of our portfolio of fixed income securities is inversely correlated to
changes in market interest rates. In addition, some of our fixed income
securities have call or prepayment options. This could subject us to a
reinvestment risk should interest rates fall or issuers call their securities
and we are forced to invest the proceeds at lower interest rates. We mitigate
this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates, so that only a
portion of the portfolio will mature at any point in time.

BANK LOAN

     On December 17, 1999, we entered into a $300.0 million Revolving Loan
Facility with a group of banks. We can borrow up to $300.0 million under the
facility on a revolving basis until it expires on December 18, 2004. Outstanding
advances bear interest at agreed upon rates. The facility is collateralized in
part by the pledge of the stock of Houston Casualty and Avemco Insurance and by
the stock of and guarantees entered into by our principal underwriting agency
and intermediary subsidiaries. The facility

                                        21
<PAGE>   23

agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including minimum net worth
requirements for us and certain of our subsidiaries, restrictions on certain
extraordinary corporate actions, notice requirements for certain material
occurrences, and required maintenance of specified financial ratios. We believe
that the restrictive covenants and our obligations that are contained in the
facility agreement are typical for financing arrangements comparable to our
facility. As of December 31, 2000, total debt outstanding under the facility was
$207.5 million and the weighted average interest rate was 8.18%. During March
2001, we reduced debt outstanding under the facility to $55.0 million using the
proceeds from our recent public stock offering.

REGULATION

     The business of insurance is extensively regulated by the government. At
this time, the insurance business in the United States is regulated primarily by
the individual states. However, a form of federal financial services
modernization legislation enacted in 1999 is expected to result in additional
federal regulation of the insurance industry. In addition, some insurance
industry trade groups are actively lobbying for legislation that would allow an
option for a separate federal charter for insurance companies. The full extent
to which the federal government will determine to directly regulate the business
of insurance has not been determined by lawmakers. Also, various foreign
governments regulate our international operations.

     Our business depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations
and our ability to maintain valid licenses and approvals for our operations. We
devote a significant effort toward obtaining and maintaining our licenses and
compliance with a diverse and complex regulatory structure. In all
jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or
interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, regulatory authorities are
vested with broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals
and to implement regulations governing the business and operations of insurers
and insurance agents.

  Insurance Companies

     Our insurance companies, in common with other insurers, are subject to
regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which
they do business. Regulation by the states varies, but generally involves
regulatory and supervisory powers of a state insurance official. The regulation
and supervision of our insurance operations relates primarily to:

     - approval of policy forms and premium rates;

     - licensing of insurers and their agents;

     - periodic examinations of our operations and finances;

     - prescribing the form and content of records of financial condition
       required to be filed;

     - requiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders;

     - requiring certain methods of accounting;

     - requiring reserves for unearned premium, losses and other purposes;

     - restrictions on the ability of our insurance companies to pay dividends
       to us;

     - restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;

     - restrictions on transactions between insurance companies and their
       affiliates;

     - restrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy; and

     - standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements.

                                        22
<PAGE>   24

     In general, state insurance regulations are intended primarily for the
protection of policyholders rather than shareholders. The state insurance
departments monitor compliance with regulations through periodic reporting
procedures and examinations. The quarterly and annual financial reports to the
state insurance regulators utilize accounting principles which are different
from the generally accepted accounting principles we use in our reports to
shareholders. Statutory accounting principles, in keeping with the intent to
assure the protection of policyholders, are generally based on a liquidation
concept while generally accepted accounting principles are based on a
going-concern concept.

     Houston Casualty is domiciled in Texas. It operates on an admitted basis in
Texas and may write reinsurance on all lines of business that it may write on a
direct basis. Houston Casualty is an accredited reinsurer in 35 states and an
approved surplus lines insurer or is otherwise permitted to write surplus lines
insurance in 46 states, three United States territories and the District of
Columbia. When a reinsurer obtains accreditation from a particular state,
insurers within that state are permitted to obtain statutory credit for risks
ceded to the reinsurer. Surplus lines insurance is offered by non-admitted
companies on risks which are not insured by admitted companies. All surplus
lines insurance is required to be written through licensed surplus lines
insurance brokers, who are required to be knowledgeable of and follow specific
state laws prior to placing a risk with a surplus lines insurer.

     Houston Casualty operates a branch office in London, England which is
subject to regulation by regulatory authorities in the United Kingdom. Avemco
Insurance is domiciled in Maryland and operates as a licensed admitted insurer
in all states, the District of Columbia, and all Canadian provinces except
Quebec. U.S. Specialty is domiciled in Texas and operates as a licensed admitted
insurer in all states and the District of Columbia. HCC Life is domiciled in
Indiana, and operates as a licensed admitted insurer in 41 states and the
District of Columbia.

     State insurance regulations also affect the payment of dividends and other
distributions by insurance companies to their shareholders. Generally, insurance
companies are limited by these regulations to the payment of dividends above a
specified level. Dividends in excess of those thresholds are "extraordinary
dividends" and subject to prior regulatory approval.

  Underwriting Agencies and Intermediaries

     In addition to the regulation of insurance companies, the states impose
licensing and other requirements on the insurance agency and service operations
of our other subsidiaries. These regulations relate primarily to:

     - advertising and business practice rules;

     - contractual requirements;

     - financial security

     - licensing as agents, brokers, intermediaries, managing general agents or
       third party administrators;

     - limitations on authority; and

     - recordkeeping requirements..

     The manner of operating our underwriting agency and intermediary activities
in particular states may vary according to the licensing requirements of the
particular state, which may require, among other things, that we operate in the
state through a local corporation. In a few states, licenses are issued only to
individual residents or locally-owned business entities. In such cases, we may
have arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in the
state.

  Statutory Accounting Principles

     The principal differences between statutory accounting principles, or SAP,
and generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the method by which we
report our financial results to our shareholders in accordance with SEC
requirements, are:

     - a liability is recorded for certain reinsurance recoverables under SAP,
       whereas under GAAP there is no such provision unless the recoverables are
       deemed to be not collectible.

     - certain assets which are considered "non-admitted assets" are eliminated
       from a balance sheet prepared in accordance with SAP but are included in
       a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP;

     - certain reserves are recognized under SAP but not under GAAP;

     - deferred taxes are not provided under SAP;

     - fixed-income investments classified as available for sale are recorded at
       market value for GAAP and at amortized cost under SAP;

     - reinsurance balances are recorded on a gross basis under GAAP and on a
       net basis under SAP; and

     - under SAP, policy acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and under
       GAAP such costs are deferred and amortized to expense as the related
       premium is earned.

     The NAIC adopted Statements of Statutory Accounting Principles in March,
1998 as a product of its attempt to codify statutory accounting principles.
Although subject to adoption by the individual states, an effective date of
January 1, 2001 was established for implementation of the statements. Prior to
the codification project, a comprehensive guide to statutory accounting
principles did not exist. Codification is new and will evolve over time. The
cumulative effect of codification is expected to increase statutory
policyholders' surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries by approximately
$6.0 million. We expect that the statutory surplus of our insurance companies
after adoption will continue to be in excess of their regulatory risk-based
capital requirements.

  Insurance Holding Company Acts

     Because we are an insurance holding company, we are subject to the
insurance holding company system regulatory requirements of the states of
Arkansas, California, Indiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Texas. Under these
regulations, we are required to report information regarding our capital
structure, financial condition and management. We are also required to provide
prior notice to, or seek the prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities
of certain agreements and transactions between our affiliated companies. These
agreements and transactions must satisfy certain regulatory requirements.

  Risk-Based Capital

     The NAIC has developed a formula for analyzing insurance companies called
risk-based capital. The risk-based capital formula is intended to establish
"minimum" capital thresholds that vary with the size and mix of a company's
business and assets. It is designed to identify companies with the capital
levels that may require regulatory attention. As of December 31, 2000, each of
our domestic insurance company subsidiaries' total adjusted capital is
significantly in excess of the NAIC authorized control level risk-based capital.

  Insurance Regulatory Information System

     The NAIC has also developed a rating system, the Insurance Regulatory
Information System, primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in
overseeing the financial condition of all insurance companies operating within
their respective states. The Insurance Regulatory Information System consists of
eleven key financial ratios that address various aspects of each insurer's
financial

                                        24
<PAGE>   26

condition and stability. Our insurance company subsidiaries Insurance Regulatory
Information System ratios generally fall within the usual prescribed ranges
except in satisfactorily explainable circumstances such as when there is a large
reinsurance transaction, capital change, merger or planned growth.

  Pending or Proposed Legislation

     In recent years, state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that
modify and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate insurance
companies and insurance holding company systems. State insurance regulators are
members of the NAIC, which seeks to promote uniformity of, and to enhance the
state regulation of, insurance. In addition, the NAIC and state insurance
regulators, as part of the NAIC's state insurance department accreditation
program and in response to new federal laws, have re-examined existing state
laws and regulations, specifically focusing on insurance company investments,
issues relating to the solvency of insurance companies, licensing and market
conduct issues, streamlining agent licensing and policy form approvals, adoption
of privacy rules for handling policyholder information, interpretations of
existing laws, the development of new laws, and the definition of extraordinary
dividends.

     In recent years, a variety of measures have been proposed at the federal
level to reform the current process of federal and state regulation of the
financial services industries in the United States, which include the banking,
insurance and securities industries. These measures, which are often referred to
as financial services modernization, have as a principal objective the
elimination or modification of current regulatory barriers to cross-industry
combinations involving banks, securities firms and insurance companies. A form
of financial services modernization legislation was enacted at the federal level
in 1999 through the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. That federal legislation will have
significant implications on the banking, insurance and securities industries and
could result in more cross-industry consolidations among banks, insurance
companies and securities firms and increased competition in many of the areas of
our operations. It also mandated the adoption of laws allowing reciprocity among
the states in the licensing of agents and the adoption of laws and regulations
dealing with the protection of the privacy of policyholder information. Also,
the federal government has conducted investigations of the current condition of
the insurance industry in the United States to determine whether to impose
overall federal regulation of insurers. In the past several years there have
been a number of recommendations that the industry's anti-trust exemption be
removed and the industry placed under federal regulation. If so, we believe
state regulation of the insurance business would likely continue. This could
result in an additional layer of federal regulation.

     We do not know at this time the full extent to which these federal or state
legislative or regulatory initiatives will or may affect our operations, and no
assurance can be given that they would not, if adopted, have a material adverse
effect on our business or its results of operations.

EMPLOYEES

     As of December 31, 2000, we had 958 employees. The employees include five
executive officers, 19 senior management, 78 management and 856 other personnel.
Of this number, 168 are employed by our insurance company subsidiaries, 521 are
employed by our underwriting agency subsidiaries, 116 are employed by our
intermediary subsidiaries, 69 are employed by our insurance services
subsidiaries and 84 are employed at the corporate headquarters and elsewhere.
With the restructuring of certain agency operations, 214 employees will move
from the agency segment to the insurance company segment in 2001. We are not a
party to any collective bargaining agreement and have not experienced work
stoppages or strikes as a result of labor disputes. We consider our employee
relations to be good.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

     Our principal and executive offices are located in Houston, Texas, in an
approximately 51,000 square foot building owned by Houston Casualty. Houston
Casualty also owns a 77,000 square foot building adjacent to its home office
building. We also maintain offices in over 30 locations elsewhere in the United
States and England. The majority of these additional locations are in leased
facilities.

     Besides our home office, our principal office facilities are as follows:

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     We are party to numerous lawsuits and other proceedings that arise in the
normal course of our business. Many of such lawsuits and other proceedings
involve claims under policies that we underwrite as an insurer or reinsurer, the
liabilities for which, we believe have been adequately included in our loss
reserves. Also, from time to time, we are a party to lawsuits and other
proceedings which relate to disputes over contractual relationships with third
parties, or which involve alleged errors and omissions on the part of our
subsidiaries. We believe the resolution of any such lawsuits will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the
fourth quarter of 2000.

     On March 16, 2001, the last reported sales price of our common stock as

SHAREHOLDERS

     We have one class of authorized capital stock: 250,000,000 shares of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share. As of March 16, 2001, there were 58,697,666
shares of issued and outstanding common stock held by 1,028 shareholders of
record; however, we believe there are in excess of 15,000 beneficial owners.

DIVIDEND POLICY

     Beginning in June, 1996, we announced a planned quarterly program of paying
cash dividends to shareholders. We paid a cash dividend of $0.02 per share in
July, 1996 and in each succeeding quarter through the first quarter of 1997. We
have increased the quarterly cash dividend in each year and beginning in
October, 2000, our quarterly dividend was $0.06 per share. Our Board of
Directors may review our dividend policy from time to time, and any
determination with respect to future dividends will be made in light of
regulatory and other conditions at that time, including our earnings, financial
condition, capital requirements, loan covenants, and other related factors.
Under the terms of our bank loan, we are prohibited from paying dividends in
excess of an agreed upon maximum amount in any fiscal year. That limitation
should not affect our ability to pay dividends in a manner consistent with our
past practice and current expectations.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

     We primarily receive our revenue from earned premium from derived from our
insurance company operations, management fees generated by our underwriting
agency operations, commission income produced by our intermediary operations,
investment income from all of our operations and capital and other operating
income. Our core underwriting activities involve providing accident and health
reinsurance and aviation, marine and offshore energy, medical stop-loss,
property and workers' compensation insurance, each of which is marketed either
directly to customers or through a network of independent or affiliated agents
and brokers.

     During the past several years, we have substantially increased our
shareholders' equity through the issuance of equity securities and through our
retained earnings, thereby enabling us to increase the underwriting capacity of
our insurance companies. With this additional equity, we increased underwriting
activity across many of our core lines of business, emphasizing lines of
business and individual opportunities with the most favorable underwriting
characteristics at a particular point in the insurance cycle. As an insurer, we
also purchase reinsurance for each of our lines of business. We purchase
different types of reinsurance in amounts we consider appropriate for each of
our lines of business based upon market conditions and the level of risk we wish
to retain.

     During 1999 and 2000, our underwriting agencies underwrote aviation,
medical stop-loss, occupational accident and workers' compensation insurance and
a variety of accident and health related insurance and reinsurance products on
behalf of our insurance companies and unaffiliated insurance companies. Our
underwriting agency activities are fee based and non-risk bearing.

     Effective January 1, 2001, in conjunction with the expansion of
underwriting activities by our insurance companies and in an effort to
streamline certain of our operations, we consolidated the operations of certain
of our agency operations, with those of certain of our insurance companies. We
have consolidated the operations of our domestic general aviation underwriting
agency, HCC Aviation, and our occupational accident and workers' compensation
underwriting agency, HCC Employer Services, with those of U.S. Specialty, and
the operations of our London-based accident and health reinsurance underwriting
agency subsidiary, LDG Re (London), with those of the London branch of Houston
Casualty. These consolidations will result in a reduction in management fee
income and the net earnings from our underwriting agency segment, but such
reduction will be more than offset over time by increases in net earnings of our
insurance company segment. The cost of this restructuring was $1.0 million
(after-tax) and was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000. A total of 26
employees were or will be terminated as a result of this consolidation. As
market conditions warrant, we anticipate reviewing our other agency operations
to determine if similar consolidation activities will provide greater operating
efficiencies.

     Our intermediaries are fee based, non-risk bearing and place reinsurance
for our insurance companies and underwriting agencies and for other
non-affiliated insurance companies and risk taking entities, as well as
insurance on behalf of medium and large corporate clients.

     Other operating income is generated through our insurance services
operations, which support our own operations as well as provide services for
other clients. Additionally, other operating income may include the equity in
the earnings of a company in which we invest, dividends or gains or losses from
the disposition of these investments.

     From 1998 through 2000, in response to adverse market conditions, we
focused our acquisition activities on expanding our underwriting agency and
intermediary operations for three principal reasons:

     - to increase the management fees and commission income components of our
       total revenue, which we believed were a more predictable and stable
       source of revenue than the potential underwriting gain from insurance
       company operations during periods of overly competitive pricing;

                                        30
<PAGE>   32

     - to insulate our Company from a decline in our revenue growth rate as
       insurance premium rates became more competitive in our specialty lines of
       business and we became more selective in our underwriting, resulting in
       reduced earned premium;

     - to provide a future source of premium revenue to our insurance companies
       and greater control of premium distribution channels.

     In 1999, due to a reduction in reinsurance capacity, rates began to
increase, particularly in the accident and health reinsurance, general aviation
and medical stop-loss lines of business. Market conditions continued to improve
in 2000 and we anticipate further improvement in 2001. In response to these
changing market conditions, we plan to continue to expand these underwriting
activities in our insurance companies and in our other lines of business as they
also improve.

     During December, 1999, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of The
Centris Group, Inc. in a transaction accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. Therefore, the results of operations and cash flows of Centris are
included in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2000, but are not included in the condensed
consolidated statement of earnings and cash flows for the twelve months ended
December 31, 1999 and earlier periods.

     Centris was the parent corporation of a group of insurance companies and
underwriting agencies principally operating in the medical stop-loss line of
business. Centris' primary insurance company subsidiary was the entity now known
as HCC Life Insurance Company. Following the acquisition, HCC Life's operations
were relocated to Houston, and it became a subsidiary of Houston Casualty.
Centris' medical stop-loss underwriting agency operations have been combined
with HCC Benefits' operations. Since the date of the acquisition, the premium
rates for medical stop-loss have increased substantially and the loss ratio has
greatly improved for the 2000 business underwritten by the combined operations.
In connection with the integration of Centris' operations with our own, we took
a restructuring charge, which was accrued at the date of acquisition.

     From 1992 through 1999, our employee count had grown from less than 100 to
more than 1,000. In the fourth quarter of 1999, we determined, based upon a
review of our operations, that our operating efficiency and profitability could
be enhanced principally by reducing the employee count in certain operations. We
therefore implemented a restructuring plan which resulted in the termination of
92 of our employees during 1999. This restructuring resulted in a decreased
level of operating expenses in 2000 for the operating entities affected.

 *  Includes provision for reinsurance in 1999.

  Year Ended December 31, 2000 Versus Year Ended December 31, 1999

     Our total revenue increased 36% to $466.2 million in 2000 compared to 1999.
This revenue increase resulted from the higher retention of premium underwritten
by our insurance companies, particularly in the medical stop-loss line of
business, and increased investment income. We expect the upward trend in revenue
to continue.

     Our net investment income increased 29% to $39.8 million in 2000 compared
to 1999. This increase was primarily due to a higher level of invested assets
which resulted from the greater retentions of premium underwritten by our
insurance companies, the investment of cash received during the first quarter of
2000 from our commutation with a reinsurer and cash flow from operations. We
expect cash flow to continue to improve, thereby increasing net investment
income, which could be substantially offset by falling interest rates.

     In 2000, we engaged General Re New England Asset Management, a subsidiary
of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. and a nationally prominent investment advisor,
particularly to insurance companies, and undertook an in-depth review and
restructuring of our investment portfolio. As a part of this restructuring, we
have shortened our investment portfolio's duration but have not significantly
changed the average credit rating. Our net realized investment losses from sales
or write downs of equity securities was $5.6 million in 2000, compared to losses
of $3.9 million in 1999. In 2000, we recognized a $5.1 million realized loss
from the write down of an equity investment to its estimated fair market value
based upon market quotations compared to a similar write down of $4.3 million in
1999. Our net realized investment gains from the disposition of fixed income
securities were $203,000 in 2000, compared to losses of $164,000 in 1999.

     Our compensation expense increased to $78.4 million during 2000 from $77.5
million in 1999. This increase reflects a normal progressional increase due to
business growth plus the increase due to the Centris acquisition, offset by the
savings resulting from the 1999 fourth quarter restructuring and the sale of
non-core subsidiaries. Other than the restructuring expenses discussed below,
other operating expenses increased to $51.8 million from $47.2 million for
similar reasons. Included in other operating expense are restructuring expenses
of $761,000 in 2000 and $5.5 million in 1999. Currency conversion losses
amounted to $330,000 in 2000, compared to gains of $442,000 in 1999.

     Our interest expense was $20.3 million in 2000 compared to $13.0 million in
1999. This increase is a result of higher interest rates and increased debt
outstanding, principally as a result of funding the Centris

                                        32

acquisition. Interest expense will be down substantially in 2001 as a result of
our reduced level of debt following our equity offering in March, 2001.

     Our income tax expense was $35.9 million in 2000 compared to $12.3 million
in 1999. Our effective tax rate was 40% in the 2000 period compared to 33% in
1999. Most of the increase in the effective tax rate was due to non-deductible
goodwill amortization relating to the Centris acquisition, a shift of fixed
income investments to taxable instruments from tax exempt instruments and
increased underwriting agency income which is subject to state income taxes.

     Our net earnings in 2000 increased 113% to $53.4 million or $1.06 per
diluted share from $25.1 million or $0.51 per diluted share in 1999. These
increases result principally from improved underwriting results, an increase in
investment income and the effects of the provision for reinsurance and a larger
restructuring expense recorded during 1999. In 2000, we incurred a $2.0 million
after-tax charge for a change in accounting principles to conform our agency and
intermediary revenue recognition principles to those required by the guidance in
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 101 entitled "Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements." The change was not material to earnings before cumulative
effect of accounting change for 2000.

     Our book value per share was $10.46 as of December 31, 2000, up from $9.29
as of December 31, 1999. During March 2001, we sold 6.9 million shares of our
common stock at a price of $23.25 per share. If this transaction had occurred on
December 31, 2000, our pro forma book value per share would have increased to
$11.86.

SEGMENTS

  Insurance Companies

     Gross written premium generated by our insurance companies increased 70% to
$967.5 million in 2000 compared to 1999 due to new business, rate increases,
increased participation by our insurance companies in the business underwritten
by our underwriting agencies and the acquisition of Centris. Net written premium
generated by our insurance companies in 2000 increased 103% to $283.8 million
compared to 1999, as our insurance companies have increased retentions in many
of their lines of business as underwriting results showed improvement. Net
earned premium increased 89% to $267.6 million during 2000 for the same reasons.
We expect net premium increases to continue in 2001.

     Loss and loss adjustment expense incurred by our insurance companies
increased to $198.5 million in 2000 from $109.7 million in 1999. The increase in
net loss and loss adjustment expense is due to the higher level of net retained
premium, net of the effect of improved underwriting results. The GAAP net loss
ratio decreased to 74.2% in 2000 from 77.6% in 1999. In 2000, we also recorded a
$4.4 million increase in reserves for discontinued lines of business acquired
with our 1999 acquisition of Centris. This increase represents 1.6% of the 2000
net loss ratio. The GAAP gross loss ratio decreased to 79.4% in 2000 from 116.5%
in 1999. The general improvement in our loss ratios result from the effects of
increased premium rates in certain lines of business, reduced writings in other
unprofitable lines of business and a general improvement in market conditions,
particularly in the domestic aviation and medical stop-loss lines of business.
The statutory net combined ratio of our insurance companies was 98.1% for 2000
compared to 129.9% (104.1% excluding effects of the provision for reinsurance)
in 1999.

     During 2000, we had net loss and LAE redundancy of $9.6 million relating to
prior year losses compared to a deficiency of $4.6 million in 1999 and we had
gross loss and LAE redundancy of $1.9 million compared to a deficiency of $90.0
million in 1999. The 1999 gross deficiency results from two principal
conditions. The first is the development of large claims on individual policies
which were either reported late or for which reserves were increased as
subsequent information became available. However, as these policies were
substantially reinsured, there was no material effect to our net earnings.
Secondly, during 1999 in connection with the insolvency of one of our reinsurers
and with the commutation, finalized subsequent to year end, of all liabilities
with another, we re-evaluated all loss reserves and incurred but not reported
loss reserves related to business placed with these reinsurers to determine the
ultimate losses we

                                        33
<PAGE>   35

might conservatively expect. These reserves were then used as the basis for the
determination of the provision for reinsurance recorded in 1999. The other
deficiencies and redundancies in the reserves result from our continued review
with our actuaries of loss reserves and the increase or reduction of such
reserves as losses are finally settled and claims exposures are reduced. We
continue to believe we have provided for all material net incurred losses.

     Policy acquisition costs, which are net of commissions on ceded
reinsurance, increased to $23.7 million during 2000 from $8.2 million for 1999.
This increase in costs results from higher retained premium and the resulting
reduced ceding commissions.

     Net earnings of our insurance companies increased to $24.2 million in 2000
from a loss of $10.7 million in 1999, primarily as a result of improved
underwriting results, the effect of the provision for reinsurance recorded in
1999 and the increase in investment income.

  UNDERWRITING AGENCIES

     Premiums underwritten by our underwriting agencies increased 27% to $1.1
billion for 2000 compared to 1999. Management fees generated by our underwriting
agencies increased 6% to $96.1 million in 2000 compared to 1999. These increases
resulted primarily from the increased premium volume in the medical stop-loss
line of business, which was due to rate increases and the Centris acquisition.
The increase in management fees was disproportionate to the increase in written
premium as a result of higher policy issuance fees and increased retentions by
our insurance companies which reduced management fees earned by our underwriting
agencies. These reductions are offset by an equal reduction in net policy
acquisition costs of our insurance companies. Net earnings of our underwriting
agencies increased 13% to $19.4 million in 2000 from $17.2 million in 1999 due
to increased revenue, a smaller restructuring charge in 2000 than in 1999 and
higher pretax margins primarily as a result of the successful integration of the
Centris acquisition.

  INTERMEDIARIES

     Commission income decreased to $42.5 million in 2000 from $54.6 million in
1999. Net earnings of our intermediary subsidiaries decreased to $9.2 million in
2000 from $13.6 million in 1999. These decreases were due to a significant
reduction in the amount of ceded reinsurance placed on behalf of our insurance
companies as a result of their planned increase in retentions.

     In January 2001, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Schanen
Consulting for 996,805 shares of our common stock. This transaction will be
recorded using the pooling-of-interests method of accounting. Schanen
Consulting's operations have been consolidated with those of HCC Employee
Benefits, our specialty retail employee benefits agency.

  OTHER OPERATIONS

     Other operating revenue decreased to $25.5 million during 2000 from $28.5
million for the same period in 1999. Net earnings of our other operations
decreased to $6.0 million in 2000 from $7.6 million in 1999. Revenue and
earnings can vary considerably from period to period depending on investment or
disposition activity.

  RESTRUCTURING

     As of December 31, 1999, we accrued a restructuring liability of $4.0
million related to our ongoing operations. As of December 31, 2000, all
restructuring costs had been paid or adjusted with the exception of a remaining
liability of $105,000. During 2000, we determined that one of the leased offices
scheduled to be closed would be retained. Therefore, we reversed $789,000
(included as a credit in other operating expenses in the consolidated financial
statements) of the restructuring expense recorded during the fourth quarter of
1999, of which $514,000 was the reversal of the accrual for future lease
payments and $275,000 was the reversal of the write-off of certain assets.

                                        34

     As of December 31, 1999, we had also accrued a restructuring liability
related to our acquisition of Centris. Changes in the accrual between December
31, 1999 and December 31, 2000 are shown in the table below:

</TABLE>

     The adjustments in 2000 were recorded as management decided to take
additional steps to integrate parts of the Centris operations.

     During the fourth quarter of 2000, we also recorded a restructuring charge
and associated expenses of $1.5 million. A total of 26 employees were or will be
terminated as a result of our restructuring of certain underwriting agency
operations and their integration into our insurance company operations. The
charges affected both segments and consisted of $557,000 accrued severance pay
to be paid at various times throughout 2001 and $992,000 for the write down or
write off of various impaired assets, primarily redundant computer software.

  Year Ended December 31, 1999 Versus Year Ended December 31, 1998

     Our revenue increased 11% to $341.9 million in 1999, from $308.0 million in
1998. The revenue increase was principally a result of increases in non-risk
bearing management fees and commission income. This growth is from new business
and acquisitions.

     Our net investment income increased 5% to $30.9 million in 1999 from $29.3
million in 1998, reflecting a slightly higher level of investment assets and
increased interest rates earned on short-term investments.

     Our net realized investment losses from sales or write downs of equity
securities were $3.9 million in 1999, compared to losses of $166,000 in 1998. In
1999, we recognized a $4.3 million realized loss from the write down of one
equity investment to its estimated fair market value based upon market
quotations. Our net realized investment losses from the disposition of fixed
income securities were $164,000 in 1999, compared to gains of $1.0 million in
1998. The losses in 1999 resulted from the sale of bonds in connection with the
funding of the Centris acquisition.

     Our compensation expense increased to $77.5 million in 1999, from $56.1
million in 1998. This increase reflects a normal progressional increase due to
business growth as well as the effect of acquisitions. Other operating expenses
increased $11.1 million to $47.2 million, before restructuring expenses of $5.5
million, during the same period for similar reasons. Our currency conversion
gains amounted to $442,000 in 1999, compared to gains of $219,000 in 1998.

     We recorded a restructuring charge and associated expenses of $5.5 million
during the fourth quarter of 1999. Since our initial public offering in 1992, we
have completed more than fifteen acquisitions. During that time, total employees
had grown from less than 100 to more than 1,000. As a result of this rapid
growth, we believe certain operating inefficiencies occurred. At the beginning
of the fourth quarter of 1999, we made a review of our operations and determined
that they could be made more efficient, principally by reducing the employee
count in certain operations. We believe that this restructuring will strengthen
our corporate and management structure and enhance future earnings by improving
operating efficiency and therefore profitability. The charge included severance
pay of $3.8 million for 92 employees, $1.0 million related to lease costs of
office space made redundant as a result of the restructuring plan and an asset
write down of $647,000, principally of leasehold improvements, and other assets
related to the redundant space.

                                        35
<PAGE>   37

     Our interest expense was $13.0 million for 1999, an increase of $6.9
million from 1998. The increase is a result of increased debt outstanding as a
result of funding for acquisitions.

     Our income tax expense was $12.3 million in 1999 compared to $35.2 million
in 1998. The decrease was due to the reduction in earnings before income tax.
Our effective tax rate for both years was approximately the same.

     Our net earnings in 1999 decreased to $25.1 million from $72.3 million in
1998, due to the provision for reinsurance, which equated to $28.3 million after
income taxes, or $0.57 per diluted share, the higher net loss ratio and the
restructuring expense, which, after income taxes, amounted to $0.07 per diluted
share. Diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.51 per share from $1.48 per
share during the same period.

     Our book value per share was $9.29 as of December 31, 1999, up from $9.12
as of December 31, 1998.

SEGMENTS

  Insurance Companies

     Gross written premium for our insurance companies increased 14% to $568.3
million in 1999, from $498.3 million in 1998. Our accident and health
reinsurance, medical stop-loss and workers' compensation lines of business
showed strong growth because our insurance companies continued to participate in
more of the business written by our underwriting agencies. This growth was
partially offset by reductions in offshore energy and property premium as a
result of the continuing extremely soft conditions in these markets. Net written
premium for our insurance companies increased 15% in 1999 to $139.9 million from
$121.9 million in 1998, as a result of increases in retained aviation and
medical stop-loss premium. Net earned premium decreased slightly in 1999 to
$141.4 million from $143.1 million in 1998 as changes in earned premium lag
behind changes in written premium.

     Loss and loss adjustment expense incurred by our insurance companies
increased to $109.7 million in 1999, from $91.3 million in 1998, and the GAAP
net loss ratio increased to 77.6% in 1999, from 63.8% in 1998. The GAAP gross
loss ratio was 116.5% in 1999 compared to 109.2% in 1998. The deterioration is
primarily from poor results in the aviation, medical stop-loss and property
lines of business. We have taken steps to reduce these gross loss ratios,
primarily by increasing premium rates and more selective underwriting. The
statutory net combined ratio was 129.9% (104.1% excluding the effects of the
provision for reinsurance) in 1999 compared to 82.9% in 1998.

     During 1999, we had a net loss and loss adjustment expense deficiency of
$4.6 million relating to prior year losses compared to a redundancy of $14.6
million in 1998. During 1999, we had a gross loss and loss adjustment expense
deficiency of $90.0 million compared to a deficiency of $33.5 million in 1998.
The 1999 gross deficiency results from two principal conditions. The first is
the development of large claims on individual policies which were either
reported late or for which reserves were increased as subsequent information
became available. However, because these policies were substantially reinsured,
there was no material effect to our net earnings. Secondly, during 1999, in
connection with the insolvency of one of our reinsurers and with the commutation
of all liabilities of another, we re-evaluated all loss reserves and incurred
but not reported loss reserves related to business placed with these reinsurers
to determine the ultimate losses we might conservatively expect. These reserves
were then used as the basis for the determination of the provision for
reinsurance we recorded in 1999. The other deficiencies and redundancies in the
reserves result from our continued review with our actuaries of loss reserves
and the increase or reduction of those reserves as losses are finally settled
and claims exposures are reduced.

     In 1999, our insurance companies recorded a $43.5 million provision for
reinsurance to reflect an estimated $29.5 million pre-tax loss for the
insolvency of a reinsurer and an estimated $14.0 million pre-tax loss, the
majority of which represents the discount on ceded reserves related to the
commutation we initiated of all liabilities with another reinsurer. The
commutation was settled for cash and other assets totaling $56.5 million in
February, 2000.

                                        36
<PAGE>   38

     Our insurance companies' policy acquisition costs, which are net of ceding
commissions on reinsurance ceded, decreased $2.8 million to $8.2 million in
1999, from $11.0 million in 1998. This decrease reflects a greater amount of
gross premium ceded and, therefore, a higher level of ceding commissions.

     Net earnings of our insurance companies decreased to a loss of $10.7
million in 1999, from a profit of $33.8 million in 1998, as a result of the
provision for reinsurance, the effect of restructuring and the higher net loss
ratio.

  Underwriting Agencies

     Management fees generated by our underwriting agencies increased 23% to
$90.7 million in 1999, from $74.0 million in 1998. Premium underwritten on
behalf of both our insurance companies and other insurance companies increased
to $848.1 million in 1999, an increase of 20% from $706.2 million in 1998. Both
increases resulted from acquisitions and internal growth of existing operations.
The underwriting agency segment also incurred a $1.9 million, net of income tax,
restructuring expense in 1999. In addition to its impact on the agency segment,
growth in underwriting agency premium has a positive impact on both the
insurance company segment and the intermediary segment.

     Net earnings of our underwriting agencies decreased to $17.2 million in
1999, from $19.4 million in 1998. Acquisitions made during 1998 and 1999 had not
yet had a positive impact on net earnings due to licensing and other regulatory
requirements, which were still in process.

  Intermediaries

     Commission income generated by our intermediaries increased 42% to $54.6
million in 1999, from $38.4 million in 1998, primarily as a result of the
January 1, 1999 acquisition of Rattner Mackenzie. Net earnings of the
intermediaries decreased to $13.6 million in 1999 from $16.9 million in 1998.
The increase in net earnings generated by Rattner Mackenzie was offset by fewer
large brokerage transactions in 1999 and other reductions, including a $902,000
(net of income tax) restructuring expense in 1999.

  Other Operations

     Our other operating revenue increased 28% to $28.5 million in 1999, from
$22.3 million in 1998. There was a general increase in revenue of the service
operations, net of the decrease in revenue related to operations disposed of in
late 1998. Other operating net earnings increased to $7.6 million in 1999, from
$4.8 million in 1998 due principally to the higher earnings of the service
operations. Revenue and earnings can vary considerably from period to period
depending on investment or disposition activity.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     We receive substantial cash from premiums, reinsurance recoverables, and
management fee and commission income and, to a lesser extent, investment income,
and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments and other assets. Our
principal cash outflows are for the payment of claims and loss adjustment
expenses, payment of premiums to reinsurers, purchase of investments, debt
service, and repayment policy acquisition costs, operating expenses, income and
other taxes and dividends. Variations in operating cash flows can occur due to
timing differences in either the payment of claims and the collection of related
recoverables or the collection of receivables and the payment of related payable
amounts. We limit our liquidity exposure by holding funds, letters of credit and
other security such that net balances due to us are less than the gross balances
shown in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

     We maintain a substantial level of cash and liquid short-term investments
which are used to meet anticipated payment obligations. Our consolidated cash
and investment portfolio increased $116.5 million, or 19% since December 31,
1999, and totaled $724.3 million as of December 31, 2000, of which $277.0
million was cash and short-term investments. The increase in investments
resulted from increased

                                        37
<PAGE>   39

operating cash flows and from the collection of a commutation receivable. Total
assets increased slightly to $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2000.

     Our investment portfolio includes a high percentage of liquid investments
and generates a significant amount of investment income, which serves as a
source of cash flow. The average tax equivalent yield on investments was 7.3% in
2000, compared to 7.2% in 1999. The weighted average duration of the portfolio
was four years as of December 31, 2000. Over 99% of our fixed income securities
were rated A or better by Standard & Poor's. The value of our portfolio of fixed
income securities is inversely correlated to changes in market interest rates.
In addition, some of our fixed income securities have call or prepayment
options. This could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall
or issuers call their securities and we reinvest the proceeds at lower interest
rates. We mitigate this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity
dates, so that only a portion of our portfolio will mature at any point in time.

     As of December 31, 2000, certain of our subsidiaries maintained revolving
lines of credit with a bank in the combined maximum amount of $55.0 million
available through December 31, 2001. Advances under the lines of credit are
limited to amounts required to fund draws, if any, on letters of credit issued
by the bank on behalf of the subsidiaries and short-term direct cash advances.
The lines of credit are collateralized by securities having an aggregate market
value of up to $68.8 million, the actual amount of collateral at any one time
being 125% of the aggregate amount outstanding. Interest on the lines is payable
at the bank's prime rate of interest less 1% (8.5% at December 31, 2000). At
December 31, 2000, letters of credit totaling $26.4 million had been issued to
insurance companies by the bank on behalf of the subsidiaries, with total
securities of $33.1 million collateralizing the lines.

     During March 2001, we sold 6.9 million shares of our common stock in a
public offering at a price of $23.35 per share. Net proceeds from the offering
amounted to approximately $152.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses. Most of the proceeds, $152.5
million, were used to pay down our bank facility.

     On December 17, 1999, we entered into a $300.0 million Revolving Loan
Facility with a group of banks. We can borrow up to $300.0 million under the
facility on a revolving basis until it expires on December 18, 2004. Outstanding
advances under the facility bear interest at agreed upon rates. The facility is
collateralized in part by the pledge of the stock of Houston Casualty and Avemco
Insurance and by the stock of and guarantees entered into by our principal
underwriting agency and intermediary subsidiaries. The facility agreement
contains certain restrictive covenants, including minimum net worth requirements
for us and certain of our subsidiaries, restrictions on certain extraordinary
corporate actions, notice requirements for certain material occurrences, and
required maintenance of specified financial ratios. We believe that the
restrictive covenants and our obligations that are contained in the facility
agreement are typical for financing arrangements comparable to our facility. As
of December 31, 2000, total debt outstanding under the facility was $207.5
million and the weighted average interest rate was 8.18%. During March 2001, we
reduced debt outstanding under the facility to $55.0 million using the proceeds
from our recent public stock offering.

     Property and casualty insurance companies domiciled in the State of Texas
are limited in the payment of dividends to their shareholders in any
twelve-month period, without the prior written consent of the Commissioner of
Insurance, to the greater of statutory net income for the prior calendar year or
10% of its statutory policyholders' surplus as of the prior year end. Houston
Casualty and U.S. Specialty, both Texas domiciled companies, paid no dividends
in 1999 or 2000. During 2001, Houston Casualty's ordinary dividend capacity will
be approximately $23.1 million and U.S. Specialty's ordinary dividend capacity
will be approximately $10.6 million.

     Under the laws of the State of Maryland, Avemco Insurance may only pay
dividends out of statutory earned surplus. The maximum amount of dividends that
Avemco Insurance may pay without prior regulatory approval in any twelve-month
period is the greater of its statutory net income (under certain conditions) for
the prior calendar year or 10% of its statutory policyholders' surplus as of the
prior year end. Avemco Insurance paid an extraordinary dividend of $45.0 million
during December, 1999, but paid

                                        38
<PAGE>   40

no dividends during 2000. During 2001, Avemco Insurance will have an ordinary
dividend capacity of approximately $18.2 million.

     HCC Life Insurance Company is limited by the laws of the State of Indiana
in the amount of dividends it may pay in any twelve-month period, without prior
regulatory approval, to the greater of its statutory net gain from operations
for the prior calendar year or 10% of its policyholders' surplus as of the prior
year end. HCC Life paid no dividends in 2000. During 2001, HCC Life's ordinary
dividend capacity will be approximately $6.3 million.

     As of December 31, 2000, we had a net deferred tax asset of $6.7 million
compared to $18.3 million as of December 31, 1999. Due to our history of
consistent earnings and expectations for future earnings and to the ability to
carry losses back to profitable years for tax purposes, we expect to be able to
fully realize the benefit of our net deferred tax asset.

     The overall increase in underwriting activity by our insurance companies
and the Centris acquisition in December, 1999 resulted in increases in gross
loss reserves, life and annuity policy benefits and gross unearned premiums.
Related amounts of reinsurance recoverables, ceded life and policy benefits and
ceded unearned premium also increased.

     We continue to collect our receivables and recoverables generally in the
ordinary course of business and we have not incurred and do not expect to incur
any significant liquidity difficulties as a result of the substantial growth in
gross amounts due. However, during 2000, a number of reinsurers have delayed or
suspended the payment of amounts recoverable under certain reinsurance contracts
to which we are a party. Such delays have affected, though not materially to
date, the investment income of our insurance companies, but not to any extent
their liquidity. We limit our liquidity exposure by holding funds, letters of
credit or other security such that net balances due are significantly less than
the gross balances shown in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, a
number of reinsurers have claimed they are not liable for payment to us and, in
one or more cases, have sought arbitration of these matters. We believe these
claims are without merit and expect to collect the full amount recoverable. We
are currently in negotiations with most of these parties. If such negotiations
do not result in a satisfactory resolution of the matters in question, we will
seek a judicial or arbitral determination of these matters.

     As of December 31, 2000, each of our domestic insurance companies' total
adjusted capital was significantly in excess of the authorized control level
risk-based capital level prescribed by the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners.

     Regulatory guidelines suggest that a property and casualty insurer's annual
statutory gross written premium should not exceed 900% of its statutory
policyholders' surplus and net written premium should not exceed 300% of its
statutory policyholders' surplus. However, industry standards and rating agency
criteria place these ratios at 300% and 200%, respectively. In the past, our
property and casualty insurance companies have maintained premium to surplus
ratios significantly lower than such guidelines and generally below industry
norms. For the year ended December 31, 2000, our statutory gross written premium
to policyholders' surplus was 298.0% compared to 182.6% for the year ended
December 31, 1999. For the year ended December 31, 2000, our statutory net
written premium to policyholders' surplus was 87.0% compared to 47.6% for the
year ended December 31, 1999. The gross written premium ratio has increased
during 2000 with the acquisition of Centris' book of medical stop-loss business
and the increasing use of our insurance companies as the issuing company for
business written by our underwriting agencies. This ratio is expected to
stabilize at or decrease from its 2000 level as statutory policyholders' surplus
increases due to the retention of earnings and other increases in policyholders'
surplus.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

     Our operations, like those of other property and casualty insurers, are
susceptible to the effects of inflation, as premiums are established before the
ultimate amounts of loss and loss adjustment expense are known. Although we
consider the potential effects of inflation when setting premium rates, for
competitive reasons, such premiums may not fully offset the effects of
inflation. However, because the majority of our

                                        39
<PAGE>   41

business is comprised of lines which have relatively short lead times between
the occurrence of an insured event, reporting of the claims to us and the final
settlement of the claims, the effects of inflation are minimized.

     A significant portion of our revenue is related to healthcare insurance and
reinsurance products that are subject to the effects of the underlying inflation
of healthcare costs. Such inflation in the costs of healthcare tends to generate
increases in premiums for medical stop-loss coverage, resulting in greater
revenue, but also higher claim payments. Inflation may have a negative impact on
insurance and reinsurance operations by causing higher claim settlements than
may originally have been estimated without an immediate increase in premiums to
a level necessary to maintain profit margins. We do not specifically provide for
inflation when setting underwriting terms and claim reserves, although we do
consider trends. We continually review claim reserves to assess their adequacy
and make necessary adjustments. Also, the market value of our investments vary
depending on economic and market conditions and interest rates. Any significant
increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the market
value of our investments. In addition, the interest rate payable under our
$300.0 million bank loan floats with that of the market. Any significant
increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our earnings,
depending on the amount borrowed on our bank facility.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS

     We underwrite risks which are denominated in a number of foreign
currencies. As a result, we have receivables and payables in foreign currencies
and we establish and maintain loss reserves with respect to our insurance
policies in their respective currencies. Our net earnings could be impacted by
exchange rate fluctuations affecting these balances. Our principal area of
exposure is with respect to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the major
European currencies and the U.S. Dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2000,
our loss from currency conversion was $(330,000) compared to gains of $442,000
in 1999 and $219,000 in 1998.

     On a limited basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts as a
hedge against foreign currency fluctuations. Rattner Mackenzie has revenue
streams in U.S. Dollars and Canadian Dollars ("CAD") but its expenses are paid
in British Pound Sterling ("GBP"). To mitigate our foreign exchange risk, we
entered into foreign currency forward contracts expiring at staggered times
through December 31, 2001. As of December 31, 2000 we had forward contracts to
sell U.S. $7.5 million for GBP at an average rate of 1.00 GBP equals U.S. $1.50
and to sell CAD $600,000 for GBP at an average exchange rate of 1.00 GBP equals
CAD $2.18. This compares with December 31,1999 when we had forward contracts to
sell U.S. $12.0 million for GBP at an average rate of 1.00 GBP equals U.S.
$1.60. The foreign currency forward contracts are used to convert currency at a
known rate in an amount which approximates average monthly expenses. This
permits us to limit the foreign currency exchange risk of the recurring monthly
expenses. In the future, we may continue to limit our exposure to currency
fluctuations through the use of foreign currency forward contracts. We utilize
these foreign currency forward contracts strictly as a hedge against existing
exposure to foreign currency fluctuations rather than as a form of speculation
or trading investment.

EFFECTS OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133 entitled
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" was issued in
June 1998, and became effective for us January 1, 2001. We utilize derivatives
or hedging strategies on a limited basis. The cumulative effect adjustment due
to this change in accounting has been calculated by us and is not material to
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows nor do we expect the
adoption of SFAS No. 133 to be material on an ongoing basis due to our limited
use of derivatives.

     The National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted Statements of
Statutory Accounting Principles in March, 1998 as a product of its attempt to
codify statutory accounting principles. Although subject to adoption by the
individual states, an effective date of January 1, 2001 was established for

                                        40
<PAGE>   42

implementation of the statements. Prior to the codification project, a
comprehensive guide to statutory accounting principles did not exist.
Codification is new and will evolve over time. The cumulative effect of
codification is expected to increase statutory policyholders' surplus of our
insurance company subsidiaries by approximately $6.0 million. We expect that the
statutory surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries after adoption will
continue to be in excess of their regulatory risk-based capital requirements.

     In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has recently
announced that it proposes to change the accounting for certain acquisitions and
goodwill. This pronouncement, if finally adopted, could affect the way we
account for and the structure of future acquisitions. Final rules implementing
the announced standards are not expected until the second quarter of 2001 and no
date has been established for adopting the final standards.

EURO CONVERSION

     On January 1, 1999, certain member countries of the European Union
irrevocably fixed the conversion rates between their national currencies and a
common currency, the Euro, which became the common legal currency of those
countries on that date. The participating countries' former national currencies
will continue to serve as legal tender and as denominations of the Euro until
January 1, 2002. The conversion to the Euro is scheduled to be completed on July
1, 2002, when the national currencies will cease to exist. We do not expect the
introduction of the Euro to have a material effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

     Our principal assets and liabilities are financial instruments which are
subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market
rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are: interest rate risk on
fixed income securities and interest expense on variable rate debt, equity risk
on marketable equity securities, credit risk on reinsurance recoverables and
foreign currency exchange rate risk.

     To manage the exposures of our investment risks, we generally invest in
investment grade securities with characteristics of duration and liquidity to
reflect the underlying characteristics of the insurance liabilities of our
insurance companies. We have not historically used derivatives to manage any of
our investment related market risks.

     Caution should be used in evaluating overall market risk from the
information below. Actual results could differ materially from estimates below
for a variety of reasons, including, among other things:

     - amounts and balances on which the estimates are based are likely to
       change over time;

     - assumptions used in the models may prove to be inaccurate;

     - market changes could be different from market changes assumed below; and

     - not all factors and balances are taken into account.

  Interest Rate Risk

     The value of our portfolio of fixed income securities is inversely
correlated to changes in the market interest rates. In addition, some of our
fixed income securities have call or prepayment options. This could subject us
to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall or issuers call their securities
and we reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates. We attempt to mitigate
this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates, so that only a
portion of the portfolio will mature at any point in time. The fair value of our
fixed income securities as of December 31, 2000 was $433.8 million and was
$342.6 million, as of December 31, 1999. If market interest rates were to change
1%, (e.g. from 6% to 5%) the fair value of our fixed income securities would
change approximately $17.9 million as of December 31, 2000. This compares to
change in value of $17.2 million as of December 31, 1999 for the same 1% change
in market interest rates. The change in fair value was determined using duration
modeling assuming no prepayments.
                                        41
<PAGE>   43

     Our $300 million bank loan is subject to variable interest rates. Thus, our
interest expense is directly correlated to market interest rates. As of December
31, 2000, we had $207.5 million in debt outstanding under the bank loan. At this
debt level, a 1% change in market interest rates (e.g. from 8.0% to 7.0%) would
change our annual interest expense by $2.1 million. As of December 31, 1999, we
had $235.0 million in debt outstanding under the bank loan. At that debt level,
the 1% change in market interest rates would have changed interest expense by
$2.4 million. During March 2001, we reduced our debt under the bank loan to
$55.0 million. At that debt level, a 1% change in market interest rates would
change our annual interest expense $550,000.

  Equity Risk

     Our portfolio of marketable equity securities is subject to equity price
risk due to market changes. The fair value of our marketable equity securities
as of December 31, 2000 was $6.3 million, compared to $20.0 million as of
December 31, 1999. If the market price of all marketable equity securities were
to change by 10% as of these dates, the fair value of our equity portfolio would
have changed $628,000 as of December 31, 2000 and $2.0 million as of December
31, 1999.

  Credit Risk

     See Reinsurance Ceded section contained in Item 1., Business, and Footnote
(8) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

  Foreign Exchange Risk

     The table below shows the net amounts of significant foreign currency
balances at December 31, 2000 and 1999 converted to U.S. Dollars. It also shows
the expected dollar change in fair value that would occur if exchange rates
changed 10% from exchange rates in effect at those times:

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc.

     In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in
shareholders' equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     As discussed in Note 1, effective January 1, 2000 the Company changed its
method of revenue recognition for certain contracts as prescribed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 entitled
"Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements".

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES

     HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. ("the Company" or "HCC") and its subsidiaries,
include domestic and foreign property and casualty and life insurance companies,
underwriting agencies, intermediaries and service companies. HCC, through its
subsidiaries, provides specialized property and casualty and life and health
insurance to commercial customers in the areas of accident and health
reinsurance and aviation, marine and offshore energy, medical stop-loss,
property and workers' compensation insurance. The principal insurance company
subsidiaries are Houston Casualty Company ("HC") in Houston, Texas, and London,
England; HCC Life Insurance Company ("HCCL") in Houston, Texas; U.S. Specialty
Insurance Company ("USSIC") in Houston, Texas; and Avemco Insurance Company
("AIC") in Frederick, Maryland. The underwriting agency subsidiaries provide
underwriting management and claims servicing for insurance and reinsurance
companies, specializing in aviation, medical stop-loss, occupational accident
and workers' compensation insurance and a variety of accident and health related
reinsurance products. The principal agency subsidiaries are LDG Reinsurance
Corporation ("LDG Re") in Wakefield, Massachusetts and New York City, New York;
and HCC Benefits Corporation ("HCCB") in Atlanta, Georgia, Costa Mesa,
California, Wakefield, Massachusetts, Minneapolis, Minnesota and Dallas, Texas.
We have recently consolidated the operations of other of the Company's agencies
with certain of the Company's insurance companies. The intermediary subsidiaries
provide brokerage, consulting and other intermediary services to insurance and
reinsurance companies, commercial customers and individuals in the same lines of
business as the insurance companies operate. The Company's principal
intermediary subsidiaries are HCC Intermediaries, Inc. ("HCCI") in Houston,
Texas; HCC Employee Benefits, Inc. ("HCCEB") in Houston, Texas and Atlanta,
Georgia; and Rattner Mackenzie Limited ("RML") in London, England. The service
company subsidiaries perform various insurance related services for insurance
companies.

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions. This affects amounts reported in the
financial statements and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     A description of the significant accounting and reporting policies utilized
by the Company in preparing the consolidated financial statements is as follows:

  Principles of Consolidation

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

  Investments

     Fixed income securities and marketable equity securities are classified as
available for sale and are carried at quoted market value, if readily
marketable, or at management's estimated fair value, if not readily marketable.
The change in unrealized gain or loss with respect to these securities is
recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, net of the related
deferred income tax effects, if any. Fixed income securities available for sale
are purchased with the original intent to hold to maturity, but they may be
available for sale if market conditions warrant, or if the Company's investment
policies dictate, in order to maximize the Company's investment yield.
Short-term investments and restricted short-term investments are carried at
cost, which approximates market value.

     For the mortgage-backed securities portion of the fixed income portfolio,
the Company recognizes income using a constant effective yield based on
anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When
actual prepayments differ significantly from anticipated prepayments, the
estimated

                                       F-7

                 HCC INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

economic life is recalculated and the remaining unamortized premium or discount
is amortized prospectively over the remaining economic life.

     The realized gain or loss on investment transactions is determined on an
average cost basis and included in earnings on the trade date. When impairment
of the value of an investment is considered other than temporary, the decrease
in value is reported in earnings as a realized investment loss and a new cost
basis is established.

  Property and Equipment

     Property and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation expense is provided using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Amortization of leasehold
improvements is provided using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
estimated useful life or the term of the respective lease. Upon disposal of
assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in earnings.

     Costs incurred in developing or purchasing management information systems
are capitalized and included in property and equipment. These costs are
amortized over their estimated useful lives from the dates the systems are
placed in service.

  Earned Premium, Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Ceding Commissions of
  Insurance Company Subsidiaries

     Written premium, net of reinsurance, is primarily included in earnings on a
pro rata basis over the lives of the related policies. However, for certain
types of business, it is recognized over the period of risk in proportion to the
amount of insurance risk provided. Policy acquisition costs, including
commissions, taxes, fees and other direct costs of underwriting policies, less
ceding commissions allowed by reinsurers, including expense allowances, are
deferred and charged or credited to earnings proportionate to the premium
earned. Historical and current loss and loss adjustment expense experience and
anticipated investment income are considered in determining the recoverability
of deferred policy acquisition costs.

  Management Fees and Commission Income

     When there is no future servicing obligation, management fees and
commission income are recognized on the revenue recognition date, which is the
later of the effective date of policy, the date when the premium can be
reasonably established, or the date when substantially all the services relating
to the insurance placement have been rendered to the client. When additional
services are required, the service revenue is deferred and recognized over the
service period. The Company also records an allowance for estimated return
commissions which the Company may be required to pay upon the early termination
of policies.

     The Company changed certain of its revenue recognition methods for its
agencies and intermediaries to agree with guidance contained in SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin Number 101 ("SAB 101") entitled "Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements." Previously, the Company's agencies and intermediaries
recognized revenue in conformity with principles that historically had been
considered generally accepted accounting principles for insurance agents and
brokers. The Company had recognized return commissions when the event occurred
that caused the return and accrued a liability for future servicing costs, when
significant, instead of deferring revenue.

     The after-tax cumulative non-cash charge resulting from the adoption of SAB
101 was $2.0 million. As required by this new accounting guidance, the Company
has restated the 2000 first quarter results for the cumulative effect of the
change in accounting. The change was not material to earnings before cumulative
effect of accounting change for the year ended December 31, 2000 or to net
earnings for any prior year presented.

  Other Operating Revenue

     The Company has two primary sources of other operating revenue, which are
included in the Company's other operations segment. The first source is a
variety of insurance related services, principally claims adjusting services.
These revenues are recorded when the service is performed. The second source is
income from and gains or losses from the disposition of investments made in this
segment. The income is recognized as earned and the gains or losses from the
sale of investments are recognized upon consummation of the transaction or upon
other-than-temporary impairment.

  Premium and Other Receivables

     The Company uses the gross method for reporting receivables and payables on
brokered transactions. Management reviews the collectibility of its receivables
on a current basis and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts if it deems
that there are accounts which are doubtful of collection. The amount of the
allowance as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 was $3.2 million and $1.7 million,
respectively. Management's estimate of the level of the allowance could change
as conditions change in the future.

  Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Payable of Insurance Company Subsidiaries

     Loss and loss adjustment expense payable is based on estimates of payments
to be made for reported and incurred but not reported ("IBNR") losses and
anticipated salvage and subrogation receipts. Currently all reserves are
recorded on an undiscounted basis. Estimates for reported losses are based on
all available information, including reports received from ceding companies on
business. Estimates for IBNR are based both on the Company's and the industry's
experience. While management believes that amounts included in the accompanying
financial statements are adequate, such estimates may be more or less than the
amounts ultimately paid when the claims are settled. The estimates are
continually reviewed and any changes are reflected in current operations.

  Reinsurance

     The Company records all reinsurance recoverables and ceded unearned
premiums as assets and deferred ceding commissions as a liability. All such
amounts are recorded in a manner consistent with the underlying reinsured
contracts. Management has also recorded a reserve for uncollectible reinsurance
based on current estimates of collectibility. These estimates could change and
affect the level of the reserve needed.

  Goodwill

     In connection with the Company's acquisitions of subsidiaries accounted for
as purchases, the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired is being
amortized using the straight-line method over twenty years for acquired agency
operations which operate in existing lines of business and in the same country.
Goodwill related to acquired agency operations which represent the Company's
initial entry into new lines of business or new countries is amortized over
thirty years. Goodwill related to acquired insurance company operations is
amortized over forty years. Managements of the acquired businesses have
successfully operated in their markets for a number of years and, with the
additional capital provided by the Company, will be positioned to take advantage
of increased opportunities. Accumulated amortization of goodwill as of December
31, 2000 and 1999, was $24.9 million and $11.9 million, respectively.

     The Company's accounting policy regarding the assessment of the
recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets, including goodwill
and other intangibles and property and equipment, is to review the carrying
value of the assets if the facts and circumstances suggest that they may be
impaired. If this review indicates that the carrying value will not be
recoverable, as determined based on projected undiscounted future cash flows,
the carrying value is reduced to its estimated fair value. Amortization of
goodwill charged to

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

income for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $13.0 million,
$6.7 million and $3.0 million, respectively.

  Cash and Short-term Investments

     Cash consists of cash in banks, generally in operating accounts. The
Company classifies certificates of deposit, corporate demand notes receivable,
commercial paper and money market funds as short-term investments. Short-term
investments are classified as investments in the consolidated balance sheets as
they relate principally to the Company's investment activities.

     As of December 31, 2000 and 1999 the Company included $158.3 million and
$138.5 million, respectively, of certain fiduciary funds in short-term
investments. These are funds held by underwriting agency or intermediary
subsidiaries for the benefit of insurance or reinsurance clients. The Company
earns the interest on these funds.

     The Company generally maintains its cash deposits in major banks and
invests its short-term investments with major banks and in investment grade
commercial paper and repurchase agreements. These securities typically mature
within 90 days and, therefore, bear minimal risk. The Company has not
experienced any losses on its cash deposits or its short-term investments.

  Restricted Cash and Cash Investments

     In conjunction with the management of reinsurance pools, the Company's
agency subsidiaries withhold premium funds for the payment of claims. These
funds are shown as restricted cash and cash investments in the consolidated
balance sheets. The corresponding liability is included within premium and
claims payable in the consolidated balance sheets. These amounts are considered
fiduciary funds, and interest earned on these funds accrues to the benefit of
the members of the reinsurance pools. Therefore, the Company does not include
these amounts as cash in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

  Foreign Currency

     The functional currency of most foreign subsidiaries and branches is the
U.S. Dollar. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet
date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange
in effect on the date the transaction occurs. Translation gains and losses are
recorded in earnings and included in other operating expenses. The Company's
foreign currency transactions are principally denominated in British Pound
Sterling ("GBP") and other European currencies. For the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998, the gain (loss) from currency conversion was $(330,000),
$442,000 and $219,000, respectively.

     Some foreign subsidiaries or branches have a functional currency of either
the GBP or the Canadian Dollar ("CAD"). The cumulative translation adjustment,
representing the effect of translating these subsidiaries' or branches' assets
and liabilities into U.S. Dollars, is included in the foreign currency
translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income.

     On a limited basis, the Company enters into foreign currency forward
contracts as a hedge against foreign currency fluctuations. RML has revenue
streams in U.S. Dollars and Canadian Dollars but its expenses are paid in GBP.
To mitigate the foreign exchange risk, the Company entered into foreign currency
forward contracts expiring at staggered times through December, 2001. The
foreign currency forward contracts are used to convert currency at a known rate
in an amount which approximates average monthly expenses. Thus, the effect of
these transactions is to limit the foreign currency exchange risk of the
recurring monthly expenses. The Company utilizes these foreign currency forward
contracts strictly as a hedge against existing exposure to foreign currency
fluctuations rather than as a form of speculative or trading investment.

<PAGE>   58
                 HCC INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     To the extent the foreign exchange forward contracts qualify for hedge
accounting treatment, the gain ($4,000 as of December 31, 2000), or loss due to
changes in fair value is not recognized in the financial statements until
realized, at which time the gain or loss is recognized along with the offsetting
loss or gain on the hedged item. To the extent the foreign currency forward
contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gain or loss due to
changes in fair value is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings,
but is generally offset by changes in value of the underlying exposure.

  Income Tax

     The companies file a consolidated Federal income tax return and include the
foreign subsidiaries' income to the extent required by law. Deferred income tax
is accounted for using the liability method, which reflects the tax impact of
temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and such bases as measured by tax laws and regulations.

  Earnings Per Share

     Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the year divided into net earnings. Diluted earnings
per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
plus the potential common shares outstanding during the year divided into net
earnings. Outstanding common stock options, when dilutive, are considered to be
potential common stock for the purpose of the diluted calculation. The treasury
stock method is used to calculate potential common stock outstanding due to
options.

     Contingent shares to be issued are included in the earnings per share
computation when the underlying conditions for issuance have been met.

  Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133 entitled
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" was issued in
June, 1998 and is effective for the Company January 1, 2001. The Company has
utilized derivatives or hedging strategies on a limited basis. After adoption,
hedge effectiveness will be measured by comparing RML's actual GBP expenses with
proceeds from the forward currency forward contracts. The cumulative effect
adjustment due to this change in accounting has been calculated by the Company
and is not material to its financial position, results of operations or cash
flows nor does the Company expect the adoption of SFAS No. 133 to be material on
an ongoing basis due to its limited use of derivatives.

     In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has recently
announced that it proposes to change the accounting for certain acquisitions and
goodwill. This pronouncement, if finally adopted, could affect the way the
Company accounts for and the structure of future acquisitions. Final rules
implementing the announced standards are not expected until the second quarter
of 2001 and no date has been established for adopting the final standards.

  Reclassifications

     Certain amounts in the 1999 and 1998 consolidated financial statements have
been reclassified to conform with the 2000 presentation. Such reclassifications
had no effect on the Company's shareholders' equity, net earnings or cash flows.

(2) ACQUISITIONS AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

  Public Offering of Common Stock

     During March 2001, the Company sold 6.9 million shares of the Company's
Common Stock in a public offering at a price of $23.35 per share. Net proceeds
from the offering amounted to approximately $152.8 million after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. Most of
the proceeds, $152.5 million, were used to pay down the bank Facility. The
unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet gives effect to the proceeds of
the public offering as if it had occurred at December 31, 2000.

  Schanen Acquisition

     On January 19, 2001, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
Schanen Consulting Corporation and its operating subsidiary, Schanen Consulting
Group, L.L.C. (collectively "Schanen") in exchange for 996,805 shares of the
Company's Common Stock. This business combination will be recorded using the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting. The table below shows the pro forma
effects on revenue, net earnings and net earnings per share as if the two
entities had been combined for the three years ended December 31, 2000:

  Purchase Acquisitions

     In 1999 and 1998, the Company acquired certain businesses in transactions
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. On a combined basis, the
fair value of assets acquired was $549.5 million in 1999 and $44.9 million in
1998. The fair value of liabilities assumed was $499.8 million in 1999 and $46.2
million in 1998. The total consideration was $227.4 million in 1999 and $50.0
million in 1998. The results of operations of these businesses have been
included in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the effective
date of each transaction. The following table lists these transactions:

     On December 17, 1999, the Company entered into a $300.0 million Revolving
Loan Facility (the "Facility") with a group of banks. Borrowing under the
Facility may be made from time to time on a revolving basis until the Facility's
expiration on December 18, 2004. Outstanding advances under the Facility bear
interest at agreed upon rates. The Facility is collateralized in part by the
stock of HC and AIC and by the stock and guarantees entered into by the
Company's principal underwriting agency and intermediary subsidiaries. The
Facility agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including minimum net
worth requirements for the Company and certain subsidiaries, restrictions on
certain extraordinary corporate actions, notice requirements for certain
material occurrences, and required maintenance of specified financial ratios.
Management believes that the restrictive covenants and other obligations of the
Company which are contained in the Facility agreement are typical for financing
arrangements comparable to the Facility. As of December 31, 2000, total debt
outstanding under the Facility was $207.5 million and the weighted average
interest rate was 8.18%. During March 2001, the Company reduced the debt
outstanding under the Facility to $55.0 million using the proceeds from its
recent public stock offering (see Note 2).

     The acquisition notes are payable to former owners of RML. The notes are
payable in decreasing amounts in four annual installments beginning January 31,
2000. The notes carry no stated interest, but were discounted at 6.25% for
financial reporting purposes when the acquisition of RML was recorded. The
interest rate used was based on current rates offered to the Company as of RML's
acquisition date.

     At December 31, 2000, certain of the Company's subsidiaries maintained
revolving lines of credit with a bank in the combined maximum amount of $55.0
million available through December 31, 2001. Advances under the lines of credit
are limited to amounts required to fund draws, if any, on letters of credit
issued by the

bank on behalf of the subsidiaries and short-term direct cash advances. The
lines of credit are collateralized by securities having an aggregate market
value of up to $68.8 million, the actual amount of collateral at any one time
being 125% of the aggregate amount outstanding. Interest on the lines is payable
at the bank's prime rate of interest less 1% (8.5% at December 31, 2000). At
December 31, 2000, letters of credit totaling $26.4 million had been issued to
insurance companies by the bank on behalf of the subsidiaries, with total
securities of $33.1 million collateralizing the lines.

(6) INCOME TAX

     As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company had income taxes receivable
of $13.2 million and $34.0 million, respectively, included in other assets in

     In connection with the acquisition of Centris in 1999, the Company acquired
approximately $35.0 million in net operating losses for Federal income tax
purposes. As of December 31, 1999 a valuation allowance was established to
reduce the acquired net operating loss deferred tax asset to zero. During 2000,
under applicable Treasury regulations, the Company irrevocably waived (reduced)
the level of the carryforwards to approximately $16.0 million. As a consequence
of this waiver, the deferred tax asset and the related deferred tax valuation
allowance applicable to the waived net operating losses were reduced by the same
amount ($5.7 million) resulting in no change in net deferred tax assets. As of
December 31, 2000, the Company has Federal net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $16.0 million which will expire in varying amounts through the
year 2020. Future use of the carryforwards is subject to material statutory
limitations due to prior changes of ownership. Any future tax benefit realized
from the pre-acquisition loss carryforwards will not be credited to future
income but will reduce goodwill recorded in connection with the applicable
purchase transaction. As of December 31, 2000, the Company also has
approximately $5.0 million of losses from foreign branches which are limited to
use against future income of the respective foreign branches.

     The following table summarizes the differences between the Company's
effective tax rate for financial statement purposes and the Federal statutory
rate for the three years ended December 31, 2000:

(7) SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

     The Company classifies its activities into four operating business segments
based upon services provided: 1) insurance company operations, 2) underwriting
agency operations, 3) intermediary operations, and 4) other operations. See Note
1 for a description of the services provided by and the principal subsidiaries
included in

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

the insurance company, underwriting agency and intermediary segments. The other
operations segment performs various insurance related services and contains
insurance related investments made from time to time. The primary operating
entities in this segment principally provide insurance claims adjusting
services. Also included in other operations is income from gains or losses from
the disposition of the investments. Corporate includes general corporate
operations, and those minor operations not included in an operating segment.
Inter-segment revenue consists primarily of management fees of the underwriting
agency segment, commission income of the intermediary segment and service
revenue of the other operations charged to the insurance company segment on
business retained by the Company's insurance company subsidiaries. Inter-
segment pricing (either flat rate fees or as a percentage premium) approximates
what is charged to unrelated parties for similar services.

     The performance of each segment is evaluated by management based upon net
earnings. Net earnings is calculated after tax and after all corporate expense
allocations, amortization of goodwill, interest expense on debt incurred at the
purchase date and intercompany eliminations have been charged or credited to the
individual segments.

     The following tables show information by business segment and geographic
location. Geographic location is determined by physical location of the
Company's offices and does not represent the location of insureds or reinsureds
from whom the business was generated.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     The agency segment incurred the $2.0 million reduction in net income
resulting from the cumulative effect of the Company's adoption of SAB 101
effective January 1, 2000. For 2000, earnings before income taxes were $90.7
million for domestic subsidiaries and a loss before income taxes of $1.4 million
for foreign subsidiaries. The insurance company subsidiaries increased their
policy issuance fees on certain 2000 contracts to reflect current market
conditions, which had the effect of reducing the underwriting agencies'
management fees $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, but as the
insurance company segment reduced its net policy acquisition costs by a like
amount, there was no effect to consolidated net income.

     During the year ended December 31, 1998, one broker in London, England,
produced gross written premium ("GWP") to the Company of approximately $46.1
million. This represents 10% of the Company's total GWP for that year. During
2000 and 1999, no customer produced in excess of 10% of the Company's total GWP.

(8) REINSURANCE

     In the normal course of business, the Company's insurance company
subsidiaries cede a substantial portion of their premium to non-affiliated
domestic and foreign reinsurers through quota share, surplus, excess of loss and
facultative reinsurance agreements. Although the ceding of reinsurance does not
discharge the primary insurer from liability to its policyholder, the
subsidiaries participate in such agreements for the purpose of limiting their
loss exposure, protect against catastrophic loss and diversifying their
business. Most of the reinsurance assumed by the Company's insurance company
subsidiaries was underwritten directly by one of the Company's underwriting
agency subsidiaries, but issued by other non-affiliated companies in order to
satisfy local licensing, contractual or other requirements. The following table
represents the effect of such reinsurance transactions on net premium and loss
and loss adjustment expense:

     Lloyds of London is an insurance and reinsurance marketplace composed of
many independent underwriting syndicates financially supported by a central
trust fund. As of December 31, 2000, the net recoverable due from Underwriters
at Lloyd's, aggregating $192.2 million, represented balances due from over 140
different syndicates, five of which each had a net recoverable balance in excess
of $10.0 million. The largest net recoverable balance from an individual Lloyd's
syndicate as of December 31, 2000 was $26.5 million.

     HCCL previously sold its entire block of life insurance and annuity
business to Life Reassurance Corporation of America (rated A++ by A.M. Best) in
the form of an indemnity reinsurance contract. Ceded life and annuity benefits
amounted to $86.8 million and $95.8 million as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

     The Company has a reserve of $4.1 million as of December 31, 2000 for
potential collectibility issues related to reinsurance recoverables. The adverse
economic environment in the worldwide insurance industry has placed great
pressure on reinsurers and the results of their operations. Ultimately, these
conditions could affect reinsurers' solvency. Historically, there have been
insolvencies following a period of competitive pricing in the industry, such as
the marketplace has experienced for the last several years. Therefore, while
management believes that the reserve is adequate based on current available
information, conditions may change or additional information might be obtained
that would affect management's estimate of the adequacy of the level of the
reserve and which may result in a future increase or decrease in the reserve.
Management continually reviews the Company's financial exposure to the
reinsurance market and continues to take actions to protect shareholders'
equity.

     During 2000, a number of reinsurers have delayed or suspended the payment
of amounts recoverable under certain reinsurance contracts to which the Company
is a party. Such delays have affected, though not materially to date, the
investment income of the Company's insurance company subsidiaries, but not to
any extent their liquidity. The Company limits its liquidity exposure by holding
funds, letters of credit or other security such that net balances due are
significantly less than the gross balances shown on the Company's consolidated
balance sheets. In addition, a number of reinsurers have claimed they are not
liable for payments to us and, in one or more cases, have sought arbitration of
these matters. The Company believes these claims are without merit and expects
to collect the full amount recoverable. The Company is currently in negotiations
with most of these parties. If such negotiations do not result in a satisfactory
resolution of the matters in question, the Company will seek a judicial or
arbitral determination of these matters.

     During 1999, the Company recorded a provision for reinsurance totaling
$29.5 million in connection with the insolvency of a reinsurer. The Company
expects this provision to be sufficient. The Company also recorded a $14.0
million provision following a commutation (the contractual settlement of
outstanding and future liabilities) with another reinsurer, the majority of
which represents the present value discount of ceded losses.

(9) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

  Litigation

     The Company is party to numerous lawsuits and other proceedings that arise
in the normal course of its business. Many of such lawsuits and other
proceedings involve claims under policies that the Company's insurance company
subsidiaries underwrite as an insurer or reinsurer, the liabilities for which
management believes have been adequately included in the Company's loss
reserves. Also, from time to time, the Company is a party to lawsuits and other
proceedings which relate to disputes over contractual relationships with third
parties, or which involve alleged errors and omissions on the part of its
subsidiaries. Management believes the resolution of any such lawsuits will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

  Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

     On a limited basis, the Company enters into foreign currency forward
contracts as a hedge against foreign currency fluctuations. RML has revenue
streams in U.S. Dollars and Canadian Dollars but incurs expenses in GBP. To
mitigate the foreign exchange risk, the Company entered into foreign currency
forward contracts expiring at staggered times through December, 2001. As of
December 31, 2000, the Company had forward contracts to sell US $7.5 million for
GBP at an average rate of 1.00 GBP equals US $1.50 and to sell CAD $600,000 for
GBP at an average rate of 1.00 GBP equals CAD $2.18. The foreign currency
forward contracts are used to convert currency at a known rate in an amount
which approximates average monthly expenses. Thus, the effect of these
transactions is to limit the foreign currency exchange risk of the recurring
monthly expenses. The Company utilizes these foreign currency forward contracts
strictly as a hedge against existing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations
rather than as a form of speculative or trading investment. The fair value of
foreign currency forward contracts December 31, 2000 was $14,000.

  Leases

     The Company leases administrative office facilities under long-term
non-cancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through
September, 2007. In addition to rent, the agreements generally require the
payment of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance and repairs. The Company has
recognized rent expense on a straight-line basis over the terms of these leases.
In addition, the Company leases computer equipment and automobiles under
operating leases expiring at various dates through the year 2004. Rent expense
under operating leases amounted to $7.1 million, $5.7 million, and $4.3 million,
for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

     At December 31, 2000, future minimum annual rental payments required under
long-term, non-cancelable operating leases, excluding certain expenses payable
by the Company, are as follows:

  Catastrophe Exposure

     The Company writes business in areas exposed to catastrophic losses and has
significant exposures to this type of loss in California, the Atlantic Coast of
United States, certain United States Gulf Coast states, particularly Florida and
Texas, the Caribbean and Mexico. The Company assesses its overall exposures to a
single catastrophic event and applies procedures that it believes are more
conservative than are typically used by the industry to ascertain the Company's
probable maximum loss ("PML") from any single event. The Company maintains
reinsurance protection which it believes is sufficient to cover any foreseeable
event.

  Loan Guarantee

     During 1999, the Company guaranteed the construction financing debt of a
partnership in which the company is a limited partner. The total amount of the
loan commitment is $11.5 million, of which $11.1 million was funded as of
December 31, 2000.

     The Company has committed to invest $5.0 million in an investment
partnership managed by a related party. As of December 31, 2000, $3.4 million
had been invested under this commitment. In 1998, HC bought an office building
to be occupied by the Company from a partnership in which an officer and
Director was a partner. The purchase price of $6.0 million was based upon
independent appraisal.

(11) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     The Company has a defined contribution retirement plan under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code which covers substantially all of the employees
residing in the United States who meet specified service requirements. The
contributions are discretionary and are determined by management as of the
beginning of

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

each calendar year. The Company currently matches each employee's contribution
to the 401(k) plan up to 6% of the employee's salary. Employees of the Company
who reside outside the United States receive comparable benefits under different
plans. The Company contributed $3.2 million, $3.1 million, and $1.7 million to
the plans for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively,
which is included in compensation expense in the accompanying consolidated
statements of earnings.

(12) SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

     Under the Texas Insurance Code, HC and USSIC must each maintain minimum
statutory capital of $1.0 million and minimum statutory surplus of $1.0 million,
and can only pay dividends out of statutory surplus funds. In addition, they are
limited in the amount of dividends which they may pay in any twelve-month
period, without prior regulatory approval, to the greater of statutory net
income for the prior calendar year or ten percent (10%) of statutory
policyholders' surplus as of the prior calendar year end. During 2001, HC's and
USSIC's ordinary dividend capacities will be approximately $23.1 million and
$10.6 million, respectively.

     AIC is limited by the State of Maryland in the amount of dividends which it
may pay in any twelve-month period, without prior regulatory approval, to the
greater of statutory net income (under certain conditions) for the prior
calendar year or ten percent (10%) of statutory policyholders' surplus as of the
prior year end. During 2001, AIC's ordinary dividend capacity will be
approximately $18.2 million.

     HCCL is limited by the laws of the State of Indiana in the amount of
dividends it may pay in any twelve-month period, without prior regulatory
approval, to the greater of net gain from operations for the prior calendar year
or ten percent (10%) of statutory capital and surplus as of the prior year end.
During 2001, HCCL's ordinary dividend capacity will be approximately $6.3
million.

     As of December 31, 2000, all of the domestic insurance company subsidiaries
total adjusted capital is significantly in excess of the NAIC authorized control
level risk-based capital.

     Options vest over a zero to five year period and expire four to ten years
after grant date. All options have been granted at fixed exercise prices,
generally at the market price of the Company's Common Stock on the grant date.
Any excess of the market price on the grant date over the exercise price is
recognized as compensation expense in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. If the fair value method of valuing compensation related to options
would have been used, pro forma net earnings and pro forma diluted earnings per
share would have been $48.7 million, or $0.96 per share, for the year ended
December 31, 2000; $20.7 million, or $0.42 per share, for the year ended
December 31, 1999; and $65.4 million, or $1.34 per share, for the year ended
December 31, 1998. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the
grant date using the Black-Scholes single option pricing model with the
following weighted average assumptions: a) risk free interest rate of 6.4% for
2000, 5.7% for 1999 and 5.3% for 1998, b) expected volatility factor of .3, c)
dividend yield of 0.89% for 2000, 1.52% for 1999 and 0.91% for 1998, and d)
expected option life of four years for 2000 and 1999, and five years for 1998.
The average fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998 was $4.51, $4.16 and $5.23, respectively.

     The following table provides an analysis of stock option activity during

</TABLE>

     As of December 31, 2000, there were approximately 1.5 million options that
were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because to do
so would have been antidilutive. As part of a 1999 purchase agreement, up to
378,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock are to be issued if certain
conditions are met. Of these shares, 94,500 have been issued and 39,000 are
included in the 2000 computation because the contingency had been partially met.
The remainder of the contingent shares were not included in the earnings per
share computation because the conditions for issuance of the remaining shares
have not yet been met.

(15) STATUTORY INFORMATION

     The Company's insurance company subsidiaries file financial statements
prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or
permitted by domestic or foreign insurance regulatory authorities. The
differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP vary between domestic and foreign
jurisdictions. The principal differences are that for statutory financial
statements deferred policy acquisition costs are not recognized, deferred income
taxes are not recorded, bonds are generally carried at amortized cost, certain
assets are non-admitted and charged directly to surplus, a liability for a
provision for reinsurance is recorded and charged directly to surplus and
insurance assets and liabilities are presented net of reinsurance. The Company's
use of permitted statutory accounting practices does not have a significant
impact on statutory surplus. Statutory policyholders' surplus, and net income
for the three years ended December 31, 2000, after intercompany eliminations, of
the Company's insurance company subsidiaries included in those companies'
respective filings with regulatory authorities are as follows:

<PAGE>   76
                 HCC INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     Statutory policyholders' surplus has been adversely affected by statutory
adjustments for reinsurance recoverables which, although required statutorily,
have no effect on net earnings or shareholders' equity. The statutory net loss
for 1999 includes a $25.5 million loss, net of income tax, from the provision
for reinsurance.

     The National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted Statements of
Statutory Accounting Principles in March, 1998 as a product of its attempt to
codify statutory accounting principles. Although subject to adoption by the
individual states, an effective date of January 1, 2001 was established for
implementation of the statements. Prior to the codification project, a
comprehensive guide to statutory accounting principles did not exist.
Codification is new and will evolve over time. The cumulative effect of
codification is expected to increase statutory policyholders' surplus of the
Company's insurance company subsidiaries by approximately $6.0 million. The
Company expects that the statutory surplus of its insurance company subsidiaries
after adoption will continue to be in excess of their regulatory risk-based
capital requirements.

     The unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale, deferred
taxes related thereto and the issuance of the Company's Common Stock for the
purchase of subsidiaries are non-cash transactions which have been included as
direct increases or decreases in shareholders' equity. The cumulative effect of
accounting change due to the Company's adoption of SAB 101 is a non-cash charge
to earnings.

  Restructuring

     As of December 31, 1999, the Company had accrued two separate restructuring
liabilities, one relating to HCC's ongoing operations ("HCC Internal") and
another relating to HCC's acquisition of Centris. Changes in the accruals
between December 31, 1999 and December 31, 2000 are shown in the tables below:

</TABLE>

     During 2000, the Company determined that one of the leased offices
scheduled to be closed would be retained. Therefore, the Company reversed
$789,000 (included as a credit in other operating expenses) of the restructuring
expense recorded during the fourth quarter of 1999, of which $514,000 was the
reversal of the accrual for the future lease payments and $275,000 was the
reversal of the write down of certain assets.

</TABLE>

     The adjustments in 2000 were recorded as management decided to take
additional steps to integrate parts of the Centris operations.

     During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company also recorded a
restructuring charge and associated expenses of $1.5 million. A total of 26
employees were or will be terminated as a result of the Company's restructuring
of certain underwriting agency operations and their integration into the
Company's insurance company operations. The charges affected both segments and
consisted of $557,000 accrued severance pay to be paid at various times
throughout 2001 and $992,000 for the write down or write off of various impaired
assets, primarily redundant computer software.

     Restructuring charges of $761,000 in 2000 and $5.5 million in 1999 are
included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.

                 HCC INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     During 2000, the Company had net loss and LAE redundancy of $9.6 million
relating to prior year losses compared to a deficiency of $4.6 million in 1999
and a redundancy of $14.6 million in 1998. The deficiencies and redundancies in
the reserves result from the Company's and its actuaries' continued review of
its loss reserves and the increase or reduction of such reserves as losses are
finally settled and claims exposures are reduced. The Company believes it has
provided for all material net incurred losses.

     The Company has no material exposure to environmental pollution losses, as
HC only began writing business in 1981 and policies issued by HC normally
contain pollution exclusion clauses which limit pollution coverage to "sudden
and accidental" losses only, thus excluding intentional (dumping) and seepage
claims. Policies issued by AIC and USSIC, because of the types of risks
incurred, principally general aviation, are not considered to have significant
environmental exposures. Therefore, the Company should not experience any
material development in reserves from environmental pollution claims.

</TABLE>

     During 1999, pre-tax provisions for reinsurance of $29.5 million and $14.0
million were recorded in the second quarter and fourth quarter, respectively.
Also, during the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company recorded a pre-tax
restructuring expense of $5.5 million. During the fourth quarter of 2000, the
Company recorded a $4.4 million pre-tax increase in reserves of discontinued
lines of business that were part of the 1999 Centris acquisition and a $1.5
million in pre-tax restructuring expense. The sum of the quarters earnings
(loss) per share may not equal the annual amounts due to rounding. The net
earnings shown in the above table for the first quarter of 2000 do not match the
amount reported in the Form 10-Q filed with the SEC due to the cumulative effect
of the change in accounting principle subsequently recorded due to the Company's
adoption of SAB 101.

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is entered into
effective as of the 19th day of January, 2001 by and among HCC Insurance
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("HCC"), HCC Employee Benefits, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of HCC ("Merger Sub," Merger
Sub and HCC are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Purchasers");
James Scott Schanen ("Schanen"), Lisa Rae Schanen ("LRS"), Connor Schanen qsst
("Connor"), Austin Schanen qsst ("Austin") and Kevin Tolbert ("Tolbert")
(Schanen, LRS, Connor, Austin, and Tolbert being herein sometimes collectively
called the "Shareholders" or the "Sellers"); and Schanen Consulting Corporation,
a Georgia corporation ("SCC" which, unless the context otherwise requires,
includes its predecessor and subsidiary, The Schanen Consulting Group, LLC).
Sellers and Purchasers are sometimes referred to herein as the "Parties."

                                    RECITALS:

         A. The Boards of Directors of each of HCC, Merger Sub and SCC have
determined to engage in a transaction pursuant to which (i) SCC will merge with
and into Merger Sub (the "Merger") in accordance with the laws of the State of
Georgia and the State of Delaware and the provisions of this Agreement, (ii) at
the Effective Time (as defined herein) the capital stock of SCC (the "SCC Common
Stock") shall be converted into shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of HCC (the "HCC Common Stock") in the manner herein described, all upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

         B. The Board of Directors of SCC has approved and has resolved, subject
to the terms of this Agreement, to recommend that shareholders of SCC approve
the Merger, this Agreement and the Articles of Merger (as defined herein) in
accordance with Georgia law.

         C. The Board of Directors of HCC has approved the Merger, this
Agreement and the Articles of Merger. HCC, as the sole shareholder of Merger
Sub, has approved the Merger, this Agreement and the Articles of Merger in
accordance with Delaware law.

         D. The parties intend for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to qualify as a plan of reorganization in accordance with the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and to be accounted for as a "pooling-of-interests" for accounting
purposes.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:



                                      1
<PAGE>   6

                                  ARTICLE 1
                                 THE MERGER

         SECTION 1.1 THE MERGER.

         (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SCC will be
merged with and into Merger Sub in accordance with the laws of the State of
Georgia ("Georgia Law") and the laws of the State of Delaware ("Delaware Law"),
whereupon the separate existence of SCC shall cease, and Merger Sub shall be the
surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

         (b) As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, SCC and Merger Sub
shall (i) file articles of merger, in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit "A-1" (the "Articles of Merger"), in the Office of the Secretary of the
State of Georgia, and make all such other filings or recordings required by
Georgia Law and as required by the Georgia Business Corporation Act in
connection with the Merger and (ii) file a certificate of merger, in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit "A-2" (the "Certificate of
Merger"), in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and
make all such other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law and as
required by the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"). The Merger shall
become effective upon completion of the filing of the Articles of Merger with
the Office of the Secretary of the State of Georgia and the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the office of the Secretary of State of Delaware, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of Georgia Law or Delaware Law, as
applicable (the "Effective Time"). The date on which the Effective Time shall
occur is referred to herein as the "Effective Date."

         (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to all
of the restrictions, disabilities and duties of SCC and Merger Sub, all as
provided under Georgia Law or Delaware Law, as applicable. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time (i) all
the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, of a public as well
as of a private nature, and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all
debts due on whatever account, including without limitation subscriptions to
shares, and all other choses in action, and all and every other interest of or
belongings to or due to the Merger Sub or SCC shall be taken and deemed to be
transferred to, and vested in, the Surviving Corporation without further act or
deed; and all property, rights and privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises, and all and every other interest shall be thereafter as effectually
the property of the Surviving Corporation, as they were of Merger Sub and SCC,
and (ii) all debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of Merger Sub and SCC,
subject to the terms hereof, shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall thenceforth be
responsible and liable for all the debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of
Merger Sub and SCC, and neither the rights of creditors nor any liens upon the
property of Merger Sub or SCC shall be impaired by the Merger, and may be
enforced against the Surviving Corporation.

         SECTION 1.2 CONVERSION OF STOCK. At the Effective Time, each share of
SCC Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof cease to
be outstanding and be converted into the right to receive 797.44 shares of HCC
Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration").

         No fractional shares shall be issued and each holder of SCC Common
Stock shall be entitled to the nearest whole share of HCC Common Stock rounded
upwards if such fractional share exceeds 0.5 and otherwise rounded downwards,
provided, however, that HCC shall under no circumstances be obligated hereunder
to issue shares of HCC Common Stock in excess of an aggregate of 996,800 shares
of HCC Common Stock.

         Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be issued and
outstanding as one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

         SECTION 1.3 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

         (a) As of the Effective Time, all shares of SCC Common Stock other than
shares of SCC Common Stock held by Stockholders ("Dissenting Shareholders") duly
exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Georgia Law ("Dissenting Shares") that
are outstanding immediately prior thereto will, by virtue of the Merger and
without further action, cease to exist, and all such shares of SCC Common Stock
will be converted into the right to receive from HCC the number of shares of HCC
Common Stock determined as set forth in Section 1.2 hereof.

         (b) At and after the Effective Time, each certificate representing
outstanding shares of SCC Common Stock will represent the number of shares of
HCC Common Stock into which such shares of SCC Common Stock are converted and
such shares of HCC Common Stock will be deemed registered in the name of the
holder of such certificate. At the Effective Time, each holder of shares of SCC
Common Stock will surrender the certificates for such shares (the "SCC
Certificates") to HCC for cancellation. Promptly following the Effective Time
and receipt of the SCC Certificates, HCC will cause to be issued to such
surrendering holder certificates for the number of shares of HCC Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to the terms hereof. Shares of SCC Common
Stock held by Dissenting Shareholders shall thereafter represent the right to
require the Surviving Corporation to purchase such shares of SCC Common stock
for their "fair value" as determined in accordance with Georgia Law.

         (c) All shares of HCC Common Stock delivered upon the surrender of SCC
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof will be delivered to the
registered holder. After the Effective Time, there will be no further
registration of transfers of the shares of SCC Common Stock on the stock
transfer books of SCC. If, after the Effective Time, SCC Certificates are
presented for transfer or for any other reason, they will be canceled and
exchanged and certificates therefor will be delivered as provided for herein.



                                       3
<PAGE>   8
         (d) Until SCC Certificates representing SCC Common Stock outstanding
prior to the Merger are surrendered pursuant to this Section 1.3, such
certificates will be deemed, for all purposes, to evidence ownership of the
number of whole shares of HCC Common Stock into which the shares of SCC Common
Stock will have been converted.

         (e) If prior to the Merger, HCC recapitalizes either through a split-up
of its outstanding shares into a greater number, or through a combination of its
outstanding shares into a lesser number, or reorganizes, reclassifies or
otherwise changes its outstanding shares into the same or a different number of
shares of other classes, or declares a dividend on its outstanding shares
payable in shares or securities convertible into shares (but not cash), the
number of shares of HCC Common Stock into which the shares of SCC Common Stock
are to be converted will be adjusted in proportion to such change.

         SECTION 1.4 ESCROW. Pursuant to an Escrow Agreement to be entered into
on or before the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) in substantially the form
of Exhibit 1.4 (the "Escrow Agreement"), among HCC, each of the Shareholders and
First Union National Bank as escrow agent, HCC will withhold for a period of 36
months following the Closing Date, an amount equal to 10% of the Merger
Consideration (the "Escrow Amount"). On the Closing Date, HCC will deposit, or
cause to be deposited in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the number of
shares representing the Escrow Amount. The Escrow Amount shall be provided by
each of the Shareholders in an amount equal to 10% of the number of shares such
Shareholder will receive upon the consummation of the Merger. The Escrow Amount
will be held as collateral for the indemnification obligations of the
Shareholders pending its release from escrow in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.

         SECTION 1.5 DISSENTERS' RIGHTS. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall be
entitled to require SCC to purchase such Shareholders' shares for their "fair
value" as provided in Section 14-2-1302 of the Georgia Business Corporation
Code, SCC shall give HCC notice thereof, and HCC shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. Neither SCC nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except with the prior
written consent of HCC, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or offer
to settle, any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall fail
to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, the
shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder shall thereupon be entitled to be

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS

         Except as otherwise set forth with appropriate section references in
the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, each of which exception shall specifically
identify or cross reference to provisions of this Article 3 to which such
exception relates, and in order to induce Purchasers to enter into and perform
this Agreement, and the Operative Agreements (as herein defined) each of the
Sellers represent and warrant to Purchasers as of the date of this Agreement and
as of the Closing Date as follows:

         SECTION 3.1 CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND POWER. SCC is a corporation duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of the state of Georgia, and has
all corporate powers and all material governmental licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals (collectively, "Governmental Authorizations") required to
carry on its business as now conducted, except such Governmental Authorizations
the failure of which to have obtained would not have a Material Adverse Effect,
as hereinafter defined, on SCC. Sellers have delivered to Purchasers true and
complete copies of SCC's Articles or Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as
currently in effect. SCC is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of
the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on SCC. For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Material Adverse Effect," with respect to any person or entity, means a
material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), business,
properties, assets, liabilities (including contingent liabilities), results of
operations or prospects of such person or entity; provided, however, that a
Material Adverse Effect shall not include any change in general economic
conditions or changes that affect a person or entity's industry generally; and
"Material Adverse Change" means a change or a development involving a
prospective change which is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

         SECTION 3.2 AUTHORIZATION. Each Seller represents and warrants that
such Seller has full right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and
each other agreement to be entered into by such Seller in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Operative Agreements") and that this
Agreement and such Operative Agreements constitute, or upon execution will
constitute, valid and binding agreements of such Seller, enforceable against
such Seller in accordance with their respective terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency



                                       5
<PAGE>   10

or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally
or by general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding of equity or at law.

         SECTION 3.3 GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION. The execution, delivery and
performance by each of the Sellers of this Agreement and the Operative
Agreements, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder and
thereunder require no action by any of the Sellers or any filing by them with
any governmental body, agency, official or authority other than in respect of:

         (a) compliance with any applicable requirements of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder;

         (b) compliance with any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue
sky" laws;

         (c) compliance with any requirements of any federal, state, foreign or
other insurance or reinsurance or intermediaries, or agent or managing general
agent or third party administrators' laws, including licensing or other related
laws;

         (d) Compliance with any applicable requirements of the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE"); or

         (e) such other filings or registrations with, or authorizations,
consents or approvals of, governmental bodies, agencies, officials or
authorities, the failure of which to make or obtain (i) would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SCC, or (ii) would not materially
adversely affect the ability of either of SCC or Purchasers to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and to operate their businesses as heretofore
operated.

         SECTION 3.4 NON-CONTRAVENTION. The execution, delivery and performance
by each of the Sellers of this Agreement and the Operative Agreements, and the
consummation by each of the Sellers of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby do not and will not:

         (a) contravene or conflict with SCC's Articles or Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws;

         (b) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 3.3,
contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any
law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon or
applicable to the Sellers;

         (c) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of, or constitute
a default under, or result in a contractual right to cause the termination or
cancellation of or loss of



                                       6

a material benefit under, or right to accelerate, any material agreement,
contract or other instrument binding upon SCC or any material license,
franchise, permit or other similar authorization held by SCC;

         (d) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (as hereinafter
defined) on any material asset of SCC; or

         (e) invalidate or adversely affect any permit, license or authorization
or status used in connection with SCC's business;

except, with respect to clauses (b), (c) and (d) above, for contraventions,
defaults, losses, Liens and other matters referred to in such clauses that would
not be reasonably expected to have individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on SCC. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Lien" means,
with respect to any asset, any mortgage, lien, pledge, charge, security interest
or encumbrance of any kind in respect of such asset.

         SECTION 3.5 CAPITALIZATION.

         (a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of
SCC consists of 100,000 shares of a single class designated as common stock,
1,250 shares of which are issued and outstanding. All of such outstanding shares
are owned by the Shareholders free of any Liens or other encumbrances in the
amounts set forth on Schedule 3.5 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule.

         (b) All outstanding shares of SCC have been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and free from any preemptive rights.
Except as set forth in and as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, for SCC
there are outstanding (i) no shares of capital stock or other voting securities,
(ii) no securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its capital
stock or voting securities, (iii) no options or other rights to acquire, and no
obligation to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for its capital stock or other voting
securities (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this subsection (b)
being referred to collectively as the "SCC Securities"), (iv) no obligations to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any SCC Securities, and (v) no
contractual rights of any person or entity to include any SCC Securities in any
registration statement filed under the Securities Act.

<PAGE>   12
         SECTION 3.6 SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES.

         (a) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Subsidiary" means, with
respect to any entity, any corporation of which securities or other ownership
interests having ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of
directors or other persons performing similar functions are directly or
indirectly owned by such entity, and (ii) "Joint Venture" means, with respect to
any entity, any corporation or organization (other than such entity and any
Subsidiary thereof) of which such entity or any Subsidiary thereof is, directly
or indirectly, the beneficial owner of 25% or more of any class of equity
securities or equivalent profit participation interest.

         (b) As of the date hereof SCC owns all of the membership interests
("Interests") in The Schanen Consulting Group, LLC ("LLC") and no person or
entity is entitled to acquire any Interests in LLC nor are there any securities
exchangeable or convertible into such Interests, and LLC is not required to
redeem or repurchase any Interests. Except for such ownership of LLC, SCC does
not have any Subsidiary and is not a party to any Joint Venture.

         SECTION 3.7 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Sellers have delivered to Purchasers
the audited balance sheets as of December 31, 1999, and unaudited balance sheets
for December 31, 1998, and December 31, 1997, audited income statements for the
annual period ended December 31, 1999, and unaudited income statements for the
annual periods ending December 31, 1998, and December 31, 1997 and unaudited
balance sheets and income statements for the period as of or ending September
30, 2000 (collectively, the "Financial Statements"). For purposes of this
Agreement, the "Balance Sheet Date" shall mean December 31, 1999, unless the
Effective Date is later than January 30, 2001, in which case it shall mean
December 31, 2000. The Financial Statements present fairly in all material
respects, substantially in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied (except as indicated in the notes thereto), the
financial position of SCC as of the dates thereof and results of operations and
cash flows for the periods therein indicated (subject to normal year-end
adjustments in the case of any interim financial statements and the absence of
certain footnotes in the case of unaudited financial statements). SCC does not
have any material debt, liability or obligation of any nature, whether accrued,

reflected, reserved against or disclosed in the Financial Statements except for
(i) those that are not required to be reported in accordance with the aforesaid
accounting principles; (ii) normal or recurring liabilities incurred since
December 31, 1999 in the ordinary course of business or (iii) as disclosed in
the Sellers Disclosure Schedule.

         SECTION 3.8 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES. Since December 31, 1999, SCC
has in all material respects conducted its business in the ordinary course and
there has not been:

         (a) any Material Adverse Change with respect thereto or any event,
occurrence or development of a state of circumstances or facts known to any of
the



                                       8
<PAGE>   13

would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SCC;

         (f) any increase in indebtedness for borrowed money or capitalized
lease obligations of SCC, except in the ordinary course of business;

         (g) any sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of any tangible
or intangible asset material to the business of SCC, except in the ordinary
course of business and for a fair and adequate consideration;

         (h) any amendment, termination or waiver by SCC of any right of
substantial value under any agreement, contract or other written commitment to
which it is a party or by which it is bound which could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on SCC;

         (i) any material reduction in the amounts of coverage provided by
existing casualty and liability insurance policies with respect to the business
or properties of SCC;

         (j) any (i) grant of any severance or termination pay to any director,

agreement) with any director, officer or employee of SCC other than the
Non-Competition Agreements contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any increase in
benefits payable under any existing severance or termination pay policies or
employment agreements, or (iv) any increase in compensation, bonus or other

                                       9

financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999
(including the notes thereto) of SCC;

         (b) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice since December 31, 1999; or

         (c) liabilities under this Agreement or indicated in the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule.

         SECTION 3.10 ACCOUNTING MATTERS. Neither SCC nor any of the
Shareholders has taken or agreed to take any action that (without giving effect
to any action taken or agreed to be taken by HCC or any of its affiliates) would
prevent HCC from accounting for the business combination to be effected by the
Merger as a pooling-of-interests.

         SECTION 3.11 LITIGATION. Other than actions, suits, proceedings, claims
or investigations occurring in the ordinary course of business involving
respective amounts in controversy of less than $10,000 each and $20,000 in the

against, nor has SCC or any Seller received notice of a claim threatened against
SCC or any of its assets or against or involving any of its officers, directors
or employees in connection with the business or



                                       10
<PAGE>   15

affairs of SCC, including, without limitation, any such claims for
indemnification arising under any agreement to which SCC is a party. SCC has not
received notice that it is subject, or in default with respect, to any writ,
order, judgment, injunction or decree which could, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.12 TAXES.

         (a) SCC and LLC (i) have filed when due (taking into account
extensions) with the appropriate federal, state, local, foreign and other
governmental agencies, all tax returns, estimates and reports required to be
filed by it, (ii) either paid when due and payable or established adequate
reserves or otherwise accrued on the Financial Statements all federal. state,
local or foreign taxes, levies, imposts, duties, licenses and registration fees
and charges of any nature whatsoever, and unemployment and social security taxes
and income tax withholding, including interest and penalties thereon (each
individually a "Tax" and collectively the "Taxes") and there are no tax
deficiencies claimed in writing by any taxing authority that, in the aggregate,
would result in any tax liability in excess of the amount of the reserves or
accruals and (iii) has or will establish in accordance with its normal
accounting practices and procedures accruals and reserves that, in the
aggregate, are adequate for the payment of all Taxes not yet due and payable and
attributable to any period preceding the Effective Date. The Sellers Disclosure
Schedule sets forth those tax returns for all periods that currently are the
subject of audit or extension by any federal, state, local or foreign taxing
authority.

         (b) There are no Taxes, interest, penalties, assessments or
deficiencies claimed in writing by any taxing authority to be due in respect of
any tax returns filed by SCC (or any predecessor corporations). Neither SCC nor
any predecessor corporation or entity, has executed or filed with the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") or any other taxing authority any agreement or other
document extending, or having the effect of extending, the period of assessment
or collection of any Taxes.

         (c) SCC is not a party to nor bound by (or will prior to the Effective
Date become a party to or bound by) any Tax indemnity, Tax sharing or Tax

affiliated group or filed or been included in a combined, consolidated or
unitary Tax return.

         (d) SCC has maintained a valid S election pursuant to the Code since
its incorporation and there is no corporate income tax due from SCC.

         SECTION 3.13 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS, ERISA.

         (a) SCC is not a party to any oral or written (i) employment,
severance, collective bargaining or consulting agreement not terminable on 60
days' or less notice, (ii) agreement with any executive officer or other key
employee (A) the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which are
materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving SCC of the
nature of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) providing
any term of employment or compensation guarantee extending



                                       11
<PAGE>   16

for a period longer than one year, or (C) providing severance benefits or other
benefits after the termination of employment of such executive officer or key
employee regardless of the reason for such termination of employment, (iii)
agreement, plan or arrangement under which any person may receive payments
subject to the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or (iv) agreement or
plan, including, without limitation, any stock option plan, stock appreciation
right plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan, the benefits of which
would be increased, or the vesting of benefits of which will be accelerated, by
the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         (b) Neither SCC nor any corporation or other entity which under Section
4001(b) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"), is under common control with SCC (an "ERISA Affiliate") maintains or
within the past five years has maintained, contributed to, or been obligated to
contribute to, any "Employee Pension Benefit Plan" ("Pension Plan") or any
"Employee Welfare Benefit Plan" ("Welfare Plan") as such terms are defined in
Sections 3(2) and 3(l) respectively of ERISA, which is subject to ERISA, except
as described on Schedule 3.13(b). Each Pension Plan and Welfare Plan disclosed
in Schedule 3.13(b) and the Sellers Disclosure Schedule (which Plans have been
heretofore delivered to Purchasers) and maintained by SCC has been maintained in
all material respects in compliance with their terms and all provisions of ERISA
and the Code (including rules and regulations thereunder) applicable thereto.

         (c) No Pension Plan or Welfare Plan is currently subject to an audit or
other investigation by the IRS, the Department of Labor (the "DOL"), the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other governmental agency or office nor are
any such Plans subject to any lawsuits or legal proceedings of any kind or to
any material pending disputed claims by employees or beneficiaries covered under
any such Plan or by any other parties.

         (d) No "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, resulting in liability to SCC or any ERISA Affiliate
has occurred with respect to any Pension Plan or Welfare Plan. None of the
Sellers has any knowledge of any breach of fiduciary responsibility under Part 4
of Title I of ERISA which may result in liability of SCC or any ERISA Affiliate,
any trustee, administrator or fiduciary of any Pension Plan or Welfare Plan.

         (e) Neither SCC nor any ERISA Affiliate, since January 1, 1986, has
maintained or contributed to, or been obligated or required to contribute to, a
"Multiemployer Plan," as such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.
Neither SCC nor any ERISA Affiliate has either withdrawn, partially or
completely, or instituted steps to withdraw, partially or completely, from any
Multiemployer Plan nor has any event occurred which would enable a Multiemployer
Plan to give notice of and demand payment of any withdrawal liability with
respect to SCC or any ERISA Affiliate.



                                       12
<PAGE>   17
         (f) There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any
employee or former employee of SCC or any ERISA Affiliate that, individually or
collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
deductible pursuant to the terms of Sections 162(a)(1) or 280G of the Code.

         (g) With respect to either of SCC and each ERISA Affiliate. Schedule
3.13(b) and the Sellers Disclosure Schedule correctly identifies each material
agreement, policy, plan or other arrangement, whether written or oral, express
or implied, fixed or contingent, to which SCC is a party or by which SCC or any
property or asset of SCC is bound, which is or relates to a pension, option,
bonus, deferred compensation, retirement, stock purchase, profit-sharing,
severance pay, health, welfare, incentive, vacation, sick leave, medical
disability, hospitalization, life or other insurance or fringe benefit plan,
policy or arrangement. Each such agreement, policy, plan or other arrangement
has been maintained in all material respects in compliance with its terms and
all provisions of ERISA and the Code (including rules and regulations
thereunder) applicable thereto.

         (h) Neither SCC nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains or has maintained or
contributed to any Pension Plan that is or was subject to Section 302 of Title
IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Sellers have made available to
Purchasers, for each Pension Plan which is intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, a copy of the most recent determination
letter issued by the IRS to the effect that each such Plan is so qualified and
that each trust created thereunder is tax exempt under Section 501 of the Code,
and each of the Sellers is unaware of any fact or circumstances that would
jeopardize the qualified status of each such Pension Plan or the tax exempt
status of each trust created thereunder.

         (i) One or more of the benefit plans of SCC listed in the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule may be subject to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"). If so, each such plan has been
operated in, and is in compliance with COBRA. All notices required to be given
under COBRA have been timely and properly given in accordance with COBRA, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and no employee, former
employee or "qualified beneficiary" (as defined in COBRA) has any claim or
contingent claim against SCC or any ERISA Affiliate. SCC does not provide
retiree benefits of any kind, including health, medical, life, etc. and SCC has
not agreed to continue any employee benefits after termination of employment
other than COBRA.

         SECTION 3.14 MATERIAL AGREEMENTS.

         (a) The Sellers Disclosure Schedule includes a complete and accurate
list of all contracts, agreements, leases (other than Property Leases, as
hereinafter defined), and instruments to which SCC is a party or by which it or
its properties or assets are bound (1) which individually involve net payments
or receipts in excess of $10,000 per annum, inclusive of contracts entered into
with customers and suppliers in the ordinary course of business, or (2) that
pertain to employment or severance benefits for any officer, director or
employee of SCC, whether written or oral, but exclusive of contracts,
agreements,



                                       13
<PAGE>   18

leases and instruments terminable without penalty upon 60 days' or less prior
written notice to the other party or parties thereto, or (3) to which any of the
Shareholders is the opposing contracting party (the "Material Agreements").

         (b) Neither SCC nor, to the knowledge of any of the Sellers, any other
party is in default under any Material Agreement and no event has occurred which
(after notice or lapse of time or both) would become a breach or default under,
or would permit modification, cancellation, acceleration or termination of, any
Material Agreement or result in the creation of any security interest upon, or
any person obtaining any right to acquire, any properties, assets or rights of
SCC, which, in any such case, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         (c) To the knowledge of each of the Sellers, each such Material
Agreement is in full force and effect and is valid and legally binding and there
are no unresolved disputes involving or with respect to any Material Agreement.
No party to a Material Agreement has advised SCC that it intends either to
terminate a Material Agreement or to refuse to renew a Material Agreement upon
the expiration of the term thereof. No representation or warranty is made that
all benefits contemplated in the Material Agreements will be received.

         (d) SCC is not in violation of, or in default with respect to, any term
of its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.

         (e) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.14 of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule, SCC has no:

             (1) noncompetition agreement or other arrangement that would
         prevent SCC from carrying on its business anywhere in the world;

             (2) material dispute with any of its suppliers, customers, or
         distributors;

             (3) joint venture contracts, arrangements or any other agreement
         that involves the sharing of profits with any other person; or

             (4) agreements or commitments to provide indemnification.

         SECTION 3.15 PROPERTIES. SCC does not own any real estate, and all
leases of real property to which SCC is a party or by which it is bound
("Property Leases") are in full force and effect and are set forth in Sellers
Disclosure Schedule. There exists no default under such Property Leases, nor any
event (other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) which with
notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default thereunder. All of
the properties and assets which are owned by SCC are owned free and clear of any
Lien, except for Liens which do not have a Material Adverse Effect. SCC has good
and indefeasible title subject to no Liens, other than those permitted under
this Section 3.15, to all of the properties and assets necessary for the



                                       14
<PAGE>   19

conduct of its business other than to the extent that the failure to have such
title would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.16 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

         (a) For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the
following meanings:

             "Environmental Laws" shall mean any and all federal, state, local

Schanen or Tolbert shall not for any reason, within any of the markets in which
Employer or its affiliates has sold products or services or formulated a plan to
sell products or services into a market during the last twelve (12) months of

knowledge to any work which is competitive with or similar to a product,
process, apparatus, service, or development on which the person in question
worked or with respect to which such person had access to Confidential
Information while employed by Employer. Following the expiration of said three
(3) year period, Schanen and Tolbert each shall continue to be obligated under
the Confidential Information set forth in paragraph (d) of this Section not to
use or to disclose Confidential Information of Employer so long as it shall not

         (b) That for a period of three (3) years after their respective
Employment Termination, neither will solicit or accept any business from any
customer or client or prospective customer or client with whom he dealt or
solicited while employed by Employer.

         (c) For a period of three (3) years after their respective Employment
Termination, neither will either directly or indirectly, on his own behalf or on
behalf of others, solicit, attempt to hire, or hire any person employed by
Employer to work for him or for another entity, firm, corporation, or
individual.

         (d) Neither Schanen nor Tolbert will, except as Employer may otherwise
consent or direct in writing, reveal or disclose, sell, use, lecture upon,
publish or otherwise disclose to any third party any Confidential Information,
or authorize anyone else to do these things at any time either during or
subsequent to his employment. This paragraph shall continue in full force and
effect after termination of Schanen or Tolbert's employment. Schanen and
Tolbert's obligations under this paragraph with respect to any specific
Confidential Information shall cease when that specific portion of the
Confidential Information becomes publicly known, in its entirety and without
combining portions of such information obtained separately. It is understood
that such Confidential Information of Employer include matters that Schanen and
Tolbert conceive or develop, as well as matters Schanen and Tolbert learn from
other employees of Employer. Confidential Information is defined to include
information: (1) disclosed to or known by Schanen or Tolbert, as applicable, as
a consequence of or through his employment with SCC; (2) not generally known
outside of Employer; and (3) which relates to any aspect of Employer or its
business, finances, operation plans, budgets, research, or strategic

development. "Confidential Information" includes, but is not limited to
Employer's trade secrets, proprietary information, financial documents, long
range plans, customer lists, employer compensation, marketing strategy, existing
contracts and contractual forms and terms, data bases, costing data, computer
software developed by Employer, investments made by Employer, and any
information provided to Employer by a third party under restrictions against
disclosure or use by Employer or others.

         (e) Upon termination of his employment with Employer, Schanen or
Tolbert, if requested by Employer, shall reaffirm in writing his recognition of
the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of Employer's Confidential
Information and proprietary information, and reaffirm any other obligations set
forth in this Agreement.

         (f) Neither Schanen nor Tolbert has used or disclosed any Confidential
Information he may have obtained from Employer prior to signing this Agreement,
in any way inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement.

         (g) Any breach of paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) above cannot be remedied
solely by money damages, and that in addition to any other remedies Employer may
have, Employer shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against Schanen or
Tolbert, as the case may be. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed as
limiting Employer's right to pursue any other available remedy at law or in
equity, including recovery of damages.

         (h) In the event either of Schanen or Tolbert breaches paragraphs (a),
(b) or (c) of this Section, the restrictive time periods contained in those
provisions will be extended by the period of time he was in violation of such
provisions.

         (i) The agreements contained in this Section are independent of the
other agreements contained herein. Accordingly, failure of Employer to comply
with any of its obligations outside of this Section do not excuse Schanen and
Tolbert from complying with the agreements contained herein.

prior to the Effective Date:

         (a) By the mutual consent of the Shareholders and Purchasers.

         (b) By Purchasers or by the Shareholders if there has been a material
breach by the other of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, which in either case cannot be, or has not been, cured within 15 days

breach, provided that the right to effect such cure shall not extend beyond the
date set forth in subparagraph (c) below.

         SECTION 10.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. Each Party's right of termination
under Section 10.1 is in addition to any other rights it may have under this

10.1, all further obligations of the Parties under this Agreement will terminate
except that the obligations in Section 7.7, Section 13.3, Section 13.5, Section
13.6 and Section 13.11 will survive; provided, however, that if this Agreement

Party or because one or more of the conditions to the terminating Party's
obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the other
Party's failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, the
terminating Party's right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such
termination unimpaired.

                          INDEMNIFICATION AND REMEDIES

         SECTION 12.1 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SHAREHOLDERS. Each
Shareholder, jointly and severally (the "Indemnifying Parties") to the extent
hereinafter set forth, covenants and agrees to indemnify, defend, protect and
hold harmless HCC, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation and their respective
officers, directors, employees, shareholders, members, assigns, successors and
affiliates (individually, an "Indemnified Party" and collectively, "Indemnified
Parties") from, against and in respect of:

         (a) all liabilities, losses, claims, damages, punitive damages, causes
of action, lawsuits, administrative proceedings (including informal
proceedings), investigations, audits, demands, assessments, adjustments,
judgments, settlement payments, deficiencies, penalties, fines, interest
(including interest from the date of such damages) and costs and expenses
(including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements of
every kind, nature and description) (collectively, "Damages") suffered,
sustained, incurred or paid by the Indemnified Parties in connection with,
resulting from or arising out of, directly or indirectly:

             (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of SCC or the
         Shareholders set forth in this Agreement or any schedule or
         certificate, delivered by or on behalf of SCC or the Shareholders in
         connection herewith; or

             (ii) any nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement by the
         Shareholders, or, prior to the Effective Time, SCC, under this
         Agreement; or

             (iii) the business, operations or assets of SCC prior to the
         Closing Date or the actions or omissions of SCC's officers, employees
         or agents prior to the Closing Date; or



                                       36
<PAGE>   41
             (iv) the matters disclosed on the Disclosure Schedule or the
         nonfulfillment of any representation, covenant or agreement described
         in Section 3.5, Section 3.6, Section 3.10, Section 3.12 or Section
         3.13; or

             (v) the failure of SCC or any Shareholder to obtain any necessary
         consent relating to the leasing by SCC of the leasehold property
         utilized by SCC; or

             (vi) fraud; and

         (b) any and all Damages incident to any of the foregoing or to the
enforcement of this Section 12.1; and

         (c) all representations, warranties, covenants and obligations in this
Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, the supplements to the Disclosure
Schedules, the certificates delivered pursuant to this Agreement and any other
certificate or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive the
Closing. The right to indemnification, payment of Damages or other remedies
based on such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations will not be
affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to
the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Damages or other remedies based on such
representation, warranties, covenants and obligations.

         SECTION 12.2 LIMITATION AND EXPIRATION. Notwithstanding the above:

         (a) (i) there shall be no liability for indemnification under Section
12.1 unless the aggregate amount of Damages exceeds $100,000 (the "Franchise
Deductible"); provided, however, if Damages exceed the Franchise Deductible, the
Indemnifying Persons shall be liable for all such Damages and (ii) provided,
further that the Franchise Deductible shall not apply to Damages arising out of
any breaches of the covenants of the Shareholders set forth in this Agreement or
representations and warranties made in Section 3.1, Section 3.5, Section 3.6,
Section 3.10 or Section 3.12 or for fraud (the "Deductible Exclusions");

         (b) the aggregate amount of any Shareholders' liability under this
Article 12 except for matters referred to as Deductible Exclusions shall not
exceed an amount equal to the Merger Consideration valued at the Closing Date
Price, defined below and received by such Shareholder;

         (c) the indemnification obligations under this Article 12, or under any
certificate or writing furnished in connection herewith, shall terminate at the
date that is the later of clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 12.2(c):



                                       37
<PAGE>   42
                  (i) (1) with respect to claims relating to or arising out of
         (i) any Taxes arising out of or relating to the business of SCC; or
         (ii) any taxes arising out of the payment of salaries, wages, bonuses,
         commissions, distributions or the granting of options or stock to any
         shareholder during their entire term as an employee, whether a
         shareholder at the time of payment or not; (iii) any taxes arising out
         of the reorganization of the shareholdings or the reorganization of the
         structure of the entities prior to the Closing Date; or (iv) the
         irrevocable assignment of all commissions, fees or other amounts due to
         SCC; or (v) any damages or expenses arising from or related to the
         claims alleged by Dr. Arun Misra against Tolbert, SCC or any other
         employee or shareholder of SCC: (A) the date that is six (6) months
         after the expiration of the longest applicable federal or state statute
         of limitation (including extensions thereof), or (B) if there is no
         applicable statute of limitation, ten (10) years after the Closing
         Date; or

                       (2) with respect to claims other than those specified in
         clause (i)(1) of this Section 12.2(c) that are of a nature and of
         sufficient materiality typically expected to be encountered in the
         audit process, on the completion of the first independent audit of the
         financial statements of the combined operations of HCC and SCC; or

                       (3) with respect to all claims other than those referred
         to in clause (i)(1) or (2) of this Section 12.2(c), twelve (12) months
         after the Effective Time; or

                  (ii) the final resolution of claims or demands pending as of
         the relevant dates described in clause (i) of this Section 12.2(c)
         (such claims referred to as "Pending Claims") and Possible Claims. For
         purposes of this Agreement, a Possible Claim shall be one in which an
         Indemnified Party has notified the Indemnifying Party that a possible
         claim or demand may be made against the Indemnified Party for which
         indemnification under this Article 12, might be applicable, provided,
         however, that a Possible Claim, which has not become a Pending Claim,
         shall not extend the term of the Escrow Agreement beyond the Escrow
         Agreement's termination date by more than three (3) months.

         SECTION 12.3 AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article 12 and except as set forth in Section 12.2, each
Shareholder shall be liable severally and Pro Rata (as hereinafter defined)
(hereafter in this Section 12.3 referred to as "HCC Damages"). "Pro Rata" for
purposes of Section 12.1 and Section 12.2 with respect to each Shareholder shall
mean the proportion that such Shareholder's holdings of SCC Common Stock as of
the time immediately prior to the Effective Time bears to the total shares of
SCC Common Stock held by all Shareholders as of the time immediately prior to
the Effective Time. In seeking indemnification for HCC Damages under this
Article 12 following the Closing, the Indemnified Persons' remedy will be
limited to receiving up to that number of shares of HCC Common Stock determined
by dividing (a) the amount of the HCC Damages by (b) the closing sale price of
HCC's Common




                                       38
<PAGE>   43

Stock on the NYSE on the Effective Date (the "Closing Date Price"). Provided,
however, that irrespective as to the number of claims asserted by Indemnified
Persons hereunder and the amount of the HCC Damages for which indemnification is
sought, any such Shareholder, in the aggregate, shall under no circumstances be
required to make indemnification payments hereunder beyond the Closing Date
Price multiplied by the number of shares of HCC Common Stock received by such
Shareholder at the time of the Merger (the "Maximum Shareholder Liability").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in the event that at
the time of the resolution of any such indemnification claim, such Shareholder
does not hold the number of shares of HCC Common Stock (including any shares
otherwise acquired at any time before or after the Effective Time or at any time
after any claim is made for indemnification) necessary to settle any
indemnification claim, then such Shareholder shall pay in cash or other
immediately available funds the cash equivalent of the remainder of his in-stock
indemnification obligations under this Section 12.3 up to his Maximum
Shareholder Liability. In lieu of HCC Common Stock, any Shareholder shall have
the option to pay in cash or other immediately available funds the cash
equivalent of all or any part of his in-stock Maximum Shareholder Liability.

         SECTION 12.4 HCC AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article 12, HCC will indemnify and hold harmless SCC, and the SCC
Shareholders and their officers, shareholders, directors, administrators,
successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, demands, actions,
causes of action, losses, costs, damages, liabilities and expenses including,
without limitation, reasonable legal fees, (hereafter in this Section 12.4
referred to as "SCC Damages") arising out of any misrepresentation or breach of
or default under any of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements given or made by HCC or Merger Sub in this Agreement or any
certificate or exhibit delivered by or on behalf of HCC or Merger Sub pursuant
hereto. In seeking indemnification for SCC Damages under this Section 12.4
following the Closing, the Indemnified Party's remedy will be limited to
receiving that number of additional shares of HCC Common Stock determined by
dividing (a) the amount of the SCC Damages by (b) the Closing Date Price.
Provided, however, that irrespective of the number of claims asserted by
Indemnified Persons hereunder in the amount of the SCC Damages for which
indemnification is sought, HCC, in the aggregate, shall under no circumstances
be obligated to make an indemnification payment hereunder beyond that number of
additional shares of HCC Common Stock equal to the total number of shares of HCC
Common Stock provided to the SCC Shareholders on the Effective Date (the
"Maximum HCC Liability"). The indemnification provided for in this Section 12.4
will not apply unless and until the aggregate SCC Damages for which one or more
Indemnified Party seeks indemnification exceeds $100,000 in the aggregate, in
which event the indemnification provided for will include all SCC Damages (a
Franchise Deductible) up to the Maximum HCC Liability. The Franchise Deductible
and Maximum HCC Liability shall not apply to damages arising from fraud.

         SECTION 12.5 PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION; THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

         (a) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party under this Article
12 of notice of a claim or if the Indemnified Party believes it is or could be
entitled to indemnification under this Article 12 (collectively a "Claim"), the
Indemnified Party will, if a claim is to be made against an Indemnifying Party,
give prompt written notice to the Indemnifying Party of the Claim, but the
failure to promptly notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any Liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense
of such action is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to give such
prompt notice. Such notice shall contain a description in reasonable detail of
facts upon which such Claim is based and, to the extent known, the amount
thereof. Such notice shall serve to preserve the Indemnified Party's claim for
indemnity against the Indemnifying Party without regard to the expiration of the
time periods set forth in Section 12.2 hereof.

         (b) If any Claim referred to in this Article 12 is made by a third
party against an Indemnified Party and such Indemnified Party gives written
notice to the Indemnifying Party of the Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be
entitled to participate in the defense of Claim but under all circumstances HCC
shall be entitled to assume the defense of the Claim and, thereafter, if HCC has
so assumed the defense, no other Party hereto will be liable under this Article
12 for any fees of counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of
the Claim in each case subsequently incurred in connection with the defense of
the Claim unless such other Party elects to retain its separate counsel. If HCC
is not the Indemnifying Party and elects, in writing, not to assume the defense,
the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense and HCC will not be liable for
any fees or expenses with respect to the defense of the Claim, unless HCC elects
to retain its separate counsel.

         SECTION 12.6 LIMITATION ON LIABILITY. It is a fundamental point of
mutual agreement among all Parties hereto that the Parties' liability for and in
respect of this Agreement and the Merger shall, except for matters relating to
Deductible Exclusions, be limited to the absolute, fixed dollar amounts and for
the absolute, fixed time limitations specified in this Article 12. These
limitations of amount of liability and time to assert any such liability shall
apply to all claims and other demands, charges, allegations, liabilities,
responsibilities, exposures and the like.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 13.1 APPOINTMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE. Subject to the
successorship provisions of this Section 13.1, Schanen (the "Representative") is
hereby irrevocably appointed as the attorney-in-fact and representative of the
interests of the Shareholders for all purposes of this Agreement, and notice is
hereby given thereof to HCC and Merger Sub, and, without independent
verification, HCC and Merger Sub may rely upon Representative's undertakings in
such capacity. The Representative shall have full and irrevocable authority on
behalf of the Shareholders, and shall promptly and completely exercise such
authority in a timely fashion to:

         (a) participate in, represent and bind the Shareholders in all respects
with respect to any arbitration or legal proceeding relating to this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the defense and settlement of any matter, and the
calculation thereof for every purpose thereunder, consent to jurisdiction, enter
into any settlement, and consent to entry of judgment, each with respect to any
or all of the Shareholders;

         (b) receive, accept and give notices and other communications relating
to this Agreement;

         (c) take any action that the Representative deems necessary or
desirable in order to fully effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

         (d) execute and deliver any instrument or document that the
Representative deems necessary or desirable in the exercise of his authority
under this Section 13.1; and

         (e) waive the fulfillment of any condition or conditions to the
Closing.

         Those Shareholders who, as of the Effective Date, hold a majority of
the SCC Common Stock may, at any time and by written action delivered to HCC,
remove the Representative or any successor thereto, but such removal shall be
effective only upon the replacement of such Representative or successor by a new
Representative designated, by written notice delivered to HCC, by those
Shareholders who, as of the date hereof hold a majority of SCC Common Stock,
provided, however, that any such notice shall be effective upon actual receipt
by HCC. Any such written notice shall be delivered to HCC in accordance with the
notice provisions set forth in Section 13.4 hereof. If any Representative shall
have died, become Disabled or unable to serve, those Shareholders who, as of the
date hereof, hold a majority of SCC Common Stock shall promptly designate by
written notice delivered to HCC, a replacement Representative. Any costs and
expenses incurred by the Representative in connection with actions taken
pursuant to or permitted by this Section 13.1 will be borne by the Shareholders
and paid or reimbursed to the Representative Pro Rata.

         The foregoing authorization is granted and conferred in consideration
for the various agreements and covenants of HCC and Merger Sub contained herein.
In



                                       41
<PAGE>   46

consideration of the foregoing, and subject to the successorship provisions of
this Section 13.1, this authorization granted to the Representative shall be
irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any of the Shareholders or
by operation of law, whether by death or incompetence of any Shareholder or by
the occurrence of any other event except the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1 hereof. If after the execution hereof any such
Shareholder shall die or become incompetent, the Representative is nevertheless
authorized and directed to exercise the authority granted in this Section 13.1
as if such death or incompetence had not occurred and regardless of notice
thereof. The Representative shall have no liability to any Shareholder for any
act or omission or obligation hereunder, provided that such action or omission
is taken by the Representative in good faith and without willful misconduct.

         SECTION 13.2 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each party agrees to cooperate fully
with the other parties and to execute such further instruments, documents and
agreements and to give such further written assurances as may be reasonably
requested by any other party to better evidence and reflect the transactions
described herein and contemplated hereby and to carry into effect the intents
and purposes of this Agreement.

         SECTION 13.3 FEES AND EXPENSES. Until otherwise agreed by the parties,
each party shall bear its own fees and expenses, including counsel fees and fees
of brokers and investment bankers contracted by such party, in connection with
the transaction contemplated hereby.

         SECTION 13.4 NOTICES. Whenever any party hereto desires or is required
to give any notice, demand, or request with respect to this Agreement, each such
communication shall be in writing and shall be effective only if it is delivered
by personal service or mailed, United States registered or certified mail,

         SECTION 13.5 GOVERNING LAW. The internal laws of the State of Texas
(irrespective of its choice of law principles) will govern the validity of this
Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the interpretation and enforcement
of the rights and duties of the parties hereto. Any dispute arising hereunder
shall lie exclusively in the state courts of the State of Texas, or in the
Federal courts sitting in Harris County, Texas.

         SECTION 13.6 BINDING UPON SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, ASSIGNMENT. This
Agreement and the provisions hereof shall be binding upon each of the parties,
their permitted successors and assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by
any party without the prior consent of the others, provided, however, that HCC

assignment of Merger Sub's rights and obligations under this Agreement to
another wholly-owned Subsidiary of HCC (without in any way relieving HCC of its
obligations under this Agreement with respect to Merger Sub or the Merger).

         SECTION 13.7 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, shall for any reason or to any extent be invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and application of such provision
to other persons or circumstances shall continue in full force and effect and in
no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

         SECTION 13.8 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the Operative
Agreements and instruments referenced herein constitute the entire understanding

<PAGE>   48

agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede
all prior and contemporaneous agreements or understandings, inducements or
conditions, express or implied, written or oral, between parties with respect
hereto.

         SECTION 13.9 AMENDMENT AND WAIVERS. Any amendment or waiver affecting
the Shareholders shall be valid if consented to in writing by the Representative
or Shareholders holding a majority of the shares of SCC Common Stock (i) if
given or made prior to the Effective Time, such majority as determined as of the
date of such amendment or waiver, and (ii) if given or made at or after the
Effective Time, such majority as determined immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be amended, and the observance
of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular
instance and either retroactively or prospectively) only by a writing signed by
those persons as provided in this Section 13.9. The waiver by a party of any
breach hereof or default in the performance hereof shall not be deemed to
constitute a waiver of any other default or any succeeding breach or default,
unless such waiver so expressly states. At any time before the Effective Time,
this Agreement may be amended or supplemented by SCC, the Shareholders or HCC
with respect to any of the terms contained in this Agreement.

         SECTION 13.10 NO WAIVER. The failure of any party to enforce any of the
provisions hereof shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such
party thereafter to enforce such provisions.

         SECTION 13.11 CONSTRUCTION OF AGREEMENT. A reference to an Article,
Section or an Exhibit shall mean an Article of, a Section in, or Exhibit to,
this Agreement unless otherwise explicitly set forth. The titles and headings
herein are for reference purposes only and shall not in any manner limit the
construction of this Agreement which shall be considered as a whole. The words
"include," and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be
followed by the words "without limitation." No Party shall be deemed to have
prepared this Agreement for purpose of aiding in the construction thereof.

         SECTION 13.12 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original as against any Party
whose signature appears thereon and all of which together shall constitute one

counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the signatures

Attention: General Counsel
Fax (713) 744-9647

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         The undersigned proposes to sell an aggregate of ______ shares of the
common stock, $1.00 par value per share, (the "Stock") of HCC Insurance
Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") through ___________(the "Broker") in accordance
with the requirements of Rule 144, as amended ("Rule 144") promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). The undersigned hereby requests
that the restrictive legends now appearing upon certificates representing the
Stock owned beneficially and of record by the undersigned be removed and that
the stop transfer instructions to the Company's transfer agent (the "Transfer
Agent") with respect to the Stock be rescinded, in accordance with and pursuant
to Rule 144. It is understood, however that legends will only be removed and
instructions rescinded in order to effect the transfer of Stock already sold in
compliance with Rules 144 (the "Sale Shares") and after confirmation of this
fact is received from the Broker who has executed my order to sell the Stock.

         In addition, if required by such Transfer Agent, the undersigned
requests that your attorneys provide to the Transfer Agent a written opinion of
counsel (the "Opinion"), confirming that the Sale Shares may be transferred
without restriction to the purchaser(s) thereof in reliance upon Rule 144 and
that any stop transfer instructions with respect to the Sale Shares may be
removed.

         In support of this request and in consideration for the removal of such
legends and rescission of such instructions to effect transfers after sales have
been made in compliance with Rule 144, and in order to permit your attorneys to
render the Opinion, the undersigned hereby represents, warrants and agrees with
the Company and your attorneys who furnish the Opinion as follows:

1.       Attached hereto is a fully completed and manually signed copy of a
         Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities Pursuant to Rule 144 ("Form 144")
         with respect to the sale of the Stock. As set forth on Form 144, the
         undersigned has been the beneficial owner of the Stock for a period of
         at least one (1) year prior to the date hereof as computed in
         accordance with paragraph (d) of Rule




<PAGE>   53

         144. The Stock was acquired by the undersigned in one or more
         transactions not involving a public offering.

2.       At the time of any sale of the Stock for the undersigned, the aggregate
         number of shares of the Company's common stock that are restricted
         securities, as defined in Rule 144(a)(3), sold by the undersigned or
         for the undersigned's account and by or for the account of any person
         whose sales are required by paragraph (a)(2) and paragraph (e)(3) of
         Rule 144, to be aggregated with sales by or for it (other than shares
         registered under the Act or sold in private placement or Regulation A
         transactions) will not exceed the amounts permitted under Rule 144(e).

3.       The undersigned represents and warrants that the undersigned is not
         acting in concert with any other person, firm or entity in connection
         with the sales contemplated herein.

4.       The undersigned agrees that the Stock will only be sold in "brokers'
         transactions" within the meaning of Section 4(4) of the Act and the
         rules and regulations thereunder and otherwise in compliance with Rule
         144. The undersigned has not solicited or arranged for the solicitation
         of, and will not solicit or arrange for the solicitation of, orders to
         buy the Stock in anticipation of or in connection with such proposed
         sale; and such sale or sales shall be made in transactions contemplated
         by paragraph (f) under Rule 144. The undersigned has no sell orders
         open in the Stock, or in any security convertible into the Stock with
         any other broker or bank and will not place any such sell orders
         pending the completion of this transaction. The undersigned has no
         present intention of selling any additional securities of the same
         class as the Stock or any securities convertible into the same class as
         the Stock. The undersigned has not made, and will not make, any payment
         in connection with the offering or sale of the Stock to any person,
         other than the usual and customary broker's commission paid to the
         Broker in connection therewith.

5.       Concurrently with the placing with the Broker of an order to sell the
         Stock in reliance upon Rule 144, the undersigned will (i) mail or
         transmit to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), 450
         Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, three fully completed

         such securities are admitted to trading; (iii) mail or deliver to the
         Company and the Broker a manually signed copy of the Form 144 as sent
         to the SEC; and (iv) if all of the Stock for which the Form 144 is
         filed are not sold within ninety (90) days thereafter, to mail three
         copies of an amended and signed Form 144, one copy of which has been
         manually signed to the SEC, one manually signed copy of the amended
         Form 144 to any exchange as set forth in subsection (ii) hereof and one
         manually signed copy of amended Form 144 to the Company and the Broker

         such reports) and (ii) has been subject to the such filing requirements
         for the past ninety (90) days. The undersigned does not know of have
         any reason to believe that the Company has not complied with the
         reporting requirements referred to in Rule 144(c)(1). The IRS
         identification number and the SEC file number set forth on the attached
         Form 144 have been supplied by the Company and the Company has informed

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

         This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is entered into as of the 5th
day of January, 2000 (the "Effective Date"), between HOUSTON CASUALTY COMPANY
("HC" or "Company"), and BENJAMIN D. WILCOX ("Executive"), sometimes
collectively referred to herein as the "Parties."

                                    RECITALS:

         WHEREAS, Executive is to be employed as President of and Chief
Executive Officer of HC and Senior Vice President of HCC Insurance Holdings,
Inc. ("HCC");

         WHEREAS, it is the desire of the Boards of Directors of HC (the
"Board") and HCC to (i) directly engage Executive as an officer of HC and its
subsidiaries; and (ii) directly engage, if elected, the services of Executive as
a director of HC and its subsidiaries;

         WHEREAS, Executive is desirous of committing himself to serve HC and
HCC on the terms herein provided; and

         WHEREAS, Executive and HC have previously entered into an Employment
Agreement effective as of December 7, 1998 (the "1998 Contract") which is to be
cancelled, terminated and of no further force or effect.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the respective
covenants and agreements set forth below, the Parties agree as follows:

         1. TERMINATION OF 1998 CONTRACT AND TERM. Effective as of the Effective

Effective Date and expiring as of 11:59 p.m. on December 31, 2002 (the "Basic
Term") (unless sooner terminated as hereinafter set forth).

         2. DUTIES.

             (a) DUTIES AS EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY. Executive shall, subject to
the supervision of the Chairman of the Board and President of HCC, have general
management and control of HC, and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of its
business with all such powers with respect to such management and control as may
be reasonably incident to such responsibilities. During normal business hours,

the business of the Company during the Basic Term. During the Basic Term,
Executive shall not directly or indirectly render any services of a business,
commercial, or professional nature to any other person, firm, corporation, or
organization, whether for compensation or otherwise,





<PAGE>   2

without the prior written consent of the Chairman of the Board. However,
Executive shall have the right to engage in such activities as may be
appropriate in order to manage his personal investments so long as such
activities do not materially interfere or conflict with the performance of his
duties to the Company hereunder. The conduct of such activity shall not be
deemed to materially interfere or conflict with Executive's performance of his
duties until Executive has been notified in writing thereof and given a
reasonable period in which to cure the same.

             (b) OTHER DUTIES. Executive agrees to serve on the Senior
Management Committee of HCC and as a Director of HC and its subsidiaries,
provided Executive is indemnified for serving in any and all such capacities in
a manner acceptable to the Company and Executive. If elected, Executive agrees
that he shall not be entitled to receive any additional compensation for serving
as a director other than the compensation to be paid to Executive by the Company
pursuant to this Agreement.

        3. COMPENSATION AND RELATED MATTERS.

             (a) BASE SALARY. From the Effective Date until December 31, 2000,
Executive shall receive a base salary equal to $315,000, payable not less
frequently than in substantially equal monthly installments. The base salary
shall be increased by $15,000 on each of January 1, 2001 and 2002. For purposes
of this Agreement, "Base Salary" shall mean the Executive's initial base salary
and, when increased, the increased base salary.

             (b) BONUS PAYMENTS. Each year Executive shall be entitled to
receive, in addition to the Base Salary, an annual bonus payment effective as of
December 7, 2000, at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of HCC,
but not less than $50,000 per year.

             (c) STOCK OPTIONS. In addition to the options previously provided
to Executive to purchase 100,000 shares of HCC Common Stock at a price per share
equal to $16-15/16, the terms of which shall remain in effect, Executive shall
be provided additional stock options pursuant to the terms set forth on Exhibit
A attached hereto.

             (d) EXPENSES. During the Basic Term, Executive shall be entitled to
receive prompt reimbursement for all reasonable expenses incurred by him in
accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Compensation
Committee for the Company's senior executive officers in performing services
hereunder, provided that Executive properly accounts therefor in accordance with
Company policy.

             (e) OTHER BENEFITS. Executive shall be entitled to participate in
or receive benefits under any compensatory employee benefit plan or other
arrangement made available by the Company now or in the future to its senior
executive officers and key management employees, subject to and on a basis
consistent with the terms, conditions, and overall administration of such plan
or arrangement. Nothing paid to Executive under any plan or arrangement
presently in effect or made available in the future shall be deemed to be in
lieu of the Base Salary payable to Executive






                                       2
<PAGE>   3



pursuant to Paragraph (a) of this Section. The Company shall not make any
changes in any employee benefit plans or other arrangements in effect on the
date hereof or subsequently in effect in which Executive currently or in the
future participates (including, without limitation, each pension and retirement
plan, supplemental pension and retirement plan, savings and profit sharing plan,
stock or unit ownership plan, stock or unit purchase plan, stock or unit option
plan, life insurance plan, medical insurance plan, disability plan, dental plan,
health and accident plan, or any other similar plan or arrangement) that would
adversely affect Executive's rights or benefits thereunder, unless such change
occurs pursuant to a program applicable to substantially all executives of the
Company and does not result in a proportionately greater reduction in the rights
of or benefits to Executive as compared with any other executive of the Company.

             (f) VACATIONS. Executive shall be entitled to twenty (20) paid
vacation days per year during the Basic Term. There shall be no carryover of
unused vacation from year to year. For purposes of this Paragraph, weekends
shall not count as vacation days, and Executive shall also be entitled to all
paid holidays and personal days given by the Company to its senior executive
officers.

             (g) PERQUISITES. Executive shall be entitled to receive the
perquisites and fringe benefits appertaining to an executive officer of HC in

Notwithstanding, and in addition to, any perquisites to which Executive is
entitled pursuant to the preceding sentence, Executive shall: (i) have a car
allowance of $1,250 per month; (ii) be allowed to travel on business utilizing
first class domestic passage and business class international passage (and, upon
approval of the Chief Executive Officer, will be entitled to travel with
Executive's spouse); (iii) receive annual country club dues at the Lochinvar
Golf and the Bayou Clubs; and (iv) receive a total of $1,000,000 life insurance
(either term or "split dollar" in HC's discretion), which shall be in addition
to the standard benefits provided to the Executive under the Company's or HCC's
group life insurance programs that covers officers.

             (h) PRORATION. Any payments or benefits payable to Executive
hereunder in respect of any calendar year during which Executive is employed by
the Company for less than the entire year, unless otherwise provided in the
applicable plan or arrangement, shall be prorated in accordance with the number
of days in such calendar year during which he is so employed. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any payments pursuant to Paragraphs 4(c) or 4(d) of this
Agreement shall not be subject to proration.

        4. TERMINATION.

             (a) DEFINITIONS.

                   (1) "CAUSE" shall mean:

                       (i) Material dishonesty which is not the result of an
         inadvertent or innocent mistake of Executive with respect to the
         Company or any of its subsidiaries;

<PAGE>   4

                       (ii) Willful misfeasance or nonfeasance of duty by
         Executive intended to injure or having the effect of injuring in some
         material fashion the reputation, business, or business relationships of
         the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
         officers, directors, or employees;

                       (iii) Material violation by Executive of any material
         term of this Agreement; or

                       (iv) Conviction of Executive of any felony, any crime
         involving moral turpitude or any crime other than a vehicular offense
         which could reflect in some material fashion unfavorably upon the
         Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Executive may not be terminated for Cause unless and until there has been
delivered to Executive written notice from the Board supplying the particulars
of Executive's acts or omissions that the Board believes constitute Cause, a
reasonable period of time (not less than 30 days) has been given to Executive
after such notice to either cure the same or to meet with the Board, with his
attorney if so desired by Executive, and following which the Board by action of
not less than two-thirds of its members furnishes to Executive a written
resolution specifying in detail its findings that Executive has been terminated
for Cause as of the date set forth in the notice to Executive.

                   (2) A "CHANGE OF CONTROL" shall be deemed to have occurred

                       (i) Any "person" or "group" (within the meaning of
         Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)
         other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an
         employee benefit plan of the Company becomes the "beneficial owner" (as
         defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934),
         directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of the Company's then
         outstanding voting common stock; or

                       (ii) At any time during the period of three (3)
         consecutive years (not including any period prior to the date hereof),
         individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board
         (and any new director whose election by the Board or whose nomination
         for election by the Company's shareholders were approved by a vote of
         at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who either
         were directors at the beginning of such period or whose election or
         nomination for election was previously so approved) cease for any
         reason to constitute a majority thereof; or

                       (iii) The shareholders of the Company approve a merger or
         consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a
         merger or consolidation (a) in which a majority of the directors of the
         surviving entity were directors of the Company prior to such
         consolidation or merger, and (b) which would result in the voting
         securities of the




                                       4
<PAGE>   5


         Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent
         (either by remaining outstanding or by being changed into voting
         securities of the surviving entity) more than 50% of the combined
         voting power of the voting securities of the surviving entity
         outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; or

                       (iv) The shareholders approve a plan of complete
         liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition
         by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets.

                   (3) A "DISABILITY" shall mean the absence of Executive from
Executive's duties with the Company on a full-time basis for 180 consecutive
days, or 180 days in a 365-day period, as a result of incapacity due to mental
or physical illness which results in the Executive being unable to perform the
essential functions of his position, with or without reasonable accommodation.

                   (4) A "GOOD REASON" shall mean any of the following (without
Executive's express written consent):

                       (i) Following a Change of Control, a material alteration

         inconsistent with Executive's status, title, duties and
         responsibilities;

                       (ii) A failure by the Company to continue in effect any
         employee benefit plan in which Executive was participating, or the
         taking of any action by the Company that would adversely affect
         Executive's participation in, or materially reduce Executive's benefits
         under, any such employee benefit plan, unless such failure or such
         taking of any action adversely affects the senior members of corporate
         management of the Company generally to the same extent;

                       (iii) A relocation of the Company's principal executive
         offices, or Executive's relocation to any place other than the
         principal executive offices, exceeding a distance of fifty (50) miles

         except for reasonably required travel by Executive on the Company's
         business;

                       (iv) Any material breach by the Company of any provision
         of this Agreement; or

                       (v) Any failure by the Company to obtain the assumption
         and performance of this Agreement by any successor (by merger,
         consolidation, or otherwise) or assign of the Company.

         However, Good Reason shall exist with respect to an above specified
         matter only if such matter is not corrected by the Company within
         thirty (30) days of its receipt of written notice of such matter from
         Executive, and in no event shall a termination by Executive occurring
         more than one hundred eighty (180) days following the date of the event
         described above be a termination for Good Reason due to such event.

                   (5) "TERMINATION DATE" shall mean the date Executive is
terminated for any reason pursuant to this Agreement.

               (b) TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE OR TERMINATION FOR GOOD REASON:

if Executive terminates for Good Reason (a "Termination Event"), this Agreement
shall terminate, except as provided in Paragraph 6, and Executive shall be
entitled to the following severance benefits:

                   (1) For a period of twelve (12) months after the Termination
         Date (unless the remainder of the Basic Term is less than twelve (12)
         months in which case, for an amount of time equal to the remainder of
         the Basic Term), Base Salary (as defined in Paragraph 3(a)), at the
         rate, and payable quarterly unless such termination is by the Company
         without Cause, in which event such amount of Base Salary shall be paid
         in a lump sum within ten (10) days of the Termination Event.

                   (2) If there is a Change of Control or a Termination Event,
         any stock options ("Stock Awards") which Executive has received under
         this Agreement shall vest immediately; and if there is a Termination
         Event all such Stock Awards shall be exercisable for one (1) year from
         the date of such Termination Event or the remainder of their term,
         whichever is less.

                   (3) To the extent not theretofore paid or provided, the
         Company shall timely pay or provide to Executive any other amounts or
         benefits required to be paid or provided or which Executive is eligible
         to receive under any plan, program, policy or practice, or contract or
         agreement of the Company and its affiliated companies for the period of
         time equal to the remainder of the Basic Term (such other amounts and
         benefits shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Other Benefits").
         Without limiting the preceding sentence or any other provision of this
         Agreement, through December 31, 2003 the Company, at its sole expense,
         shall continue to provide (through its own plan and/or individual
         policies) Executive (and Executive's dependents) with health benefits
         no less favorable than the group health plan benefits provided during
         such period to any senior executive officer of the Company or any
         affiliated company (to the extent any such coverage or benefits are
         taxable to Executive by reason of being provided under a self-insured
         health plan of the Company or an affiliate, the Company shall make
         Executive "whole" for the same on an after-tax basis). In any event,
         the Other Benefits provided for pursuant to this Paragraph shall be
         secondary to any benefits and coverage Executive (or his dependents)
         receive from another employer.

                   (4) If Executive receives any payments whether or not
         pursuant to this Agreement which are subject to an excise tax imposed
         under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
         any similar tax imposed under federal, state, or local law
         (collectively, "Excise Taxes"), the Company shall pay to Executive (on
         or before the date




                                       6
<PAGE>   7

         on which the Company is required to withhold such Excise Taxes), 1) an
         additional amount equal to all Excise Taxes then due and payable, and
         2) the amount necessary to defray Executive's increased (federal,
         state, and local) tax liability arising due to payment of the amount
         specified in this Subsection (4) which shall include any costs and
         expenses, including penalties and interest incurred by Executive in
         connection with any audit, proceedings, etc. related to the payment of
         such Excise Taxes or this payment. For purposes of calculating the
         amount payable to Executive under this Paragraph, the federal and state
         income tax rates used shall be the highest marginal federal and state
         rates applicable to ordinary income in Executive's state of residence,
         taking into account any federal income tax deductions or credits
         available to Executive for state income taxes. The Company shall cause
         its independent auditors to calculate such amount and provide Executive
         a copy of such calculation at least ten (10) days prior to the date
         specified above for payment of such amount. It is the intent of the
         Parties that this Subsection (4) shall place Executive in the same net
         after-tax position Executive would have been in had no payment been
         subject to an Excise Tax and, notwithstanding anything herein to the
         contrary, it shall be construed to effectuate said result.

                   (5) All accrued compensation and unreimbursed expenses
         through the Termination Date. Such amounts shall be paid to Executive
         in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30) days after the Termination
         Date; and

                   (6) Executive shall be free to accept other employment during
         such period, and there shall be no offset of any employment
         compensation earned by Executive in such other employment during such
         period against payments due Executive under this Paragraph (4), and
         there shall be no offset in any compensation received from such other
         employment against the Base Salary set forth above.

                (c) TERMINATION IN EVENT OF DEATH: BENEFITS. If Executive's
employment is terminated by reason of Executive's death during the Basic Term,
this Agreement shall terminate, except as provided in Paragraph 6, without
further obligation to Executive's legal representatives under this Agreement,
other than for payment of all accrued compensation, unreimbursed expenses, the
timely payment or provision of Other Benefits through the date of death, and, if
such death occurs on or after October 1 of any year, such cash bonus as
Executive would otherwise have been awarded in such year if Executive's death
had not occurred. Such amounts shall be paid to Executive's estate or
beneficiary, as applicable, in a lump sum in cash within ninety (90) days after
the date of death. With respect to the provision of Other Benefits, the term
Other Benefits as used in this Paragraph 4(c) shall include, without limitation,
and Executive's estate and/or beneficiaries shall be entitled to receive,
benefits at least equal to the most favorable benefits provided by the Company
to the estates and beneficiaries of other executive level employees of the
Company under such plans, programs, practices, and policies relating to death
benefits, if any, as in effect with respect to other executives and their
beneficiaries at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the
date of death. Additionally, all Stock Awards for which Executive would have
been eligible had he completed the Basic Term (except as set forth in Paragraph
4(b)(2)), shall be






                                       7
<PAGE>   8


accelerated, and Executive's estate or beneficiary shall be vested in such Stock
Awards as of the date of Executive's termination. Additionally, all Stock Awards
shall be vested immediately and shall be exercisable for the greater of one year
after the date of such vesting or the remaining term of such option.

                (d) TERMINATION IN EVENT OF DISABILITY: BENEFITS. If Executive's
employment is terminated by reason of Executive's Disability during the Basic
Term, this Agreement shall continue in full force for a period of one (1) year
following such Disability and if such Disability occurs on or after October 1 of
any year Executive shall be entitled to the same cash or stock bonus in such
year that Executive would have been awarded if such Disability had not occurred.
Following such one (1) year period, this Agreement shall continue in full force
except that (a) the Base Salary shall be reduced by 50% and (b) Executive shall
not be entitled to any subsequent cash bonuses. In addition, all outstanding
Stock Awards shall vest immediately upon such termination due to Disability. If
Executive's Disability occurs prior to the commencement of the Consulting
Period, defined below, in addition to the amounts provided for herein, Executive
shall receive the Consulting Fee, defined below, at such time as it would have
otherwise been earned, whether or not Executive can perform Consulting Services,
defined below. Additionally, all Stock Awards shall be vested immediately and
shall be exercisable for the greater of one year after the date of such vesting
or the remaining term of such option.

                (e) VOLUNTARY TERMINATION BY EMPLOYEE AND TERMINATION FOR CAUSE:
BENEFITS. Executive may terminate his employment with the Company without Good
Reason by giving written notice of his intent and stating an effective
Termination Date at least ninety (90) days after the date of such notice;
provided, however, that the Company may accelerate such effective date by paying
Executive through the proposed Termination Date and also vesting awards that
would have vested but for this acceleration of the proposed Termination Date.
Upon such a termination by Executive except as provided in Paragraph 6 or upon
termination for Cause by the Company, this Agreement shall terminate and the
Company shall pay to Executive all accrued compensation, unreimbursed expenses
and the Other Benefits through the Termination Date. All unvested options shall
be void. Such amounts shall be paid to Executive in a lump sum in cash within
thirty (30) days after the date of termination.

                (f) DIRECTOR POSITIONS. Executive agrees that upon termination
of employment, for any reason, at the request of the Chairman of the Board, he
will immediately tender his resignation from any and all Board positions held
with the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates. If Executive
remains as a director, after such termination, Executive shall be compensated as
an outside director.

         5. NON-COMPETITION, NON-SOLICITATION, AND CONFIDENTIALITY. Executive
recognizes and agrees that the benefit of not being employed at-will, is
provided in consideration for, among other things, the agreements contained in
this Section, as well as the Stock Awards granted to Executive pursuant to this
Agreement. The Company agrees that while employed pursuant to this Agreement,
Executive will be provided with confidential information of Company; specialized




                                       8
<PAGE>   9


training on how to perform his duties; and contact with the Company's customers
and potential customers. Furthermore, in the event Executive is terminated
without Cause, or terminates for Good Reason, and more than one (1) year remains
on the existing Basic Term, then Executive shall receive additional
consideration in an amount equal to the quotient of the Base Salary divided by
12, which shall thereupon be multiplied by the number of months remaining in the
Basic Term minus 12 months and which shall be paid in one lump sum within ten
(10) days of such termination.

         In consideration of all of the foregoing, Executive agrees as follows:

                  (a) NON-COMPETITION DURING EMPLOYMENT. Executive agrees during
the Basic Term he will not compete with the Company by engaging in the
conception, design, development, production, marketing, or servicing of any
product or service that is substantially similar to the products or services
which the Company provides, and that he will not work for, in any capacity,
assist, or become affiliated with as an owner, partner, etc., either directly or
indirectly, any individual or business which offers or performs services, or
offers or provides products substantially similar to the services and products
provided by Company.

                  (b) CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. Executive agrees that during the
Basic Term and any Consulting Period, he will not engage, either directly or
indirectly, in any activity (a "Conflict of Interest") which might adversely
affect the Company or its affiliates, including ownership of a material interest
in any supplier, contractor, distributor, subcontractor, customer or other
entity with which the Company does business or accepting any material payment,
service, loan, gift, trip, entertainment, or other favor from a supplier,
contractor, distributor, subcontractor, customer or other entity with which the
Company does business, and that Executive will promptly inform the Chairman of
the Company as to each offer received by Executive to engage in any such
activity. Executive further agrees to disclose to the Company any other facts of
which Executive becomes aware which might in Executive's good faith judgment
reasonably be expected to involve or give rise to a Conflict of Interest or
potential Conflict of Interest.

                  (c) NON-COMPETITION AFTER TERMINATION. Executive agrees that
Executive shall not, at any time during the period of two (2) years after the
later of the termination of the Basic Term or the Consulting Period, for any
reason, within any of the markets in which the Company has sold products or
services or formulated a plan to sell products or services into a market during
the last twelve (12) months of Executive's employ or which the Company enters
into within three (3) months thereafter, engage in or contribute Executive's
knowledge to any work which is competitive with or similar to a product,
process, apparatus, service, or development on which Executive worked or with
respect to which Executive had access to Confidential Information while employed
by the Company; provided, however, this Paragraph




                                       9
<PAGE>   10


(c) shall not operate to prevent Executive from engaging in retail insurance
activities during such two-year period to the extent such activities do not
compete or permit any other person or entity to compete with any business the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies were engaged in at
the time of such termination or which the Company enters into within three (3)
months thereafter. Following the expiration of said two (2) year period,
Executive shall continue to be obligated under the Confidential Information
Paragraph of this Agreement not to use or to disclose Confidential Information
of the Company so long as it shall not be publicly available. It is understood
that the geographical area set forth in this covenant is divisible so that if
this clause is invalid or unenforceable in an included geographic area, that
area is severable and the clause remains in effect for the remaining included
geographic areas in which the clause is valid.

                  (d) NON-SOLICITATION OF CUSTOMERS. Executive further agrees
that for a period of two (2) years after the termination of the Basic Term, he
will not solicit or accept any business from any customer or client or
prospective customer or client with whom Executive dealt or solicited while
employed by Company during the last twelve (12) months of his employment.

                  (e) NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. Executive agrees that for
the duration of the Basic Term, and for a period of two (2) years after the
termination of the Basic Term, he will not either directly or indirectly, on his
own behalf or on behalf of others, solicit, attempt to hire, or hire any person
employed by Company to work for Executive or for another entity, firm,
corporation, or individual.

                  (f) CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Executive further agrees that he
will not, except as the Company may otherwise consent or direct in writing,
reveal or disclose, sell, use, lecture upon, publish or otherwise disclose to
any third party any Confidential Information or proprietary information of the
Company, or authorize anyone else to do these things at any time either during
or subsequent to his employment with the Company. This Section shall continue in
full force and effect after termination of Executive's employment and after the
termination of this Agreement. Executive's obligations under this Paragraph with
respect to any specific Confidential Information and proprietary information
shall cease when that specific portion of the Confidential Information and
proprietary information becomes publicly known, in its entirety and without
combining portions of such information obtained separately. It is understood
that such Confidential Information and proprietary information of the Company
include matters that Executive conceives or develops, as well as matters
Executive learns from other employees of Company. Confidential Information is
defined to include information: (1) disclosed to or known by the Executive as a
consequence of or through his employment with the Company; (2) not generally
known outside the Company; and (3) which relates to any aspect of the Company or
its business, finances, operation plans, budgets, research, or strategic
development. "Confidential Information" includes, but is not limited to the
Company's trade secrets, proprietary information, financial documents, long
range plans, customer lists, employer compensation, marketing strategy, data
bases, costing data, computer software developed by the Company, investments
made by the Company, and any information provided to the Company by a third
party under restrictions against disclosure or use by the Company or others.

                  (g) RETURN OF DOCUMENTS, EQUIPMENT, ETC. All writings,
records, and other documents and things comprising, containing, describing,
discussing, explaining, or evidencing any Confidential Information, and all
equipment, components, parts, tools, and the like in Executive's custody or
possession that have been obtained or prepared in the course of Executive's
employment with the Company shall be the exclusive property of the Company,
shall not be copied and/or




                                       10
<PAGE>   11


removed from the premises of the Company, except in pursuit of the business of
the Company, and shall be delivered to the Company, without Executive retaining
any copies, upon notification of the termination of Executive's employment or at
any other time requested by the Company. The Company shall have the right to
retain, access, and inspect all property of Executive of any kind in the office,
work area, and on the premises of the Company upon termination of Executive's
employment and at any time during employment by the Company to ensure compliance
with the terms of this Agreement.

                  (h) REAFFIRM OBLIGATIONS. Upon termination of his employment
with the Company, Executive, if requested by Company, shall reaffirm in writing
Executive's recognition of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of
the Company's Confidential Information and proprietary information, and reaffirm
any other obligations set forth in this Agreement.

                  (i) PRIOR DISCLOSURE. Executive represents and warrants that
he has not used or disclosed any Confidential Information he may have obtained
from Company prior to signing this Agreement, in any way inconsistent with the
provisions of this Agreement.

                  (j) CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF PRIOR COMPANIES. Executive
will not disclose or use during the period of his employment with the Company
any proprietary or Confidential Information or Copyright Works which Executive
may have acquired because of employment with an employer other than the Company
or acquired from any other third party, whether such information is in
Executive's memory or embodied in a writing or other physical form.

                  (k) BREACH. Executive agrees that any breach of Paragraphs
5(a), (c), (d), (e) or (f) above cannot be remedied solely by money damages, and
that in addition to any other remedies Company may have, Company is entitled to
obtain injunctive relief against Executive. Nothing herein, however, shall be
construed as limiting Company's right to pursue any other available remedy at
law or in equity, including recovery of damages and termination of this
Agreement and/or any payments that may be due pursuant to this Agreement.

                  (l) RIGHT TO ENTER AGREEMENT. Executive represents and
covenants to Company that he has full power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and that the execution of this Agreement will not breach or constitute
a default of any other agreement or contract to which he is a party or by which
he is bound.

                  (m) EXTENSION OF POST-EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS. In the event
Executive breaches Paragraphs 5(b), (d), or (e) above, the restrictive time
periods contained in those provisions will be extended by the period of time
Executive was in violation of such provisions.

                  (n) ENFORCEABILITY. The agreements contained in Section 5 are
independent of the other agreements contained herein. Accordingly, failure of
the Company to comply with any of its obligations outside of this Paragraph do
not excuse Executive from complying with the agreements contained herein.



                                       11
<PAGE>   12

                  (o) SURVIVABILITY. The agreements contained in Paragraphs
5(c)-(g) shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.

         6. CONSULTING AGREEMENT. Effective upon Executive's termination of
employment for any reason other than Executive's termination prior to the end of
the Basic Term by the Company for Cause, HC hereby retains Executive as a
consultant (an independent contractor and not as an employee) for a period of
three (3) years (the "Consulting Period"). Termination of the Basic Term shall
not effect the Parties' rights and obligations under this Paragraph 6. Subject
to the following, Executive agrees to provide, if requested, a minimum of 166
hours of service per year, or, as requested by the Company, up to a total of 500
hours during any one year of the Consulting Period; provided, however, that the
total number of hours to be worked over the duration of the Consulting Period
shall not exceed 500 hours (the "Consulting Services"). The Consulting Services
to be provided shall be commensurate with Executive's training, background,
experience and prior duties with the Company. Executive agrees to make himself
reasonably available to provide such Consulting Services during the Consulting
Period; provided, however, the Company agrees that it shall provide reasonable
advance notice to Executive of its expected consulting needs and any request for
Consulting Services hereunder shall not unreasonably interfere with Executive's
other business activities and personal affairs as determined in good faith by
Executive. In addition, Executive shall not be required to perform any requested
Consulting Services which, in Executive's good faith opinion, would cause
Executive to breach any fiduciary duty or contractual obligation Executive may
have to another employer. Further, during the Consulting Period, Executive shall
not be subject to any non-competition provisions except for the two-year period
provided for in Paragraph 5(c). Unless waived by Executive, Executive shall not
be required to perform Consulting Services for more than four (4) days during
any week or for more than eight (8) hours during any day. Executive's travel
time shall not constitute hours of Consulting Services for purposes of this
Paragraph 6. The Parties contemplate that, when appropriate, the Consulting
Services shall be performed at Executive's office, residence or at the Company's
executive offices in Houston, Texas and may be performed at such other locations
only as they may mutually agree upon. Executive shall be properly reimbursed for
all travel and other expenses reasonably incurred by Executive in rendering the
Consulting Services. HCC shall pay Executive $200,000 per year (the "Consulting
Fee") during the Consulting Period, payable monthly in arrears. Executive may
elect to delay payment for services but not the services themselves. Except as
set forth below and in Paragraphs 4(c) or 4(d) hereof, if Executive fails to
provide the hours requested by the Company in any 24-month period, Executive's
rights to receive any further Consulting Fee shall immediately terminate. During
the Consulting Period, Executive shall receive no employment benefits from HCC.
If Executive dies or becomes Disabled during the Basic Term (or as an employee
of the Company following the Basic Term) or during the Consulting Period he (or,
on his death, his beneficiary or estate) shall receive or continue to receive as
the case may be the Consulting Fee during the remainder of the Consulting Period
as if such death or Disability had not occurred.

         7. ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement cannot be assigned by Executive. The
Company may assign this Agreement only to a successor (whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger,




                                       12
<PAGE>   13


consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and
assets of the Company provided such successor expressly agrees in writing
reasonably satisfactory to Executive to assume and perform this Agreement in the
same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform
it if no such succession and assignment had taken place. Failure of the Company
to obtain such written agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such
succession shall be a material breach of this Agreement.

         8. BINDING AGREEMENT. Executive understands that his obligations under
this Agreement are binding upon Executive's heirs, successors, personal
representatives, and legal representatives.

         9. NOTICES. All notices pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing
and sent certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed as set forth below,
or by delivering the same in person to such party, or by transmission by

         10. WAIVER. No waiver by either party to this Agreement of any right to
enforce any term or condition of this Agreement, or of any breach hereof, shall
be deemed a waiver of such right in the future or of any other right or remedy
available under this Agreement.

         11. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to
be void, invalid, unenforceable, or against public policy, such provisions shall
be deemed severable from the Agreement, and the remaining provisions of the
Agreement will remain unaffected and in full force and effect.

<PAGE>   14

         12. ARBITRATION. In the event any dispute arises out of Executive's
employment with or by the Company, or separation/termination therefrom, whether
as an employee or as a consultant, which cannot be resolved by the Parties to
this Agreement, such dispute shall be submitted to final and binding
arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the National
Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA"). If the Parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, a list of
seven (7) arbitrators will be requested from AAA, and the arbitrator will be
selected using alternate strikes with Executive striking first. The cost of the
arbitration will be shared equally by Executive and Company ; provided, however,
the Company shall promptly reimburse Executive for all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with any dispute in an amount up to, but not exceeding 20
percent of Executive's Base Salary (or, if the dispute arises during the
Consulting Period, Executive's Base Salary as in effect immediately prior to the
beginning of the Consulting Period) unless such termination was for Cause in
which event Executive shall not be entitled to reimbursement unless and until it
is determined he was terminated other than for Cause. Arbitration of such
disputes is mandatory and in lieu of any and all civil causes of action and
lawsuits either party may have against the other arising out of Executive's
employment with Company, or separation therefrom. Such arbitration shall be held
in Houston, Texas.

         13. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. The terms and provisions contained herein shall
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to Executive's
employment with Company during the time period covered by this Agreement. This
Agreement replaces and supersedes any and all existing Agreements entered into
between Executive and the Company relating generally to the same subject matter,
if any, and shall be binding upon Executive's heirs, executors, administrators,
or other legal representatives or assigns.

         14. MODIFICATION OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement may not be changed or
modified or released or discharged or abandoned or otherwise terminated, in
whole or in part, except by an instrument in writing signed by the Executive and
an officer or other authorized executive of Company.

         15. UNDERSTAND AGREEMENT. Executive represents and warrants that he has
read and understood each and every provision of this Agreement, and Executive
understands that he has the right to obtain advice from legal counsel of choice,
if necessary and desired, in order to interpret any and all provisions of this
Agreement, and that Executive has freely and voluntarily entered into this
Agreement.

accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.

         17. JURISDICTION AND VENUE. With respect to any litigation regarding
this Agreement, Executive agrees to venue in the state or federal courts in
Harris County, Texas, and agrees to waive and does hereby waive any defenses
and/or arguments based upon improper venue and/or lack of personal jurisdiction.
By entering into this Agreement, Executive agrees to personal jurisdiction in
the state and federal courts in Harris County, Texas.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

         This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is entered into effective as of
the 5th day of January, 2000 (the "Effective Date"), between HCC INSURANCE
HOLDINGS, INC. ("HCC" or "Company"), and FRANK J. BRAMANTI ("Executive"),
sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Parties."

                                    RECITALS:

         WHEREAS, Executive is to be employed as Executive Vice President of
HCC, and as an integral part of its management who participates in the
decision-making process relative to short and long-term planning and policy for
the Company, will serve on the Company's Executive Management Committee;

         WHEREAS, it is the desire to the Board of Directors of HCC (the
"Board") to (i) directly engage Executive as an officer of HCC and its
subsidiaries; and (ii) directly engage, if elected, the services of Executive as
a director of HCC and its subsidiaries;

         WHEREAS, Executive is desirous of committing himself to serve HCC on
the terms herein provided; and

         WHEREAS, Executive and HCC have previously entered into an Employment
Agreement effective as of January 1, 1998 (the "1998 Contract") which is to be
cancelled, terminated and of no further force or effect.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the respective
covenants and agreements set forth below, the Parties agree as follows:

         1. TERMINATION OF 1998 CONTRACT AND TERM. Effective as of the Effective
Date, the 1998 Contract shall be cancelled, terminated and of no further force
or effect. The Company hereby agrees to employ Executive as an Executive Vice
President, and Executive hereby agrees to accept such employment, on the terms
and conditions set forth herein, for the period commencing on the Effective Date
and expiring as of 11:59 p.m. on December 31, 2002 (the "Basic Term") (unless
sooner terminated as hereinafter set forth).

         2. DUTIES.

            (a) DUTIES AS EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY. Executive shall, subject to
the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer, the President, and the Board,
have general management responsibilities in the ordinary course of HCC's
business with all such powers with respect to such management as may be
reasonably incident to such responsibilities. During normal business hours,
Executive shall devote his full time and attention to diligently attending to
the business of the Company during the Basic Term. During the Basic Term,
Executive shall not directly or indirectly render any services of a business,
commercial, or professional nature to any other person, firm, corporation, or
organization, whether for compensation or otherwise, without the prior written




<PAGE>   2
consent of the Chairman of the Board. However, Executive shall have the right to
engage in such activities as may be appropriate in order to manage his personal
investments so long as such activities do not interfere or conflict with the
performance of his duties to the Company hereunder. The conduct of such activity
shall not be deemed to materially interfere or conflict with Executive's
performance of his duties until Executive has been notified in writing thereof
and given a reasonable period in which to cure the same.

            (b) OTHER DUTIES. At all times during the Basic Term, the Company
shall use its best efforts to cause Executive to be elected a director and to
serve on the Executive Committee and Senior Management Committee of HCC. Any
such failure to use its best efforts prior to a Change of Control shall be a
material breach of this Agreement for purposes of Paragraph (4)(a)(iv). If
elected, Executive agrees to serve as a director and on the Executive Committee
and Senior Management Committee of HCC and of any of its subsidiaries and in one
or more executive offices of any of HCC's subsidiaries, provided Executive is
indemnified for serving in any and all such capacities in a manner acceptable to
the Company and Executive. If elected, Executive agrees that he shall not be
entitled to receive any compensation for serving as a director of HCC or in any
capacities of HCC's subsidiaries other than the compensation to be paid to
Executive by the Company pursuant to this Agreement..

         3. COMPENSATION AND RELATED MATTERS.

            (a) BASE SALARY. Executive shall receive a base salary (the "Base
Salary") paid by the Company at the annual rate of $350,000, during the period
beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending December 31, 2000; $375,000 for the
period from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001; and $400,000 for the
period from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002, payable not less
frequently than in substantially equal monthly installments. Effective January
1, 2003, Executive's employment shall terminate with the Company and Executive
shall become a consultant to the Company for the period beginning on such date
and ending on December 31, 2005 (the "Consulting Period"). Executive shall
receive an annual consulting fee and be required to perform the hours of
consulting services (the "Consulting Services") as follows: during Year 1 of the
Consulting Period - $200,000 and 200 annual hours; during Year 2 of the
Consulting Period - $150,000 and 150 annual hours; and during Year 3 of the
Consulting Period - $100,000 and 100 annual hours. The Consulting Services to be
provided shall be commensurate with Executive's training, background, experience
and prior duties with the Company. Executive agrees to make himself reasonably
available to provide such Consulting Services during the Consulting Period;
provided, however, the Company agrees that it shall provide reasonable advance
notice to Executive of its expected consulting needs and any request for
Consulting Services hereunder shall not unreasonably interfere with Executive's
other business activities and personal affairs, as determined in good faith by
Executive. In addition, Executive shall not be required to perform any requested
Consulting Services which, in Executive's good faith opinion, would cause
Executive to breach any fiduciary duty or contractual obligation Executive may
have to another employer. Further, during the Consulting Period, Executive shall
not be subject to any non-competition provisions except for the two-year period
provided for in Paragraph 5(c). Executive's travel time shall constitute hours





                                       2
<PAGE>   3
of Consulting Services for purposes of this Paragraph 3(a). The Parties
contemplate that, when appropriate, the Consulting Services shall be performed
at Executive's office, residence or at the Company's executive offices in
Houston, Texas and may be performed at such other locations only as they may
mutually agree upon. Executive shall be promptly reimbursed for all travel and
other expenses reasonably incurred by Executive in rendering the Consulting
Services. Executive's annual consulting fee shall be paid quarterly in advance.
In such event, Executive, acting as a consultant, shall be entitled to no
further benefits from the Company other than medical insurance as set forth
herein. At Executive's election, Executive may terminate his employment and
commence the Consulting Period at any earlier time than as set forth herein. In
such event, the Consulting Period shall commence on such date and shall
terminate on the third anniversary thereof.

            (b) BONUS PAYMENTS. Executive shall be entitled to receive, in
addition to the Base Salary, an annual cash bonus payment in an amount, which
may be zero, to be determined at the sole discretion of the Compensation
Committee. If Executive elects to become a Consultant, he shall receive no
bonus.

            (c) EXPENSES. During the Basic Term, Executive shall be entitled to
receive reimbursement for all reasonable expenses incurred by him in accordance
with the policies and procedures established by the Board for the Company's
senior executive officers in performing services hereunder, provided that
Executive properly accounts therefor in accordance with Company policy.

            (d) OTHER BENEFITS. Except if Executive elects to become a
consultant, as set forth above, Executive shall be entitled to participate in or
receive benefits under any compensatory employee benefit plan or other
arrangement made available by the Company now or in the future to its senior
executive officers and key management employees, subject to and on a basis
consistent with the terms, conditions, and overall administration of such plan
or arrangement. Nothing paid to Executive under any plan or arrangement
presently in effect or made available in the future shall be deemed to be in
lieu of the Base Salary payable to Executive pursuant to Paragraph (a) of this
Section. The Company shall not make any changes in any employee benefit plans or
other arrangements in effect on the date hereof or subsequently in effect in
which Executive currently or in the future participates (including, without
limitation, each pension and retirement plan, supplemental pension and
retirement plan, savings and profit sharing plan, stock or unit ownership plan,
stock or unit purchase plan, stock or unit option plan, life insurance plan,
medical insurance plan, disability plan, dental plan, health and accident plan,
or any other similar plan or arrangement) that would adversely affect
Executive's rights or benefits thereunder, unless such change occurs pursuant to
a program applicable to substantially all executives of the Company and does not
result in a proportionately greater reduction in the rights of or benefits to
Executive as compared with any other executive of the Company.

            (e) VACATIONS. (i) Executive shall be entitled to thirty (30) paid
vacation days per year during the Basic Term. There shall be no carryover of
unused vacation from year to year. For




                                       3
<PAGE>   4

purposes of this Paragraph, weekends shall not count as vacation days, and
Executive shall also be entitled to all paid holidays and personal days given by
the Company to its senior executive officers.

            (f) PERQUISITES. During Executive's employment, but not during the
Consulting Period, except as specifically set forth herein, Executive shall be
entitled to receive the perquisites and fringe benefits appertaining to an
executive officer of HCC in accordance with any practice established by the
Compensation Committee. Notwithstanding, and in addition to, any perquisites to
which Executive is entitled pursuant to the preceding sentence, Executive shall,
whether acting as an employee or as a consultant: (i) have use of a new Mercedes
500 SEL automobile, and the Company shall pay all expenses related to
Executive's use of such car, including gasoline, insurance, and maintenance,
such automobile to be granted to Executive, without cost, on an "as-is" basis at
the beginning of the Consulting Period; (ii) be allowed to travel on business
utilizing first class passage (whether domestic or international) (such
perquisite to be for the Basic Term and the Consulting Period); (iii) be
reimbursed for annual club dues for Lakeside Country Club, such membership to be
granted to Executive, without cost, at the beginning of the Consulting Period;
(iv) receive a total of $1,000,000 term life insurance (which shall be in
addition to the standard benefits provided to Executive under the Company's
group life insurance program that covers officers); (v) in addition to the other
benefits provided in this Agreement, Executive shall be entitled to receive
medical insurance as currently provided under the Company's group program, as
such group program may be changed from time-to-time in the future, and Executive
shall be entitled to continue to be covered by such group program or, if not
permitted under the terms of the group program, then the Company shall provide
Executive with a medical insurance policy providing substantially similar
benefits as to the group program, for the period ending on the date of the later
to die of Executive or, if Executive is married on the date of his death,
Executive's spouse or the date all of Executive's children complete college (as
defined in the Company's group program). Executive shall be entitled to receive
the medical benefits defined herein at no cost to the Executive. However,
Executive's rights pursuant to this subsection (v) shall be void if Executive is
terminated for Cause or if Executive voluntarily terminates his employment
except as provided for herein; and (vi) HCC shall pay for Executive's
preparation of estate planning and wealth preservation documents during the
course of Executive's employment with the Company. Such estate planning and
wealth preservation documents may be changed from time-to-time at the Company's
cost and expense, pursuant to Executive's change in circumstances.

            (g) PRORATION. Any payments or benefits payable to Executive
hereunder in respect of any calendar year during which Executive is employed by
the Company for less than the entire year, unless otherwise provided in the
applicable plan or arrangement, shall be prorated in accordance with the number
of days in such calendar year during which he is so employed. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any payments pursuant to Paragraphs 4(b)(4), 4(c) or 4(d) of this
Agreement shall not be subject to proration.

                  (a)      DEFINITIONS.

                           (1)      "CAUSE" shall mean:

                                    (i) Material dishonesty which is not the
         result of an inadvertent or innocent mistake of Executive with respect
         to the Company or any of its subsidiaries;

                                    (ii) Willful misfeasance or nonfeasance of
         duty by Executive intended to injure or having the effect of injuring
         in some material fashion the reputation, business, or business
         relationships of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
         respective officers, directors, or employees;

                                    (iii) Material violation by Executive of any

                                    (iv) Conviction of Executive of any felony,
         any crime involving moral turpitude or any crime other than a vehicular
         offense which could reflect in some material fashion unfavorably upon
         the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Executive may not be terminated for Cause unless and until there has been
delivered to Executive written notice from the Board supplying the particulars
of Executive's acts or omissions that the Board believes constitute Cause, a
reasonable period of time (not less than 30 days) has been given to Executive
after such notice to either cure the same or to meet with the Board, with his

         owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of
         1934), directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of the Company's then
         outstanding voting common stock; or

                                    (ii) At any time during the period of three

         nomination for election by the Company's shareholders were approved by
         a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who
         either were directors at the beginning of

         approve a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other
         corporation, other than a merger or consolidation (a) in which a
         majority of the directors of the surviving entity were directors of the
         Company prior to such consolidation or merger, and (b) which would
         result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately
         prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding
         or by being changed into voting securities of the surviving entity)
         more than 50% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of
         the surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or
         consolidation; or

                                    (iv) The shareholders approve a plan of
         complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or
         disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's
         assets.

                           (3)      A "DISABILITY" shall mean the absence of
Executive from Executive's duties with the Company on a full-time basis for 180
consecutive days, or 180 days in a 365-day period, as a result of incapacity due
to mental or physical illness which results in the Executive being unable to

accommodation.

                           (4) A "GOOD REASON" shall mean any of the
following (without Executive's express written consent):

                                    (i) Following a Change of Control, a
         material alteration in the nature or status of Executive's title,
         duties or responsibilities, or the assignment of duties or
         responsibilities inconsistent with Executive's status, title, duties
         and responsibilities;

                                    (ii) A failure by the Company to continue in
         effect any employee benefit plan in which Executive was participating,
         or the taking of any action by the Company that would adversely affect
         Executive's participation in, or materially reduce Executive's benefits
         under, any such employee benefit plan, unless such failure or such
         taking of any action adversely affects the senior members of corporate
         management of the Company generally to the same extent;

                                    (iii) A relocation of the Company's

         Houston, Texas, except for reasonably required travel by Executive on
         the Company's business;

                                    (iv) Any material breach by the Company of

<PAGE>   7
                                    (v) Any failure by the Company to obtain the
         assumption and performance of this Agreement by any successor (by
         merger, consolidation, or otherwise) or assign of the Company.

However, Good Reason shall exist with respect to an above specified matter only
if such matter is not corrected by the Company within thirty (30) days of its
receipt of written notice of such matter from Executive, and in no event shall a
termination by Executive occurring more than one hundred eighty (180) days
following the date of the event described above be a termination for Good Reason
due to such event.

                           (5) "TERMINATION DATE" shall mean the date Executive
is terminated for any reason pursuant to this Agreement.

                  (b) TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE, OR TERMINATION FOR GOOD REASON:
BENEFITS. In the event there is a termination by the Company without Cause, or
if Executive terminates for Good Reason within one hundred eighty (180) days
after a Change of Control (a "Termination Event"), this Agreement shall
terminate and Executive shall be entitled to the following severance benefits:

                           (1) For a period of twelve (12) months after the
         Termination Date (unless the remainder of the Basic Term is less than
         twelve (12) months, in which case, for an amount of time equal to the
         remainder of the Basic Term), Base Salary (as defined in Paragraph
         3(a)), at the rate and payable quarterly unless such termination is by
         the Company without Cause, in which event such amount of Base Salary
         shall be paid in a lump sum within ten (10) days of the Termination
         Event.

                           (2) If there is a Change of Control or a Termination
         Event any stock options ("Stock Awards") which Executive has received
         under this Agreement shall vest immediately, and if there is a
         Termination Event, all such Stock Awards shall be exercisable for
         thirty (30) days from the date of such Termination Event or the
         remainder of their term, whichever is less.

                           (3) To the extent not theretofore paid or provided,
         the Company shall timely pay or provide to Executive any other amounts
         or benefits required to be paid or provided or which Executive is
         eligible to receive under any plan, program, policy or practice, or
         contract or agreement of the Company and its affiliated companies for
         the period of time equal to the remainder of the Basic Term (such other
         amounts and benefits shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Other
         Benefits"). Without limiting the preceding sentence and without
         limiting any other provision of this Agreement, through December 31,
         2002 the Company, at its sole expense, shall continue to provide
         (through its own plan and/or individual policies) Executive (and
         Executive's dependents) with health benefits no less favorable than the
         group health plan benefits provided during such period to any senior
         executive officer of the Company or any affiliated company (to the
         extent any such coverage




                                       7
<PAGE>   8

         or benefits are taxable to Executive by reason of being provided under
         a self-insured health plan of the Company or an affiliate, the Company
         shall make Executive "whole" for the same on an after-tax basis). In
         any event, the Other Benefits provided for pursuant to this Paragraph
         shall be secondary to any benefits and coverage Executive (or his
         dependents) receive from another employer.

                           (4) If any such Termination occurs on or after
         October 1 of any year, such cash and/or stock bonus that Executive
         otherwise would have received if such Termination had not taken place.

                           (5) If Executive receives any payments whether or not
         pursuant to this Agreement which are subject to an excise tax imposed
         under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
         any similar tax imposed under federal, state, or local law
         (collectively, "Excise Taxes"), the Company shall pay to Executive (on
         or before the date on which the Company is required to withhold such
         Excise Taxes), 1) an additional amount equal to all Excise Taxes then
         due and payable, and 2) the amount necessary to defray Executive's
         increased (federal, state, and local) tax liability arising due to
         payment of the amount specified in this Subsection (5) which shall
         include any costs and expenses, including penalties and interest
         incurred by Executive in connection with any audit, proceedings, etc.
         related to the payment of such Excise Taxes or this payment. For
         purposes of calculating the amount payable to Executive under this
         Paragraph, the federal and state income tax rates used shall be the
         highest marginal federal and state rates applicable to ordinary income
         in Executive's state of residence, taking into account any federal
         income tax deductions or credits available to Executive for state
         income taxes. The Company shall cause its independent auditors to
         calculate such amount and provide Executive a copy of such calculation
         at least ten (10) days prior to the date specified above for payment of
         such amount. It is the intent of the Parties that this Subsection (5)
         shall place Executive in the same net after-tax position Executive
         would have been in had no payment been subject to an Excise Tax and,
         notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it shall be construed
         to effectuate said result.

                           (6) All accrued compensation and unreimbursed
         expenses through the Termination Date. Such amounts shall be paid to
         Executive in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30) days after the
         Termination Date; and

                           (7) Executive shall be free to accept other
         employment during such period, and there shall be no offset of any
         employment compensation earned by Executive in such other employment
         during such period against payments due Executive under this Paragraph
         (4), and there shall be no offset in any compensation received from
         such other employment against the Base Salary set forth above.

                  (c) TERMINATION IN EVENT OF DEATH: BENEFITS. If Executive's
employment is terminated by reason of Executive's death during the Basic Term,
this Agreement shall terminate



                                       8
<PAGE>   9

without further obligation to Executive's legal representatives under this
Agreement, other than for payment of all accrued compensation, unreimbursed
expenses, the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits through the date of
death, and, if such death occurs on or after October 1 of any year, such cash or
stock bonus as Executive would otherwise have been awarded in such year if
Executive's death had not occurred. Such amounts shall be paid to Executive's
estate or beneficiary, as applicable, in a lump sum in cash within ninety (90)
days after the date of death. With respect to the provision of Other Benefits,
the term Other Benefits as used in this Paragraph 4(c) shall include, without
limitation, and Executive's estate and/or beneficiaries shall be entitled to
receive, benefits at least equal to the most favorable benefits provided by the
Company to the estates and beneficiaries of other executive level employees of
the Company under such plans, programs, practices, and policies relating to
death benefits, if any, as in effect with respect to other executives and their
beneficiaries at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the
date of death. Additionally, all Stock Awards shall be vested immediately and
shall be exercisable for the greater of one year after the date of such vesting
or the remaining term of such option.

                  (d) TERMINATION IN EVENT OF DISABILITY: BENEFITS. If
Executive's employment is terminated by reason of Executive's Disability during
the Basic Term, this Agreement shall continue in full force for a period of one
(1) year following such Disability and if such Disability occurs on or after
October 1 of any year Executive shall be entitled to the same cash or stock
bonus in such year that Executive would have been awarded if such Disability had
not occurred. Following such one (1) year period, this Agreement shall continue
in full force except that (a) the Base Salary shall be reduced by 50% and (b)
Executive shall not be entitled to any subsequent cash or stock bonuses. In
addition, all outstanding Stock Awards shall vest immediately upon such
termination due to Disability. Additionally, all Stock Awards shall be vested
immediately and shall be exercisable for the greater of one year after the date
of such vesting or the remaining term of such option.

                  (e) VOLUNTARY TERMINATION BY EMPLOYEE AND TERMINATION FOR
CAUSE: BENEFITS. Executive may terminate his employment with the Company without
Good Reason by giving written notice of his intent and stating an effective
Termination Date at least ninety (90) days after the date of such notice;
provided, however, that the Company may accelerate such effective date by paying
Executive through the proposed Termination Date and also vesting awards that
would have vested but for this acceleration of the proposed Termination Date.
Upon such a termination by Executive, except as provided in Paragraph 3(a), or
upon termination for Cause by the Company, this Agreement shall terminate, and
the Company shall pay to Executive all accrued compensation, unreimbursed
expenses and the Other Benefits through the Termination Date. Such amounts shall
be paid to Executive in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30) days after the
date of termination. In addition, all unvested stock options shall terminate and
all vested options will terminate thirty (30) days after the Termination Date.

                  (f) DIRECTOR POSITIONS. Executive agrees that upon termination
of employment, for any reason, at the request of the Chairman of the Board,
Executive will immediately tender his resignation from any and all Board
positions held with the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries



                                       9
<PAGE>   10

and affiliates. If Executive remains as a director, after such termination,
Executive shall be compensated as an outside director.

         5. NON-COMPETITION, NON-SOLICITATION, AND CONFIDENTIALITY. Executive
recognizes and agrees that the benefit of not being employed at-will, is
provided in consideration for, among other things, the agreements contained in
this Section as well as the Stock Awards granted to Executive pursuant to this
Agreement. The Company agrees that while employed pursuant to this Agreement,
Executive will be provided with confidential information of Company; specialized
training on how to perform his duties; and contact with the Company's customers
and potential customers. Furthermore, in the event Executive is terminated
without Cause, or terminates for Good Reason; and more than one (1) year remains
on the existing Basic Term, then Executive shall receive additional
consideration in an amount equal to the quotient of the Base Salary divided by
12, which shall thereupon be multiplied by the number of months remaining in the
Basic Term minus 12 months, and which shall be paid in one lump sum within ten
(10) days of such termination.

         In consideration of all of the foregoing, Executive agrees as follows:

                  (a) NON-COMPETITION DURING EMPLOYMENT. Executive agrees during
the Basic Term and the Consulting Period he will not compete with the Company by
engaging in the conception, design, development, production, marketing, or
servicing of any product or service that is substantially similar to the
products or services which the Company provides, and that he will not work for,
in any capacity, assist, or become affiliated with as an owner, partner, etc.,
either directly or indirectly, any individual or business which offers or
performs services, or offers or provides products substantially similar to the
services and products provided by Company, provided, Executive shall not be
prevented from owning no more than 2% of any Company whose stock is publicly
traded.

                  (b) CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. Executive agrees that during the
Basic Term and the Consulting Period, he will not engage, either directly or
indirectly, in any activity (a "Conflict of Interest") which might adversely
affect the Company or its affiliates, including ownership of a material interest
in any supplier, contractor, distributor, subcontractor, customer or other
entity with which the Company does business or accepting any material payment,
service, loan, gift, trip, entertainment, or other favor from a supplier,
contractor, distributor, subcontractor, customer or other entity with which the
Company does business, and that Executive will promptly inform the Chairman of
the Company as to each offer received by Executive to engage in any such
activity. Executive further agrees to disclose to the Company any other facts of
which Executive becomes aware which might in Executive's good faith judgment
reasonably be expected to involve or give rise to a Conflict of Interest or
potential Conflict of Interest.

                  (c) NON-COMPETITION AFTER TERMINATION. Executive agrees that
Executive shall not, at any time during the period of two (2) years after the
termination of the later of the Basic Term or the Consulting Period for any
reason, within any of the markets in which the Company has sold products or
services or formulated a plan to sell products or services into a market during
the last




                                       10
<PAGE>   11

twelve (12) months of Executive's employ or which the Company enters into within
three (3) months thereafter, engage in or contribute Executive's knowledge to
any work which is competitive with or similar to a product, process, apparatus,
service, or development on which Executive worked or with respect to which
Executive had access to Confidential Information while employed by the Company;
provided, however, this Paragraph (c) shall not operate to prevent Executive
from engaging in retail insurance or re-insurance activities during such
two-year period to the extent such activities do not compete or permit any other
person or entity to compete with any business the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliated companies were engaged in at the time of such
termination or which the Company enters into within three (3) months thereafter.
Following the expiration of said two (2) year period, Executive shall continue
to be obligated under the Confidential Information Paragraph of this Agreement
not to use or to disclose Confidential Information of the Company so long as it
shall not be publicly available. It is understood that the geographical area set
forth in this covenant is divisible so that if this clause is invalid or
unenforceable in an included geographic area, that area is severable and the
clause remains in effect for the remaining included geographic areas in which
the clause is valid.

                  (d) NON-SOLICITATION OF CUSTOMERS. Executive further agrees
that for a period of two (2) years after the termination of the Basic Term, he
will not solicit or accept any business from any customer or client or
prospective customer or client with whom Executive dealt or solicited while
employed by Company during the last twelve (12) months of his employment.

                  (e) NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. Executive agrees that for
the duration of the Basic Term, and for a period of two (2) years after the
termination of the Basic Term, he will not either directly or indirectly, on his
own behalf or on behalf of others, solicit, attempt to hire, or hire any person
employed by Company to work for Executive or for another entity, firm,
corporation, or individual.

                  (f) CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Executive further agrees that he
will not, except as the Company may otherwise consent or direct in writing,
reveal or disclose, sell, use, lecture upon, publish or otherwise disclose to
any third party any Confidential Information or proprietary information of the
Company, or authorize anyone else to do these things at any time either during
or subsequent to his employment with the Company. This Section shall continue in
full force and effect after termination of Executive's employment and after the
termination of this Agreement. Executive's obligations under this Paragraph with
respect to any specific Confidential Information and proprietary information
shall cease when that specific portion of the Confidential Information and
proprietary information becomes publicly known, in its entirety and without
combining portions of such information obtained separately. It is understood
that such Confidential Information and proprietary information of the Company
include matters that Executive conceives or develops, as well as matters
Executive learns from other employees of Company. Confidential Information is
defined to include information: (1) disclosed to or known by the Executive as a
consequence of or through his employment with the Company; (2) not generally
known outside the Company; and (3) which relates to any aspect of the Company or
its business, finances, operation plans, budgets, research, or strategic
development. "Confidential Information" includes, but is not limited to the




                                       11
<PAGE>   12

Company's trade secrets, proprietary information, financial documents, long
range plans, customer lists, employer compensation, marketing strategy, data
bases, costing data, computer software developed by the Company, investments
made by the Company, and any information provided to the Company by a third
party under restrictions against disclosure or use by the Company or others.

                  (g) RETURN OF DOCUMENTS, EQUIPMENT, ETC. All writings,
records, and other documents and things comprising, containing, describing,
discussing, explaining, or evidencing any Confidential Information, and all
equipment, components, parts, tools, and the like in Executive's custody or
possession that have been obtained or prepared in the course of Executive's
employment with the Company shall be the exclusive property of the Company,
shall not be copied and/or removed from the premises of the Company, except in
pursuit of the business of the Company, and shall be delivered to the Company,
without Executive retaining any copies, upon notification of the termination of
Executive's employment or at any other time requested by the Company. The
Company shall have the right to retain, access, and inspect all property of
Executive of any kind in the office, work area, and on the premises of the
Company upon termination of Executive's employment and at any time during
employment by the Company to ensure compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  (h) REAFFIRM OBLIGATIONS. Upon termination of his employment
with the Company, Executive, if requested by Company, shall reaffirm in writing
Executive's recognition of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of
the Company's Confidential Information and proprietary information, and reaffirm
any other obligations set forth in this Agreement.

                  (i) PRIOR DISCLOSURE.  Executive represents and warrants that
he has not used or disclosed any Confidential Information he may have obtained
from Company prior to signing this Agreement, in any way inconsistent with the
provisions of this Agreement.

                  (j) CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF PRIOR COMPANIES. Executive
will not disclose or use during the period of his employment with the Company
any proprietary or Confidential Information or Copyright Works which Executive
may have acquired because of employment with an employer other than the Company
or acquired from any other third party, whether such information is in
Executive's memory or embodied in a writing or other physical form.

                  (k) BREACH. Executive agrees that any breach of Paragraphs
5(a), (c), (d), (e) or (f) above cannot be remedied solely by money damages, and
that in addition to any other remedies Company may have, Company is entitled to
obtain injunctive relief against Executive. Nothing herein, however, shall be
construed as limiting Company's right to pursue any other available remedy at
law or in equity, including recovery of damages and termination of this
Agreement and/or any payments that may be due pursuant to this Agreement.

                  (l) RIGHT TO ENTER AGREEMENT. Executive represents and
covenants to Company that he has full power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and that the execution of this



                                       12
<PAGE>   13

Agreement will not breach or constitute a default of any other agreement or
contract to which he is a party or by which he is bound.

                  (m) EXTENSION OF POST-EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS. In the event
Executive breaches Paragraphs 5(b), (d), or (e) above, the restrictive time
periods contained in those provisions will be extended by the period of time
Executive was in violation of such provisions.

                  (n) ENFORCEABILITY. The agreements contained in Section 5 are
independent of the other agreements contained herein. Accordingly, failure of
the Company to comply with any of its obligations outside of this Paragraph do
not excuse Executive from complying with the agreements contained herein.

                  (o) SURVIVABILITY.  The agreements contained in Paragraphs
5(c)-(g) shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.

         6. ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement cannot be assigned by Executive. The
Company may assign this Agreement only to a successor (whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and assets of the Company provided such
successor expressly agrees in writing reasonably satisfactory to Executive to
assume and perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that
the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession and assignment
had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such written agreement prior
to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a material breach of this
Agreement.

         7. BINDING AGREEMENT.  Executive understands that his obligations under
this Agreement are binding upon Executive's heirs, successors, personal
representatives, and legal representatives.

         8. NOTICES. All notices pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing
and sent certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed as set forth below,
or by delivering the same in person to such party, or by transmission by
facsimile to the number set forth below (which shall not constitute notice).
Notice deposited in the United States Mail, mailed in the manner described

         9. WAIVER.  No waiver by either party to this Agreement of any right to
enforce any term or condition of this Agreement, or of any breach hereof, shall
be deemed a waiver of such right in the future or of any other right or remedy
available under this Agreement.

         10. SEVERABILITY.  If any provision of this Agreement is determined to
be void, invalid, unenforceable, or against public policy, such provisions shall
be deemed severable from the Agreement, and the remaining provisions of the
Agreement will remain unaffected and in full force and effect.

         11. ARBITRATION. In the event any dispute arises out of Executive's
employment with or by the Company, or separation/termination therefrom, whether
as an employee or as a consultant which cannot be resolved by the Parties to
this Agreement, such dispute shall be submitted to final and binding
arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the National
Rules for the resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA"). If the Parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, a list of
seven (7) arbitrators will be requested from AAA, and the arbitrator will be
selected using alternate strikes with Executive striking first. The cost of the
arbitration will be shared equally by Executive and Company; provided, however,
the Company shall promptly reimburse Executive for all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with any dispute in an amount up to, but not exceeding
twenty percent (20%) of Executive's Base Salary (or, if the dispute arises
during the Consulting Period, Executive's Base Salary as in effect immediately
prior to the beginning of the Consulting Period) unless such termination was for
Cause in which event Executive shall not be entitled to reimbursement unless and
until it is determined he was terminated other than for Cause. Arbitration of
such disputes is mandatory and in lieu of any and all civil causes of action and
lawsuits either party may have against the other arising out of Executive's
employment with Company, or separation therefrom. Such arbitration shall be held
in Houston, Texas.

         12. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. The terms and provisions contained herein shall
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to Executive's
employment with Company during the time period covered by this Agreement. This
Agreement replaces and supersedes any and all existing Agreements entered into
between Executive and the Company relating generally to the same




                                       14
<PAGE>   15

subject matter, if any, and shall be binding upon Executive's heirs, executors,
administrators, or other legal representatives or assigns.

         13. MODIFICATION OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement may not be changed or
modified or released or discharged or abandoned or otherwise terminated, in
whole or in part, except by an instrument in writing signed by the Executive and
an officer or other authorized executive of Company.

         14. UNDERSTAND AGREEMENT. Executive represents and warrants that he has
read and understood each and every provision of this Agreement, and Executive
understands that he has the right to obtain advice from legal counsel of choice,
if necessary and desired, in order to interpret any and all provisions of this
Agreement, and that Executive has freely and voluntarily entered into this
Agreement.

         15. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.

         16. JURISDICTION AND VENUE. With respect to any litigation regarding
this Agreement, Executive agrees to venue in the state or federal courts in
Harris County, Texas, and agrees to waive and does hereby waive any defenses
and/or arguments based upon improper venue and/or lack of personal jurisdiction.
By entering into this Agreement, Executive agrees to personal jurisdiction in
the state and federal courts in Harris County, Texas.
