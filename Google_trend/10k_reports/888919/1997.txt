ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
GENERAL
 
    HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. ("HCCH" or the "Company") is a Delaware
corporation with principal and executive offices located at 13403 Northwest
Freeway, Houston, Texas 77040. HCCH and its consolidated subsidiaries are
collectively referred to as the "Company". HCCH, through its subsidiaries,
provides specialized property and casualty insurance to commercial customers,
underwritten on both a direct and reinsurance basis, and, to a lesser extent,
insurance agency services. The Company's principal insurance company
subsidiaries are Houston Casualty Company ("HCC") and Trafalgar Insurance
Company ("TIC") in Houston, Texas and IMG Insurance Company Ltd. ("IMG") in
Amman, Jordan. The Company's principal agency subsidiaries are LDG Management
Company, Incorporated ("LDG") in Wakefield, Massachusetts; HCC Underwriters, A
Texas Corporation ("HCCU") in Houston, Texas; North American Special Risk
Associates, Inc. ("NASRA") in Northbrook, Illinois and Middle East Insurance
Brokers, Ltd. ("MEIB") in Amman, Jordan.
 
    The Company's underwriting activities are focused on providing aviation,
marine, property, offshore energy and accident and health insurance on a
worldwide basis and international reinsurance on these same lines of business.
The Company also specializes in marketing and servicing complicated, high value,
structured insurance and reinsurance programs placed on behalf of domestic and
foreign clients which cover large, ocean marine fleets; complex, multinational,
energy and industrial businesses; international aviation operations; large
international property accounts; and a variety of accident and health related
risks. The Company derives substantially the same amount of its business
domestically and internationally. The Company operates primarily on a surplus
lines or a non-admitted basis and is licensed in Texas and Oklahoma.
 
    Since its founding in 1974, the Company and its predecessor companies have
been consistently profitable, generally reporting annual increases in gross
written premium ("GWP"), net written premium ("NWP") and total revenue. During
the period 1992 through 1996, the Company had an average combined ratio of 78.1%
versus the less favorable 109.3% recorded by the U.S. property and casualty
insurance industry overall (1992-1995). During the same period, the Company's
GWP increased from $75.1 million to $230.8 million, an increase of 207% and net
earnings increased from $5.3 million to $29.3 million, an increase of 454%.
 
    HCC and TIC are rated "A"(Excellent) by A.M. Best and HCC is rated "Aq" by
S&P. An A.M. Best or S&P rating is intended to provide an independent opinion of
an insurer's ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and should not be
considered an investment recommendation.
 
STRATEGY
 
    The Company's operating philosophy is to maximize underwriting profit while
preserving the integrity of shareholders' equity. The Company concentrates its
writings in selected, narrowly defined lines of business in which it believes
there is a substantial opportunity to achieve underwriting profits. The Company
primarily underwrites first party, physical damage coverages and lines of
business which have relatively short lead times between the occurrence of an
insured event and the reporting of claims to the Company. With respect to the
underwriting management, marketing and related services, the Company seeks to
offer quality underwriting, decision-making, support and reinsurance capacity
and financial and other resources to take advantage of market opportunities for
the development of new products.
 
    The property and casualty insurance underwriting business has historically
been cyclical (though not seasonal). Within the overall cycle of the industry,
particular lines of business experience their own cycles.
 
                                       3
<PAGE>
These cycles are characterized by periods of excess capital and significant
competition in policy pricing, terms and conditions, followed by periods of
capital shortages, typically resulting from adverse loss experience, which leads
to decreased competition, higher premium rates and stricter underwriting
standards.
 
    The position of a particular line of business in its respective underwriting
cycle depends on prevailing premium rates, availability and cost of reinsurance,
and other market conditions. The Company considers each of these factors in
determining when to increase or decrease premium volume in each line. With this
approach, the Company focuses on increasing net earnings rather than premium
volume or market share.
 
    The Company purchases a substantial amount of reinsurance to limit its net
loss from both individual and catastrophic risks. The degree to which the
Company reinsures varies by, among other things, the particular risks inherent
in the policies underwritten.
 
    The Company's business plan is to expand its underwriting activities and
continue the growth of its insurance agency operations. However, the Company's
business plan is shaped by its underlying operating philosophy, which is to
maximize underwriting profit opportunities, while preserving the integrity of
shareholders' equity and to seek to acquire complementary businesses with
established management and reputation in the insurance agency field, whose
business, the Company believes, can be enhanced through the synergism created by
the Company's underwriting capabilities and other owned insurance businesses. As
a result, the Company's primary interests are not in expanding market share or
necessarily, GWP, but rather in increasing net earnings. To accomplish this
objective, the Company: (i) has been and is prepared to emphasize or reduce
underwritings in certain lines as premium rates, the availability and cost of
reinsurance and other market conditions warrant; and (ii) will continue to
attempt to limit its downside net loss exposure through the effective, prudent
and conservative use of reinsurance.
 
    The Company believes its operational flexibility, experienced underwriting
personnel, and access to and expertise in the reinsurance marketplace allow the
Company to implement its strategy of emphasizing more profitable lines of
business during periods of increased premium rates and de-emphasizing less
profitable lines of business during periods of severe competition. In addition,
through its acquisition and ownership of insurance agency businesses, the
Company believes it has additional lines of business that can complement its
underwriting activities.
 
RECENT ACQUISITIONS
 
    Effective January 1, 1994, HCCU acquired a 25% interest in MEIB, a wholesale
insurance and reinsurance broker based in Amman, Jordan. Concurrent with the
purchase of IMG on October 1, 1994, HCCH acquired the remaining 75% of interest
in MEIB and HCCU transferred its 25% interest in MEIB to HCCH, thereby making
MEIB a wholly owned subsidiary of HCCH. To acquire 100% of MEIB, the Company
issued 109,524 shares (pre split) of its Common Stock and paid a total of $3.9
million in cash.
 
    Effective October 1, 1994, HCCH acquired 100% of the stock of IMG, a
property and casualty insurance company based in Amman, Jordan. IMG specializes
in insuring large commercial risks. In exchange for IMG's stock, the Company
issued 838,095 shares (pre split) of its Common Stock and paid $4.4 million in
cash.
 
    These acquisitions were made in order to expand the Company's international
business operations, principally in the Middle East, Asia and Africa.
 
    On May 24, 1996, the Company issued 6,250,000 shares of its common stock to
acquire all of the outstanding shares of LDG. LDG acts on behalf of insurance
and reinsurance companies and conducts its business in two areas: (i) insurance
underwriting management and (ii) reinsurance underwriting management and
intermediary services. LDG underwrites insurance and/or reinsurance in the
following lines of business: medical stop-loss insurance for employer sponsored
self-insured health plans, accident and health special risk, workers'
compensation, alternative workers' compensation, and specialty aviation. LDG
 
                                       4
<PAGE>
generally concentrates on lines of business that have relatively short lead
times between the occurrence of an insured event and the reporting of claims.
 
    On November 27, 1996, the Company issued 1,136,400 shares of its Common
Stock and paid $1.7 million in cash to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
North American Special Risk Associates, Inc. group of companies ("NASRA"). NASRA
provides underwriting and claims management services to insurance and
reinsurance companies primarily in occupational accident insurance for
self-employed truckers.
 
    On January 24, 1997, the Company issued 266,667 shares of its Common Stock
and paid $6.55 million in cash to acquire all of the occupational accident
business of TRM International, Inc.
 
    These acquisitions were made in order to increase the agency (non-risk
bearing) operations of the Company.
 
PENDING ACQUISITIONS
 
    On January 6, 1997, the Company announced that it had agreed in principal to
acquire all of the outstanding shares of Interworld Inc. group of companies
("Interworld") in exchange for 725,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock.
Interworld, through its subsidiaries, acts as a managing general agency that
specializes in underwriting general aviation risks throughout the United States,
with special emphasis on private and corporate aircraft as well as small to
medium size airports and commercial operators.
 
    On January 17, 1997, the Company and AVEMCO Corporation ("AVEMCO") jointly
announced that they had signed a letter of intent to merge in a stock-for-stock
transaction, each share of AVEMCO common stock to be exchanged for one share of
HCCH's Common Stock. The Companies executed definitive agreements on February
28, 1997. AVEMCO provides specialized property and casualty insurance products
and services, principally involving aviation. Non-aviation specialty lines
include lenders single interest, short-term health and pleasure marine.
Insurance products are distributed on a direct basis nationally and in Canada
(except Quebec) and through agency and brokerage networks nationwide. AVEMCO's
insurance services businesses offer management and related subrogation and
salvage services, short-term health and travel insurance programs,
administration and availability of short-term health programs primarily for
foreign students resident in the United States, worldwide multilingual emergency
assistance services for individuals who become ill or are injured while
traveling abroad and computer software and related products and services for
property and casualty insurance companies in the United States.
 
    The merger is subject to approval by each of the Company's shareholders and
additional approval by certain regulatory agencies. The Companies have filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Join Proxy Statement/Prospectus
relating to each of their respective Company's special shareholder's meeting.
The Company anticipates that its Special Meeting of Shareholders will be held
prior to May 31, 1997, and the merger will be consummated as soon thereafter as
all other conditions to the merger are satisfied. There can be no assurance that
the conditions to the proposed merger will be satisfied or that the shareholders
will approve the transaction and the merger will consummated.
 
    These acquisitions are expected to expand and strengthen the Company's
existing lines of business.
 
INSURANCE COMPANY OPERATIONS
 
    The Company's property and casualty insurance business specializes in the
direct, including facultative reinsurance, underwriting of aviation, marine,
offshore energy, property and accident and health risks, as well as treaty
reinsurance in the same lines of business.

    DIRECT AND FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE UNDERWRITING
 
    AVIATION--The Company insures predominantly foreign general aviation risks
including fixed base, rotor wing and cargo operations and commuter airlines. The
Company does not generally insure major domestic trunk airlines, satellites,
corporate aircraft or United States passenger liabilities. The coverages
underwritten include hull (including engines, avionics and other systems),
liabilities, war, cargo and various ancillary coverages.
 
    The Company has been underwriting aviation risks since 1981. GWP has risen
rapidly since 1992, increasing to $71.7 million in 1996 from $4.3 million in
1992. This growth has occurred due to a dramatic increase in rates as a result
of extremely adverse worldwide underwriting results in prior years and the
Company's ability to respond quickly to the opportunity to write new business in
a rising market. In addition, the Company resumed writing domestic general
aviation risks late in 1996. Rates have now reached very acceptable levels of
profitability but the Company expects the increase in GWP and NWP to slow during
1997 as recent competition is beginning to effect this line of business.
 
                                       6
<PAGE>
    Treaty reinsurance is maintained on an excess of loss basis to protect the
Company against individual risk severity of loss and the relatively low level of
catastrophe exposure that exists on this book of business.
 
    MARINE--The Company underwrites marine risks for ocean going vessels ("Blue
Water"), inland and coastal trading vessels ("Brown Water") and fishing vessels.
The coverages written include hull and machinery, liabilities (including
protection and indemnity), marine cargo and various ancillary coverages.
 
    The Company has underwritten marine risks since 1984. Rates increased
substantially between 1991 and 1993 and maintained an acceptable level of
profitability. However, recent competition has caused downward pressure on the
rates which has caused a reduction in GWP from $33.8 million in 1995 to $28.1
million in 1996. The Company believes rates will continue to soften during 1997.
 
    Treaty reinsurance is maintained on an excess of loss basis to protect the
Company against individual risk severity of loss and the relatively low level of
catastrophe exposure that exists on this book of business.
 
    OFFSHORE ENERGY--The Company has been underwriting offshore energy risks
since 1988. Offshore energy risks include drilling rigs, production and
gathering platforms, and pipelines. Coverages underwritten include physical
damage, liabilities, business interruption and various ancillary coverages.
 
    Rates have declined significantly during the past few years to levels where
profitability is unlikely. Underwriting has been on a very selective basis,
striving for quality rather than quantity, which has resulted in a continued
reduction in GWP from $20.1 million in 1994 to $8.5 million in 1996. The Company
anticipates a further decline in GWP and NWP during 1997 and continues to
evaluate the viability of this line of business.
 
    Treaty reinsurance is maintained on both a proportional and an excess of
loss basis to protect the Company against individual risk severity of loss and
the catastrophic exposure that exists, for example, from a hurricane in the Gulf
of Mexico.
 
    PROPERTY--The Company specializes in writing catastrophe exposed risks in
general and the property risks of large multinational corporations covering such
commercial risks as hotels, office buildings, retail locations, factories,
industrial plants, utilities, refineries, and natural gas and petrochemical
plants. Coverage includes business interruption and physical damage, including
flood and earthquake.
 
    The Company has written property business since 1986. GWP grew rapidly
beginning in 1993 as the Company expanded its underwriting into international
business, often in the same countries where it already wrote aviation and/or
marine business. Dramatic rate increases occurred during the period 1993 to 1995
due to the severe lack of catastrophe capacity resulting from the effects of
Hurricane Andrew and the Northridge Earthquake on the world's reinsurance
markets. With support from its reinsurers, the Company moved quickly to take
advantage of the changing market. During 1996, premium rates began to soften
toward the end of the year.
 
    GWP grew from $14.9 million in 1992 to $124.3 million in 1995, with a slight
decrease to $118.1 million in 1996. NWP also grew rapidly but substantial
reinsurance costs will always keep the actual premium retained significantly
smaller than GWP. In the absence of a major industry catastrophe loss, the
Company expects both GWP and NWP to decline during 1997 as premium rates
continue to soften.
 
    Treaty reinsurance is maintained on both a proportional and an excess of
loss basis to ensure adequate protection, particularly against catastrophe
exposures. The Company conservatively estimates its aggregate exposure in any
individual catastrophe zone and maintains catastrophe reinsurance to cover its
exposure to any one occurrence.
 
    ACCIDENT AND HEALTH--The Company began reinsuring accident and health risks
during 1996 which are produced by the agencies acquired during the year. The
risks underwritten include medical stop-loss insurance for employer sponsored
self-insured health plans; reinsurance in the medical, accident and health
special risk, workers' compensation and alternative workers' compensation areas;
and occupational
 
                                       7
<PAGE>
accident insurance for self-employed truckers. The Company underwrites
reinsurance in this area on both a proportional and excess of loss basis. The
Company expects GWP and NWP to increase significantly during 1997.
 
    REINSURANCE UNDERWRITING
 
    The Company engages in reinsurance underwriting on a periodic basis when
market rates and other conditions make it profitable to do so. The Company began
writing treaty reinsurance in 1984, but has been dramatically reducing its book
of business, particularly excess of loss business, due to the lack of adequate
reinsurance protection available at any reasonable cost.
 
    EXCESS OF LOSS--The Company previously wrote excess of loss reinsurance,
typically aviation, marine and non-marine catastrophe exposures. In 1992, due to
a general market contraction of available reinsurance for excess of loss
business, the Company was unable to purchase adequate protection at a reasonable
cost and, therefore, elected not to continue writing this class other than
selectively on a net basis. The run off of this line of business continues
profitably.
 
    PROPORTIONAL--The Company underwrites proportional reinsurance on a
selective basis. The exposures reinsured are typically the same type of risks
that the Company underwrites on a direct basis. The Company provides this
reinsurance to obtain a more diversified cross section of business which it
might not otherwise have access to and for reciprocity with companies with whom
it has an ongoing business relationship.
 
    FACULTATIVE--The Company underwrites facultative reinsurance in all of its
lines of business. Typically, this is on international business in order to
comply with local licensing requirements or as reinsurance of captives and
usually can be considered direct business, as the Company maintains underwriting
and claims control. However, all of this business is recorded under the caption
of "Reinsurance Assumed".
 
    HOUSTON CASUALTY COMPANY
 
    HCC, the Company's principal insurance company subsidiary, operates
worldwide in all of the lines of business in which the Company specializes.
HCC's business is produced by independent agents and brokers, the group's agency
subsidiaries, TIC, IMG and other insurance and reinsurance companies worldwide.
HCC has a highly experienced staff of underwriters trained to deal with the high
value, complicated exposures prevailing in the lines of business in which the
Company specializes. As of December 31, 1996, HCC had statutory policyholders'
surplus of $150.7 million.
 
    TRAFALGAR INSURANCE COMPANY
 
    HCC formed a wholly owned subsidiary, TIC, in 1993. TIC is an Oklahoma
domiciled property and casualty insurance company which currently underwrites
only domestic property risks and allows HCC to offer insurance on a surplus
lines basis in certain jurisdictions where HCC is not permitted to do so.
Applications for surplus lines approval are pending in many additional states
and TIC will expand its operations as approvals are received. As of December 31,
1996, TIC had statutory policyholders' surplus of $27.6 million.

<PAGE>
    IMG INSURANCE COMPANY LTD.
 
    Organized in September, 1991, as a Jordanian Exempt Company ("JEC"), IMG
conducts substantially all of its business outside of Jordan and is principally
engaged in insuring and reinsuring large commercial risks in substantially the
same lines of business as HCC. In connection with IMG's business, the Company
has agreed to unconditionally guarantee certain of the insurance and reinsurance
business of IMG. As of December 31, 1996, IMG had policyholders' surplus of
$59.3 million.
 
AGENCY OPERATIONS
 
    The Company's agency subsidiaries act on behalf of insurance and reinsurance
companies, conducting business in the areas of insurance and reinsurance
underwriting management and intermediary services. The agency subsidiaries do
not assume any insurance or reinsurance risk themselves. LDG, the largest of
these subsidiaries, manages and markets medical stop-loss and excess coverage
insurance products principally to employer sponsored self-insured health plans.
Other areas of LDG's business include medical, accident and health special risk,
workers' compensation and alternative workers' compensation and specialty
aviation reinsurance. NASRA acts as an insurance and reinsurance underwriting
manager in the area of occupational accident insurance (similar to workers'
compensation) to self-employed truckers. In addition, LDG and NASRA produce all
of the Company's accident and health business.
 
    HCCU and MEIB specialize in marketing and servicing large, complicated
insurance and reinsurance programs placed on behalf of multinational clients
operating in the same lines of business that the Company underwrites. Such
business is placed with domestic and international insurance companies,
including HCC, TIC, and IMG, on a direct basis and through intermediaries. In
addition, LDG, HCCU and MEIB act as reinsurance intermediaries on behalf of HCC,
TIC, IMG and other insurance companies, placing both facultative and treaty
reinsurance. The Company's revenue is composed of fee and commission income
which increased to $38.5 million in 1996 from $17.0 million in 1992. Management
expects continued growth in agency revenues in 1997, both from existing
operations and pending acquisitions.
 
REINSURANCE CEDED
 
    The Company principally utilizes reinsurance to reduce its net liability on
individual risks, to protect against catastrophic losses and to achieve a
desired ratio of NWP to policyholders' surplus. Various intermediaries,
including LDG, HCCU and MEIB, facilitate the placement of this reinsurance
coverage on behalf of the Company and are compensated, directly or indirectly,
by the reinsurers.
 
    Reinsurance is ceded under treaties on both a proportional (where the
reinsurer shares proportionately in premiums and losses) and an excess of loss
basis (where only losses above a fixed point are reinsured). The Company also
reinsures on a facultative (individual policy) basis on large individual risks.
Management believes that the Company reinsures its risks to a greater extent
than most of its competitors and most other insurance companies. This strategy
greatly reduces the likelihood of a significant net loss from insurance company
operations and protects the integrity of the Company's shareholders' equity.
Under its current reinsurance protections, the Company has limited its net
retained loss, across any single line of business, to a maximum of approximately
$1.0 million for any one risk, but significantly less on most risks.
 
    The type, cost and limits of reinsurance purchased can vary from year to
year based upon the Company's desired retention levels and the availability of
adequate reinsurance at a reasonable price. The majority of the Company's
reinsurance programs are renewed on a calendar year basis. For 1997, the Company
has been successful in renewing its reinsurance protections at reduced costs to
1996 and was able to expand its underwriting capacity. This expanded capacity
will assist the Company in taking advantage of underwriting opportunities as
they present themselves.
 
                                       9
<PAGE>
    The Company structures a specific reinsurance program for each line of
business it underwrites. This reinsurance is placed to protect the Company from
any foreseeable event; proportionally to cover frequency and for catastrophe
coverage; excess of loss to cover severity on an individual risk; and
catastrophe to cover losses involving multiple risks, such as those resulting
from a hurricane or an earthquake. The Company does not expose itself to a net
loss from an individual risk in excess of its reinsurance protection.
 
    The Company writes business in areas exposed to catastrophic losses and has
significant exposures to this type of loss in California, certain Gulf Coast
states and Mexico. The Company carefully assesses its overall exposures to a
single catastrophic event and applies procedures, that it believes are more
conservative than is typically used by the industry, to ascertain the Company's
probable maximum loss ("PML") from any single event. The Company maintains
reinsurance protection which it believes is sufficient to cover any foreseeable
event.
 
    The Company receives an overriding (ceding) commission on the premium ceded
to reinsurers which compensates the Company for the direct costs associated with
the production of the premium, the servicing of the business during the term of
the policies ceded, and the costs associated with the placement of the related
reinsurance. In addition, certain of the Company's reinsurance treaties allow
for a sharing with the Company by the reinsurers of the net profits generated
under such treaties.
 
    The ceding of reinsurance does not discharge the Company from liability to
its policyholders. The Company is required to pay losses even if the reinsurer
fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance contract. To minimize its
exposure to reinsurance credit risk, the Company places its reinsurance with a
diverse group of financially sound reinsurers. The Company's 1997 treaty
reinsurance program was placed with more than 56 domestic and foreign
reinsurers. As of December 31, 1996, the total amount recoverable from
reinsurers was approximately $123.2 million, of which $21.7 million represents
paid losses recoverable and $103.9 million represents outstanding losses
recoverable less a $2.4 million reserve for uncollectible reinsurance. In
addition, ceded unearned premium was $65.8 million. The Company held $67.9
million of irrevocable letters of credit and $9.1 million in cash to
collateralize a portion of the total amount recoverable and had other payable
balances due to its reinsurers of $89.6 million as potential offsets against
reinsurance recoverables.
 
    The following table sets forth the reinsurers with a total recoverable
balance greater than $10.0 million and the collateral and potential offsets held
by the Company as of December 31, 1996 (dollars in thousands):

    Due to the Company's financial analysis of active and potential reinsurers
and its conservative strategy of diversifying its reinsurers, the Company has
never incurred a significant loss on recoverables from reinsurers. The Company
has established a reserve of $2.4 million as of December 31, 1996, to reduce the
effects of any recoverable problem.

    While there is no statutory requirement regarding a permissible premium to
surplus ratio, guidelines established by the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners ("NAIC") provide that a property and casualty insurer's annual
statutory GWP should not exceed 900% and NWP should not exceed 300% of its
policyholders' surplus. In keeping with its philosophy of protecting its
shareholders' equity and limiting its aggregate loss exposure, the Company
maintains premium to surplus ratios significantly lower than such guidelines,
and, as indicated above, below industry norms.
 
    COMBINED RATIO
 
    The underwriting experience of a property and casualty insurance company is

RESERVES
 
    Applicable insurance laws and regulations, under which the Company operates,
require that reserves be maintained for the payment of loss and loss adjustment
expense ("LAE") with respect to both reported and incurred but not reported
("IBNR") claims under insurance and reinsurance policies issued by the Company.
The Company establishes reserves through an evaluation of each individual claim
rather than by any average reserving method. In the case of direct and
facultative reinsurance business, loss reserves are determined by evaluating
reported claims on the basis of the type of loss, jurisdiction of the
occurrence, knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim, severity of
injury or damage, potential for ultimate
 
                                       11
<PAGE>
exposure, experience with the insured and the line of business and policy
provisions relating to the particular type of claim. The Company establishes
loss reserves for excess of loss and proportional reinsurance claims based on
information and reports received from ceding companies. Loss reserves for IBNR
losses are determined in part on the basis of statistical information and in
part on industry experience with respect to the probable number and nature of
claims arising from occurrences which have not been reported. The Company does
not discount any of its loss reserves.
 
    The period of time between the occurrence of an insured event and the final
settlement of a claim may be many years, and during this period it often becomes
necessary to adjust the claim estimates either upward or downward. Certain
classes of marine and offshore energy insurance underwritten by the Company have
historically had long lead times between the occurrence of an insured event,
reporting of the claim to the Company, and final settlement. In such cases, the
Company is forced to estimate reserves over long periods of time, with the
possibility of several adjustments to reserves. Other classes of insurance, such
as property, historically have shorter lead times between the occurrence of an
insured event, reporting of the claim to the Company, and final settlement. The
reserves with respect to such property classes are, therefore, less likely to be
adjusted.
 
    The reserving process is intended to provide implicit recognition of the
impact of inflation and other factors affecting loss payments by taking into
account changes in historical payment patterns and perceived probable trends.
However, there is no precise method for the subsequent evaluation of the
adequacy of the consideration given to inflation, or to any other specific
factor, some of which are interdependent.
 
    The Company underwrites, directly and through reinsurance, risks which are
denominated in a number of foreign currencies, and therefore establishes and
maintains loss reserves with respect to these policies in the respective
currencies. These reserves are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, which may
have an effect on the Company's earnings. The Company continues to limit its
exposure to future currency fluctuations through the use of foreign currency
forward contracts.
 
    The following loss development triangle shows changes in reserves in
subsequent years from the prior loss estimates based on experience as of the end
of each succeeding year on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP"). The estimate is increased or decreased as more information becomes
known about the frequency and severity of losses for individual years. A
redundancy means the original estimate was higher than the current estimate; a
deficiency means that the current estimate is higher than the original estimate.

    The first line of each loss development triangle presents, for each of the
years indicated, the gross reserve liability including the reserve for IBNR
losses. The first section of each table shows, by year, the cumulative amounts
of loss and LAE paid as of the end of each succeeding year. The second section
sets forth the re-estimates in later years of incurred losses, including
payments, for the years indicated. The "cumulative redundancy (deficiency)"
represents, as of December 31, 1996, the difference between the latest
re-estimated reserves and the reserves as originally estimated.

(2) Changes in loss and LAE reserves on a GAAP basis, for losses occurring in
    prior years, reflect the net effect of the resolution of losses for other
    than the reserve value and the subsequent adjustments of loss reserves.
 
    During 1996, the Company had gross loss and LAE deficiency of $45.8 million.
The gross deficiency comes from two primary sources. The first source is the
development of several large claims on individual policies which were
substantially reinsured. These losses were either reported late or reserves were
increased as subsequent information became available. However, because these
policies were substantially reinsured, there is no material effect on a net
basis. The second source is the run-off of the excess of loss
 
                                       15
<PAGE>
"spiral" business the Company ceased writing in 1991. This development is due to
the delay in reporting of catastrophe losses by the London insurance market,
coupled with the unprecedented number of catastrophes and subsequent insurance
company insolvencies. As the Company did not have enough representative years'
underwriting experience to base a more accurate estimate on, significant gross
development has been experienced. However, this business is substantially
reinsured, thereby not having a material effect on the Company's current
operations or shareholders' equity.
 
    During 1996, the Company had net loss and LAE redundancy of $3.8 million
relating to prior year losses compared to a redundancy of $1.6 million in 1995.
The redundancies have been reflected in the statements of earnings for each year
as they occur.
 
    The Company has no material exposure to environmental pollution losses, as
the Company only began writing business in 1981 and policies issued by the
Company normally contain pollution exclusion clauses which limit pollution
coverage to "sudden and accidental" losses only, thus excluding intentional
(dumping) and seepage claims. Therefore, the Company should not experience any
material development in reserves from environmental pollution claims.
 
INVESTMENTS
 
    Insurance company investments must comply with applicable laws and
regulations which prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments.
In general, these laws and regulations permit investments, within specified
limits and subject to certain qualifications, in Federal, state and municipal
obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, real
estate mortgages and real estate. As of December 31, 1996, the Company had
$320.3 million of investment assets, the majority of which were held by HCC.
 
    The Company's investment policy is determined by the Company's Board of
Directors and is reviewed on a regular basis. Pursuant to its investment policy,
the Company concentrates its investments in obligations of states,
municipalities and political subdivisions, the interest income from which is
predominantly exempt from Federal income tax. The interest rates on these
securities are normally lower than rates on comparable taxable securities. The
Company's portfolio of fixed income securities available for sale principally
consists of intermediate term, tax-exempt securities. The Company generally
intends to hold such securities to maturity. However, the Company regularly
re-evaluates its position based upon market conditions, which may cause the
Company to restructure its portfolio and realize gains or losses in order to
maximize its total return on investments. Accordingly, all fixed income
securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market
value.
 
    The Company's financial statements reflect an unrealized ("mark-to-market")
gain on fixed income securities available for sale as of December 31, 1996, of
$2.1 million. Since the Company's intention is to hold these securities until
maturity, it does not currently expect to realize any significant gain or loss
on these investments.
 
    The Company has maintained a substantial level of cash and liquid short-term
instruments in order to maintain the ability to fund large physical damage
losses of the Company's insureds, should they occur. As of December 31, 1996,
the Company had cash and short-term investments of approximately $56.3 million.
The Company also maintains credit facilities which provide for $23 million in
bank lines of credit for the issuance of letters of credit and short-term
borrowings.
 
    From time to time the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts
as a hedge against foreign currency fluctuations, primarily British Pound
Sterling. The Company's balances denominated in foreign currency fluctuate as
transactions are recorded and settled. During 1996, the average Sterling
liability, for subsidiaries whose functional currency was the United States
dollar, was approximately L907,000 ($1.6 million at December 31, 1996, rate of
exchange) which was hedged by an average open forward contract balance of
approximately L460,000 ($785,000 at the December 31, 1996, rate of
 
                                       16
<PAGE>
exchange). There was one open foreign currency forward contract as of December
31, 1996, to purchase L500,000 ($856,000 at the December 31, 1996, rate of
exchange) with a maturity of January, 1997. During January, 1997, the Company
entered into a foreign currency forward contact totaling L500,000 ($856,000 at
the December 31, 1996, rate of exchange). The Company expects to continue to
limit its exposure to currency fluctuations through the use of foreign currency
forward contracts.
 
    The Company utilizes these foreign currency forward contracts strictly as a
hedge against existing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and it does not
do so as any form of speculative or trading investment.

COMPETITION
 
    The insurance business is generally highly competitive. The Company faces
competition from domestic and foreign insurers, some of whom are larger and have
greater financial, marketing and management resources than the Company. The
Company's profitability is affected by many other factors, including rate
competition, severity and frequency of claims, interest rates, state
regulations, court decisions, the judicial climate and general business
conditions, all of which are outside the control of the Company. The Company's
medical stop-loss business involves a diversified field of participants from
small start-up
 
                                       17
<PAGE>
operations to large, well-established organizations. While the medical stop-loss
business has been historically competitive, during the past several years there
has been significant growth in the number of medical stop-loss insurance
underwriters. The Company also faces intense and growing pressure from
alternatives to employer sponsored self-insured health plans, such as
fully-insured plans, HMOs and Point of Service plans, as well as from large well
established direct insurers and competing underwriting managers providing
similar medical stop-loss products to those offered by the Company to employer
sponsored self-insured health plans. Competition in the reinsurance marketplace
is primarily due to an increase in the number of reinsurers participating in the
market as well as a tendency by reinsureds to retain a greater percentage of
their own risk. The Company competes with other reinsurance underwriting
managers and domestic and international reinsurance companies. The Company's
results of operations may also be affected by the competition for reinsurance
business between broker reinsurance markets and direct reinsurance writers. The
Company also competes with many reinsurance intermediaries in the broker
reinsurance market, some of which are affiliated with primary insurance brokers
with substantial financial resources. In each of the above business areas, a
significant number of the Company's competitors have financial resources,
employees, facilities, market recognition, marketing, management, experience,
and other resources substantially greater than those of the Company.
 
REGULATION
 
    The operations of the Company are subject to state insurance laws and
regulations which require the licensing of insurance agents, brokers,
reinsurance intermediaries, reinsurance underwriting managers, and managing
general agents which regulate certain aspects of their business. These laws and
regulations are intended primarily for the protection of policyholders, rather
than shareholders of the licensed entities, and may include requirements for
certain provisions in contracts entered into between the Company and various
insurers or reinsurers, certain record keeping and reporting requirements,
advertising and business practice rules, and other matters. The Company's
business depends on obtaining and maintaining licenses and approvals pursuant to
which it operates, as well as compliance with pertinent regulations. In addition
to the regulatory supervision of the insurance subsidiaries of the Company, the
Company is subject to regulation under the Texas Insurance Holding Company
System Regulatory Act, which contains certain reporting requirements including
registration and the filing of annual reports. In such registration and annual
reports, the Company is required to provide current information regarding its
capital structure, general financial condition, ownership, management, and the
identity of each member of its insurance holding company system. The Company is
also required in such registration and annual reports to disclose certain
agreements and transactions between the Company and its affiliates, which must
satisfy certain standards set forth in the Texas Insurance Code. There can be no
assurance given that the Company has all such required licenses, approvals of
complying contracts or that such licenses, approvals or complying contracts can
always be obtained or continued. In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and
regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory
authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad
discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals, and to implement
regulations, and licenses may be denied or revoked for various reasons,
including the violations of such regulations, conviction of crimes and the like.
In some instances, the Company follows practices based on its interpretations,
or those that it believes may be generally followed by the industry, which may
be different from the requirements or interpretations of regulatory authorities.
Accordingly, the possibility exists that the Company may be precluded or
temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of its activities or
otherwise penalized in a given jurisdiction. Such preclusion or suspension could
have a materially adverse effect on the business and results of operations of
the Company.
 
    HCC is licensed as an admitted insurer in Texas, is an approved surplus
lines insurer and an accredited reinsurer in Oklahoma and Maryland, is an
approved surplus lines insurer in 32 states, and is otherwise permitted to write
surplus lines insurance in nine more states, the District of Columbia, Guam and
Puerto Rico. All surplus lines insurance is written through licensed surplus
lines insurance brokers, who are required to ensure that no licensed admitted
insurer will write a particular risk prior to placing that risk

with a surplus lines insurer. TIC is licensed as an admitted insurer in
Oklahoma, is an approved surplus lines insurer and an accredited reinsurer in
Texas, is a surplus line insurer in seven states and is otherwise permitted to
write surplus lines insurance in nine more states and the District of Columbia.
IMG is a JEC licensed as a property and casualty insurance company. Due to its
status as a JEC, IMG cannot write Jordanian domiciled business directly, but can
write reinsurance of Jordanian risks.
 
    Under the laws of its domiciliary state (Texas), HCC may only pay dividends
out of its statutory earned surplus. The maximum amount of dividends that HCC
may pay without prior regulatory approval in any twelve month period is the
greater of its statutory net investment income for the prior year, or 10% of its
statutory policyholders' surplus as of the prior year end, which at December 31,
1996, was $15.1 million. Under the laws of the State of Oklahoma, TIC may only
pay dividends out of surplus funds. The maximum amount TIC may pay without prior
regulatory approval is the greater of statutory net income excluding realized
capital gains or 10% of statutory capital and surplus, which at December 31,
1996 was $2.8 million. As of December 31, 1996, HCC's total adjusted capital was
1,332% of the NAIC authorized control level risk-based capital and TIC's total
adjusted capital was 17,928% of the NAIC authorized control level risk-based
capital.
 
PENDING LEGISLATION
 
    In recent years state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that
alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate insurance
companies and insurance holding company systems. In addition, the NAIC and state
insurance regulators, as part of the NAIC's state insurance department
accreditation program, have re-examined existing laws and regulations,
specifically focusing on insurance company investments, issues relating to the
solvency of insurance companies, licensing and market conduct issues,
interpretations of existing laws, the development of new laws, and the
definition of extraordinary dividends. In addition, Congress and certain Federal
agencies have conducted investigations of the current condition of the insurance
industry in the United States to determine whether to impose Federal regulation
of insurers and reinsurers. From time to time, Congress and certain states have
considered various legislative proposals which would provide for governmental
earthquake insurance coverage. Legislation has been introduced in Congress that
could result in the Federal government's assuming some role in the regulation of
the insurance industry. The Company does not know at this time the extent to
which such Federal or state legislative or regulatory initiatives will be
adopted, and no assurance can be given that they would not have a material
adverse effect on the Company.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
    As of December 31, 1996, the Company had 331 employees, which included seven
executive, seventeen senior management and 45 other management personnel. The
average experience in the insurance industry and tenure with the Company of the
executive and senior management personnel was 21 and eight years, respectively.
The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and has not
experienced work stoppages or strikes as a result of labor disputes. The Company
considers relations with its employees to be good.

- --------------------------
 
(1) In a 1987 private placement, the Company sold shares of redeemable common
    stock, which incorporated a redemption obligation requiring the Company to
    repurchase such shares at a specified multiple of the then current book
    value. Prior to its October, 1992 initial public offering, the Company
    executed an agreement with the holders of the redeemable common stock
    whereby the redemption obligation would terminate upon the effective date of
    the initial public offering. During the period in which the redemption
    obligation was in force, the Company was required to reduce its earnings by
    an amount equal to the increase in the redemption value of the redeemable
    common stock and concurrently increase the book value of the redeemable
    common stock by a like amount. On October 28, 1992, the effective date of
    the Company's initial public offering, the redemption obligation terminated.
 
(2) These amounts have been adjusted to reflect the effects of the three-for-two
    stock split payable as a 50% stock dividend to shareholders of record March
    15, 1994, and the five-for-two stock split payable as a 150% stock dividend
    to shareholders of record April 30, 1996.
 
(3) Book value per share is calculated by dividing shares outstanding into total
    shareholders' equity. Net tangible book value per share uses total
    shareholders' equity less goodwill as the numerator.
 
(4) Effective October 1, 1994, the Company acquired 100% of the stock of IMG and
    MEIB. Both acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method.
    Therefore, the results of operations from both companies are included in the
    consolidated statements of earnings beginning October 1, 1994 and assets and
    liabilities of IMG and MEIB have been included in the consolidated balance
    sheets beginning October 1, 1994.
 
(5) On May 24, 1996, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock
    of LDG. This business combination has been accounted for as a
    pooling-of-interests and, accordingly, the consolidated financial data shown
    in this table has been restated to include the accounts and operations of
    LDG for all periods presented. On November 27, 1996, the Company acquired
    100% of the outstanding shares of NASRA. This combination has been accounted
    for as a pooling-of-interests. However, the Company's consolidated financial
    statements have not been restated due to immateriality.
 
(6) The pro forma amounts shown include the following adjustments relating to
    the merger of LDG and HCCH: a) to eliminate the non-recurring compensatory
    stock grant and expenses related to the merger, and b) to reflect
    appropriate Federal income tax expense on LDG's earnings for the period LDG
    was an S Corporation.

UNCERTAINTY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISK OF A SIGNIFICANT NATURAL
DISASTER, THE INABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO REINSURE CERTAIN RISKS, THE ADEQUACY
OF ITS LOSS RESERVES, EXPANSION OR CONTRACTION IN ITS VARIOUS LINES OF BUSINESS,

GENERAL
 
    The Company's primary sources of revenue are earned premium and investment
income derived from its insurance operations, and fee and commission income from
its insurance agency operations. The Company's core underwriting activities
involve providing aviation, marine, offshore energy, property, and accident and
health insurance, which is underwritten on both a direct and a reinsurance
basis. The Company concentrates on first party, physical damage coverages and
lines of business which have relatively short lead times between the occurrence
of an insured event and the reporting of claims to the Company. The Company also
selectively underwrites a small amount of excess treaty reinsurance. The
Company's agencies market and service medical stop-loss, occupational accident
and excess coverage insurance products plus large complicated insurance and
reinsurance programs on behalf of multinational clients. They also place
reinsurance for the Company's insurance operations and other insurance
companies.
 
    During recent years, the Company has substantially increased its capital and
surplus through the issuance of equity securities, incurrence of debt, and
earnings, thereby enabling it to increase its underwriting capacity. The Company
has utilized this additional capital by increasing underwriting activity across
many of its core lines of business, emphasizing lines of business and individual
opportunities with the most favorable underwriting characteristics at a
particular point in time. In each line of business, the Company also cedes
premiums through the purchase of reinsurance in types and amounts appropriate to
the line of business, market conditions and the Company's desired net risk
retention profile. Accordingly, the Company has substantially increased both its
GWP and NWP, although with different relative increases in each line of
business. In addition, because the Company's operating expense and loss and LAE
have not increased as quickly as its premium volume, the Company has been able
to substantially expand its operating margins.

</TABLE>
 
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 VERSUS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995
 
    Total revenue during 1996 increased 20% to $152.2 million from $127.2
million in 1995. 1996 GWP decreased to $230.8 million from $239.0 million in
1995, while 1996 NWP decreased from $98.8 million to $96.8 million. The decrease
in written premium was a result of the planned exit from the offshore energy
business as a result of increased competition that has driven rates below
acceptable levels, as well as the softening in marine rates and, more recently,
property rates. Net earned premium in 1996 increased from $80.0 million to $93.3
million, reflecting the large increase in written premium during 1995.
 
    Fee and commission (non-risk bearing) income in 1996 increased 17% to $38.5
million from $32.9 million in 1995, reflecting increased agency activities. Net
investment income increased 16% to $15.4 million in 1996 from $13.3 million in
1995 reflecting a higher level of investment assets.
 
    Realized investment gains from sales of marketable equity securities were
$5.3 million during 1996 compared to $1.1 million during 1995. Realized
investment losses from dispositions of fixed income securities were $201,000
during 1996, compared to losses of $11,000 during 1995. During 1996, the Company
liquidated most of its equity security portfolio and redeployed those investment
assets into fixed income securities.
 
    Loss and LAE increased $1.5 million in 1996, to $51.2 million, reflecting
the overall increase in business. During 1996, the Company had net loss and LAE
redundancy of $3.8 million relating to prior
 
                                       25
<PAGE>
year losses compared to a redundancy of $1.6 million in 1995. However, during
1996, the Company had gross loss and LAE deficiency of $45.8 million. The gross
deficiency comes from two primary sources. The first source is the development
of several large claims on individual policies which were substantially
reinsured. These losses were either reported late or reserves were increased as
subsequent information became available. However, because these policies were
substantially reinsured, there is no material effect on a net basis. The second
source is the run-off of the excess of loss "spiral" business which the Company
ceased writing in 1991. This development is due to the delay in reporting of
catastrophe losses by the London market, coupled with the unprecedented number
of catastrophes and subsequent insurance company insolvencies. As the Company
did not have enough representative years' underwriting experience upon which to
base a more accurate estimate, significant gross development has been
experienced. However, this business is substantially reinsured, thereby not
having a material effect on the Company's current operations or shareholders'
equity. The Company continues to believe it has materially provided for all net
incurred losses.
 
    Compensation expense decreased $6.4 million or 24% in 1996, to $20.4 million
due primarily to changes in compensation to LDG's previous principal
shareholders.
 
    Interest expense during 1996 decreased 48% to $1.2 million from $2.2 million
during 1995 due to the reduced level of indebtedness as a portion of the
proceeds of a June, 1995, public offering of Common Stock which was used to
retire debt.
 
    Income tax expense decreased to $7.3 million in 1996, compared to $9.0
million in 1995. The decrease in income tax expense was a result of a deferred
tax benefit of $9.6 million which was recorded in connection with the
compensatory stock grant to certain LDG employees. Also, as an S corporation,
LDG was exempt from Federal income taxes through May 21, 1996. Had LDG been
subject to Federal income taxes for both years, additional income tax expense of
$2.3 million and $722,000 would have been recorded during the years ended
December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
 
    Net earnings increased 20% to $29.3 million in 1996 from $24.3 million in
1995. Included in these amounts were merger related expenses of $2.1 million and
a non-recurring compensation expense of $14.4 million (net of a $9.6 million tax
benefit) recorded by LDG in connection with a compensatory stock grant from
LDG's majority shareholder to certain key employees prior to the Company's May,
1996, acquisition of LDG. The compensation expense was a non-cash item however,
$9.6 million of actual cash tax savings will be recognized. Earnings per share
increased 8% to $0.81 in 1996 from $0.75 in 1995. Excluding the non-recurring
compensation charge and the merger related expenses, net earnings in 1996 would
have been $43.7 million, an increase of 56% over comparable 1995 amounts and
earnings per share would have been $1.21, a 41% increase over comparable 1995
amounts. The non-recurring compensation expense also caused the net loss for the
agency segment during 1996.
 
    The Company's insurance company subsidiaries' statutory combined ratio was
72.0% for 1996 compared to 74.9% in 1995. The Company's combined ratio remains
significantly better than the industry average.
 
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 VERSUS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994
 
    Total revenue during 1995 increased 49% to $127.2 million from $85.5 million
in 1994. GWP increased 24% to $239.0 million from $192.9 million in 1994, while
1995 NWP increased 65% from $59.7 million to $98.8 million. Accordingly, net
earned premium in 1995 increased 71% from $46.8 million to $80.0 million. These
increases were due to substantial new business, rate increases on some renewals,
particularly property and aviation, and increased retentions.
 
    Fee and commission (non-risk bearing) income in 1995 increased 16% to $32.9
million from $28.5 million in 1994, reflecting increased agency activities. Net
investment income increased 39% to $13.3 million in 1995 from $9.5 million in
1994 reflecting a substantially higher level of investment assets due to
increased operating cash flow and the deployment of the proceeds from a public
offering of the Company's Common Stock.
 
                                       26
<PAGE>
    Realized investment gains from sales of marketable equity securities were
$1.1 million during 1995 compared to $775,000 during 1994. Realized investment
losses from sales of fixed income securities were $11,000 during 1995, compared
to losses of $89,000 during 1994.
 
    Loss and LAE increased $20.2 million in 1995, to $49.8 million, reflecting
the overall increase in business written. During 1995, the Company had net loss
and LAE redundancy of $1.6 million relating to prior year losses compared to a
deficiency of $717,000 in 1994. However, during 1995, the Company had gross loss
and LAE deficiency of $18.4 million. A substantial portion of this gross
deficiency relates to the run-off of the excess of loss "spiral" business which
the Company ceased writing in 1991. This development is due to the delay in
reporting of catastrophe losses by the London market, coupled with the
unprecedented number of catastrophes and subsequent insurance company
insolvencies. As the Company did not have enough representative years'
underwriting experience to base a more accurate estimate on, significant gross
development has been experienced. However, this business is substantially
reinsured, thereby not having a material effect on the Company's current
operations or shareholders' equity. The Company continues to believe it has
materially provided for all net incurred losses.
 
    Interest expense during 1995 increased 14% to $2.2 million from $2.0 million
during 1994 due to the increased level of indebtedness during the first six
months of 1995, which was incurred during late 1994 to fund the acquisitions of
IMG and MEIB.
 
    Net earnings increased 59% to $24.3 million from $15.3 million in 1994. This
increase was principally a result of more efficient and continued profitable
underwriting plus higher investment income and fee and commission income.
 
    Earnings per share in 1995 increased 36% to $0.75 from $0.55 in 1994. This
reflects the 59% increase in net earnings partially offset by the 17% increase
in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of HCCH's 1994 acquisitions
and 1995 public stock offering.
 
    HCCH's insurance company subsidiaries' statutory combined ratio was 74.9%
for 1995 compared to 74.8% in 1994. HCCH's combined ratio remains significantly
better than the industry average.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
    HCCH completed an initial public offering of 1,437,500 shares (pre splits)
of Common Stock during October, 1992 and secondary public offerings of 1,254,200
shares (pre splits) of Common Stock in September, 1993 and 2,012,500 shares (pre
split) of Common Stock in June, 1995. The offerings dramatically improved the
capital resources of the Company. The net proceeds of the offerings have been
used to reduce the Company's indebtedness and to contribute capital to the
insurance company subsidiaries. HCC now has more than $150 million in
policyholders' surplus and IMG has more than $59 million. This additional
capital enables both HCC and IMG to write significantly more premium income. The
initial public offering also resulted in the termination of all redemption
rights previously held by certain shareholders.
 
    The Company receives substantial cash from premiums and reinsurance
recoverables, and, to a lesser extent, investment income, proceeds from sales
and redemptions of investment assets and fee and commission income. The
principal cash outflows are for the payment of claims, payment of premiums to
reinsurers, purchase of investments, debt service, LAE, policy acquisition
costs, operating expense, income and other taxes and dividends.
 
    During 1996, HCC renewed its existing credit facility which provides for a
$12 million bank line of credit for the issuance of letters of credit and for
short-term borrowings at the prime rate of interest. This line is collateralized
by securities with a market value equal to 125% of the total sum of the letters
of credit issued and cash advances outstanding. This facility matures on April
30, 1997. As of December 31, 1996, letters of credit in the amount of $4.6
million were issued on behalf of the HCC to collateralize certain reinsurance
obligations, however no cash advances were outstanding under this line and,
therefore, $7.4 million is available for short-term borrowings under this
facility.
 
                                       27
<PAGE>
    In January, 1997, the Company obtained an additional bank line of credit for
$10.0 million. This credit facility provides for short-term borrowings and
matures April 30, 1998. Interest is payable quarterly at either (i) variable at
the banks prime rate; or (ii) fixed at the London Interbank Offering Rate
("LIBOR") plus 1 1/2%, at the option of the Company. The line of credit is
collateralized by a pledge of all capital stock of HCC. This new line of credit
improves the Company's short term liquidity.
 
    On September 14, 1993, HCCH borrowed $29.25 million from a bank. HCCH used
the proceeds to retire previous indebtedness and make a $10.0 million capital
contribution to HCC. The principal terms of the note, which matures on October
1, 1998 are (i) quarterly principal repayments of $1.5 million, increasing to
$1.75 million; (ii) interest at the prime lending rate; (iii) collateralization
by a pledge of all capital stock of HCC and substantially all of the common
stock of IMG; and (iv) certain restrictive terms and conditions including
restrictions on certain transactions in the Company's Common Stock or the
capital stock of HCC and IMG and the maintenance of required financial ratios.
During February, 1994, the note was amended by fixing the interest rate at 6.5%
until February 7, 1997. Thereafter, the rate reverts to the prime lending rate
or LIBOR plus 2.25%, at the Company's option. Additionally, the loan agreement
prohibits the payment of dividends by the Company without the bank's approval.
During 1995, the Company prepaid the first two installments of $1.5 million due
in 1996. The bank deferred the second two installments due in 1996 until
maturity. The Company paid the first 1997 quarterly payment of $1.5 million in
January, 1997.
 
    The Company maintains a substantial level of cash and liquid short-term
investments which are used to meet anticipated payment obligations. As of
December 31, 1996, the Company had cash and short-term investments of
approximately $56.3 million. The Company's consolidated investment portfolio of
$320.3 million as of December 31, 1996, is available to provide additional
liquidity and cash for operations.
 
    Property and casualty insurance companies domiciled in the State of Texas
are limited in the payment of dividends to its shareholders in any 12 month
period, without the prior written consent of the Commissioner of Insurance, to
the greater of net investment income or 10% of statutory policyholders' surplus.
HCC paid no dividends in 1996 to HCCH. During 1997, HCC's ordinary dividend
capacity will be approximately $15.1 million.
 
    The Company believes that its operating cash flows, short-term investments
and the bank lines of credit will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to
meet its anticipated needs for the foreseeable future.
 
    At December 31, 1996, the Company had a net deferred tax asset of $11.5
million. Due to the Company's history of consistent earnings, strong operating
cash flows, expectations for the future and the ability to hold investments to
maturity, it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to realize
the benefit of its deferred tax asset.
 
    As of December 31, 1996, HCC's total adjusted capital was $150.7 million,
which is 1,332% of the NAIC authorized control level risk-based capital while
TIC's total adjusted capital was $27.6 million, which is 17,928% of the NAIC
authorized control level risk-based capital.
 
    Industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that a property and casualty
insurer's annual statutory GWP should not exceed 900% of its statutory
policyholders' surplus and NWP should not exceed 300% of its statutory
policyholders' surplus. The Company maintains a premium to surplus ratio
significantly lower than such guidelines, and for the year ended December 31,
1996, its annual statutory GWP was 108.8% of its statutory policyholders'
surplus and NWP was 45.6% of its statutory policyholders' surplus.
 
IMPACT OF INFLATION
 
    The Company's operations, like those of other property and casualty
insurers, are susceptible to the effects of inflation, as premiums are
established before the ultimate amounts of loss and LAE are known. Although
management considers the potential effects of inflation when setting premiums,
for competitive reasons, such premiums may not adequately compensate the Company
for the effects of inflation. However, as the majority of the Company's business
is comprised of lines which have short lead times
 
                                       28
<PAGE>
between the occurrence of an insured event, reporting of the claims to the
Company and the final settlement of the claims, the effects of inflation are
minimized.
 
    A significant portion of the Company's revenue is related to healthcare
insurance and reinsurance products which are subject to the effects of the
underlying inflation of medical costs. Such inflation in the costs of healthcare
tends to generate increases in premiums for medical stop-loss coverage,
resulting in greater revenue, but also higher claim payments. Inflation may have
a negative impact on insurance and reinsurance operations by causing higher
claim settlements than may originally have been estimated without an immediate
increase in premiums to a level necessary to maintain profit margins being
possible. No express provision for inflation is made, although trends are
considered when setting underwriting terms and claim reserves for purposes of
determining revenue from underwriting profit commission. Such reserves are
subject to a continuing review process to assess their adequacy and are adjusted
as deemed appropriate. In addition, the market value of the investments held by
the Company varies depending on economic and market conditions and interest
rates, which are highly sensitive to the policies of governmental and regulatory
authorities. Any significant change in interest rates could therefore have a
material adverse effect on the market value of the Company's investments.
 
EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS
 
    The Company underwrites risks which are denominated in a number of foreign
currencies. It establishes and maintains loss reserves with respect to these
policies in their respective currencies. These reserves are subject to exchange
rate fluctuations which can have an effect on the Company's net earnings. The
Company's principal area of exposure is with respect to fluctuation in the
exchange rate between the British Pound Sterling and the United States Dollar.
For the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, the gain (loss) from
currency conversion was ($181,000), ($209,000) and $203,000, respectively.
 
    From time to time the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts
as a hedge against foreign currency fluctuations, primarily British Pound
Sterling. The Company's balances denominated in foreign currency fluctuate as
transactions are recorded and settled. During 1996, the average Sterling
liability, for subsidiaries whose functional currency was the United States
dollar, was approximately L907,000 ($1.6 million at the December 31, 1996, rate
of exchange) which was hedged by an average open forward contract balance of
approximately L460,000 ($785,000 at the December 31, 1996, rate of exchange).
There was one open foreign currency forward contract as of December 31, 1996, to
purchase L500,000 ($856,000 at the December 31, 1996, rate of exchange) with a
maturity of January, 1997. During January, 1997, the Company entered into a
foreign currency forward contract totaling L500,000 ($856,000 at the December
31, 1996, rate of exchange). The Company expects to continue to limit its
exposure to currency fluctuations through the use of foreign currency forward
contracts.
 
    The Company utilizes these foreign currency forward contracts strictly as a
hedge against existing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and it does not
do so as any form of speculative or trading investment.
 
EFFECTS OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
    In February, 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS
No.128 "Earnings Per Share". SFAS No.128 is effective for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 1997. Early application is not permitted. SFAS No.128
modifies the denominator to be used in the earnings per share calculations, and
requires additional disclosures of the calculations. However, the statement will
have no effect on the Company's net earnings, shareholders' equity or cash
flows.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc.
 
    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HCC
Insurance Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and
the related consolidated statements of earnings, changes in shareholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1996. These financial statements are the responsibility of HCC Insurance
Holdings, Inc.'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the 1994
financial statements of LDG Management Company Incorporated and Affiliates,
which statements reflect total revenues constituting 30 percent and net earnings
constituting 12 percent of the related consolidated financial statement totals
for the year ended December 31, 1994. Those statements were audited by other
auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it
relates to data included for LDG Management Company Incorporated and Affiliates
for 1994, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.
 
    We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
    In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors,
the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of HCC Insurance
Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

    We have audited the combined statements of earnings, changes in
shareholders' equity, and cash flow of LDG Management Company Incorporated (an S
corporation) and Affiliates (S corporations) for the year ended December 31,
1994. These combined financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companies' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
combined financial statements based on our audit.
 
    We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the combined financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the combined financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
 
    In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the combined results of operations of LDG
Management Company Incorporated and Affiliates and their cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
(1) GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES
 
    HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "the
Company" or "HCCH"), include domestic and foreign property and casualty
insurance companies and managing general agents, surplus lines insurance brokers
and wholesale insurance and reinsurance brokers. HCCH, through its subsidiaries,
provides specialized property and casualty insurance to commercial customers
worldwide, underwritten on both a direct and reinsurance basis, in the areas of
aviation, marine, property, offshore energy and accident and health. The
principal insurance company subsidiaries are Houston Casualty Company ("HCC")
and Trafalgar Insurance Company ("TIC") in Houston, Texas and IMG Insurance
Company Ltd. ("IMG") in Amman, Jordan. The agency subsidiaries provide
underwriting management and intermediary services for insurance and reinsurance
companies, primarily in the accident and health area, but also in the same lines
of business that the insurance subsidiaries operate. The principal agency
subsidiaries are LDG Management Company Incorporated ("LDG") in Wakefield,
Massachusetts, HCC Underwriters, A Texas Corporation ("HCCU") in Houston, Texas;
North American Special Risk Associates, Inc. ("NASRA") in Northbrook, Illinois
and Middle East Insurance Brokers, Ltd. ("MEIB") in Amman, Jordan.
 
    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions. This affects amounts reported in the financial statements and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
 
    A description of the significant accounting and reporting policies utilized
by the Company in preparing the consolidated financial statements is as follows:
 
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
 
    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The business combinations
with LDG and NASRA have been recorded as poolings-of-interests. The Company's
financial statements have been restated to include the accounts and operations
of LDG for all periods presented. The financial statements have not been
restated to include NASRA due to immateriality. (see note 2).
 
INVESTMENTS
 
    Fixed income securities and marketable equity securities are classified as
available for sale and are carried at quoted market value, if readily
marketable, or at management's estimated fair value, if not readily marketable.
The change in unrealized gain or loss with respect to these securities is
recorded as a direct increase or decrease to shareholders' equity, net of
related deferred income tax, if any. Fixed income securities available for sale
are purchased with the original intent to hold to maturity, but which may be
available for sale if market conditions warrant, or if the Company's investment
policies dictate, in order to maximize the Company's investment yield. Mortgage
loans on real estate are stated at the aggregate unpaid principal balance less
unamortized fees. Short-term investments and restricted short-term investments
are carried at cost which approximates market value.
 
    The realized gain or loss on investment transactions is determined on an
average cost basis and included in earnings on the trade date. When impairment
of the value of an investment is considered other than temporary, the decrease
in value is reported in earnings as a realized investment loss and a new cost
basis is established.

(1) GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES
(CONTINUED)
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
 
    Property and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation expense is provided using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets. Amortization of leasehold
improvements is provided using the straight-line method over the term of the
respective lease. Upon disposal of assets, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is
included in earnings.
 
    Costs incurred in developing or purchasing management information systems
are capitalized and included in property and equipment. These costs are
amortized over their estimated useful lives from the dates the systems are
placed in service.
 
EARNED PREMIUM, DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS AND CEDING COMMISSIONS OF
  INSURANCE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES
 
    Written premium, net of reinsurance, is generally included in earnings on a
pro rata basis over the lives of the related policies. Policy acquisition costs
related to unearned premium, which include commissions, taxes, fees and other
direct costs of underwriting policies and ceding commissions allowed by
reinsurers, which include expense allowances, are deferred and charged or
credited to earnings on the same basis. Historical and current loss and loss
adjustment expense experience are considered in determining the recoverability
of deferred policy acquisition costs.
 
FEE AND COMMISSION INCOME
 
    Fee and commission income is recognized on the revenue recognition date,
which is the later of the effective date of the policy, the date when the
premium can be reasonably estimated, or the date when substantially all required
services relating to the insurance placement have been rendered to the client.
Commission income relating to additional or return premiums or other policy
adjustments is recognized when the events occur and the amounts become known or
can be estimated.
 
PREMIUM AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
 
    The Company has adopted the gross method for reporting receivables and
payables on brokered transactions.
 
    Management considers all premium and other receivables to be collectable
and, therefore, has not recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts.
 
LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE OF INSURANCE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES
 
    Loss and loss adjustment expense is based on undiscounted estimates of
payments to be made for reported and incurred but not reported losses ("IBNR"),
net of reinsurance and anticipated salvage and subrogation receipts. Estimates
for reported losses are based on all available information, including reports
received from ceding companies on assumed business. Estimates for IBNR are based
both on the Company's and industry experience. While management believes that
amounts included in the accompanying financial statements are adequate, such
estimates may be more or less than the amounts ultimately

(CONTINUED)
paid when the claims are settled. The estimates are continually reviewed and any
changes are reflected in current operations.
 
REINSURANCE
 
    The Company records all reinsurance recoverables and ceded unearned premiums
as assets and deferred ceding commissions as a liability. All such amounts are
estimated and recorded in a manner consistent with the underlying reinsured
contracts. Management has recorded a reserve for uncollectible reinsurance based
on estimates of collectability.
 
GOODWILL
 
    In connection with the Company's acquisitions of subsidiaries during 1994,
the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired is being amortized
using the straight-line method over forty years. Management of the acquired
businesses have successfully operated in the Companies' insurance markets for a
number of years and, with the additional capital provided by the Company, will
be positioned to take advantage of increased underwriting opportunities.
 
    The Company has no reason to expect major changes in the business conditions
in which the acquired companies operate which might affect the recoverability of
the recorded intangibles. However, in the event business conditions change, the
recoverability will be re-evaluated based upon revised projections of future
undiscounted operating income and cash flows and, if impaired, the balances will
be adjusted accordingly. Amortization charged to income for the years ended
December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, was $289,000, $289,000 and $72,000,
respectively.
 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
 
    For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company
considers certificates of deposit, corporate demand notes receivable and
commercial paper with original maturities of three months or less and money
market funds as cash equivalents. These amounts are shown as short-term
investments in the consolidated balance sheets. In conjunction with the
management of reinsurance pools, the Company's agency subsidiaries withhold
premium funds for the payment of claims which are shown as restricted cash and
short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets.
 
    The Company generally invests its excess cash with major banks and in
investment grade commercial paper and repurchase agreements. These securities
typically mature within 90 days and, therefore, bear minimal risk. The Company
has not experienced any losses on these investments.
 
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
 
    The functional currency of most foreign subsidiaries is the United States
dollar. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated
into United States dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet
date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange
in effect on the date the transaction occurs. The Company's foreign currency
transactions are principally denominated in British Pound Sterling. From time to
time the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts as a hedge
against foreign currency fluctuations. Gains or losses in the market value of
foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in the statements of earnings
concurrently with the gains and losses on

the hedged balances. For the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, the
gain (loss) from currency conversion was ($181,000), ($209,000) and $203,000,
respectively.
 
    One subsidiary has a functional currency of the British Pound Sterling
("GBP"). Cumulative translation adjustment, representing the effect of
translating this subsidiary's assets and liabilities into United States dollars
is included in the foreign currency translation adjustment within shareholders'
equity.
 
INCOME TAX
 
    The domestic companies and the foreign insurance company subsidiaries (which
have all elected to be taxed as domestic companies) file a single consolidated
Federal income tax return and include the foreign subsidiaries' income to the
extent required by law. Deferred income tax is accounted for using the liability
method, which reflects the tax impact of temporary differences between the bases
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such bases as
measured by tax laws and regulations. LDG was an S Corporation prior to its
reorganization and merger with the Company. Therefore, Federal income tax
expense was not provided for LDG's earnings until the S Corporation election was
terminated. LDG is included in the Company's consolidated Federal income tax
return beginning May 24, 1996.
 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
    Earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common and
common equivalent shares outstanding during the year divided into net earnings.
The shares issued in connection with the combination with LDG are included in
outstanding shares for all periods presented. Outstanding common stock options,
when dilutive, are considered to be common stock equivalents for the purpose of
this calculation. The treasury stock method is used to calculate common stock
equivalents due to options. The difference between primary and fully diluted
earnings per share is not material.
 
STOCK SPLITS
 
    In February, 1994, the Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock
split in the form of a 50% stock dividend on its shares of $1.00 par value
Common Stock payable to shareholders of record March 15, 1994. This stock split
was recorded retroactively as of December 31, 1993. In April, 1996, the Board of
Directors declared a five-for-two stock split in the form of a 150% stock
dividend on the Company's $1.00 par value Common Stock, payable to shareholders
of record April 30, 1996. The par value of the Company's Common Stock remains
unchanged. All per share, weighted average shares outstanding and option data
presented in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto have
been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the splits.
 
EFFECTS OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
    In February, 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
128 "Earnings Per Share". SFAS No. 128 is effective for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 1997. Early application is not permitted. SFAS No. 128
modifies the denominator to be used in the earnings per share calculations, and
requires additional disclosures of the calculations. However, the statement will
have no effect on the Company's net earnings, shareholders' equity or cash
flows.

RECLASSIFICATIONS
 
    Certain amounts in the 1995 and 1994 consolidated financial statements have
been reclassified to conform with the 1996 presentation. Such reclassifications
had no effect on the Company's shareholders' equity, net earnings or cash flows.
 
(2) ACQUISITIONS
 
IMG AND MEIB
 
    Effective January 1, 1994, the Company acquired a 25% interest in MEIB.
Concurrent with the purchase of IMG on October 1, 1994, the Company acquired the
remaining 75% interest, thereby making MEIB a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company. To acquire 100% interest of MEIB the Company issued 109,524 shares (pre
split) of its Common Stock and paid a total of $3.9 million. During the first
nine months of 1994, the Company accounted for its 25% interest using the equity
method and beginning October 1, 1994, MEIB's results of operations have been
included in the consolidated statements of earnings.
 
    Effective October 1, 1994, the Company acquired 100% of the stock of IMG.
IMG specializes in insuring large commercial risks, with an emphasis on energy
related business. In exchange for IMG's stock, the Company issued 838,095 shares
(pre split) of its Common Stock and paid $4.4 million. IMG's results of
operations have been included in the consolidated statements of earnings
beginning October 1, 1994.
 
    Both acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method. In each case
the purchase price was allocated to assets acquired based on their estimated
fair values. On a combined basis, the fair value of assets acquired was
approximately $29.0 million and the fair value of liabilities assumed was
approximately $18.3 million. This resulted in a combined total cost in excess of
net assets acquired (goodwill) of approximately $11.6 million from both
acquisitions. The resulting goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over forty years.
 
    The following unaudited pro forma summary presents information for the year
ended December 31, 1994, as if the acquisitions of IMG and MEIB had occurred at
the beginning of the year after giving effect to certain adjustments including
amortization of goodwill, increased interest expense from debt issued to fund
the acquisitions and Federal income taxes. The pro forma summary is for
information purposes only, does not necessarily reflect the actual results that
would have occurred, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of the
combined Company.

LDG
 
    On May 24, 1996, the Company issued 6,250,000 shares of its Common Stock to
acquire all of the outstanding common stock of LDG. The former principal
shareholder of LDG is a director of the Company. This business combination has
been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. The Company's

consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the accounts and
operations of LDG for all periods presented.
 
    The consolidated financial statements include adjustments made to conform
LDG's accounting policies for fee and commission income to that of HCCH. HCCH's
policy is to recognize fee and commission income on the revenue recognition date
(the later of the effective date of the policy, the date when premium can be
reasonably estimated, or the date when substantially all required services
relating to the placement have been rendered to the client), and subsequent
policy adjustments and contingent profit commissions are recognized when events
occur and amounts are known or can be reasonably estimated. LDG previously
recognized fee and commission income on the later of the effective date or the
reporting date, subsequent adjustments were recognized when they became due, and
contingent profit commission was recognized when received. For the years ended
December 31, 1995 and 1994, these adjustments decreased net income $119,000 and
$844,000, respectively.

entities are presented for the periods prior to merger in the following table:

NASRA
 
    On November 27, 1996, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
NASRA by issuing 1,136,400 shares of its Common Stock and a payment of $1.7
million in cash to one dissenting shareholder. This combination has been
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. However, the Company's consolidated
financial statements have not been restated due to immateriality.
 
TRM
 
    On November 11, 1996, the Company announced that it had agreed to acquire
all of the occupational accident business of the TRM International, Inc. group
of companies ("TRM") in exchange for 266,667 shares of its Common Stock and
$6.55 million in cash. The acquisition was finalized on January 24, 1997 and
will be accounted for as a purchase.
 
AMIG
 
    On January 6, 1997, the Company announced that it had agreed in principal to
acquire all of the outstanding shares of Interworld Inc. Group ("Interworld") in
exchange for 725,000 shares of its Common Stock. The transaction will be
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.
 
AVEMCO
 
    On January 17, 1997, HCCH and AVEMCO Corporation ("AVEMCO") jointly
announced that the Companies had signed a letter of intent to merge in a stock
for stock transaction, each share of AVEMCO common stock to be exchanged for one
share of HCCH's Common Stock. The Companies executed definitive agreements on
February 28, 1997. This transaction will be accounted for as a pooling-of-
interests. The merger is still subject to approval by the shareholders of both
Companies and to certain regulatory approvals. As of March 1, 1997, there were
8.4 million shares of AVEMCO common stock outstanding.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
(5) NOTES PAYABLE (CONTINUED)
    The first note is payable to a bank in quarterly installments of $1.5
million plus interest increasing to quarterly installments of $1.75 million plus
interest as of October 1, 1997. Interest is payable quarterly at the prime rate
(8 1/4% at December 31, 1996). During February, 1994, the first note was amended
changing the interest rate to a fixed rate of 6 1/2% until February 7, 1997. The
rate reverts back to the prime rate after such date or can be set at London
Interbank Offering Rate ("LIBOR") plus 2 1/4% at the Company's discretion. The
note is collateralized by all of the Common Stock of HCC. The loan agreement
contains certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on certain
transactions in the Company's capital stock or the capital stock of HCC and the
maintenance of required financial ratios. Additionally, the loan agreement
prohibits the payment of dividends by the Company without the bank's approval.
The bank has approved the Company's current dividend policy. During 1995, the
Company prepaid the first two installments of $1.5 million due in 1996. The bank
deferred the second two installments due in 1996 until maturity on October 1,
1998. The Company paid the first 1997 quarterly payment of $1.5 million in
January, 1997.
 
    The second note was payable to a bank in monthly installments of $21,000
plus interest. This note was repaid in full during 1996.
 
    The outstanding advance at December 31, 1996, on a revolving line of credit,
is owed to a bank and represents the maximum available on that line of credit.
Interest is payable quarterly beginning March 20, 1997, at a variable rate which
is the bank's prime rate plus one percent (9 1/4% at December 31, 1996). The
principal is due in one payment upon maturity on December 20, 1998. The loan is
collateralized by a certificate of deposit.
 
    At December 31, 1996, HCC maintained a revolving line of credit with a bank
in the maximum amount of $12 million available through April 30, 1997. Advances
under the line of credit are limited to amounts required to fund draws, if any,
on letters of credit issued by the bank on behalf of HCC and short-term direct
cash advances. The line of credit is collateralized by securities having an
aggregate market value of up to $15 million, the actual amount of collateral at
any one time being 125% of the aggregate amount outstanding. Interest on the
line is payable at the bank's prime rate of interest (8 1/4% at December 31,
1996). At December 31, 1996, letters of credit totaling $4.6 million had been
issued to insurance companies by the bank on behalf of HCC, with total
securities collateralizing the line of $5.8 million. As of December 31, 1996,
there were no cash advances outstanding under this line of credit, therefore,
$7.4 million is available for short-term borrowings under this facility.
 
    Principal payments due on the note payable and the line of credit at
December 31, 1996, are shown in the table below:

(7) SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA (CONTINUED)
    During 1996 and 1995, one broker in London, England, produced gross written
premium to the Company of approximately $25.7 million and $31.2 million,
respectively. This represents 11% and 13% of the Company's total gross written
premium for those years. Approximately 55% of the gross written premium by the
domestic insurance subsidiaries is for insureds located outside the United
States.
 
(8) REINSURANCE
 
    In the normal course of business the Company's insurance company
subsidiaries cede a substantial portion of their premium to unrelated domestic
and foreign reinsurers through quota share, surplus, excess of loss and
facultative reinsurance agreements. Although the ceding of reinsurance does not
discharge the primary insurer from liability to its policyholder, the
subsidiaries participate in such agreements for the purpose of limiting their
loss exposure and diversifying their business. Substantially all of the
reinsurance assumed by the Company's insurance company subsidiaries was
underwritten directly by the subsidiaries but issued by other unrelated
companies in order to satisfy local licensing or other requirements,
predominantly on foreign business or as reinsurance of captives. The following
table represents the effect of such reinsurance transactions on net premium and
loss and loss adjustment expense:

    The insurance company subsidiaries require reinsurers not authorized by
their respective states of domicile to collateralize their reinsurance
obligations to the Company with letters of credit or cash deposits. At December
31, 1996, the Company held letters of credit and cash deposits in the amounts of
$67.9 million and $9.1 million, respectively, to collateralize certain
reinsurance balances. The Company has established a reserve of $2.4 million as
of December 31, 1996, to reduce the effects of any recoverable problem.
 
    In order to minimize their exposure to reinsurance credit risk, the Company
evaluates the financial condition of their reinsurers and place their
reinsurance with a diverse group of financially sound companies. The following
table shows reinsurance balances relating to the reinsurers with a total
recoverable balance greater than $10.0 million and the collateral and potential
offsets held by the Company as of each year end:

    Approximately $1.9 million in recoverables is due from reinsurers that are
either under regulatory supervision or insolvent. The Company holds letters of
credit and cash deposits totaling $1.9 million to collateralize these balances
plus other credits of $1.1 million available for potential offset. The Company
is involved in a dispute with two reinsurers over coverage and other issues. The
Company believes the reinsurers' positions are without merit and all amounts due
from the reinsurers will be recovered. The total amount in dispute is
approximately $3.4 million.

(9) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
LITIGATION
 
    The Company is a party to numerous lawsuits arising in the normal course of
business. All pending lawsuits involve claims under policies underwritten or
reinsured by the Company, which management believes have been adequately
included in its established loss reserves. The Company believes the resolution
of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 
FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS
 
    From time to time the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts
as a hedge against foreign currency fluctuations, primarily British Pound
Sterling. The Company's balances denominated in foreign currency fluctuate as
transactions are recorded and settled. During 1996, the average Sterling
liability, for subsidiaries whose functional currency was the United States
dollar, was approximately L907,000 ($1.6 million at the December 31, 1996, rate
of exchange) which was hedged by an average open forward contract balance of
approximately L460,000 ($785,000 at the December 31, 1996, rate of exchange).
There was one open foreign currency forward contract as of December 31, 1996 to
purchase L500,000 ($856,000 at the December 31, 1996, rate of exchange) with a
maturity of January, 1997. As of December 31, 1996, the open foreign currency
contract had a gain of $37,000. During January, 1997, the Company entered into a
foreign currency forward contract for L500,000 ($856,000 at December 31, 1996,
rate of exchange). The Company expects to continue to limit its exposure to
currency fluctuations through the use of foreign currency forward contracts.
 
    The Company utilizes these foreign currency forward contracts strictly as a
hedge against existing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and it does not
do so as any form of speculative or trading investment.
 
LEASES
 
    The Company leases administrative office facilities under long-term
noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through
October, 2001. The agreements generally require the payment of utilities, real
estate taxes, insurance and repairs. The Company has recognized rent expense on
a straight-line basis over the terms of these leases. In addition, the Company
leases computer equipment and automobiles under operating leases expiring at
various dates through the year 1999. Rent expense under these leases amounted to
$1,495,000, $1,095,000 and $895,000 for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995
and 1994, respectively.
 
    At December 31, 1996, future minimum annual rental payments required under
the long-term noncancelable operating leases, excluding certain expenses payable
by the Company, are as follows:

    During 1995, $63,000 was paid to a related party for construction management
services related to improvements to the Company's offices in Houston, Texas.
Also, during 1994, real estate acquired with the acquisition of IMG was sold to
a related party for $788,000. There was no gain or loss recorded on this sale.
 
(11) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
 
    The Company has defined contribution retirement plans under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code which cover substantially all of the domestic
employees who meet specified service requirements. The Company's contributions
of these plans are based on varying percentages of the employees' contributions,
up to varying maximum levels. The Company contributed $506,000, $693,000 and
$646,000 to the plans for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively, which is included in compensation expense in the accompanying
consolidated statements of earnings.
 
(12) SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
 
    Under the Texas Insurance Code, HCC must maintain minimum statutory capital
of $1,000,000 and minimum statutory surplus of $1,000,000, and can only pay
dividends out of surplus funds. In addition, HCC is limited in the amount of
dividends which it may pay in any twelve month period, without prior regulatory
approval, to the greater of statutory net investment income for the prior
calendar year or ten percent (10%)of statutory capital and surplus as of the
prior calendar year end. During 1997, HCC's ordinary dividend capacity will be
approximately $15.1 million. As of December 31, 1996, HCC's and TIC's total
adjusted capital greatly exceeded the NAIC authorized control level risk-based
capital.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
(12) SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (CONTINUED)
    Under Jordanian Law, IMG and MEIB must transfer 10% of their earnings before
income tax each year to a statutory reserve until the reserve balance equals the
paid up capital balance. This reserve is not available for the payment of
dividends. As of December 31, 1996, IMG and MEIB had combined capital plus
statutory reserves totaling $17.0 million included as part their combined
shareholders' equity totaling $61.1 million.
 
(13) STOCK OPTIONS
 
    The Company has four option plans, the 1994 Nonemployee Director Stock
Option Plan, the 1996 Nonemployee Director Stock Option Plan, the 1992 Incentive
Stock Option Plan, and the 1995 Flexible Incentive Plan. All plans are
administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Each
option may be used to purchase one share of Common Stock of the Company. As of
December 31, 1996, 4,004,669 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance
of options, of which 1,748,276 shares were reserved for future issuances of
options.
 
    Options generally vest over a one, three or five year period and expire ten
years after grant date. All options have been granted at fixed exercise prices,
generally at the market price of the Company's Common Stock on the grant date.
Any excess of the market price on the grant date over the exercise price is
recognized as compensation expense in the accompanying financial statements.
During 1996, such compensation expense amounted to $494,000. If the fair value
method of valuing compensation related to options would have been used, pro
forma net earnings and pro forma earnings per share would have been $28.3
million, or $0.79 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1996. The pro forma
compensation cost for the year ended December 31, 1995, is immaterial. The fair
value of each option grant was estimated on the grant date using the
Black-Scholes single option pricing model with the following assumptions: a)
risk free interest rate of 5.6% for 1996 and 6.6% for 1995, b) expected
volatility factor of .3, c) dividend yield of .3% for 1996 and 0% for 1995, and
d) expected option life of six years.
 
    Stock option activity is shown below after adjustment for the effects of the
three-for-two stock split payable as a 50% stock dividend to shareholders of
record March 15, 1994, and for the effects of the five-for-two stock split
payable as a 150% stock dividend to shareholders of record April 30, 1996. (See
note 1).

(1) Columns C and D are shown ignoring the effects of reinsurance.
 
(2) Net investment income was allocated to the company, and therefore the
    segment, on which the related investment asset was recorded. Other operating
    expenses were allocated to the company, and therefore the corresponding
    segment, which actually incurred those expenses.
 
Note: Column E is omitted because the Company has no other policy claims and
      benefits payable.

                         AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

                                           
    THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement") is entered 
into as of the 27th day of November, 1996 by and among HCC Insurance 
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("HCCH"), Merger Sub, Inc. an Illinois 
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of HCCH ("Merger Sub"), North 
American Special Risks Associates, Inc. ("Holdco" or "NASRA"), an Illinois 
corporation, NASRA TPA, Inc. ("TPA"), an Illinois corporation, NASRA 
Consulting, Inc. ("Consulting"), an Illinois corporation (TPA and Consulting 
being from time to time collectively referred to herein as the "Affiliated 
Companies"), George A. Mellon ("Mellon"), F. Donald Fleming ("Fleming"), and 
J. Nicholas Tegenkamp ("Tegenkamp") (Mellon, Fleming and Tegenkamp being 
collectively referred to as the "Original Shareholders" and the Original 
Shareholders and any person becoming a shareholder of Holdco subsequent to 
the date hereof and on or before the Effective Date who executes a 
counterpart signature page in the form attached hereto being collectively 
referred to herein as the "Shareholders"). As of the Effective Date, wherever 
used herein and in the NASRA Disclosure Schedule (as hereinafter defined), 
the term "Affiliated Companies" shall mean "Subsidiaries" (as hereinafter 
defined).

                                      RECITALS:

    A.   The Boards of Directors of each of HCCH, Merger Sub and NASRA have 
determined (a) to engage in a transaction pursuant to which (i) prior to the 
Effective Date (as hereinafter defined), TPA shall become a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Holdco, by means of a contribution to the capital of Holdco by 
Mellon, of all of the shares of common stock of TPA held by Mellon in 
exchange for 5,382 shares of NASRA Common Stock, (ii) Consulting will merge 
into NASRA, with NASRA being the surviving company, and the Original 
Shareholders receiving 100 shares of NASRA Common Stock in consideration 
therefor, (iii) Merger Sub will merge with and into Holdco (the "Merger"), 
(iv) the capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into shares of common 
stock of Holdco (the "Holdco Common Stock"); and (v) each share of Holdco 
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be 
converted into shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of HCCH 
(the "HCCH Common Stock") in the manner herein described, all upon the terms 
and subject to the conditions set forth herein or (b) if otherwise advised by 
counsel, to engage in a transaction involving any alternative structure 
whereby the Affiliated Companies will be able to carry out the intent of this 
Agreement as agreed upon in a writing signed by each party hereto.

    B.   The Board of Directors of NASRA has determined that based on the 
relative values of their holdings of NASRA, including the detrimental effect 
of certain call options relating to the shares of NASRA Common Stock held by 
Fleming and Tegenkamp, the shares of NASRA held by the Original Shareholders 
result in the value of NASRA after consummation of the transactions described 
in Recital A above to be held as follows: Mellon - 93.6%; Fleming - 5.3% and 
Tegenkamp 1.1%, and the Original Shareholders have agreed to such relative 
values.

    C.   The Boards of Directors of Holdco and the Affiliated Companies have 
approved, and the Board of Directors of Holdco has resolved, subject to the 
terms of this Agreement, to 

<PAGE>

recommend that shareholders of Holdco approve the Merger, this Agreement and 
the Articles of Merger (as defined herein).

    D.   The Board of Directors of HCCH has approved the Merger, this 
Agreement and the Articles of Merger. HCCH, as the sole shareholder of Merger 
Sub, has approved the Merger, this Agreement and the Articles of Merger.

    E.   The parties intend for the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement to qualify as a plan of reorganization in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended 
(the "Code"), and to be accounted for as a "pooling-of-interests" for 
accounting purposes.

    F.   Fleming has informed NASRA that he intends to dissent from agreeing 
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger and to 
receive the fair value for his shares of NASRA pursuant to the Illinois 
Business Corporation Act.

    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual 
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the 
parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:

                                      ARTICLE I

                                      THE MERGER

    Section 1.1  The Merger.

    (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub 
will be merged into Holdco in accordance with the laws of the State of 
Illinois ("Illinois Law"), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub 
shall cease, and Holdco shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving 
Corporation").

    (b)  As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent 
permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, Holdco and 
Merger Sub shall file articles of merger, in substantially the form attached 
hereto as Exhibit 1.1(b) (the "Articles of Merger"), in the Office of the 
Secretary of the State of Illinois, and make all such other filings or 
recordings required by Illinois Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger 
shall become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger are duly filed 
with the Office of the Secretary of the State of Illinois, in accordance with 
the relevant provisions of Illinois Law (the "Effective Time"). The date on 
which the Effective Time shall occur is referred to herein as the "Effective 
Date."

    (c)  From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall 
possess all the rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to 
all of the restrictions, disabilities and duties of Holdco and Merger Sub, 
all as provided under Illinois Law.

                                     2

    Section 1.2 Conversion of Shares.  At the Effective Time, each share of 
common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding 
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically and without any 
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into one share of 
common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and, except as set forth herein in 
connection with the payment of cash for Fleming's shares in NASRA, shares of 
Holdco Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall 
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof cease 
to be outstanding and be converted into the right to receive shares of HCCH 
Common Stock as follows:

    (a)  7,404.2 shares of Holdco held by Mellon shall be converted into 
1,123,200 shares of HCCH Common Stock;

    (b)  622.2 shares of Holdco held by Fleming shall be converted into 
63,600 shares of HCCH Common Stock; and

    (c)  155.6 shares of Holdco held by Tegenkamp shall be converted into 
13,200 shares of HCCH Common stock.

No fractional shares shall be issued and each holder of Holdco Common Stock 
shall be entitled to the nearest whole share of HCCH Common Stock rounded 
upwards if such fractional share exceeds .5 and otherwise rounded downwards, 
provided, however, that HCCH shall under no circumstances be obligated 
hereunder to issue shares of HCCH Common Stock in excess of an aggregate of 
1,200,000 shares of HCCH Common Stock.

    Section 1.3 Exchange of Certificates.

    (a)  Prior to the Effective Date, HCCH shall appoint KeyCorp Shareholder 
Services, Inc. to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.

    (b)  At the Effective Time, HCCH shall exchange the shares of HCCH Common 
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.2 in exchange for all outstanding shares 
of Holdco Common Stock (other than for shares of Holdco Common Stock held by 
any Shareholder who has elected to accept appraisal rights as contemplated by 
Section 1.4).

    (c)  If prior to the Merger, HCCH recapitalizes either through a split-up 
of its outstanding shares into a greater number, or through a combination of 
its outstanding shares into a lesser number, or reorganizes, reclassifies or 
otherwise changes its outstanding shares into the same or a different number 
of shares of other classes (other than through a split-up or a combination of 
shares provided for in the previous clause), or declares a dividend on its 
outstanding shares payable in shares or securities convertible into shares 
(but not cash), the number of shares of HCCH Common Stock into which the 
shares of Holdco Common Stock are to be converted will be adjusted in 
proportion to such change.

                                    3

    Section 1.4 Dissenting Shares.

    (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the 
shares of any holder of Holdco Common Stock who has demanded and perfected 
appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with Illinois Law and who, as 
of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal 
rights ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right 
to receive HCCH Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.2, but the holder thereof 
shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by Illinois Law.

    (b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), if any holder of 
shares of Holdco Common Stock who demands appraisal of such shares under 
Illinois Law shall effectively withdraw such appraisal demand or fail to 
perfect or otherwise lose the right to appraisal, then, as of the later of 
the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such shareholder's 
shares of Holdco Common Stock shall automatically be converted into and 
represent only the right to receive HCCH Common Stock, without interest 
thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares.

    (c)  Holdco shall give HCCH (i) prompt notice of any written demands for 
appraisal of any shares of Holdco Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands, 
and any other instruments served pursuant to Illinois Law and received by 
Holdco which relate to any such demand for appraisal and (ii) the opportunity 
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings which take place prior to 
the Effective Time with respect to demands for appraisal under Illinois Law.

    (d)  If holders of Holdco Common Stock entitled to receive an excess of 
100,000 shares of HCCH Common Stock demand appraisal rights as provided for 
herein and refuse to withdraw such demand prior to the Effective Date, HCCH, 
in its sole and absolute discretion, shall have the right to terminate this 
Agreement.

    Section 1.5 Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to an Escrow Agreement to be 
entered into on or before the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) in 
substantially the form of Exhibit 1.5 (the "Escrow Agreement"), among HCCH, 
the Shareholders and KeyCorp Shareholders Services, Inc., as Escrow Agent, 
HCCH will withhold from the shares of HCCH Common Stock that would otherwise 
be delivered to the Shareholders, 10% of the total number of shares of HCCH 
Common Stock issued to the Shareholders in the Merger and 10% of the cash 
otherwise to be received by Fleming pursuant to this Agreement. On the 
Closing Date, HCCH will deposit, or cause to be deposited in escrow pursuant 
to the Escrow Agreement, certificates representing the shares and the cash 
thus withheld. The shares of HCCH Common Stock represented by the 
certificates and the cash deposited in escrow as provided above in this 
Section 1.5 (the "Escrow Shares") will be held as collateral for the 
indemnification obligations of the Shareholders under Sections 11.1 and 11.2 
below and pursuant to the Escrow Agreement pending their release from escrow 
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

    Section 1.6 Satisfaction of Fleming's Dissenter's Rights.  At the 
Effective Time, HCCH agrees that at the Closing it will pay to Fleming an 
amount equal to 63,600 multiplied 

                                     4

<PAGE>

by the average of the high and low sales price of HCCH Common Stock on the 
New York Stock Exchange for the ten (10) trading days ending two trading days 
before the Effective Date, and that such amount is the fair value for 
Fleming's shares of NASRA and is in full satisfaction of Fleming's right to 
dissent from the consummation of the Merger in accordance with Illinois Law.

                                      ARTICLE II

                              THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

    Section 2.1  Articles of Incorporation.  At the Effective Time, the 
Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the 
Effective Time shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving 
Corporation.

    Section 2.2  Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as 
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the 
Surviving Corporation.

    Section 2.3  Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time, 
until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance 
with applicable law, the directors and officers of Merger Sub at the 
Effective Time shall become directors and the officers of the Surviving 
Corporation. In addition, HCCH shall take all necessary action to cause 
Mellon to be appointed Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and 
President of the Surviving Corporation, such appointment to become effective 
as of the Effective Time.

                                     ARTICLE III

                      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HOLDCO,
                       AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND SHAREHOLDERS

Agreement (the "NASRA Disclosure Schedule") which has been delivered to HCCH 
on or before the date hereof, each of Holdco, each Affiliated Company and 
each Shareholder (severally and not jointly) represents and warrants to HCCH 
as set forth below (it being agreed that the disclosure on the NASRA 
Disclosure Schedule of the existence of any document or fact or circumstance 
or situation relating to any representations, warranties, covenants or 
agreements in any section of this Agreement shall be automatically deemed to 
be disclosure of such document or fact or circumstance or situation for 
purposes of all other representations, warranties, covenants and agreements 
in this Agreement):

    Section 3.1  Corporate Existence and Power.  Holdco and each of the 
Affiliated Companies is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in 
good standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation, and have all 
corporate powers and all material governmental licenses, authorizations, 
consents and approvals (collectively, "Governmental Authorizations")

required to carry on its business as now conducted, except such Governmental 
Authorizations the failure of which to have obtained would not have a 
Material Adverse Effect, as hereinafter defined, on Holdco or such Affiliated 
Company. Holdco and each of the Affiliated Companies is duly qualified to do 
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each 
jurisdiction where the character of the property owned or leased by it or the 
nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the 
failure to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Holdco 
or such Affiliated Company. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Material 
Adverse Effect," with respect to any person or entity (including without 
limitation Holdco, each Affiliated Company and HCCH), means a material 
adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), business, 
properties, assets, liabilities (including contingent liabilities), results 
of operations or prospects of such person or entity and its affiliated 
companies and subsidiaries and/or parent corporation and/or corporations 
under the same stock ownership, taken as a whole; and "Material Adverse 
Change" means a change or a development involving a prospective change which 
would result in a Material Adverse Effect. Holdco has delivered to HCCH true 
and complete copies of Holdco's and each Affiliated Company's Articles of 
Incorporation or Articles of Incorporation, as the case may be, and Bylaws as 
currently in effect.

execution of the Confidentiality Agreement (as hereinafter defined), are 
within Holdco and each Affiliated Company's corporate powers and have been 
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, excluding approval by the 
Shareholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger. This 
Agreement, the Articles of Merger, and the Confidentiality Agreement 
constitute, or upon execution will constitute, valid and binding agreements 
of Holdco and each of the Affiliated Companies party thereto, enforceable 
against such agreeing party in accordance with their respective terms, except 
as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar 
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general 
principles of equity.

    (b)  Each of the Shareholders, severally, represents and warrants that he 
has full right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement, the

be entered into by him in connection with the transactions contemplated 
hereby and that this Agreement, the Affiliates Agreement, and such other 
agreements contemplated hereby constitute, or upon execution will constitute, 
valid and binding agreements of such Shareholder, enforceable against him in 
accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforcement may be 
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws effecting the

    (f)  such other filings or registrations with, or authorizations,

Companies or the Surviving Corporation, or (ii) would not materially 
adversely affect the ability of Holdco, each Affiliated Company, HCCH or 
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and operate 
their businesses as heretofore operated.

except, with respect to clauses (b), (c) and (d) above, for contraventions, 
defaults, losses, Liens and other matters referred to in such clauses that in 
the aggregate would not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in 
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Holdco or any of the Affiliated 
Companies.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Lien" means, with 
respect to any asset, any mortgage, lien, pledge, charge, security interest

have received a letter from its independent public accountants to the effect 
that if the Merger were to be consummated on the date of this Agreement, each

Company that, in the aggregate, would result in any tax liability in excess 
of the amount of the reserves or accruals and (iii) has or will establish in 
accordance with its normal accounting practices and procedures accruals and 
reserves that, in the aggregate, are adequate for the payment of all Taxes 
not yet due and payable and attributable to any period preceding the

terms of which are materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction 
involving Holdco or any of the Affiliated Companies of the nature of any of 
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) providing any term of

to, any "Employee Pension Benefit Plan" ("Pension Plan") or any "Employee 
Welfare Benefit Plan" ("Welfare Plan") as such terms are defined in Sections 
3(2) and 3(1) respectively of ERISA, which is subject to ERISA. Each Pension 
Plan and Welfare Plan disclosed in the NASRA Disclosure Schedule (which Plans 
have been heretofore delivered to HCCH) and maintained by NASRA has been 
maintained in all material respects in compliance with their terms and all 
provisions of ERISA and the Code (including rules and regulations thereunder) 
applicable thereto.

    (c)  No Pension Plan or Welfare Plan is currently subject to an audit or 
other investigation by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), the Department 
of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other governmental 
agency or office nor are any such Plans subject to any lawsuits or legal 
proceedings of any kind or to any material pending disputed claims by 
employees or beneficiaries covered under any such Plan or by any other 
parties.

responsibility under Part 4 of Title I of ERISA which has resulted in 
liability of Holdco, any Affiliated Company, and NASRA ERISA Affiliate, any 
trustee, administrator or fiduciary of any Pension Plan or Welfare Plan.

    (e)  Neither Holdco, any Affiliated Company, nor any NASRA ERISA 
Affiliate, since January 1, 1986, has maintained or contributed to, or been 
obligated or required to contribute to, a "Multiemployer Plan," as such term 
is defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.  Neither Holdco, any Affiliated 
Company, nor any NASRA ERISA Affiliate has either withdrawn, partially or 
completely, or instituted steps to withdraw, partially or completely, from 
any Multiemployer Plan nor has any event occurred which would enable a 
Multiemployer Plan to give notice of and demand payment of any withdrawal 
liability with respect to Holdco, any Affiliated Company, or any NASRA ERISA 
Affiliate.

    (f)  There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any 
employee or former employee of Holdco or any NASRA ERISA Affiliate that, 
individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount 
that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Sections 162(a)(I) or 
280G of the Code.

    (g)  With respect to Holdco, each Affiliated Company and each NASRA ERISA 
Affiliate, the NASRA Disclosure Schedule correctly identifies each material 
agreement, policy, plan or other arrangement, whether written or oral, 
express or implied, fixed or contingent, to which Holdco or any Affiliated 
Company is a party or by which Holdco or any Affiliated Company or any 
property or asset of Holdco or any Affiliated Company is bound, which is or 
relates to a pension, option, bonus, deferred compensation, retirement, stock 
purchase, profitsharing, severance pay, health, welfare, incentive, 
vacation, sick leave, medical disability, hospitalization, life or other 
insurance or fringe benefit plan, policy or arrangement.

    (h)  Neither Holdco, any Affiliated Company, nor any NASRA ERISA 
Affiliate maintains or has maintained or contributed to any Pension Plan that 
is or was subject to Section 302 of Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the 
Code.  Holdco and each Affiliated Company has made available to HCCH, for 
each Pension Plan which is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of 
Section 401(a) of the Code, a copy of the most recent determination letter 
issued by the IRS to the effect that each such Plan is so qualified and that 
each trust created thereunder is tax exempt under Section 501 of the Code, 
and Holdco and each Affiliated Company is unaware of any fact or 
circumstances that would jeopardize the qualified status of each such Pension 
Plan or the tax exempt status of each trust created thereunder.

    Section 3.16 Material Agreements.

    (a)  The NASRA Disclosure Schedule includes a complete and accurate list 
of all contracts, agreements, leases (other than NASRA Property Leases, as 
hereinafter defined), and instruments to which Holdco or any of the 
Affiliated Companies is a party or by which it or its properties or assets 
are bound which individually involve net payments or receipts in excess of 
$25,000 per annum, inclusive of contracts entered into with customers and 
suppliers in the ordinary course of business, or that pertain to employment 
or severance benefits for any officer, director or employee of Holdco or 
any of the Affiliated Companies, whether written or oral, but exclusive of 
contracts, agreements, leases and instruments terminable without penalty upon 
60 days' or less prior written notice to the other party or parties thereto 
(the "Material NASRA Agreements").

    (b)  Neither Holdco nor any Affiliated Company nor, to the knowledge of 
Holdco or any Affiliated Company, any other party is in default under any 
Material NASRA Agreement and no event has occurred which (after notice or 
lapse of time or both) would become a breach or default under, or would 
permit modification, cancellation, acceleration or termination of any 
Material NASRA Agreement or result in the creation of any security interest 
upon, or any person obtaining any right to acquire, any properties, assets or 
rights of Holdco or any Affiliated Company, which, in any such case, has had 
or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

    (c)  To the knowledge of Holdco and each Affiliated Company, each such 
Material NASRA Agreement is in full force and effect and is valid and legally 
binding and there are no material unresolved disputes involving or with 
respect to any Material NASRA Agreement. No party to a Material NASRA 
Agreement has advised Holdco or any Affiliated Company that it intends either 
to terminate a Material NASRA Agreement or to refuse to renew a Material 
NASRA Agreement upon the expiration of the term thereof.

    (d)  Holdco and each Affiliated Company is not in violation of, or in 
default with respect to, any term of its Articles or Certificate of 
Incorporation, as the case may be, or Bylaws.

    Section 3.17 Properties.  To the knowledge of Holdco and each of the 
Affiliated Companies, Holdco or such Affiliated Company owns no real estate, 
and all leases of real property to which Holdco or any of the Affiliated 
Companies is a party or by which it is bound ("NASRA Property Leases") are in 
full force and effect. To the knowledge of Holdco or any Affiliated Company, 
there exists no default under such NASRA Property Leases, nor any event which 
with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default thereunder, 
which default would have a Material Adverse Effect. All of the properties and 
assets which are owned by Holdco and each of the Affiliated Companies are 
owned by each of them, respectively, free and clear of any Lien, except for 
Liens which do not have a Material Adverse Effect. Holdco and each of the 
Affiliated Companies have good and indefeasible title with respect to such 
owned properties and assets subject to no Liens, other than those permitted 
under this Section 3.17, to 

                                  16

<PAGE>

all of the properties and assets necessary for the conduct of their business 
other than to the extent that the failure to have such title would not have a 
Material Adverse Effect.

Affiliated Companies will issue any securities or for which any of the

    Section 3.23 Broker's Fees. Neither Holdco, any Affiliated Company, any

Agreement or in a document, exhibit, or appendix filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") which has been filed on or before the date

which has been delivered to Holdco and the Affiliated Companies on or before 
the date hereof, each of HCCH and Merger Sub represents and warrants to 
Holdco, the Affiliated Companies and the Shareholders as set forth below (it 
being agreed that the disclosure on the HCCH Disclosure Schedule of the 
existence of any document or fact or circumstance or situation relating to 
any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in any section of

Subsidiaries is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good

Authorizations the failure of which to have obtained would not have a 
Material Adverse Effect on HCCH.  HCCH and each of its Subsidiaries is duly 
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in 
each jurisdiction where the character of the property owned or leased by it 
or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except 
where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect

Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Merger Sub's Articles of

    (a)  Each HCCH Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated, validly 
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of 
incorporation, has all corporate powers and all material Governmental 
Authorizations required to carry on its business as now conducted, except 
such Governmental Authorizations the failure of which to have obtained would 
not have a Material Adverse Effect on HCCH, and is duly qualified to do 
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each 
jurisdiction where the character of the property owned or leased by HCCH, or 
the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary, except for 
those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not, individually 
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on HCCH. All Subsidiaries 
and Joint Ventures material to the business of HCCH ("Material HCCH 
Subsidiaries") and their respective jurisdictions of incorporation or 
organization and HCCH's ownership interest therein are identified in the HCCH 
Disclosure Schedule. Other than its investments in its Subsidiaries and Joint 
Ventures, and shares of stock in publicly held companies aggregating less

directly or indirectly, any outstanding capital stock or equity interest in 
any corporation, partnership, Joint Venture or other entity.

    (b)  All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other ownership 
interests in, each Material HCCH Subsidiary that is owned by HCCH, is owned 
by HCCH, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any material Lien and free 
of any other material limitation or restriction on its rights as owner 
thereof (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise 
dispose of such capital stock or other ownership interests), other than those 
imposed by applicable law. There are no existing options, calls or

the following filed with the SEC on or after the date hereof and prior to the

registration statements filed with the SEC since December 31, 1995. None of 
HCCH's Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other documents 
with the SEC.

    (c)  As of its filing date, no such report or statement filed pursuant to 
the Exchange Act contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted 
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made 
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not 
misleading.

    (d)  No registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act, if 
declared effective by the SEC, as of the date such statement or amendment 
became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or 
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary 
to make the statements therein not misleading.

    Section 4.9 Financial Statements. The audited consolidated financial 
statements of HCCH included in its annual reports on Form 10-K and the 
unaudited financial statements of HCCH included in its quarterly reports on 
Form 10-Q referred to in Section 4.8 present fairly, in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the consolidated 
financial position of HCCH and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates 
thereof and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the 
periods then ended (subject to normal year-end adjustments in the case of any 
interim financial statements). For purposes of this Agreement, "HCCH Balance 
Sheet" means the consolidated balance sheet of HCCH as of September 30, 1996, 
and the notes thereto, contained in HCCH's quarterly report on Form 10-Q 
filed for its fiscal quarter then ended, and "HCCH Balance Sheet Date" means 
September 30, 1996.

    Section 4.10 Absence of Certain Changes. Except as disclosed in the HCCH 
Disclosure Schedule, since the HCCH Balance Sheet Date, HCCH and each of its 
Subsidiaries have in all material respects conducted their business in the 
ordinary course and there has not been:

    (a)  any Material Adverse Change with respect to HCCH or any event, 
occurrence or development of a state of circumstances or facts known to HCCH, 
which as of the date hereof could reasonably be expected to have a Material 
Adverse Effect on HCCH;

                                     23

<PAGE>

    (b)  any amendment of any material term of any outstanding HCCH Securities;

    (c)  any action by HCCH or, to HCCH's knowledge, any affiliate of HCCH 
which would preclude the ability of HCCH to account for the business 
combination to be effected by the Merger as a "pooling of interests" under 
generally accepted accounting principles; or

    (d)  the entering into of any agreement by HCCH or any person on behalf 
of HCCH to take any of the foregoing actions.

    Section 4.11 No Undisclosed Liabilities. There are no liabilities of HCCH 
or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever that are, individually or 
in the aggregate, material to HCCH and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, 
other than:

    (a)  liabilities disclosed or provided for in the HCCH Balance Sheet 
(including the notes thereto);

    (b)  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent 
with past practice since the HCCH Balance Sheet Date; and

    (c)  liabilities under this Agreement or as indicated in the HCCH 
Disclosure Schedule.

or investigations occurring in the ordinary course of business or such 
actions, suits, proceedings, claims or investigations involving respective 
amounts in controversy of less than $100,000 each, there is no action, suit, 
proceeding, claim or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of HCCH, 
overtly threatened, against HCCH or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their 
assets or against or involving any of its officers, directors or employees in 
connection with the business or affairs of HCCH, including, without 
limitation, any such claims for indemnification arising under any agreement 
to which HCCH or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, which could, 
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on HCCH. 
HCCH is not subject to or in default with respect to any writ, order, 
judgment, injunction or decree which could, individually or in the aggregate, 
have a Material Adverse Effect on HCCH.

    Section 4.13 Taxes.

    (a)  HCCH and each of its Subsidiaries (i) has filed when due (taking 
into account extensions) with the appropriate federal, state, local, foreign 
and other governmental agencies, all material tax returns, estimates and 
reports required to be filed by it, (ii) either paid when due and payable or 
established adequate reserves or otherwise accrued on the HCCH Balance Sheet 
all material Taxes, and there are no tax deficiencies claimed in writing by 
any Taxing authority and received by HCCH that, in the aggregate, would 
result in any tax liability in excess of the amount of the reserves or 
accruals, and (iii) has or will establish in accordance with its normal 
accounting practices and procedures accruals and reserves that, in the 
aggregate, are adequate for the payment of all Taxes not yet due and payable 
and attributable to any period preceding the 

                                    24

Effective Time. The HCCH Disclosure Schedule sets forth those tax returns of 
HCCH (or any predecessor entities) for all periods that currently are the 
subject of audit by any federal, state, local or foreign taxing authority.

    (b)  There are no material taxes, interest, penalties, assessments or 
deficiencies claimed in writing by any taxing authority and received by HCCH 
or any of its Subsidiaries to be due in respect of any tax returns filed by 
HCCH (or any predecessor corporations) or any of its Subsidiaries.  Neither 
HCCH nor any predecessor corporation, nor any of their respective 
Subsidiaries, has executed or filed with the IRS or any other Taxing 
authority any agreement or other document extending, or having the effect of 
extending, the period of assessment or collection of any Taxes.

    (c)  HCCH is not a party to or bound by (or will prior to the Effective 
Date become a party to or bound by) any Tax indemnity, Tax sharing or Tax 
allocation agreement or other similar arrangement which includes a party 
other than HCCH and its Subsidiaries.  Neither HCCH nor any of its 
Subsidiaries has been a member of an affiliated group other than one of which 
HCCH was the common parent, or filed or been included in a combined, 
consolidated or unitary Tax return other than one filed by HCCH (or a return 
for a group consisting solely of its Subsidiaries and predecessors).

    Section 4.14 Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA.

    (a)  Neither HCCH nor any corporation or other entity which under Section 
4001(b) of ERISA is under common control with HCCH (an "HCCH ERISA 
Affiliate") maintains or within the past five years has maintained, 
contributed to, or been obligated to contribute to, any Pension Plan or any 
Welfare Plan which is subject to ERISA.  Each Pension Plan and Welfare Plan 
disclosed in the HCCH Disclosure Schedule (which Plans have been heretofore 
delivered to Holdco) and maintained by HCCH has been maintained in all 
material respects in compliance with their terms and all provisions of ERISA 
and the Code (including rules and regulations thereunder) applicable thereto.

    (b)  Neither HCCH nor any HCCH ERISA Affiliate maintains or has 
maintained or contributed to any Pension Plan that is or was subject to 
Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. HCCH has made 
available to Holdco and the Affiliated Companies, for each Pension Plan which 
is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the 
Code, a copy of the most recent determination letter issued by the IRS to the 
effect that each such Plan is so qualified and that each trust created 
thereunder is tax exempt under Section 501 of the Code, and HCCH is unaware 
of any fact or circumstances that would jeopardize the qualified status of 
each such Pension Plan or the tax exempt status of each trust created 
thereunder.

    (c)  To the knowledge of HCCH, no Pension Plan or Welfare Plan is 
currently subject to an audit or other investigation by the IRS, the 
Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other 
governmental agency or office nor are any such Plans subject 

                                     25



<PAGE>

to any lawsuits or legal proceedings of any kind or to any material pending 
disputed claims by employees or beneficiaries covered under any such Plan or 
by any other parties.

    (d)  No "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or 
Section 4975 of the Code, resulting in liability to HCCH or any HCCH ERISA 
Affiliate has occurred with respect to any Pension Plan or Welfare Plan. HCCH 
has no knowledge of any breach of fiduciary responsibility under Part 4 of 
Title I of ERISA which has resulted in liability of HCCH, any HCCH ERISA 
Affiliate, any trustee, administrator or fiduciary of any Pension Plan or 
Welfare Plan.

    (e)  Neither HCCH nor any HCCH ERISA Affiliate, since January 1, 1986, 
has maintained or contributed to, or been obligated or required to contribute 
to, a "Multiemployer Plan," as such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of 
ERISA. Neither HCCH nor any HCCH ERISA Affiliate has either withdrawn, 
partially or completely, or instituted steps to withdraw, partially or 
completely, from any Multiemployer Plan nor has any event occurred which 
would enable a Multiemployer Plan to give notice of and demand payment of any 
withdrawal liability with respect to HCCH or any HCCH ERISA Affiliate.

    (f)  With respect to HCCH and each HCCH ERISA Affiliate, the HCCH 
Disclosure Schedule correctly identifies each material agreement, policy, 
plan or other arrangement, whether written or oral, express or implied, fixed 
or contingent, to which HCCH is a party or by which HCCH or any property or 
asset of HCCH is bound, which is or relates to a pension, option, bonus, 
deferred compensation, retirement, stock purchase, profit-sharing, severance 
pay, health, welfare, incentive, vacation, sick leave, medical disability, 
hospitalization, life or other insurance or fringe benefit plan, policy or 
arrangement.

    Section 4.15 Material Agreements.

    (a)  The HCCH Disclosure Schedule includes a complete and accurate list 
of all contracts, agreements, leases (other than HCCH Property Leases, as 
hereinafter defined) and instruments to which HCCH or any of its Subsidiaries 
is a party or by which it or its properties or assets are bound which 
individually involve net payments or receipts in excess of $1,000,000 per 
annum, inclusive of contracts that pertain to employment or severance 
benefits for any officer, director or employee of HCCH, whether written or 
oral, but exclusive of contracts entered into with customers and suppliers in 
the ordinary course of business or contracts, agreements, leases and 
instruments terminable without penalty by HCCH upon 60 days or less prior 
written notice to the other party or parties thereto (the "Material HCCH 
Agreements").

    (b)  Neither HCCH, any HCCH Subsidiary, nor, to the knowledge of HCCH, 
any other party is in default under any Material HCCH Agreement and no event 
has occurred which (after notice or lapse of time or both) would become a 
breach or default under, or would permit modification, cancellation, 
acceleration or termination of any Material HCCH Agreement or result in the 
creation of any security interest upon, or any person obtaining any right to 
acquire, any

                                       26

<PAGE>

properties, assets or rights of HCCH which, in any such case, has had or 
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on HCCH.

    (c)  To the knowledge of HCCH, each such Material HCCH Agreement is in 
full force and effect and is valid and legally binding and there are no 
material unresolved disputes involving or with respect to any Material HCCH 
Agreement. No party to a Material HCCH Agreement has advised HCCH or any of 
its Subsidiaries that it intends either to terminate a Material HCCH 
Agreement or to refuse to renew a Material HCCH Agreement upon the expiration 
of the term thereof.

    (d)  Each of HCCH, Merger Sub, and each HCCH Subsidiary is not in 
violation of, or in default with respect to, any term of its Certificate of 
Incorporation or Bylaws.

    Section 4.16 Properties.  To the knowledge of HCCH, all leases of real 
property to which HCCH or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it 
or any of its Subsidiaries is bound ("HCCH Property Leases") which are 
material to the business of HCCH and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole are in 
full force and effect. To the knowledge of HCCH, there exists no default 
under such HCCH Property Leases, nor any event which with notice or lapse of 
time or both would constitute a default thereunder by HCCH or any of its 
Subsidiaries, which default would have a Material Adverse Effect on HCCH. All 
of the properties and assets which are owned by HCCH and each of its 
Subsidiaries are owned by each of them, respectively, free and clear of any 
Lien, except for Liens which do not have a Material Adverse Effect on HCCH. 
HCCH and each of its Subsidiaries have good and indefeasible title with 
respect to such owned properties and assets subject to no Liens, other than 
those permitted under this Section 6, to all of the properties and assets 
necessary for the conduct of their business other than to the extent that the 
failure to have such title would not have a Material Adverse Effect on HCCH.

    Section 4.17 Environmental Mailers.

    (a)  To the knowledge of HCCH, no notice, notification, demand, request 
for information, citation, summons, complaint or order has been received, no 
complaint has been filed, no penalty has been assessed and no investigation 
or review is pending, or to HCCH's knowledge, has been threatened by any 
governmental entity or other party with respect to any (i) alleged violation 
by HCCH or any of its Subsidiaries of any Environmental Law, (ii) alleged 
failure by HCCH or any such Subsidiary to have any environmental permit, 
certificate, license, approval, registration or authorization required in 
connection with the conduct of its business or (iii) Regulated Activity.

    (b)  To the knowledge of HCCH, neither HCCH nor any of its Subsidiaries 
has any material Environmental Liabilities and there has been no release of 
Hazardous Substances into the environment by HCCH or any such Subsidiary or 
with respect to any of their respective properties which has had, or would be 
reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on HCCH.

                                       27

<PAGE>

    Section 4.18 Labor Matters.  Neither HCCH nor any of its Subsidiaries is 
a party to any collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract 
applicable to persons employed by HCCH or any such Subsidiary, nor do the 
executive officers of HCCH know of any activities or proceedings of any labor 
union to organize any such employees.

    Section 4.19 Compliance with Laws.  Except for violations which do not 
have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the 
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on HCCH, neither HCCH nor any of its 
Subsidiaries is in violation of, or has violated, any applicable provisions 
of any laws, statutes, ordinances or regulations or any term of any judgment, 
decree, injunction or order binding against it.

    Section 4.20 Trademarks, Tradenames, Etc. HCCH owns or possesses, or 
holds a valid right or license to use, all intellectual property, patents, 
trademarks, tradenames, servicemarks, copyrights and licenses, and all rights 
with respect to the foregoing, necessary for the conduct of its business as 
now conducted, without any known conflict with the rights of others.

    Section 4.21 Broker's Fees. Neither HCCH nor Merger Sub, nor anyone 
acting on the behalf or at the request thereof has any liability to any 
broker, finder, investment banker or agent, or has agreed to pay any 
brokerage fees, finder's fees or commissions, or to reimburse any expenses of 
any broker, finder, investment banker or agent in connection with the Merger.

Affiliated Company will each use its reasonable best efforts to satisfy or 
cause to be satisfied all the

forth in this Article XI and except as set forth in Section 11.2, each 
Shareholder, severally and Pro Rata (as hereinafter defined), will indemnify 
and hold harmless HCCH and its respective officers, directors, agents and 
employees, and each person, if any, who controls or may control HCCH within

collectively as "Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all claims, 
demands, actions, causes of action, losses, costs, damages, liabilities and 
expenses including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees, net of any 
recoveries under insurance policies recovered from third parties and tax 
savings known to

this Section 11.1 referred to as "HCCH Damages"), arising out of any 
misrepresentation or breach of or default under any of the representations, 
warranties, covenants or agreements given or made in this Agreement or any 
certificate or exhibit delivered by or on behalf of Holdco, any of the

shall mean the proportion that such Shareholder's holdings of Holdco Common 
Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time bears to the total shares

claim, such Shareholder does not hold the number of shares of HCCH Common

indemnification) necessary to settle any indemnification claim, then such 
Shareholder shall pay in cash or other immediately available funds the cash 
equivalent of the remainder of his in-stock indemnification obligations under 
this Section 11.1 up to his Maximum Shareholder Liability. In lieu of HCCH 
Common Stock, any Shareholder shall have the option to pay in cash or other 
immediately available funds the cash equivalent of all or any part of his 
in-stock Maximum Shareholder Liability.

Damages under this Section following the Closing, the Indemnified Persons

expenses including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees, net of any

representations, warranties, covenants and agreements given or made by HCCH 
or Merger Sub in this Agreement or any certificate or exhibit delivered by or

Indemnified Person's remedy will be limited to receiving up to that number of 
shares of HCCH Common Stock determined by dividing (a) the amount of the 
NASRA Damages by (b) the Closing Date Price.  Provided, however, that 
irrespective of the number of claims asserted by Indemnified Persons 
hereunder in the amount of the NASRA Damages for which indemnification is 
sought, HCCH, in the aggregate, shall under no circumstances be obligated to 
make an indemnification payment hereunder beyond that number of shares of 
HCCH Common Stock equal to the total number of shares of HCCH Common Stock

matter, and the calculation thereof for every purpose thereunder, consent to 
jurisdiction, enter into any settlement, and consent to entry of judgment, 
each with respect to any or all of the Shareholders;

    (b)  receive, accept and give notices and other communications relating 
to this Agreement;

                                       44

    (c)  take any action that the Representative deems necessary or desirable 
in order to fully effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

    (d)  execute and deliver any instrument or document that the 
Representative deems necessary or desirable in the exercise of his authority 
under this Section 11.4; and

    (e)  waive the fulfillment of any condition or conditions to the Closing.

    Those Shareholders who, as of the Effective Date, hold a majority of the 
Holdco Common Stock may, at any time and by written action delivered to HCCH, 
remove the Representative or any successor thereto, but such removal shall be 
effective only upon the replacement of such Representative or successor by a 
new Representative designated, by written notice delivered to HCCH, by those 
Shareholders who, as of the date hereof hold a majority of Holdco Common 
Stock, provided, however, that any such notice shall be effective upon actual 
receipt by HCCH. Any such written notice shall be delivered to HCCH in 
accordance with the notice provisions set forth in Section 12.3 hereof.  If 
any Representative shall have died, become incapacitated or unable to serve, 
those Shareholders who, as of the date hereof, hold a majority of Holdco 
Common Stock shall promptly designate by written notice delivered to HCCH, a 
replacement Representative.  Any costs and expenses incurred by the 
Representative in connection with actions taken pursuant to or permitted by 
this Section 11.4 will be borne by the Shareholders and paid or reimbursed to 
the Representative Pro Rata.

    The foregoing authorization is granted and conferred in consideration for 
the various agreements and covenants of HCCH and Merger Sub contained herein. 
In consideration of the foregoing, and subject to the successorship 
provisions of this Section 11.4, this authorization granted to the 
Representative shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of 
any of the Shareholders or by operation of law, whether by death or 
incompetence of any Shareholder or by the occurrence of any other event 
except the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof. If 
after the execution hereof any such Shareholder shall die or become 
incompetent, the Representative is nevertheless authorized and directed to 
exercise the authority granted in this Section 11.4 as if such death or 
incompetence had not occurred and regardless of notice thereof. The 
Representative shall have no liability to any Shareholder for any act or 
omission or obligation hereunder, provided that such action or omission is 
taken by the Representative in good faith and without willful misconduct.

    Section 11.5 Survival of Representations. Unless any representation, 
warranty, covenant or agreement is required to terminate at an earlier time 
in order to maintain the appropriate pooling-of-interest accounting 
treatment, all representations, warranties, covenants and agreements 
concerned in this Agreement will remain operative and in full force and 
effect for a period of one year after the Closing (the last date of such 
applicable period of not more than one year being herein called the "Final 
Date"), regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the parties 
to this Agreement, upon which Final Date such representations, warranties, 
covenants and agreements shall expire and be of no further force and effect, 
except that the covenants set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement shall 
survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with 

                                       45

<PAGE>

the terms of such Confidentiality Agreement. The indemnification referred to 
and set forth in Section 11.2 shall survive until a final resolution of such 
claim is effective. Any litigation or other action of any kind arising out of 
or attributable to a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or 
agreement contained in this Agreement, except as set forth in Section 11.2, 
must be commenced prior to the Final Date. If not so commenced prior to the 
Final Date, any claims or indemnifications brought under this Article XI will 
thereafter conclusively deemed to be waived regardless of when such claim is 
or should have been discovered.  Any such claim for indemnification brought 
under this Article XI, brought before the Final Date, should survive until a 
final resolution of such claim is effective. As set forth herein, no 
investigation by any party hereto into the business, operations and 
conditions of the other party shall diminish in any way the effect of any 
representation or warranty made by any such party in this Agreement or shall 
relieve any party of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

    Section 11.6 Procedure for Indemnification; Third Party Claims.

    (a)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Article XI 
of notice of a claim against it for indemnification brought under this 
Article XI (a "Claim"), the indemnified party will, if a claim is to be made 
against an indemnifying party, give prompt written notice to the indemnified 
party of the Plan, but the failure to promptly notify the indemnified party 
will not relieve the indemnified party of any liability that it may have to 
any indemnified party, except to the extent that the indemnifying party 
demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudice by the indemnifying 
party's failure to give such prompt notice. Such notice shall contain a 
description in reasonable detail of facts upon which such Claim is based and, 
to the extent known, the amount thereof.

    (b)  If any Claim referred to in this Article XI is made by a third party 
against an indemnified party and each gives written notice to the 
indemnifying party of the Claim, the indemnifying party will be entitled to 
participate in the defense of Claim and, to the extent that it wishes to 
assume the defense of the Claim and, after written notice from the 
indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the 
defense of the Claim, the indemnifying party shall assume such defense and 
will not be liable to the indemnified party under this Article XI for any 
fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of 
the Claim in each case subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in 
connection with the defense of the Claim.

assigned by any party without the prior consent of the others, provided 
however, that HCCH shall be permitted at any time prior to the Effective Time

any term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular 
instance and either retroactively or prospectively) only by a writing signed 
by those persons as provided in this Section 12.8. The waiver by a party of 
any breach hereof or default in the performance hereof shall not be deemed to 
constitute a waiver of any other default or any succeeding breach or default, 
unless such waiver so expressly states.  At any time before the Effective 
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented by Holdco, the Affiliated 
Companies, the Shareholders or HCCH with respect to any of the terms

Section or an Exhibit shall mean an Article of, a Section in, or Exhibit to, 
this Agreement unless otherwise explicitly set forth. The titles and headings

         $6,550,000, in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds 
         to such account or accounts or such Persons as Seller shall designate 
         in writing to Purchaser.  If, prior to Closing, HCCH recapitalizes 
         either through a split-up of its outstanding shares into a greater 
         number, or through a combination of its outstanding shares into a
         lesser number, or reorganizes, reclassifies, or otherwise changes its
         outstanding shares into the same or a different number of shares of 
         other classes (other than through a split-up or a combination of 
         shares provided for in the previous clause), or declares a dividend 
         on its outstanding shares payable in shares or securities convertible 
         into shares (but not cash), the number of shares of HCCH Common Stock 
         that constitutes the HCCH Shares to be issued pursuant to the 
         provisions of this Agreement will be adjusted in proportion to such 
         change.

    Section 1.4 Assumption of Liabilities

         1.4.1     Assumed Liabilities. At the Closing, and subject to 
    the terms and conditions set forth herein, and effective as of the 
    Effective Date, Purchaser shall and does hereby assume and agree to 
    pay, honor and discharge when due any and all liabilities, 
    obligations and commitments of Seller relating exclusively to the 
    Truckers Business and/or the Assets, including, without limitation, 
    compensation payable to Seller and any obligations of Seller to 
    Producers under the Program Manager's Agreement, existing or 
    arising out of Billed Premium collected under the Policies for any 
    periods prior to the Effective Date (collectively, the "Assumed 
    Liabilities") in accordance with the terms and provisions of the 
    assumption agreement ("Assumption Agreement") in substantially the 
    form of Exhibit A attached hereto and hereby made a part hereof.

         1.4.2     Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing 
    or any other provision hereof or any schedule or exhibit hereto, 
    and regardless of any disclosure to Purchaser, Purchaser shall not 
    assume any liabilities, obligations or commitments of Seller 
    relating to or arising out of any other business or operations of 
    the Seller, or the ownership of any Excluded Assets by the Seller 
    other than the Assumed Liabilities (the "Excluded Liabilities").

    Section 1.5 Adjustments to Purchase Price. If, during the one-year period 
beginning on the Effective Date (the "Measurement Period"), (a) the Billed 
Premium for Policies issued in connection with the Truckers Business plus (b) 
the Billed Premium for New Business issued by any insurer in connection with 
the Truckers Business on and after the Effective Date, except that premium 
billed on an annual basis shall be allocated pro rata to the Measurement 
Period, (the amount of such calculation being the "Adjusted Gross Premium") 
is less than Sixteen Million Dollars ($16,000,000.00) (the "Minimum 
Premium"), Seller will refund to Purchaser an amount equal to the ratio of 
fifty percent (50.0%) of the difference between Eighteen Million One Hundred 
Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($18,125,000.00) (the "Target Premium") and the 
Adjusted Gross Premium, over the Target Premium, times Thirteen Million Seven 
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($13,750,000.00) payable in cash.

    Section 1.6 Allocation of Earned Commission. Notwithstanding the 
Effective Date, the parties agree that all commission income earned with 
respect to Billed Premium in connection with the Truckers Business for the 
month of December 1996 (the "December Commission Income") shall be payable 
50% to Seller and 50% to Purchaser. In addition, all commission earned with 
respect to Billed Premium in connection with the Truckers Business for the 
month of January 1997 (the "January Commission Income") shall be payable to 
Purchaser. The parties agree that, to the extent required by law, they will 
file tax returns consistent with the foregoing; provided, however, in the 
event that Seller is required for federal income tax purposes to report as 
ordinary income more than 50% of the December Commission Income and/or any 
portion of the January Commission Income, then the amount of December 
Commission Income and/or January Commission Income payable to Seller shall be 
increased, and the amount of December Commission Income and/or January 
Commission Income payable to Purchaser shall be decreased, by an amount equal 
to the difference between (a) the amount of the December Commission Income 
and/or January Commission Income required to be reported as income by 
Seller for federal income tax purposes in excess of the amount of the 
December Commission Income and/or January Commission Income actually paid to 
Seller (the "Excess Income Amount") multiplied by the highest combined 
federal, state and local income tax rates for individuals on ordinary income 
and (b) the Excess Income Amount multiplied by the highest combined federal, 
state and local income tax rates for individuals on long-term capital gains.

    Section 3.2 Securities Act of 1933
    
         3.2.1  Investment Representations and Warranties. Seller represents 
    and warrants, on behalf of itself and each of the Principals to whom it 
    shall designate that any HCCH Shares should be distributed under this 
    Agreement (collectively, "Holder(s)") to Purchaser and HCCH that:

              (a) Each Holder is an "accredited investor" as that term is 
         defined in Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities Act.

              (b) The HCCH Shares to be received upon consummation of the
         transactions contemplated hereby will be acquired for investment for 
         an indefinite period for each Holder's own account and not with a view
         to the sale or distribution of any part thereof, and that Holders have
         no present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the same.  
         Holders do not have any contract, undertaking, agreement or 
         arrangement with any Person to sell or transfer to such Person any of
         the HCCH Shares.

              (c) Each Holder understands that the HCCH Shares are not and may 
         never be registered under the Securities Act on the ground 

                                    16

<PAGE>
     
         that the sale provided for in this Agreement and the issuance of 
         securities is exempt from the registration provisions thereof, and 
         that the reliance by Purchaser and  HCCH on such exemption is 
         predicated on Seller's representations set forth herein.

              (d) Seller agrees, and shall cause each of the Principals who are
         designated Holder to agree, that in no event will any Holder make a
         disposition of any of the HCCH Shares, unless the HCCH Shares shall 
         have been registered under the Securities Act, unless and until 
         (i) Holder shall have notified HCCH of the proposed disposition, and 
         (ii) Holder shall have furnished HCCH with an opinion of counsel 
         reasonably satisfactory to HCCH or a "no action" or interpretive 
         letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the effect that 
         such registration is not required under the circumstances of such sale
         or transfer.

              (e) Each Holder has such knowledge and experience in financial 
         and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and 
         risks of Holder's investment, has the ability to bear the economic 
         risks of Holder's investment and has been furnished with and has had 
         access to such information as would be made available in the form of 
         a registration statement together with such additional information as 
         is necessary to verify the accuracy of the information supplied and 
         to have all questions which have been asked by Holders answered by or
         on behalf of HCCH.

              (f) Each Holder understands that if a registration statement 
         covering the HCCH Shares under the Securities Act is not in effect 
         when such Holder desires to sell any of the HCCH Shares, Holder may be
         required to hold such HCCH Shares for an indeterminate period. Seller 
         also acknowledges, and shall cause each Holder to acknowledge, that 
         Holder understands that any sale of the HCCH Shares which might be 
         made by Holder in reliance upon Rule 144 under the Securities Act may 
         be made only in limited amounts in accordance with the terms and 
         conditions of that Rule.  Each Holder has consulted with Seller's or 
         Holder's own counsel regarding the terms of Rule 144 and the 
         restrictions on sales of the HCCH Shares imposed thereby, and is 
         willing to accept the HCCH Shares pursuant to this Agreement subject 
         to the limitations of Rule 144.

         3.2.2     Legends. All certificates representing the HCCH Shares shall
    bear substantially the following legend:

         "THE SHARES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED

         AGENT) IS PRESENTED WITH EITHER A WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL 
         SATISFACTORY TO COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY OR A 'NO-ACTION' OR 
         INTERPRETIVE LETTER FROM THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO

         Sheet (including the notes thereto);

              (b)  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business

         3.3.9     Territorial Restrictions. Purchaser is not restricted by any
    written agreement or understanding with any other Person from carrying on 
    the Truckers Business anywhere in the United States of America, and

    Business from Seller pursuant hereto and the assumption of the Assumed 
    Liabilities, become restricted in carrying on the Truckers Business 
    anywhere in the United States of America by reason of any restrictions 
    imposed upon Purchaser under any such agreement or understanding.

         4.1.7     Disclosure Memorandum [Intentionally Omitted.]

         4.1.8     Enforcement of Rights and Non-Competition Agreement

              (a)  Cooperation in Enforcement of Rights. On and after the 
         Closing Date, to the extent required to allow Purchaser to avail 
         itself of any rights acquired or liabilities assumed hereunder and to 
         exercise all legal, equitable and contractual rights acquired or 
         liabilities assumed by Purchaser and HCCH hereunder, Seller shall, and
         shall cause its Affiliates to, at the request of Purchaser, cooperate 
         with Purchaser in taking timely legal action and exercising all legal,
         equitable and contractual rights that may be available to Seller with 
         respect thereto.

              (b)  Support of Marketing Efforts of Purchaser. On and after the
         Closing Date, Purchaser shall have the exclusive right to market the
         Truckers Business through the Producers. Seller shall take any and all
         other commercially reasonable steps and actions that may be requested 
         by Purchaser to effect the appointment of all Producers as agents of
         Purchaser, and to notify promptly such Producers of the assignment of 
         their contracts to Purchaser with respect to the Truckers Business.

              (c) Non-Competition. Seller acknowledges and agrees that the 
         Purchase Price paid by Purchaser to Seller for the Truckers Business 
         and the Assets has been calculated and based upon, among other things,
         the present and future value of the Truckers Business. and the ability
         of Purchaser to conserve the Truckers Business following the Closing 
         Date through the use of the Producers currently marketing and 
         servicing the Policies under the Program Manager's Agreement in the 
         continued marketing and servicing of the Policies, and that 
         Purchaser's conservation efforts, and the future value of the Truckers
         Business, will be enhanced substantially by reason of the  continued 
         relationship among the Producers, Purchaser and RNRS. Seller 
         recognizes and agrees that the nature of the Truckers Business is a
         national business throughout the continental United States of America,
         and  that Purchaser will, after the Closing Date, continue to market 
         the Truckers Business throughout the continental United States through
         a variety of channels, including by means of its own employees, 
         brokers, representatives, agents, Producers, and otherwise. Seller 
         also recognizes Purchaser's interest in protecting the Truckers 
         Business and the establishment and maintenance of good relationships 
         with the Producers and RNRS, and that such interest gives rise to 
         Purchaser's desire to restrain Seller and the Principals, and their 
         respective successors and assigns, from competing with 

                                      25
<PAGE>
         Purchaser in any Competitive Business for a reasonable
         period of time and within reasonable geographic limits after the 
         Closing Date. Therefore, Seller agrees to enter into this covenant not
         to compete with Purchaser and shall cause each of the Principals to 
         enter into the Noncompetition Agreements with Purchaser in 
         consideration of the Purchaser's payment of the Purchase Price and 
         the other agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement. ln 
         consideration of the foregoing, Seller agrees that, during the ten 
         (10) year period following the Effective Date, or for such shorter 
         period during which Purchaser or its successors or assigns shall 
         engage in the Truckers Business and except as may be specifically 
         requested by Purchaser in writing or as otherwise required, permitted 
         or contemplated under this Agreement, Seller will not, directly or 
         indirectly, alone or with or through any other Person or entity, as a
         member of a partnership, limited liability company, or other business
         entity or as an investor in any security of any class (except for 
         ownership of the HCCH Shares or as an investor in less than 5% of any 
         outstanding equity securities of any corporation, partnership, limited
         liability company or other business entity), or as a consultant, 
         advisor, agent, representative of any business entity, or through any 
         officer, director, agent, employee, or Affiliate of the Seller, their 
         successors or assigns, or by any contract, agreement, arrangement or 
         understanding with any other Person or business entity, engage in a 
         Competitive Business in any state, district or jurisdiction in the 
         continental United States of America. Seller and Purchaser recognize 
         and agree that Purchaser's enforcement of this covenant and the 
         Noncompetition Agreements is necessary to prevent irreparable harm and
         damage to the  Truckers Business acquired by Purchaser under this 
         Agreement, and that the limitations as to time, geographical  area and 
         the scope of activity restrained hereby are reasonable and do not 
         impose on Seller and the Principals any greater restraint than is 
         necessary to protect the Truckers Business and Purchaser's 
         relationships with the Producers and RNRS. If Seller or any of the 
         Principals commits a breach, or threatens to commit a breach, of any 
         of the provisions of this Section 4.1.8 or of the Noncompetition 
         Agreements, Purchaser shall have the right and remedy, in addition to 
         any other remedies available to it at law or in equity:

                   (i)  to have the provisions of this Section 4.1.8 
              specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, 
              including, without limitation, immediate injunctive relief, it 
              being acknowledged and agreed by Seller that any such breach or 
              threatened breach will cause irreparable injury or harm to 
              Purchaser and that 

                                      26

<PAGE>
              money damages will not provide an adequate remedy to Purchaser; 
              and

                   (ii) to require Seller and the Principals to account for 
              and pay over to Purchaser all compensation, profits, monies, 
              accruals, increments or other benefits (collectively, 
              "Benefits") derived or received by Seller or the Principals as 
              the result of any transactions constituting a breach of any of 
              the provisions of this Section 4.1.8, and Seller hereby agrees 
              to account for and pay over such Benefits to Purchaser; and

                   (iii) to recover from Seller reasonable attorney's fees and
              expenses incurred by Purchaser in connection with any proceedings
              to enforce the provisions of this Section 4.1.8.

              (d)  Each of the rights and remedies enumerated in this Section 
         4.1.8 shall be independent of the other, and shall be severally 
         enforceable, and such rights and remedies shall be in addition to, 
         and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to 
         Purchaser under law or in equity. In the event that Purchaser 
         prevails in any action or proceeding in any court of  competent 
         jurisdiction that, results in a finding that this covenant or any of 
         the Noncompetition Agreements have been breached or violated by 
         Seller or any of the Principals, then the parties agree that, in 
         addition to any other damages awarded to Purchaser for such 
         violation or breach, the Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount 
         equal to two and one-half (2 1/2) times the total amount of damages, 
         costs and attorney's fees awarded Purchaser by the court in any such 
         court proceedings, not to exceed the Purchase Price as adjusted 
         pursuant to Section 1.5.

              (e)  If any provision of this Section 4.1.8 is  held to be 
         unenforceable because of the scope, duration or area of its 
         applicability, the tribunal making such determination shall have the 
         power to modify such scope, duration, or area, or all of them, and 
         such provision or provisions shall then be applicable in such 
         modified form.

         4.1.9     Transition Team.  Seller hereby designates Sue Carson and
    Bernadette Leiggi (the "Designated Employees") to assist in the orderly 
    transfer of the Truckers Business from Seller to Purchaser ("Transition 
    Services") during a period not less than six (6) months nor longer than one
    year from the Closing Date (the "Transition Period"). During the Transition
    Period, Seller shall provide and bear the cost of office space and related 
    office furniture and equipment,

                                   INDEMNIFICATION

    Section 7.1 By Seller. Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless 
HCCH and Purchaser, their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, 
advisers, representatives in such capacities and Affiliates (collectively, the 
"Purchaser Indemnitees") from and against, and pay or reimburse Purchaser 
Indemnitees for, any and all claims, liabilities, obligations, losses, fines, 
costs, royalties, proceedings, deficiencies or damages (whether absolute, 
accrued, conditional or otherwise and whether or not resulting from third party 
claims), including expenses paid to third parties and reasonable outside 
attorneys' and accountants' fees incurred in the investigation or defense of 
any of the same or in asserting any of their respective rights hereunder 
(collectively, "Losses"), resulting from or arising out of:

              (i)  any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty by Seller 
         made or contained in this Agreement or in any Collateral Agreement to 
         which it is a party or in connection herewith or therewith;

              (ii) any failure of Seller to perform in any material respect any
         covenant or agreement hereunder or under any Collateral Agreement to 
         which it is a party or to fulfill any other obligation in respect 
         hereof or of any Collateral Agreement to which it is a party;

             (iii) any Excluded Liabilities or Excluded Assets; and

              (iv) any and all Taxes of Seller and all Affiliates thereof not
         relating to or arising out of the Truckers Business.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the maximum 
aggregate amount recoverable by Purchaser Indemnitees for all claims for 
indemnification under this Agreement under this Section 7.1 shall, in the 
aggregate, not exceed the Purchase Price.

    Section 7.2 By Purchaser and HCCH. Purchaser and HCCH shall defend, 
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its officers, directors, employees, 
agents, advisers, representatives and Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller 
Indemnitees") from and against any and all Losses resulting from or arising out 
of:

              (i)  any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty by 
         Purchaser or HCCH made or contained in this Agreement or in any 
         Collateral Agreement to which it is a party or in connection herewith 
         or therewith; or

              (ii) any failure of Purchaser or HCCH to perform in any material
         respect any covenant or agreement hereunder or under any Collateral

                                      35

<PAGE>

         Agreement to which it is a party or fulfill any other obligation in 
         respect hereof or thereof;

              (iii) the Assumed Liabilities;

              (iv) any Taxes relating to the Truckers Business for any period 
         on and after the Effective Date; and

              (v)  the operation of the Truckers Business by Purchaser or
         Purchaser's ownership, operation or use of the Assets following the 
         Closing Date,

    except, in the case of clause (v), to the extent such Losses result from or
    arise out of the Excluded Liabilities or constitute Losses for which Seller
    is required to indemnify Purchaser Indemnitees under Section 7.1.

    Section 7.3 Adjustments to Indemnification Payments. Any payment made by 
Seller to Purchaser Indemnities, on the one hand, or by Purchaser to the Seller 
Indemnities, on the other hand, pursuant to this Article 7 in respect of any 
claim (i) shall be net of any insurance proceeds realized by and paid to the 
Indemnified Party in respect of such claim and (ii) shall be (A) reduced by an 
amount equal to any Tax benefits attributable to such claim and (B) increased 
by an amount equal to any Taxes attributable to the receipt of such payment, 
but only to the extent that such Tax benefits are actually realized, or such 
Taxes are actually paid, as the case may be, by Seller or by Purchaser or by 
any consolidated, combined or unitary group of which Purchaser or Seller is a 
member. The Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable efforts to make 
insurance claims relating to any claim for which it is seeking indemnification 
pursuant to this Article 7; provided that the Indemnified Party shall not be 
obligated to make such an insurance claim if the Indemnified Party in its 
reasonable judgment believes that the cost of pursuing such an insurance claim
together with any corresponding increase in insurance premiums or other 
chargebacks to the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, would exceed the 
value of the claim for which the Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification.

    Section 7.4 Indemnification Procedures. In the case of any claim asserted 
by a third party against a party entitled to indemnification under this 
Agreement (the "Indemnified Party"), notice shall be given by the Indemnified 
Party to the party required to provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying 
Party") promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim 
as to which indemnity may be sought, and the Indemnified Party shall permit the 

                                      36
<PAGE>

Indemnifying Party (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party) to assume the 
defense of any claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that (i) 
the counsel for the Indemnifying Party who shall conduct the defense of such 
claim or litigation shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified 
Party, (ii) the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such 
Indemnified Party's expense, and (iii) the omission by any Indemnified Party 
to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of 
its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except to the extent that 
such omission results in a failure of actual notice to the Indemnifying Party 
and such indemnifying Party is materially damaged as a result of such failure 
to give notice. Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified 
Party, no Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, 
shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that 
provides for injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified 
Party or that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by 
each claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all 
liability with respect to such claim or litigation. In the event that the 
Indemnified Parry shall in good faith determine that the conduct of the 
defense of any claim subject to indemnification hereunder or any proposed 
settlement of any such claim by the Indemnifying Party might be expected to 
affect adversely the Indemnified Party's Tax liability or the ability of 
Purchaser to conduct its business, or that the Indemnified Party may have 
available to it one or more defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent 
with one or more of those that may be available to the Indemnifying Party in 
respect of such claim or any litigation relating thereto, the Indemnified 
Party shall have the right at all times to take over and assume control over 
the defense, settlement, negotiations or litigation relating to any such 
claim at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party, provided that if the 
Indemnified Party does so take over and assume control, the Indemnified Party 
shall not settle such claim or litigation without the written consent of the 
Indemnifying Parry, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.  In the 
event that the Indemnifying Party does not accept the defense of any matter 
as above provided, the Indemnified Parry shall have the full right to defend 
against any such claim or demand and shall be entitled to settle or agree to 
pay in full such claim or demand. In any event, the Indemnifying Party and 
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense of any claim or 
litigation subject to this Section 7 and the records of each shall be 
available to the other with respect to such defense.

    Section 7.5 Limits on Indemnification. Anything in this Agreement to the 
contrary notwithstanding, claims for indemnification of Losses hereunder 
shall not be made by any party unless the aggregate amount of such Losses 
exceeds Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) ("Threshold Amount"), and 
Seller shall have no obligation for any Losses in excess of the Purchase 
Price, as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.5. In the event the aggregate Losses 
for which any claim of indemnification is made exceed the Threshold Amount, 
the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the full amount of such Losses, 
subject to the limitations set forth herein.

$12,000,000.00                                                  Houston, Texas
                                                               October 7, 1996

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned HOUSTON CASUALTY COMPANY ("Borrower")
promises to pay to the order of WELLS FARGO BANK (TEXAS), NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
("Bank") at its office at 1000 Louisiana, Houston, Texas, or at such other place
as the holder hereof may designate, in lawful money of the United States of
America and in immediately available funds, the principal sum of Twelve Million
Dollars ($12,000,000.00), or so much thereof as may be advanced and be
outstanding, with interest thereon, to be computed on each advance from the date
of its disbursement as set forth herein.

INTEREST:

(a)  Interest.  The outstanding principal balance of this Note shall bear
interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day year, actual days elapsed, unless
such calculation would result in a usurious rate, in which case interest shall
be computed on the basis of 365/366-day year, as the case may be, actual days
elapsed) at the lesser of (i)  a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate in
effect from time to time, or (ii)  the Maximum Rate.  The "Prime Rate" is a base
rate that Bank from time to time establishes and which serves as the basis upon
which effective rates of interest are calculated for those loans making
reference thereto.  Each change in the rate of interest hereunder shall become
effective on the date each Prime Rate change is announced within Bank.

(b)  Payment of Interest.  Interest accrued on this Note shall be payable on the
first (1st) day of each month, commencing December 1, 1996.

BORROWING AND REPAYMENT:

(a)  Borrowing and Repayment.  Borrower may from time to time during the term of
this Note borrow, partially or wholly repay its outstanding borrowings, and
reborrow, subject to all of the limitations, terms and conditions of this Note
and of any document executed in connection with or governing this Note; 
provided however, that the total outstanding borrowings under this Note shall
not at any time exceed the principal amount stated above.  The unpaid principal
balance of this obligation at any time shall be the total amounts advanced
hereunder by the holder hereof less the amount of principal payments made hereon
by or for any Borrower, which balance may be endorsed hereon from time to time
by the holder.  The outstanding principal balance of this Note shall be due and
payable in full on April 30, 1997.

(b)  Advances.  Advances hereunder, to the total amount of the principal sum
stated above, may be made by the holder at the oral or written request of (i)
                     or                             , any one acting alone, who
are authorized to request advances and direct the disposition of any advances
until written notice of the revocation of such authority is received by the
holder at the office designated above, or (ii) any person, with respect to
advances deposited to the credit of any account of any Borrower with the holder,
which advances, when so deposited, shall be conclusively presumed to have been
made to or for the benefit of each Borrower regardless of the fact that persons
other than those authorized to request advances may have authority to draw
against such account.  The holder shall have no obligation to determine whether
any person requesting an advance is or has been authorized by any Borrower.

(c)  Application of Payments.  Each payment made on this Note shall be credited
first, to any interest then due and second, to the outstanding principal balance
hereof.

EVENTS OF DEFAULT:

This Note is made pursuant to and is subject to the terms and conditions of that
certain Credit Agreement between Borrower and Bank dated as of October 7, 1996,
as amended from time to time (the "Credit Agreement").  Any default in the
payment or performance of any obligation under this Note, or any defined event
of default under the Credit Agreement, shall constitute an "Event of Default"
under this Note.

MISCELLANEOUS:

(a)  Remedies.  Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the holder of this
Note, at the holder's option, may declare all sums of principal and accrued and
unpaid interest outstanding hereunder to be immediately due and payable without
presentment, demand, or any notices of any kind, including without limitation
notice of nonperformance, notice of protest, protest, notice of dishonor, notice
of intention to accelerate or notice of acceleration, all of which are expressly
waived by each Borrower, and the obligation, if any, of the holder to extend any

<PAGE>
further credit hereunder shall immediately cease and terminate.  Each Borrower
shall pay to the holder immediately upon demand the full amount of all payments,
advances, charges, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees (to
include outside counsel fees and all allocated costs of the holder's in-house
counsel to the extent permissible), expended or incurred by the holder in
connection with the enforcement of the holder's rights and/or the collection of
any amount which become due to the holder under this Note, and the prosecution
or defense of any action in any way related to this Note, including without
limitation, any action for declaratory relief, whether incurred at the trial or
appellate level, in arbitration proceeding or otherwise, and including any of
the foregoing incurred in connection with any bankruptcy proceeding (including
without limitation, any adversary proceeding, contested matter or motion brought
by Bank or any other person) relating to any Borrower or any other person or
entity.

(b)  Obligations Joint and Several.  Should more than one person or entity sign
this Note as a Borrower, the obligations of each such Borrower shall be joint
and several.

(c)  Governing Law.  This Note shall be governed by and constructed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.

(d)  Savings Clause.  It is the intention of the parties to comply strictly with
applicable usury laws.  Accordingly, notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary in this Note, or in any contract, instrument or document evidencing or
securing the payment hereof or otherwise relating hereto (each, a "Related
Document"), in no event shall this Note or any Related Document require the
payment or permit the payment, taking, reserving, receiving, collection or
charging of any sums constituting interest under applicable laws that exceed the
maximum amount permitted by such laws, as the same may be amended or modified
from time to time (the "Maximum Rate").  If any such excess interest is called
for, contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received in connection with
this Note or any Related Document, or in any communication by Bank or any other
person to Borrower or any other person, or in the event that all or part of the
principal or interest hereof or thereof shall be prepaid or accelerated, so that
under any of such circumstances or under any other circumstances whatsoever the
amount of interest contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received on the
amount of principal actually outstanding from time to time under this Note shall
exceed the Maximum Rate, then in such event it is agreed that:  (i)  the
provisions of this paragraph shall govern and control;  (ii)  neither Borrower
nor any other person or entity now or hereafter liable for the payment of this
Note or any Related Document shall be obligated to pay the amount of such
interest to the extent it is in excess of the Maximum Rate;  (iii)  any such
excess interest which is or has been received by Bank, notwithstanding this
paragraph, shall be credited against the then unpaid principal balance hereof
and thereof, or if this Note or any Related Document has been or would be paid
in full by such credit, refunded to Borrower; and (iv)  the provisions of this
Note and each Related Document, and other communication to Borrower, shall
immediately be deemed reformed and such excess interest reduced, without the
necessity of executing any other document, to the Maximum Rate.  The right to
accelerate the maturity of this Note or any Related Document does note include
the right to accelerate, collect or charge unearned interest, but only such
interest that has otherwise accrued as of the date of acceleration.  Without
limiting the foregoing, all calculations of the rate of interest contracted for,
charged taken, reserved or received in connection with this Note and any Related
Document which are made for the purpose of determining whether such rate exceeds
the Maximum Rate shall be made to the extent permitted by applicable laws by
amortizing, prorating, allocating and spreading during the period of the full
term of this Note or such Related Document, including all prior subsequent
renewals and extensions hereof and thereof, all interest at any time contracted
for, charged, taken, reserved or received by Bank.  The terms of this paragraph
shall be deemed to be incorporated into each Related Document.

To the extent that Article 5069-1.04 of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes is
relevant to Bank for the purpose of determining the Maximum Rate, Bank hereby
elects to determine the applicable rate ceiling under such Article by the
indicated (weekly) rate ceiling from time to time in effect, subject to Bank's
right subsequently to change such method in accordance with applicable law, as
the same may be amended or modified from time to time.

(e)  Right of Setoff;  Deposit Accounts.  Upon and after the occurrence of an
Event of Default, (i) Borrower hereby authorizes Bank, at any time and from time
to time, without notice, which is hereby expressly waived by Borrower, and
whether or not Bank shall have declared this Note to be due and payable in
accordance with the terms hereof, to set off against, and to appropriate and
apply to the payment of, Borrower's obligations and liabilities under this Note
(whether matured or unmatured, fixed or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated),
any and all amounts owing by Bank to Borrower (whether payable in U.S. dollars
or any other currency, whether matured or unmatured, and in the case of
deposits, whether general or special (except trust and escrow accounts), time or
demand and however evidenced), and (ii) pending any such action, to the extent
necessary, to hold such amounts as collateral to secure such obligations and
liabilities and to return as unpaid for insufficient funds any and all checks
and other items drawn against any deposits so held as Bank, in its sole
discretion, may elect.  Borrower hereby grants to Bank a security interest in
all deposits and accounts maintained with Bank and with any other financial
institution to secure the payment of all obligations and liabilities of Borrower
to Bank under this Note.

(f)  Business Purpose.  Borrower represents and warrants that all loans
evidenced by this Note are for a business, commercial, investment, agricultural
or other similar purpose and not primarily for a personal, family or household
use.
<PAGE>
(g)  Certain Tri-Party Accounts.  Borrower and Bank agree that Tex. Rev. Civ.
Stat. Ann. Art. 5056, ch 15 (which regulates certain revolving credit loan
accounts and revolving tri-party accounts) shall not apply to any revolving loan
accounts created under this Note or maintained in connection herewith.

NOTICE:  THIS NOTE AND ALL OTHER DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE INDEBTEDNESS
EVIDENCED HEREBY CONSTITUTE A WRITTEN LOAN AGREEMENT WHICH REPRESENTS THE FINAL

                                   CREDIT AGREEMENT

    THIS AGREEMENT is entered into as of October 7, 1996, by and between 
HOUSTON CASUALTY COMPANY, a Texas corporation ("Borrower"), and WELLS FARGO 
BANK (TEXAS), NATIONAL ASSOCIATION ("Bank").

                                       RECITAL

    Borrower has requested from Bank the credit accommodation described 
below, and Bank has agreed to provide said credit accommodation to Borrower 
on the terms and conditions contained herein.

    NOW, THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency 
of which are hereby acknowledged, Bank and Borrower hereby agree as follows:

                                      ARTICLE I
                                      THE CREDIT

    SECTION 1.1.   LINE OF CREDIT.

    (a)  Line of Credit.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement, Bank hereby agrees to make advances to Borrower from time to time 
up to and including April 30, 1997, not to exceed at any time the aggregate 
principal amount of Twelve Million Dollars ($12,000,000.00) ("Line of 
Credit"), the proceeds of which shall be used to finance working capital.  
Borrower's obligation to repay advances under the Line of Credit shall be 
evidenced by a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit A 
attached hereto ("Line of Credit Note"), all terms of which are incorporated 
herein by this reference.

    (b)  Letter of Credit Subfeature.  As a subfeature under the Line of 
Credit, Bank agrees from time to time during the term thereof to issue 
Standby Letters of Credit for the account of Borrower (each, a "Letter of 
Credit" and collectively, "Letters of Credit"); provided however, that the 
form and substance of each Letter of Credit shall be subject to approval by 
Bank, in its sole discretion; and provided further, that the aggregate 
undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit shall not at any time 
exceed Twelve Million Dollars ($12,000,000.00).  The last day any such Letter 
of Credit may expire is April 30, 1998. The undrawn amount of all Letters of 
Credit shall be reserved under the Line of Credit and shall not be available 
for borrowings thereunder. Each Letter of Credit shall be subject to the 
additional terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit Agreement and related 
<PAGE>

documents, if any, required by Bank in connection with the issuance thereof 
(each, a "Letter of Credit Agreement" and collectively, "Letter of Credit 
Agreements"). Each draft paid by Bank under a Letter of Credit shall be 
deemed an advance under the Line of Credit and shall be repaid by Borrower in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement applicable to such 
advances; provided however, that if advances under the Line of Credit are not 
available, for any reason, at the time any draft is paid by Bank, then 
Borrower shall immediately pay to Bank the full amount of such draft, 
together with interest thereon from the date such amount is paid by Bank to 
the date such amount is fully repaid by Borrower, at the rate of interest 
applicable to advances under the Line of Credit.  In such event Borrower 
agrees that Bank, in its sole discretion, may debit any demand deposit 
account maintained by Borrower with Bank for the amount of any such draft.

    (c)  Borrowing and Repayment.  Borrower may from time to time during the
term of the Line of Credit borrow, partially or wholly repay its outstanding
borrowings, and reborrow, subject to all of the limitations, terms and
conditions contained herein or in the Line of Credit Note; provided however,
that the total outstanding borrowings under the Line of Credit shall not at any
time exceed the maximum principal amount available thereunder, as set forth
above.

    SECTION 1.2.   INTEREST/FEES.

    (a)  Interest.  The outstanding principal balance of the Line of Credit
shall bear interest at the rate of interest set forth in the Line of Credit
Note.

    (b)  Computation and Payment.  Interest shall be computed on the basis of a
360-day year, actual days elapsed, unless such calculation would result in a
usurious rate, in which case interest shall be computed on the basis of a
365/366-day year, as the case may be, actual days elapsed.  Interest shall be
payable at the times and place set forth in the Line of Credit Note.

    (c)  Letter of Credit Fees.  Borrower shall pay to Bank (i) fees upon the
issuance of each Letter of Credit equal to the greater of one percent (1.00%) of
the face amount thereof, or $300.00, (ii) fees upon payment or negotiation by
Bank of each draft under any Letter of Credit equal to $60.00, and (iii) fees
upon the occurrence of any other activity with respect to any Letter of Credit
(including without limitation, the transfer, amendment or cancellation of any
Letter of Credit) equal to $40.00.

    SECTION 1.3.   COLLATERAL.

    As security for all indebtedness of Borrower to Bank subject hereto, 
Borrower hereby grants to Bank a security interest equal to one hundred 
twenty-five percent (125%) (based on the current market values of Borrower's 
outstanding Letters of Credit and advances under the Line of Credit) in 
Borrower's interest in and to the account maintained by Borrower with Wells 
Fargo Bank (Texas), National Association (Trust Department), as custodian 
(the "Custodian") under account number 9002183500 and styled Houston Casualty 
Company Custody Account(the "Account"), as same may have been or may be 
amended from time to time, and in and to all securities, certificates of 
deposit, monies, instruments, documents, general intangibles and other 
property held and to be held in the Account, or held or to be held by 
Custodian for the benefit of Debtor, together with all renewals,

increases thereof.  All of the foregoing shall be evidenced by and subject to 
the terms of such security agreements, financing statements, deeds of trust 
and other documents as Bank shall reasonably require, all in form and 
substance satisfactory to Bank.  Borrower shall reimburse Bank immediately 
upon demand for all costs and expenses incurred by Bank in connection with 
any of the foregoing security, including without limitation, filing and 
recording fees and costs of appraisals, audits and title insurance.

                                      ARTICLE II

    SECTION 7.4.   SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNMENT.  This Agreement shall be binding 
upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators, legal

that Borrower may not assign or transfer its interest hereunder without

transfer, negotiate or grant participations in all or any part of, or any 
interest in, Bank's rights and benefits under each of the Loan Documents.  In 
connection therewith, Bank may disclose all documents and information which 
Bank now has or may hereafter acquire relating to any credit extended by Bank

    SECTION 7.5.   ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENT.  This Agreement and the other

a written instrument executed by each party hereto.

    SECTION 7.6.   NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES.  This Agreement is made and

    SECTION 7.9.  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in any number 
of counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to 
be an original, and all of which when taken together shall constitute one and 
the same Agreement.

    SECTION 7.10.  GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement shall be governed by and 
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.

    SECTION 7.11.  SAVINGS CLAUSE.  It is the intention of the parties to 
comply strictly with applicable usury laws. Accordingly, notwithstanding any 
provision to the contrary in the Loan Documents, in no event shall any Loan 
Documents require the payment or permit the payment, taking, reserving, 
receiving, collection or charging of any sums constituting interest under 
applicable laws that exceed the maximum amount permitted by such laws, as the 
same may be amended or modified from time to time (the "Maximum Rate").  If 
any such excess interest is called for, contracted for, charged, taken, 
reserved or received in connection with any Loan Documents, or in any 
communication by Lender or any other person to Borrower or any other person, 
or in the event that all or part of the principal or interest hereof or 
thereof shall be prepaid or accelerated, so that under any of such 
circumstances or under any other circumstance whatsoever the amount of 
interest contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received on the amount 
of principal actually outstanding from time to time under the Loan Documents 
shall exceed the Maximum Rate, then in such event it is agreed that: (i) the 
provisions of this paragraph shall govern and control; (ii) neither Borrower 
nor any other person or entity now or hereafter liable for the payment of any 
Loan Documents shall be obligated to pay the amount of such interest to the 
extent it is in excess of the Maximum Rate; (iii) any such excess interest 
which is or has been received by Lender, notwithstanding this paragraph, 
shall be credited against the then unpaid principal balance hereof or 
thereof, or if any of the Loan Documents has been or would be paid in full by 
such credit, refunded to Borrower; and (iv) the provisions of each of the 
Loan Documents, and any other communication to Borrower, shall immediately be 
deemed reformed and such excess interest reduced, without the necessity of 
executing any other document, to the Maximum Rate.  The right to accelerate 
the maturity of the Loan Documents does not include the right to accelerate, 
collect or charge unearned interest, but only such interest that has 
otherwise accrued as of the date of acceleration.  Without limiting the 
foregoing, all calculations of the rate of interest contracted for, charged, 
taken, reserved or received in connection with any of the Loan Documents 
which are made for the purpose of determining whether such rate exceeds the 
Maximum Rate shall be made to the extent permitted by applicable laws by 
amortizing, prorating, allocating and spreading during the period of the full 
term of such Loan Documents, including all prior and subsequent renewals and 
extensions hereof or thereof, all interest at any time contracted for, 
charged, taken, reserved or received by Lender. The terms of this paragraph 
shall be deemed to be incorporated into each of the other Loan Documents.

                                     -14-
<PAGE>

    To the extent that Article 5069-1.04 of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes 
is relevant to Lender for the purpose of determining the Maximum Rate, Bank 
hereby elects to determine the applicable rate ceiling under such Article by 
the indicated (weekly) rate ceiling from time to time in effect, subject to 
Lender's right subsequently to change such method in accordance with 
applicable law, as the same may be amended or modified from time to time.

    SECTION 7.12.  RIGHT OF SETOFF; DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS.  Upon and after the 
occurrence of an Event of Default, (a) Borrower hereby authorizes Bank, at 
any time and from time to time, without notice, which is hereby expressly 
waived by each Borrower, and whether or not Bank shall have declared any 
credit extended hereunder to be due and payable in accordance with the terms 
hereof, to set off against, and to appropriate and apply to the payment of, 
Borrower's obligations and liabilities under the Loan Documents (whether 
matured or unmatured, fixed or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated), any 
and all amounts owing by Bank to Borrower (whether payable in U.S. dollars or 
any other currency, whether matured or unmatured, and in the case of 
deposits, whether general or special (except trust and escrow accounts), time 
or demand and however evidenced), and (b) pending any such action, to the 
extent necessary, to hold such amounts as collateral to secure such 
obligations and liabilities and to return as unpaid for insufficient funds 
any and all checks and other items drawn against any deposits so held as 
Bank, in its sole discretion, may elect.  Borrower hereby grants to Bank a 
security interest in all deposits and accounts maintained with Bank and with 
any other financial institution to secure the payment of all obligations and 
liabilities of Borrower to Bank under the Loan Documents.

    SECTION 7.13.  BUSINESS PURPOSE.  Borrower represents and warrants that 
any credit extended hereunder is for a business, commercial, investment, 
agricultural or other similar purpose and not primarily for a personal, 
family or household use.

    SECTION 7.14.  ARBITRATION.

    (a) Arbitration.  Upon the demand of any party, any Dispute shall be 
resolved by binding arbitration (except as set forth in (e) below) in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  A "Dispute" shall mean any 
action, dispute, claim or controversy of any kind, whether in contract or 
tort, statutory or common law, legal or equitable, now existing or hereafter 
arising under or in connection with, or in any way pertaining to, any of the 

                                     -15-

<PAGE>

Loan Documents, or any past, present or future extensions of credit and other 
activities, transactions or obligations of any kind related directly or 
indirectly to any of the Loan Documents, including without limitation, any of 
the foregoing arising in connection with the exercise of any self-help, 
ancillary or other remedies pursuant to any of the Loan Documents.  Any party 
may by summary proceedings bring an action in court to compel arbitration of 
a Dispute.  Any party who fails or refuses to submit tb arbitration following 
a lawful demand by any other party shall bear all costs and expenses 
incurred by such other party in compelling arbitration of any Dispute.

    (b) Governing Rules.  Arbitration proceedings shall be administered by 
the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") or such other administrator as 
the parties shall mutually agree upon in accordance with the AAA Commercial 
Arbitration Rules. All Disputes submitted to arbitration shall be resolved in 
accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States 
Code), notwithstanding any conflicting choice of law provision in any of the 
Loan Documents.  The arbitration shall be conducted at a location in Texas 
selected by the AAA or other administrator. If there is any inconsistency 
between the terms hereof and any such rules, the terms and procedures set 
forth herein shall control.  All statutes of limitation applicable to any 
Dispute shall apply to any arbitration proceeding.  All discovery activities 
shall be expressly limited to matters directly relevant to the Dispute being 
arbitrated.  Judgment upon any award rendered in an arbitration may be 
entered in any court having jurisdiction; provided however, that nothing 
contained herein shall be deemed to be a waiver by any party that is a bank 
of the protections afforded to it under 12 U.S.C. Section 91 or any similar 
applicable state law.

    (c)  No Waiver; Provisional Remedies, Self-Help and Foreclosure.  No 
provision hereof shall limit the right of any party to exercise self-help 
remedies such as setoff, foreclosure against or sale of any real or personal 
property collateral or security, or to obtain provisional or ancillary 
remedies, including without limitation injunctive relief, sequestration, 
attachment, garnishment or the appointment of a receiver, from a court of 
competent jurisdiction before, after or during the pendency of any 
arbitration or other proceeding.  The exercise of any such remedy shall not 
waive the right of any party to compel arbitration hereunder.

    (d)  Arbitrator Qualifications and Powers; Awards. Arbitrators must be 
active members of the Texas State Bar with expertise in the substantive laws 
applicable to the subject matter of the Dispute.  Arbitrators are empowered 
to resolve Disputes by summary rulings in response to motions filed prior to 
the final arbitration hearing. Arbitrators (i) shall resolve all Disputes in 
accordance with the substantive law of the state of Texas, (ii) may grant any 
remedy or relief that a court of the state of Texas could order or grant 


                                     -16-
<PAGE>

within the scope hereof and such ancillary relief as is necessary to make 
effective any award, and (iii) shall have the power to award recovery of all 
costs and fees, to impose sanctions and to take such other actions as they 
deem necessary to the same extent a judge could pursuant to the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure or other applicable 
law.  Any Dispute in which the amount in controversy is $5,000,000 or less 
shall be decided by a single arbitrator who shall not render an award of 
greater than $5,000,000 (including damages, costs, fees and expenses). By 
submission to a single arbitrator, each party expressly waives any right or 
claim to recover more than $5,000,000.  Any Dispute in which the amount in 
controversy exceeds $5,000,000 shall be decided by majority vote of a panel 
of three arbitrators; provided however, that all three arbitrators must 
actively participate in all hearings and deliberations.

    (e) Judicial Review.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in 
any arbitration in which the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000,000, the 
arbitrators shall be required to make specific, written findings of fact and 
conclusions of law. In such arbitrations (i) the arbitrators shall not have 
the power to make any award which is not supported by substantial evidence or 
which is based on legal error, (ii) an award shall not be binding upon the 
parties unless the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and 
the conclusions of law are not erroneous under the substantive law of the 
state of Texas, and (iii) the parties shall have in addition to the grounds 
referred to in the Federal Arbitration Act for vacating, modifying or 
correcting an award the right to judicial review of (A) whether the findings 
of fact rendered by the arbitrators are supported by substantial evidence, 
and (B) whether the conclusions of law are erroneous under the substantive 
law of the state of Texas.  Judgment confirming an award in such a proceeding 
may be entered only if a court determines the award is supported by 
substantial evidence and not based on legal error under the substantive law 
of the state of Texas.

    (f) Miscellaneous.  To the maximum extent practicable, the AAA, the 
arbitrators and the parties shall take all action required to conclude any 
arbitration proceeding within 180 days of the filing of the Dispute with the 
AAA.  No arbitrator or other party to an arbitration proceeding may disclose 
the existence, content or results thereof, except for disclosures of 
information by a party required in the ordinary course of its business, by 
applicable law or regulation, or to the extent necessary to exercise any 
judicial review rights set forth herein.  If more than one agreement for 
arbitration by or between the parties potentially applies to a Dispute, the 
arbitration provision most directly related to the Loan Documents or the 
subject matter of the Dispute shall control.  This arbitration provision 
shall survive termination, amendment or expiration of any of the Loan 
Documents or any relationship between the parties.

control of Bank in any manner or for any purpose whatsoever during the

held in a general or special account or deposit for safekeeping or otherwise, 
together with whatever is receivable or received when any of the Collateral 
or proceeds thereof are sold, collected, exchanged or otherwise disposed of, 
whether such disposition is voluntary or involuntary, including without 
limitation, (a) all rights to payment, including returned premiums, with 
respect to any insurance relating to any of the foregoing, (b) all rights to 
payment with respect to any cause of action affecting or relating to any of

liquidating dividends, cash dividends, dividends paid in stock, new

entitled to receive on account of any securities pledged hereunder, including 
without limitation, stock received by Debtor due to stock splits or dividends 
paid in stock or sums paid upon or in respect of any securities pledged 
hereunder upon the liquidation or dissolution of the issuer thereof 
(hereinafter called "Proceeds"), and in the event that Debtor receives any 
such Proceeds, Debtor will hold the same in trust on behalf of and for the 
benefit of Bank and will immediately deliver all such Proceeds to Bank in the 
exact form received, with the endorsement of Debtor if necessary and/or 
appropriate undated stock powers duly executed in blank, to be held by Bank 
as part of the Collateral, subject to all terms hereof.

<PAGE>
                                      
absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, determined or 
undetermined, and whether Debtor may be liable individually or jointly with 
others, or whether recovery upon such Indebtedness may be or hereafter 
becomes unenforceable.

    3.   TERMINATION.  This Agreement will terminate upon the performance of 
all obligations of Debtor to Bank, including without limitation, the payment 
of all Indebtedness of Debtor to Bank, and the termination of all commitments 
of Bank to extend credit to Debtor, existing at the time Bank receives 
written notice from, Debtor of the termination of this Agreement.

    4.   OBLIGATIONS OF BANK.

control, and the same shall, for all purposes, be deemed Collateral hereunder.

    (b)  Bank's obligation with respect to Collateral and Proceeds in its 
possession shall be strictly limited to the duty to exercise reasonable care 
in the custody and preservation of such Collateral and Proceeds, and such

against prior parties, or to initiate any action to protect against the 
possibility of a decline in the market value of the Collateral or Proceeds.  
Bank shall not be obligated to take any action with respect to the Collateral 
or Proceeds requested by Debtor unless such request is made in writing and 
Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that the requested action would not 
unreasonably jeopardize the value of the Collateral and Proceeds as security 
for the Indebtedness. Bank may at any time deliver the Collateral and 
Proceeds, or any part thereof, to any Debtor, and the receipt thereof by any 
Debtor shall be a complete and full acquittance for the Collateral and 
Proceeds so delivered, and Bank shall thereafter be discharged from any 
liability or responsibility therefor.

    5.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Debtor represents and warrants to 
Bank that: (a) Debtor is the owner and has possession or control of the

writing; (d) all statements contained herein and, where applicable, in the

include, without limitation, the right of Bank or its nominee to exchange, at 
its discretion, any and all Collateral and/or Proceeds upon the merger, 
consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other readjustment of the 
issuer thereof, or upon the exercise by the issuer thereof or Bank of any 
right, privilege or option pertaining to any shares of the Collateral and/or 
Proceeds, and in connection therewith, the right to deposit and deliver any 
and all of the Collateral and/or Proceeds with any committee, depository, 
transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and 
conditions as Bank may determine.  All of the foregoing rights, privileges or 
options may be exercised without liability on the part of Bank or its nominee 
except to account for property actually received by Bank.  Bank shall have no 
duty to exercise any of the foregoing, or any other rights, privileges or 
options with respect to the Collateral or Proceeds and shall not be 
responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing.

    8.   PAYMENT OF PREMIUMS, TAXES, CHARGES, LIENS AND ASSESSMENTS.  Debtor 
agrees to pay, prior to delinquency, all insurance premiums, taxes, charges, 
liens and assessments against the Collateral and Proceeds, and upon the 
failure of Debtor to do so, Bank at its option may pay any of them and shall 
be the sole judge of the legality or validity thereof and the amount 
necessary to discharge the same.  Any such payments made by Bank shall be 
obligations of Debtor to Bank, due and payable immediately upon demand, 
together with interest at a rate determined in accordance with the provisions 
of Section 15 hereof, and shall be secured by the Collateral and Proceeds, 
subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement.

    9.   EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  The occurrence of any of the following shall 
constitute an "Event of Default" under this Agreement: (a) any default in the 
payment or performance of any obligation, or any defined event of default, 
under (i) any contract or instrument evidencing any Indebtedness, or (ii) any 
other agreement between any Debtor and Bank, including without limitation any 
loan agreement, relating to or executed in connection with any Indebtedness; 
(b) any representation or warranty made by any Debtor herein shall prove to 
be incorrect, false or misleading in any material respect when made; (c) any 
Debtor shall fail to observe or perform any obligation or agreement contained 
herein; (d) any attachment or like levy on any property of any Debtor; and 
(e) Bank, in good faith, believes any or all of the Collateral and/or 
Proceeds to be in danger of misuse, dissipation, commingling, loss, theft, 
damage or destruction, or otherwise in jeopardy or unsatisfactory in 
character or value.

    10.  REMEDIES.  Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Bank shall 
have the right to declare immediately due and payable all or any Indebtedness 
secured hereby and to terminate any commitments to make loans or otherwise 

                                     -5-

<PAGE>

extend credit to Debtor. Bank shall have all other rights, powers, privileges 
and remedies granted to a secured party upon default under the Texas Uniform 
Commercial Code or otherwise provided by law, including without limitation, 
the right to contact all persons obligated to Debtor on any Collateral or 
Proceeds and to instruct such persons to deliver all Collateral and/or 
Proceeds directly to Bank.  All rights, powers, privileges and remedies of 
Bank shall be cumulative.  No delay, failure or discontinuance of Bank in 
exercising any right, power, privilege or remedy hereunder shall affect or 
operate as a waiver of such right, power, privilege or remedy; nor shall any 
single or partial exercise of any such right, power, privilege or remedy 
preclude, waive or otherwise affect any other or further exercise thereof or 
the exercise of any other right, power, privilege or remedy.  Any waiver, 
permit, consent or approval of any kind by Bank of any default hereunder, or 
any such waiver of any provisions or conditions hereof, must be in writing 
and shall be effective only to the extent set forth in writing.  It is agreed 
that public or private sales, for cash or on credit, to a wholesaler or 
retailer or investor, or user of property of the types subject to this 
Agreement, or public auction, are all commercially reasonable since 
differences in the sales prices generally realized in the different kinds of 
sales are ordinarily offset by the differences in the costs and credit risks 
of such sales.  While an Event of Default exists: (a) Bank may, at any time 
and at Bank's sole option, liquidate any time deposits pledged hereunder, 
whether or not said time deposits have matured and notwithstanding the fact 
that such liquidation may give rise to penalties for early withdrawal of 
funds; (b) Debtor will not dispose of any of the Collateral or Proceeds 
except on terms approved by Bank; (c) Bank may appropriate the Collateral and 
apply all Proceeds toward repayment of the Indebtedness in such order of 
application as Bank may from time to time elect; and (d) at Bank's request, 
Debtor will assemble and deliver all Collateral and Proceeds, and books and 
records pertaining thereto, to Bank at a reasonably convenient place 
designated by Bank.  For any Collateral or Proceeds consisting of securities, 
Bank shall have no obligation to delay a sale of any portion thereof for the 
period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register such 
securities for public sale under any applicable state or Federal law, even if 
the issuer thereof would agree to do so.

    11.  DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL AND PROCEEDS.  Upon the transfer of all or 
any part of the Indebtedness, Bank may transfer all or any part of the 
Collateral or Proceeds and shall be fully discharged thereafter from all 
liability and responsibility with respect to any of the foregoing so 
transferred, and the transferee shall be vested with all rights and powers of 
Bank hereunder with respect to any of the foregoing so transferred; but with 
respect to any Collateral or Proceeds not so transferred, Bank shall retain 

                                     -6-

<PAGE>

all rights, powers, privileges and remedies herein given.  Any proceeds of 
any disposition of any of the Collateral or Proceeds, or any part thereof, 
may be applied by Bank to the payment of expenses incurred by Bank in 
connection with the foregoing, including reasonable attorneys' fees, and the 
balance of such proceeds may be applied by Bank toward the payment of the 
Indebtedness in such order of application as Bank may from time to time elect.

    12.  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.  Until all Indebtedness shall have been paid 
in full and all commitments by Bank to extend credit to Debtor have been 
terminated, the power of sale and all other rights, powers, privileges and 
remedies granted to Bank hereunder shall continue to exist and may be 
exercised by Bank at any time and from time to time irrespective of the fact 
that the Indebtedness or any part thereof may have become barred by any 
statute of limitations, or that the personal liability of Debtor may have 
ceased, unless such liability shall have ceased due to the payment in full of 
all Indebtedness secured hereunder.

    13.  MISCELLANEOUS.  (a) The obligations of Debtor hereunder are joint 
and several; (b) Debtor hereby waives any right (i) to require Bank to make 
any presentment or demand, or give any notices of any kind, including without 
limitation any notice of nonpayment or nonperformance, protest, notice of 
protest, notice of dishonor, notice of the intention to accelerate or notice 
of acceleration hereunder, (ii) to direct the application of payments or 
security for any Indebtedness of Debtor, or indebtedness of customers of 
Debtor, or (iii) to require proceedings against others or to require 
exhaustion of security; and (c) Debtor hereby consents to extensions, 
forbearances or alterations of the terms of Indebtedness, the release or 
substitution of security, and the release of any guarantors; provided 
however, that in each instance Bank believes in good faith that the action in 
question is commercially reasonable in that it does not unreasonably increase 
the risk of nonpayment of the Indebtedness to which the action applies. Until 
all Indebtedness shall have been paid in full, no Debtor shall have any right 
of subrogation or contribution, and each Debtor hereby waives any benefit of 
or right to participate in any of the Collateral or Proceeds or any other 
security now or hereafter held by Bank.  Any requirement of reasonable notice 
to Debtor with respect to the sale or other disposition of Collateral shall 
be met if such notice is given pursuant to the requirements of Section 14 
hereof at least 5 days before the date of any public sale or the date after 
which any private sale or other disposition will be made.

    14.  NOTICES.  All notices, requests and demands required under this 
Agreement must be in writing, addressed to Bank at the address specified in 
any other loan documents entered into between Debtor and Bank and to Debtor 


                                     -7-

applicable) specified below or to such other address as any party may

(b) if sent by mail, upon the earlier of the date of receipt or three (3) 
days after deposit in the U.S. mail, first class and postage prepaid; and (c) 
if sent by telecopy, upon receipt.

    15.  COSTS, EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES.  Debtor shall pay to Bank 
immediately upon demand the full amount of all payments, advances, charges, 
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees (to include outside 
counsel fees and all allocated costs of Bank's in-house counsel to the extent 
permissible), incurred by Bank in exercising any right, power, privilege or 
remedy conferred by this Agreement or in the enforcement thereof, whether 
incurred at the trial or appellate level, in an arbitration proceeding or 
otherwise, and including any of the foregoing incurred in connection with any 
bankruptcy proceeding (including without limitation, any adversary 
proceeding, contested matter or motion brought by Bank or any other person) 
relating to Debtor or in any way affecting any of the Collateral or Bank's 
ability to exercise any of its rights or remedies with respect thereto.  All 
of the foregoing shall be paid by Debtor from the date of demand to the date 
paid in full with interest at the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

    16.  SUCCESSORS; ASSIGNS; AMENDMENT.  This Agreement shall be binding 
upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators, legal 
representatives, successors and assigns of the parties, and may be amended or 
modified only in writing signed by Bank and Debtor.

    17.  SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS.  If any provision of this Agreement 
shall be held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such 
provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or 
invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or any 
remaining provisions of this Agreement.

    18.  GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the state of Texas.

    Debtor warrants that its chief executive office (or personal residence, 
if applicable) is located at the following address: 13403 Northwest Freeway, 
Suite 200, Houston, Texas 77040.

                   ADDENDUM TO GENERAL PLEDGE AGREEMENT


         THIS ADDENDUM is attached to and made a part of that certain General 
Pledge Agreement ("Agreement") executed by HOUSTON CASUALTY COMPANY 
("Debtor"), as of October 7, 1996, in favor of WELLS FARGO BANK (TEXAS), 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION ("Bank"). 

     Debtor acknowledges and agrees as follows:     

     1.  Collateral.  Notwithstanding any reference in the Agreement to a 
transfer, pledge or delivery to Bank, or a deposit with Bank, of the 
Collateral and Proceeds defined in paragraph I of the Agreement, and 
notwithstanding any reference in the Agreement to the possession, custody or 
control by Bank of the Collateral or Proceeds, said Collateral includes 
without limitation: (a) all securities, bonds, documents, instruments, money, 
notes, repurchase agreements, general intangibles, financial assets, 
investment property, and all other property of whatever nature or 
description, whether tangible or intangible, whether certificated or 
uncertificated, now or hereafter held on account of or for Debtor in Debtor's 
Custody Account maintained with Custodian in the name of Debtor, under 
Account Number 9002183500 ("Account") ; (b) the Account itself and all 
replacements and substitutions therefor; and (c) Proceeds of all 

<PAGE>

of the foregoing; provided however, that notwithstanding the generality of 
the foregoing, the term "Collateral" does not include any and Bank disclaims 
a security interest in all WF Securities or Collective Investment Funds (as 
hereinafter defined) now or hereafter in the Account.  The parties hereto 
expressly agree that all property, including cash, certificates of deposit, 
and mutual funds held in the account are to be treated as "financial assets" 
under the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of Texas. 

     2.  Security Interest.  In accordance with and subject to the provisions 
of the Agreement, and to secure the obligations described therein, Debtor 
grants and transfers to Bank a security interest in all of the Collateral 
described in the Agreement and paragraph l of this Addendum.  Grantor expressly
agrees that all Collateral shall be security for the indebtedness secured hereby
and by the Agreement, whether the Collateral is located at one or more offices, 
branches or affiliates of Bank or Custodian, and whether or not the office or 
branch where any secured indebtedness is created is aware of or relies upon 
the Collateral.

                                     2
<PAGE>

     3.  Account Activity.  So long as no default exists with respect to the 
indebtedness secured hereby, Debtor may sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise 
dispose of assets in and withdraw assets from the Account, provided however 
that the Collateral Value of the Account, as hereinafter defined, shall at 
all times be equal to or greater than one hundred twenty five percent (125%) 
of the outstanding principal balance of the indebtedness secured hereby, but 
in no event shall the Collateral Value of the Account exceed Fifteen Million 
Dollars ($15,000,000.00). 

     In the event that the Collateral Value of 
the Account should, for any reason and at any time, be less than the required 
amount, Debtor shall promptly either make a principal reduction on the 
indebtedness secured hereby, or pledge to Bank and deposit in the Account 
additional assets, of a nature satisfactory to Bank, in either case, 
sufficient such that the Collateral Value of the Account achieves the 
required amount.     

     4.  Priority. The terms of this Addendum override and 
take precedence over any provision to the contrary in any other agreement or 
other documentation relative to the opening and maintenance of the Account.   

                                3

<PAGE>


     5.  Defined Terms.  All terms defined in the Agreement and used herein 
shall have the same meaning when used in this Addendum. 

     "Custodian" means Wells Fargo Bank (Texas), National Association (Trust 
Department), with whom the Account is registered and that has the custody 
and/or management of the securities and other financial assets comprising the 
Account. The Custodian may be a separate department, division, group or 
affiliate of Bank. 

     "WF Securities"  means stock, securities or obligations of Wells Fargo & 
Company or of any affiliate thereof (as the term affiliate is defined in 
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 USC 371(c), as amended from time 
to time). 

     6.  Negative Pledge.  So long as Bank retains a security interest in the 
Collateral, Debtor shall not (a) further pledge, encumber, grant or permit to 
exist a security interest in or lien upon any assets now or hereafter in the 
Account, including without limitation, WF Securities or Collective Investment 
Funds, (b) cause any of the Collateral to be registered in the name of any 
party, other than Grantor, nor to grant to any other party any entitlement in 
any Collateral, (c) grant to any party,

                                     4
<PAGE>

other than Bank, the right to take any action with respect to the Collateral, 
including sale of such portions of the Collateral that are securities or 
other investment property, without any further action by Debtor or (d) the 
Account agreement between the Debtor and the Custodian, other than ordinary 
and reasonable charges in Custodian's charges for handling the Account, in 
any way which would affect Bank's interest in the Collateral without the 
prior written consent of Bank, or terminate the Account agreement without 
sixty (60) days' prior notice to Lender.          

     7.   Instruction to Custodian. This Addendum constitutes an instruction
and authorization by Debtor to the Custodian to abide by the terms hereof,
and following written instructions from Bank, to take any action requested by 
Bank with respect to the Account with the necessity of no further action by
Debtor.     

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Debtor has executed this Addendum as of the same 
date as the Agreement.

                                                             January 10, 1997

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned HCC INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.,  a Delaware
corporation ("Borrower") promises to pay to the order of WELLS FARGO BANK
(TEXAS), NATIONAL ASSOCIATION ("Bank") at its office at 1000 Louisiana, Third
Floor, Houston, Texas  77002, or at such other place as the holder hereof may
designate, in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately
available funds, the principal sum of TEN MILLION AND NO/100 Dollars
($10,000,000.00), or so much thereof as may be advanced and be outstanding, with
interest thereon, to be computed on each advance from the date of its
disbursement as set forth herein.

DEFINITIONS:

As used herein, the following terms shall have meanings set forth after each,
and any other term defined in this Note shall have the meanings set forth at the
place defined:

    (a)  "Business Day" means any day except Saturday, Sunday or any other day
on which commercial banks in Texas are authorized or required by law to close.

    (b)  "Fixed Rate Term" means a period commencing on a Business Day
continuing for one (1), two (2) or three (3) months, as designated by Borrower,
during which all or a portion of the outstanding principal balance of this Note
bears interest determined in relation to LIBOR;  provided however, that no Fixed
Rate Term may be selected for a principal amount less than One Million and
No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00);  and provided further, that no Fixed Rate term
shall extend beyond the scheduled maturity date hereof.  If any Fixed Rate Term
would end on a day which is not a Business Day, then such Fixed Rate Term shall
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.

    (c)  "LIBOR" means the rate per annum (rounded upward, if necessary, to the
nearest whole 1/8 of 1%) and determined pursuant to the following formula:

    LIBOR =              BASE LIBOR          
           --------------------------------------
              100% - LIBOR Reserve Percentage

    (i)  "Base LIBOR" means the rate per annum for United States dollar
deposits quoted by Bank as the Inter-Bank Market Offered Rate, with the
understanding that such rate is quoted by Bank for the purpose of calculating
effective rates of interest for loans making reference thereto, on the first day
of a Fixed Rate Term for delivery of funds on said date for a period of time
approximately equal to the number of days in such Fixed Rate Term and in an
amount approximately equal to the principal amount to which such Fixed Rate Term
applies.  Borrower understands and agrees that Bank may base its quotation of
the Inter-Bank Market Offered Rate upon such offers or other market indicators
of the Inter-Bank Market as Bank in its discretion deems appropriate including,
but no limited to, the rate offered for U.S. dollar deposits on the London
Inter-Bank Market.

    (ii) "LIBOR Reserve Percentage" means the reserve percentage prescribed by
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for
"Eurocurrency Liabilities" (as defined in Regulation D of the Federal Reserve
Board, as amended), adjusted by Bank for expected changes in such reserve
percentage during the applicable Fixed Rate Term.

    (d)  "Prime Rate" means at any time the rate of interest most recently
announced within Bank at its principal office as its Prime Rate, with the
understanding that the Prime Rate is one of Bank's base rates and serves as the
basis upon which effective rates of interest are calculated for those loans
making reference thereto, and is evidenced by the recording thereof after its
announcement in such internal publication or publications as Bank may designate.

INTEREST:

    (a)  INTEREST.  The outstanding principal balance of this Note shall bear
interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day year, actual days elapsed, unless
such calculation would result in a usurious rate, in which case interest shall
be computed on the basis of 365/366-day year, as the case may be, actual days
elapsed) at the lesser of (i) either (A) a fluctuating rate per annum equal to
the Prime Rate in effect from time to time, or (B) a fixed rate per annum
determined by Bank to be one and one-half percent (1.50%) above LIBOR in effect
on the first day of the applicable Fixed Rate Term, or (ii) the Maximum Rate. 
When interest is determined in relation to the Prime Rate, each change in the
rate of interest hereunder shall become effective on the date each Prime Rate

<PAGE>

change is announced within Bank.  With respect to each LIBOR selection
hereunder, Bank is hereby authorized to note the date, principal amount,
interest rate and Fixed Rate Term applicable thereto and any payments made
thereon on Bank's books and records (either manually or by electronic entry)
and/or on any schedule attached to this Note, which notations shall be prima
facie evidence of the accuracy of the information noted.

    (b)  SELECTION OF INTEREST RATE OPTIONS.  At any time any portion of this
Note bears interest determined in relation to LIBOR, it may be continued by
Borrower at the end the Fixed Rate Term applicable thereto so that all or a
portion thereof bears interest determined in relation to the Prime Rate or to
LIBOR for a new Fixed Rate Term designated by Borrower.  At any time any portion
of this Note bears interest determined in relation to the Prime Rate, Borrower
may convert all or a portion thereof so that it bears interest determined in
relation to LIBOR for a Fixed Rate Term designated by Borrower.  At such time as
Borrower requests an advance hereunder or wishes to select a LIBOR option for
all or a portion of the outstanding principal balance hereof, and at the end of
each Fixed Rate Term, Borrower shall give Bank notice specifying:  (i) the
interest rate option selected by Borrower;  (ii) the principal amount subject
thereto;  and (iii) for each LIBOR selection, the length of the applicable Fixed
Rate Term.  Any such notice may be given by telephone so long as, with respect
to each LIBOR selection, (A) Bank receives written confirmation from Borrower
not later than three (3) Business Days after such telephone notice is given, and
(B) such notice is given to Bank prior to 10:00 a.m., California time, three (3)
Business Days before the first day of the Fixed Rate Term.  For each LIBOR
option requested hereunder, Bank will quote the applicable fixed rate to
Borrower at approximately 10:00 a.m., California time, on the first day of the
Fixed Rate Term.  If Borrower does not immediately accept the rate quoted by
Bank, any subsequent acceptance by Borrower shall be subject to a
redetermination by Bank of the applicable fixed rate; provided however, that if
Borrower fails to accept any such rate by 11:00 a.m., California time, on the
Business Day such quotation is given, then the quoted rate shall expire and Bank
shall have no obligation to permit a LIBOR option to be selected on such day. 
If no specific designation of interest is made at the time any advance is
requested hereunder or at the end of any Fixed Rate Term, Borrower shall be
deemed to have made a Prime Rate interest selection for such advance or the
principal amount to which such Fixed Rate Term applied.

    (c)  ADDITIONAL LIBOR PROVISIONS.

    (i)  If Bank at any time shall determine that for any reason adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR, then Bank shall promptly
give notice thereof to Borrower.  If such notice is given and until such notice
has been withdrawn by Bank, then (A) no new LIBOR option may be selected by
Borrower, and (B) any portion of the outstanding principal balance hereof which
bears interest determined in relation to LIBOR, subsequent to the end of the
Fixed Rate Term applicable thereto, shall bear interest determined in relation
to the Prime Rate.

    (ii) If any law, treaty, rule, regulation or determination of a court or
governmental authority or any change therein or in the interpretation or
application thereof (each, a "Change in Law") shall make it unlawful for Bank
(A) to make LIBOR options available hereunder, or (B) to maintain interest rates
based on LIBOR, then in the former event, any obligation of Bank to make
available such unlawful LIBOR options shall immediately be canceled, and in the
latter event, any such unlawful LIBOR-based interest rates then outstanding
shall be converted, at Bank's option, so that interest on the portion of the
outstanding principal balance subject thereto is determined in relation to the
Prime Rate; provided however, that if any such Change in Law shall permit any
LIBOR-based interest rates to remain in effect until the expiration of the Fixed
Rate Term applicable thereto, then such permitted LIBOR-based interest rates
shall continue in effect until the expiration of such Fixed Rate Term.  Upon the
occurrence of any of the foregoing events, Borrower shall pay to Bank
immediately upon demand such amounts as may be necessary to compensate Bank for
any fines, fees, charges, penalties or other costs incurred or payable by Bank
as a result thereof and which are attributable to any LIBOR options made
available to Borrower hereunder, and any reasonable allocation made by Bank
among its operations shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower.

    (iii)     If any Change in Law or compliance by Bank with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or
other governmental authority shall:

    (A)  subject Bank to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to any
    LIBOR options, or change the basis of taxation of payments to Bank of
    principal, interest, fees or any other amount payable hereunder (except for
    changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of Bank); or

    (B)  impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit,
    compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or
    other liabilities in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or any
    other acquisition of funds by any office of Bank; or

    (C)  impose on Bank any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Bank of
making, renewing or maintaining any LIBOR options hereunder and/or to reduce any

<PAGE>

amount receivable by Bank in connection therewith, then in any such case,
Borrower shall pay to Bank immediately upon demand such amounts as may be
necessary to compensate Bank for any additional costs incurred by Bank and/or
reductions in amounts received by Bank which are attributable to such LIBOR
options.  In determining which costs incurred by Bank and/or reductions in
amounts received by Bank are attributable to any LIBOR options made available to
Borrower hereunder, any reasonable allocation made by Bank among its operations
shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower.

    (iv) Only one amount may be quoted a LIBOR rate, and that amount, except
for permitted repayments, may not be changed between Fixed Rate Terms.

    (d)  PAYMENT OF INTEREST.  Interest accrued on any portion of this Note
which bears interest determined in relation to the Prime Rate shall be payable
on the last day of each calendar quarter, commencing March 31, 1997.  Interest
accrued on any portion of this Note which bears interest determined in relation
to LIBOR shall be payable on the last day of each Fixed Rate Term. Borrower
authorizes Bank to debit Borrower's accounts at Bank for all principal,
interest, fees or other liabilities due to Bank under any of the Loan Documents
as defined in the hereinafter described Credit Agreement.

    (e)  DEFAULT INTEREST.  From and after the maturity date of this Note, or
such earlier date as all principal owing hereunder becomes due and payable by
acceleration or otherwise, the outstanding principal balance of this Note shall
bear interest until paid in full at an increased rate per annum (computed on the
basis of a 360-day year, actual days elapsed, unless such calculation would
result in a usurious rate, in which case interest shall be computed on the basis
of a 365/366-day year, as the case may be, actual days elapsed) equal to four
percent (4%) above the rate of interest from time to time applicable to this
Note, but in no event at a rate greater than the Maximum Rate.

BORROWING AND REPAYMENT:

    (a)  BORROWING AND REPAYMENT.  Borrower may from time to time during the
term of this Note borrow, partially or wholly repay its outstanding borrowings,
and reborrow, subject to all of the limitations, terms and conditions of this
Note and of any document executed in connection with or governing this Note;
provided however, that the total outstanding borrowings under this Note shall
not at any time exceed the principal amount stated above.  The unpaid principal
balance of this obligation at any time shall be the total amounts advanced
hereunder by the holder hereof less the amount of principal payments made hereon
by or for any Borrower, which balance may be endorsed hereon from time to time
by the holder.  The outstanding principal balance of this Note together with all
accrued but unpaid interest shall be due and payable in full on April 30, 1998.

    (b)  ADVANCES.  Advances hereunder, to the total amount of the principal
sum stated above, may be made by the holder at the oral or written request of
(i) Frank J. Bramanti or L. Edward Tuffly, any one acting alone, who are
authorized to request advances and direct the disposition of any advances until
written notice of the revocation of such authority is received by the holder at
the office designated above, or (ii) any person, with respect to advances
deposited to the credit of any account of any Borrower with the holder, which
advances, when so deposited, shall be conclusively presumed to have been made to
or for the benefit of each Borrower regardless of the fact that persons other
than those authorized to request advances may have authority to draw against
such account.  The holder shall have no obligation to determine whether any
person requesting an advance is or has been authorized by any Borrower.

    (c)  APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS.  Each payment made on this Note shall be
credited first, to any interest then due and second, to the outstanding
principal balance hereof.  All payments credited to principal shall be applied
first, to the outstanding principal balance of this Note which bears interest
determined in relation to the Prime Rate, if any, and second, to the outstanding
principal balance of this Note which bears interest determined in relation to
LIBOR, with such payments applied to the oldest Fixed Rate Term first.

PREPAYMENT:

    (a)  PRIME RATE.  Borrower may prepay principal on any portion of this Note
which bears interest determined in relation to the Prime Rate at any time, in
any amount and without penalty.

    (b)  LIBOR.  Borrower may prepay principal on any portion of this Note
which bears interest determined in relation to LIBOR at any time and in the
minimum amount of One Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($100,000.00);
provided however, that if the outstanding principal balance of such portion of
this Note is less than said amount, the minimum prepayment amount shall be the
entire outstanding principal balance thereof.  In consideration of Bank
providing this prepayment option to Borrower, or if any such portion of this
Note shall become due and payable at any time prior to the last day of the Fixed
Rate Term applicable thereto, Borrower shall pay to Bank immediately upon demand
a fee which is the sum of the discounted monthly differences for each month from
the month of prepayment through the month in which such Fixed Rate Term matures,

<PAGE>

calculated as follows for each such month:

    (i)  Determine the amount of interest which would have accrued each month
    on the amount prepaid at the interest rate applicable to such amount had it
    remained outstanding until the last day of the Fixed Rate Term applicable
    thereto.

    (ii) Subtract from the amount determined in (i) above the amount of
    interest which would have accrued for the same month on the amount prepaid
    for the remaining term of such Fixed Rate Term at LIBOR in effect on the
    date of prepayment for new loans made for such term and in a principal
    amount equal to the amount prepaid.

    (iii)     If the result obtained in (ii) for any month is greater than
    zero, discount that difference by LIBOR used in (ii) above.

Each Borrower acknowledges that prepayment of such amount may result in Bank
incurring additional costs, expenses and/or liabilities, and that it is
difficult to ascertain the full extent of such costs, expenses and/or
liabilities.  Each Borrower, therefore, agrees to pay the above-described
prepayment fee and agrees that said amount represents a reasonable estimate of
the prepayment costs, expenses and/or liabilities of Bank.

EVENTS OF DEFAULT:

This Note is made pursuant to and is subject to the terms and conditions of that
certain Credit Agreement between Borrower and Bank dated as of January 10, 1997,
as amended from time to time (the "Credit Agreement").  Any default in the
payment or performance of any obligation under this Note, or any defined event
of default under the Credit Agreement, shall constitute an "Event of Default"
under this Note.

MISCELLANEOUS:

    (a)  REMEDIES.  Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the holder of
this Note, at the holder's option, may declare all sums of principal and accrued
and unpaid interest outstanding hereunder to be immediately due and payable
without presentment, demand, or any notices of any kind, including without
limitation notice of nonperformance, notice of protest, protest, notice of
dishonor, notice of intention to accelerate or notice of acceleration, all of
which are expressly waived by each Borrower, and the obligation, if any, of the
holder to extend any further credit hereunder shall immediately cease and
terminate.  Each Borrower shall pay to the holder immediately upon demand the
full amount of all payments, advances, charges, costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorney's fees (to include outside counsel fees and all allocated
costs of the holder's in-house counsel to the extent permissible), expended or
incurred by the holder in connection with the enforcement of the holder's rights
and/or the collection of any amounts which become due to the holder under this
Note, and the prosecution or defense of any action in any way related to this
Note, including without limitation, any action for declaratory relief, whether
incurred at the trial or appellate level, in an arbitration proceeding or
otherwise, and including any of the foregoing incurred in connection with any
bankruptcy proceeding (including without limitation, any adversary proceeding,
contested matter or motion brought by Bank or any other person) relating to any
Borrower or any other person or entity.

    (b)  OBLIGATIONS JOINT AND SEVERAL.  Should more than one person or entity
sign this Note as a Borrower, the obligations of each such Borrower shall be
joint and several.

    (c)  GOVERNING LAW.  This Note shall be governed by and constructed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.

    (d)  SAVINGS CLAUSE.  It is the intention of the parties to comply strictly
with applicable usury laws.  Accordingly, notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary in this Note, or in any contract, instrument or document evidencing or
securing the payment hereof or otherwise hereto (each, a "Related Document"), in
no event shall this Note or any Related Document require the payment or permit
the payment, taking, reserving, receiving, collection or charging of any sums
constituting interest under applicable laws that exceed the maximum amount
permitted by such laws, as the same may be amended or modified from time to time
(the "Maximum Rate").  If any such excess interest is called for, contracted
for, charged, taken, reserved or received in connection with this Note or any
Related Document, or in any communication by Bank or any other person to
Borrower or any other person, or in the event that all or part of the principal
or interest hereof or thereof shall be prepaid or accelerated, so that under any
of such circumstances or under any other circumstance whatsoever the amount of
interest contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received on the amount of
principal actually outstanding from time to time under this Note shall exceed
the Maximum Rate, then in such event it is agreed that:  (i)  the provisions of
this paragraph shall govern and control; (ii) neither Borrower nor any other
person or entity now or hereafter liable for the payment of this Note or any
Related Document shall be obligated to pay the amount of such interest to the
extent it is in excess of the Maximum Rate; (iii) any such excess interest which

<PAGE>

is or has been received by Bank, notwithstanding this paragraph, shall be
credited against the then unpaid principal balance hereof or thereof, or if this
Note or any Related Document has been or would be paid in full by such credit,
refunded to Borrower; and (iv) the provisions of this Note and each Related
Document, and any other communication to Borrower, shall immediately be deemed
reformed and such excess interest reduced, without the necessity of executing
any other document, to the Maximum Rate.  The right to accelerate the maturity
of this Note or any Related Document does not include the right to accelerate,
collect or charge unearned interest, but only such interest that has otherwise
accrued as of the date of acceleration.  Without limiting the foregoing, all
calculations of the rate of interest contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or
received in connection with this Note and any Related Document which are made
for the purpose of determining whether such rate exceeds the Maximum Rate shall
be made to the extent permitted by applicable laws by amortizing, prorating,
allocating and spreading during the period of the full term of this Note or such
Related Document, including all prior and subsequent renewals and extensions
hereof or thereof, all interest at any time contracted for, charged, taken,
reserved or received by Bank.  The terms of this paragraph shall be deemed to be
incorporated into each Related Document.

To the extent that Article 5069-1.04 of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes is
relevant to Bank for the purpose of determining the Maximum Rate, Bank hereby
elects to determine the applicable rate ceiling under such Article by the
indicated (weekly) rate ceiling from time to time in effect, subject to Bank's
right subsequently to change such method in accordance with applicable law, as
the same may be amended or modified from time to time.

    (e)  RIGHT OF SETOFF;  DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS.  Upon and after the occurrence of
an Event of Default, (i) Borrower hereby authorizes Bank, at any time and from
time to time, without notice, which is hereby expressly waived by Borrower, and
whether or not Bank shall have declared this Note to be due and payable in
accordance with the terms hereof, to set off against, and to appropriate and
apply to the payment of, Borrower's obligations and liabilities under this Note
(whether matured or unmatured, fixed or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated),
any and all amounts owing by Bank to Borrower (whether payable in U.S. dollars
or any other currency, whether matured or unmatured, and in the case of
deposits, whether general or special (except trust and escrow accounts), time or
demand and however evidenced), and (ii) pending any such action, to the extent
necessary, to hold such amounts as collateral to secure such obligations and
liabilities and to return as unpaid for insufficient funds any and all checks
and other items drawn against any deposits so held as Bank, in its sole
discretion, may elect.  Borrower hereby grants to Bank a security interest in
all deposits and accounts maintained with Bank and with any other financial
institution to secure the payment of all obligations and liabilities of Borrower
to Bank under this Note.

    (f)  BUSINESS PURPOSE.  Borrower represents and warrants that all loans
evidenced by this Note are for a business, commercial, investment, agricultural
or other similar purpose and not primarily for a personal, family or household
use.


<PAGE>

    (g)  Certain Tri-Party Accounts. Borrower and Bank agree that Tex. Rev. 
Civ. Stat. Ann. Art. 5056, ch. 15 (which regulates certain revolving credit 
loan accounts and revolving triparty accounts) shall not apply to any 
revolving loan accounts created under this Note or maintained in connection 
herewith.

for such period, and 2) the expense ratio percentage of Borrower, which shall 
be other net operating expenses incurred for such period divided by net 
premiums earned by Borrower for such period, as such items would be reflected

                                    MISCELLANEOUS

    SECTION 7.1.   NO WAIVER. No delay, failure or discontinuance of Bank in 
exercising any right, power or remedy under any of the Loan Documents shall 
affect or operate as a waiver of such right, power or remedy; nor shall any

or otherwise affect any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of 
any other right, power or remedy. Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of

    SECTION 7.4. SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall be binding upon 
and inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators, legal 
representatives, successors and assigns of the parties; provided however, 
that Borrower may not assign or transfer its interest hereunder without

transfer, negotiate or grant participations in all or any part of, or any 
interest in, Bank's rights and benefits under each of the Loan Documents. In 
connection therewith, Bank may disclose all documents and information which 
Bank now has or may hereafter acquire relating to any credit extended by Bank 
to Borrower, Borrower or its business, or any collateral required hereunder.

    SECTION 7.5. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENT. This Agreement and the other 
Loan Documents constitute the entire agreement between Borrower and Bank with 
respect to any extension of credit by Bank subject hereto and supersede all 
prior negotiations, communications, discussions and correspondence concerning

a written instrument executed by each party hereto.

    SECTION 7.6. NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement is made and 
entered into for the sole protection and benefit of the parties hereto and 
their respective permitted successors and assigns, and no other person or 
entity shall be a third party beneficiary of, or have any direct or indirect 
cause of action or claim in connection with, this Agreement or any other of 
the Loan Documents to which it is not a party.

    SECTION 7.7. TIME. Time is of the essence of each and every provision of 
this Agreement and each other of the Loan Documents.

    SECTION 7.8. SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. If any provision of this 
Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such 
provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or 
invalidity without invalidating the remainder of such provision or any 
remaining provisions of this Agreement.

    SECTION 7.9. COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an
original, and all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the same
Agreement.

    SECTION 7.10. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and 
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.

    SECTION 7.11. SAVINGS CLAUSE. It is the intention of the parties to 
comply strictly with applicable usury laws. Accordingly, notwithstanding any 
provision to the contrary in the Loan Documents, in no event shall any Loan 
Documents require the payment or permit the payment, taking, reserving, 
receiving, collection or charging of any sums constituting interest under 
applicable laws that exceed the maximum amount permitted by such laws, as the 
same may be amended or modified from time to time (the "Maximum Rate"). If 
any such excess interest is called for, contracted for, charged, taken, 
reserved or received in connection with any Loan Documents, or in any 
communication by Lender or any other person to Borrower or any other person, 
or in the event that all or part of the principal or interest hereof or 
thereof shall be prepaid or accelerated, so that under any of such 
circumstances or under any other circumstance whatsoever the amount of 
interest contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received on the amount 
of principal actually outstanding from time to time under the Loan Documents 
shall exceed the Maximum Rate, then in such event it is agreed that: (i) the 
provisions of this paragraph shall govern and control; (ii) neither Borrower 
nor any other person or entity now or hereafter liable for the payment of any 
Loan Documents shall be obligated to pay the amount of such interest to the 
extent it is in excess of the Maximum Rate; (iii) any such excess interest 
which is or has been received by Lender, notwithstanding this paragraph, 
shall be credited against the then unpaid principal balance hereof or 
thereof, or if any of the Loan Documents has been or would be paid in full by 
such credit, refunded to Borrower; and (iv) the

                                          10

<PAGE>

provisions of each of the Loan Documents, and any other communication to 
Borrower, shall immediately be deemed reformed and such excess interest 
reduced, without the necessity of executing any other document, to the 
Maximum Rate. The right to accelerate the maturity of the Loan Documents does 
not include the right to accelerate, collect or charge unearned interest, but 
only such interest that has otherwise accrued as of the date of acceleration. 
Without limiting the foregoing, all calculations of the rate of interest 
contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received in connection with any 
of the Loan Documents which are made for the purpose of determining whether 
such rate exceeds the Maximum Rate shall be made to the extent permitted by 
applicable laws by amortizing, prorating, allocating and spreading during the 
period of the full term of such Loan Documents, including all prior and 
subsequent renewals and extensions hereof or thereof, all interest at any 
time contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received by Lender. The 
terms of this paragraph shall be deemed to be incorporated into each of the 
other Loan Documents.

    To the extent that Article 5069-1.04 of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes 
is relevant to Lender for the purpose of determining the Maximum Rate, Bank 
hereby elects to determine the applicable rate ceiilng under such Article by 
the indicated (weekly) rate ceiling from time to time in effect, subject to 
Lender's right subsequently to change such method in accordance with 
applicable law, as the same may be amended or modified from time to time.

    SECTION 7.12. RIGHT OF SETOFF; DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. Upon and after the 
occurrence of an Event of Default, (a) Borrower hereby authorizes Bank, at 
any time and from time to time, without notice, which is hereby expressly 
waived by each Borrower, and whether or not Bank shall have declared any 
credit extended hereunder to be due and payable in accordance with the terms 
hereof, to set off against, and to appropriate and apply to the payment of, 
Borrower's obligations and liabilities under the Loan Documents (whether 
matured or unmatured, fixed or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated), any 
and all amounts owing by Bank to Borrower (whether payable in U.S. dollars or 
any other currency, whether matured or unmatured, and in the case of 
deposits, whether general or special (except trust and escrow accounts), time 
or demand and however evidenced), and (b) pending any such action, to the 
extent necessary, to hold such amounts as collateral to secure such 
obligations and liabilities and to return as unpaid for insufficient funds 
any and all checks and other items drawn against any deposits so held as 
Bank, in its sole discretion, may elect. Borrower hereby grants to Bank a 
security interest in all deposits and accounts maintained with Bank and with 
any other financial institution to secure the payment of all obligations and 
liabilities of Borrower to Bank under the Loan Documents.

    SECTION 7.13.  BUSINESS PURPOSE. Borrower represents and warrants that 
any credit extended hereunder is for a business, commercial, investment, 
agricultural or other similar purpose and not primarily for a personal, 
family or household use.

    SECTION 7.14. ARBITRATION.

    (a) Arbitration. Upon the demand of any party, any Dispute shall be 
resolved by binding arbitration (except as set forth in (e) below) in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. A "Dispute" shall mean any 
action, dispute, claim or controversy of any kind, whether in contract or 
tort, statutory or common law, legal or equitable, now existing or hereafter 
arising under or in connection with, or in any way pertaining to, any of the 
Loan Documents, or any past, present or future extensions of credit and other 
activities, transactions or obligations of any kind related directly or 
indirectly to any of the Loan Documents, including without limitation, any of 
the foregoing arising in connection with the exercise of any self-help, 
ancillary or other remedies pursuant to any of the Loan Documents. Any party 
may by summary proceedings bring an action in court to compel arbitration of 
a Dispute. Any party who fails or refuses to submit to arbitration following 
a lawful demand by any other party shall bear all costs and expenses incurred 
by such other party in compelling arbitration of any Dispute.

    (b) Governing Rules. Arbitration proceedings shall be administered by the 
American Arbitration Association ("AAA") or such other administrator as the 
parties shall mutually agree upon in accordance

                                          11

<PAGE>

with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. All Disputes submitted to 
arbitration shall be resolved in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act 
(Title 9 of the United States Code), notwithstanding any conflicting choice 
of law provision in any of the Loan Documents. The arbitration shall be 
conducted at a location in Texas selected by the AAA or other administrator. 
If there is any inconsistency between the terms hereof and any such rules, 
the terms and procedures set forth herein shall control. All statutes of 
limitation applicable to any Dispute shall apply to any arbitration 
proceeding. All discovery activities shall be expressly limited to matters 
directly relevant to the Dispute being arbitrated. Judgment upon any award 
rendered in an arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction; 
provided however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a 
waiver by any party that is a bank of the protections afforded to it under 12 
U.S.C. Section 91 or any similar applicable state law.

    (c) No Waiver; Provisional Remedies, Self-Help and Foreclosure. No 
provision hereof shall limit the right of any party to exercise self-help 
remedies such as setoff, foreclosure against or sale of any real or personal 
property collateral or security, or to obtain provisional or ancillary 
remedies, including without limitation injunctive relief, sequestration, 
attachment, garnishment or the appointment of a receiver, from a court of 
competent jurisdiction before, after or during the pendency of any 
arbitration or other proceeding. The exercise of any such remedy shall not 
waive the right of any party to compel arbitration hereunder.

    (d) Arbitrator Qualifications and Powers: Awards. Arbitrators must be 
active members of the Texas State Bar with expertise in the substantive laws 
applicable to the subject matter of the Dispute. Arbitrators are empowered to 
resolve Disputes by summary rulings in response to motions filed prior to the 
final arbitration hearing. Arbitrators (i) shall resolve all Disputes in 
accordance with the substantive law of the state of Texas, (ii) may grant any 
remedy or relief that a court of the state of Texas could order or grant 
within the scope hereof and such ancillary relief as is necessary to make 
effective any award, and (iii) shall have the power to award recovery of all 
costs and fees, to impose sanctions and to take such other actions as they 
deem necessary to the same extent a judge could pursuant to the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure or other applicable 
law. Any Dispute in which the amount in controversy is $5,000,000 or less 
shall be decided by a single arbitrator who shall not render an award of 
greater than $5,000,000 (including damages, costs, fees and expenses). By 
submission to a single arbitrator, each party expressly waives any right or 
claim to recover more than $5,000,000. Any Dispute in which the amount in 
controversy exceeds $5,000,000 shall be decided by majority vote of a panel 
of three arbitrators; provided however, that all three arbitrators must 
actively participate in all hearings and deliberations.

    (e) Judicial Review. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in 
any arbitration in which the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000,000, the 
arbitrators shall be required to make specific, written findings of fact and 
conclusions of law. In such arbitrations (i) the arbitrators shall not have 
the power to make any award which is not supported by substantial evidence or 
which is based on legal error, (ii) an award shall not be binding upon the 
parties unless the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and 
the conclusions of law are not erroneous under the substantive law of the 
state of Texas, and (iii) the parties shall have in addition to the grounds 
referred to in the Federal Arbitration Act for vacating, modifying or 
correcting an award the right to judicial review of (A) whether the findings 
of fact rendered by the arbitrators are supported by substantial evidence, 
and (B) whether the conclusions of law are erroneous under the substantive 
law of the state of Texas. Judgment confirming an award in such a proceeding 
may be entered only if a court determines the award is supported by 
substantial evidence and not based on legal error under the substantive law 
of the state of Texas.

    (f) Miscellaneous. To the maximum extent practicable, the AAA, the 
arbitrators and the parties shall take all action required to conclude any

                            GENERAL PLEDGE AGREEMENT


TO: WELLS FARGO BANK (TEXAS), NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

    1.  GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST. For valuable consideration, the 
undersigned HCC INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware corporation, or any of 
them ("Debtor"), hereby assigns, transfers to and pledges with WELLS FARGO 
BANK (TEXAS), NATIONAL ASSOCIATION ("Bank"), and grants to Bank a security 
interest in, all money and property this day or previously delivered to and 
deposited with Bank. including but not limited to, the property described on 
Exhibit "A" hereto, together with all other money or property heretofore 
delivered or which shall hereafter be delivered to or come into the 
possession, custody or control of Bank in any manner or for any purpose 
whatsoever during the existence of this Agreement (collectively called 
"Collateral"), and whether held in a general or special account or deposit 
for safekeeping or otherwise, together with whatever is receivable or 
received when any of the Collateral or proceeds thereof are sold, collected, 
exchanged or otherwise disposed of, whether such disposition is voluntary or 
involuntary,; including without limitation, (a) all rights to payment, 
including returned premiums, with respect to any insurance relating to any of 
the foregoing, (b) all rights to payment with respect to any cause of action 
affecting or relating to any of the foregoing, and (c) all stock rights, 
rights to subscribe, stock splits, liquidating dividends, cash dividends, 
dividends paid in stock, new securities or other property of any kind which 
Debtor is or may hereafter be entitled to receive on account of any 
securities pledged hereunder, including without limitation, stock received by 
Debtor due to stock splits or dividends paid in stock or sums paid upon or in 
respect of any securities pledged hereunder upon the liquidation or 
dissolution of the issuer thereof (hereinafter called "Proceeds"), and in the 
event that Debtor receives any such Proceeds, Debtor will hold the same in 
trust on behalf of and for the benefit of Bank and will immediately deliver 
all such Proceeds to Bank in the exact form received, with the endorsement of 
Debtor if necessary and/or appropriate undated stock powers duly executed in 
blank, to be held by Bank as part of the Collateral, subject to all terms 
hereof.

    2.  OBLIGATIONS SECURED.  The obligations secured hereby are the payment 
and performance of: (a) all present and future Indebtedness of Debtor to 
Bank; (b)all obligations of Debtor and rights of Bank under this Agreement; 
and (c) all present and future obligations of Debtor to Bank of other kinds. 
The word "Indebtedness" is used herein in its most comprehensive sense and 
includes any and all advances, debts, obligations and liabilities of Debtor, 
or any of them, heretofore, now or hereafter made, incurred or created, 
whether voluntary or involuntary and however arising, whether due or not due, 
absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, determined or 
undetermined, and whether Debtor may be liable individually or jointly with 
others, or whether recovery upon such Indebtedness may be or hereafter 
becomes unenforceable.

    3.   TERMINATION. This Agreement will terminate upon the performance of 
all obligations of Debtor to Bank, including without limitation, the payment 
of all Indebtedness of Debtor to Bank, and the termination of all commitments 
of Bank to extend credit to Debtor, existing at the time Bank receives 
written notice from Debtor of the termination of this Agreement.

    4.   OBLIGATIONS OF BANK.

    (a)  Bank has no obligation to make any loans hereunder. Any money 
received by Bank in respect of the Collateral may be deposited, at Bank's 
option, into a non-interest bearing account over which Debtor shall have no 
control, and the same shall, for all purposes, be deemed Collateral hereunder.

    (b) Bank's obligation with respect to Collateral and Proceeds in its 
possession shall be strictly limited to the duty to exercise reasonable care 
in the custody and preservation of such Collateral and Proceeds, and such 
duty shall not include any obligation to ascertain or to initiate any action 
with respect to or to inform Debtor of maturity dates, conversion, call or 
exchange rights, or offers to purchase the

                                          1

<PAGE>

Collateral or Proceeds, or any similar matters, notwithstanding Bank's 
knowledge of the same. Bank shall have no duty to take any steps necessary to 
preserve the rights of Debtor against prior parties, or to initiate any 
action to protect against the possibility of a decline in the market value of 
the Collateral or Proceeds. Bank shall not be obligated to take any action 
with respect to the Collateral or Proceeds requested by Debtor unless such 
request is made in writing and Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that 
the requested action would not unreasonably jeopardize the value of the 
Collateral and Proceeds as security for the Indebtedness. Bank may at any 
time deliver the Collateral and Proceeds, or any part thereof, to any Debtor, 
and the receipt thereof by any Debtor shall be a complete and full 
acquittance for the Collateral and Proceeds so delivered, and Bank shall

Bank that: (a) Debtor is the owner and has possession or control of the 
Collateral and Proceeds; (b) Debtor has the right to pledge the Collateral and 
Proceeds; (c) all Collateral and Proceeds are genuine, free from liens, 
adverse claims, setoffs, default, prepayment, defenses and conditions 
precedent of any kind or character, except the lien created hereby or as 
otherwise agreed to by Bank, or as heretofore disclosed by Debtor to Bank, in 
writing; (d) all statements contained herein and, where applicable, in the 
Collateral, are true and complete in all material respects; (e) no financing 
statement covering any of the Collateral or Proceeds, and naming any secured 
party other than Bank, is on file in any public office; and (f) specifically 
with respect to Collateral and Proceeds consisting of investment securities, 
instruments, chattel paper, documents, contracts, insurance policies or any 
like property, (i) all persons appearing to be obligated thereon have 
authority and capacity to contract and are bound as they appear to be, and 
(ii) the same comply with applicable laws concerning form, content and manner 
of preparation and execution.

powers and remedies hereunder; (iv) to permit Bank to exercise its powers; 
(v) to execute and deliver such documents as Bank deems necessary to create, 
perfect and continue the security interests contemplated hereby; and (vi) not 
to change its chief place of business or the places where Debtor keeps any of 
the Collateral or Debtor's records concerning the Collateral and Proceeds 
without first giving Bank written notice of the address to which Debtor is 
moving same.

    (b) Debtor agrees with regard to the Collateral and Proceeds, unless Bank 
agrees otherwise in writing: (i) not to permit any lien on the Collateral or 
Proceeds, except in favor of Bank; (ii) not to withdraw any finds from any 
deposit account pledged to Bank hereunder; (iii) not to sell, hypothecate or 
otherwise dispose of, nor permit the transfer by operation of law of, any of 
the Collateral or Proceeds or any interest therein; (iv) to keep, in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, complete and 
accurate records regarding all Collateral and Proceeds, and to permit Bank to 
inspect the same and make copies thereof at any reasonable time; (v) if 
requested by Bank, to receive and use reasonable diligence to collect 
Proceeds, in trust and as the property of Bank, and to immediately endorse as 
appropriate and deliver such Proceeds to Bank daily in the exact form in 
which they are received together with a collection report in form 
satisfactory to Bank; (vi) not to commingle Collateral or Proceeds, or 
collections thereunder, with other property; (vii) in the event Bank elects 
to receive payments of Proceeds hereunder, to pay all expenses incurred by 
Bank in connection therewith, including expenses of accounting, 
correspondence, collection efforts, filing, recording, record keeping and 
expenses incidental thereto; (viii) to provide any service and do any other 
acts which may be necessary to keep all Collateral and Proceeds free and 
clear of all defenses, rights of offset and counterclaims; and (ix) if the

<PAGE>

waivers and ratifications with respect thereto, provided that no vote shall 
be cast or consent, waiver or ratification given or action taken which would 
impair Bank's interests in the Collateral and Proceeds or be inconsistent 
with or violate any provisions of this Agreement.

    7.  POWERS OF BANK. Debtor appoints Bank its true attorney in fact to 
perform any of the following powers, which are coupled with an interest, are 
irrevocable until termination of this Agreement and may be exercised from 
time to time by Bank's officers and employees, or any of them, whether or not 
Debtor is in default: (a) to perform any obligation of Debtor hereunder in 
Debtor's name or otherwise; (b) to notify any person obligated on any 
security, instrument or other document subject to this Agreement of Bank's 
rights hereunder; (c) to collect by legal proceedings or otherwise all 
dividends, interest, principal or other sums now or hereafter payable upon or 
on account of the Collateral or Proceeds; (d) to enter into any extension, 
reorganization, deposit, merger or consolidation agreement, or any other 
agreement relating to or affecting the Collateral or Proceeds, and in 
connection therewith to deposit or surrender control of the Collateral and 
Proceeds, to accept other property in exchange for the Collateral and 
Proceeds, and to do and perform such acts and things as Bank may deem proper, 
with any money or property received in exchange for the Collateral or 
Proceeds, at Bank's option, to be applied to the Indebtedness or held by Bank 
under this Agreement; (e) to make any compromise or settlement Bank deems 
desirable or proper in respect of the Collateral and Proceeds; (f) to insure, 
process and preserve the Collateral and Proceeds; (g) to exercise all rights, 
powers and remedies which Debtor would have, but for this Agreement, with 
respect to all Collateral and Proceeds subject hereto; and (h) to do all acts 
and things and execute all documents in the name of Debtor or otherwise, 
deemed by Bank as necessary, proper and convenient in connection with the 
preservation, perfection or enforcement of its rights hereunder. To effect 
the purposes of this Agreement or otherwise upon instructions of Debtor, or 
any of them, Bank may cause any Collateral and/or Proceeds to be transferred 
to Bank's name or the name of Bank's nominee. If an Event of Default has 
occurred and is continuing, any or all Collateral and/or Proceeds consisting 
of securities may be registered, without notice, in the name of Bank or its 
nominee, and thereafter Bank or its nominee may exercise, without notice, all 
voting and corporate rights at any meeting of the shareholders of the issuer 
thereof, any and all rights of conversion, exchange or subscription, or any 
other rights, privileges or options pertaining to such Collateral and/or 
Proceeds, all as if it were the absolute owner thereof. The foregoing shall 
include, without limitation, the right of Bank or its nominee to exchange, at 
its discretion, any and all Collateral and/or Proceeds upon the merger, 
consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other readjustment of the 
issuer thereof, or upon the exercise by the issuer thereof or Bank of any 
right, privilege or option pertaining to any shares of the Collateral and/or 
Proceeds, and in connection therewith, the right to deposit and deliver any 
and all of the Collateral and/or Proceeds with any committee, depository, 
transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and 
conditions as Bank may determine. All of the foregoing rights, privileges or 
options may be exercised without liability on the part of Bank or its nominee 
except to account for property actually received by Bank. Bank shall have no 
duty to exercise any of the foregoing, or any other rights, privileges or 
options with respect to the Collateral or Proceeds and shall not be 
responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing.

    8.  PAYMENT OF PREMIUMS, TAXES, CHARGES, LIENS AND ASSESSMENTS. Debtor 
agrees to pay, prior to delinquency, all insurance premiums, taxes, charges, 
liens and assessments against the Collateral and Proceeds, and upon the 
failure of Debtor to do so, Bank at its option may pay any of them and shall 
be the sole judge of the legality or validity thereof and the amount 
necessary to discharge the same. Any such payments made by Bank shall be 
obligations of Debtor to Bank, due and payable immediately upon demand, 
together with interest at a rate determined in accordance with the provisions 
of Section 15 hereof, and shall be secured by the Collateral and Proceeds, 
subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement.

    9.  EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The occurrence of any of the following shall 
constitute an "Event of Default" under this Agreement: (a) any default in the 
payment or performance of any obligation, or any defined event of default, 
under (i) any contract or instrument evidencing any Indebtedness, or (ii) any 
other agreement between any Debtor and Bank, including without limitation any 
loan agreement,

                                          3

<PAGE>

relating to or executed in connection with any Indebtedness; (b)any 
representation or warranty made by any Debtor herein shall prove to be 
incorrect, false or misleading in any material respect when made; (c) any 
Debtor shall fail to observe or perform any obligation or agreement contained 
herein; (d) any attachment or like levy on any property of any Debtor; and 
(e) Bank, in good faith, believes any or all of the Collateral and/or 
Proceeds to be in danger of misuse, dissipation, commingling, loss, theft, 
damage or destruction, or otherwise in jeopardy or unsatisfactory in 
character or value.

    10.  REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Bank shall 
have the right to declare immediately due and payable all or any Indebtedness 
secured hereby and to terminate any commitments to make loans or otherwise 
extend credit to Debtor. Bank shall have all other rights, powers, privileges 
and remedies granted to a secured party upon default under the Texas Uniform 
Commercial Code or otherwise provided by law, including without limitation, 
the right to contact all persons obligated to Debtor on any Collateral or 
Proceeds and to instruct such persons to deliver all Collateral and/or 
Proceeds directly to Bank. All rights, powers, privileges and remedies of 
Bank shall be cumulative. No delay, failure or discontinuance of Bank in 
exercising any right, power, privilege or remedy hereunder shall affect or 
operate as a waiver of such right, power, privilege or remedy; nor shall any 
single or partial exercise of any such right, power, privilege or remedy 
preclude, waive or otherwise affect any other or further exercise thereof or 
the exercise of any other right, power, privilege or remedy. Any waiver, 
permit, consent or approval of any kind by Bank of any default hereunder, or 
any such waiver of any provisions or conditions hereof, must be in writing 
and shall be effective only to the extent set forth in writing. It is agreed 
that public or private sales, for cash or on credit, to a wholesaler or 
retailer or investor, or user of property of the types subject to this 
Agreement, or public auction, are all commercially reasonable since 
differences in the sales prices generally realized in the different kinds of 
sales are ordinarily offset by the differences in the costs and credit risks 
of such sales. While an Event of Default exists: (a) Bank may, at any time 
and at Bank's sole option, liquidate any time deposits pledged hereunder, 
whether or not said time deposits have matured and notwithstanding the fact 
that such liquidation may give rise to penalties for early withdrawal of 
funds; (b) Debtor will not dispose of any of the Collateral or Proceeds 
except on terms approved by Bank; (c) Bank may appropriate the Collateral and 
apply all Proceeds toward repayment of the Indebtedness in such order of 
application as Bank may from time to time elect; and (d) at Bank's request, 
Debtor will assemble and deliver all Collateral and Proceeds, and books and 
records pertaining thereto, to Bank at a reasonably convenient place 
designated by Bank. For any Collateral or Proceeds consisting of securities, 
Bank shall have no obligation to delay a sale of any portion thereof for the 
period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register such 
securities for public sale under any applicable state or Federal law, even if 
the issuer thereof would agree to do so.

    11.  DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL AND PROCEEDS. Upon the transfer of all or 
any part of the Indebtedness, Bank may transfer all or any part of the 
Collateral or Proceeds and shall be fully discharged thereafter from all 
liability and responsibility with respect to any of the foregoing so 
transferred, and the transferee shall be vested with all rights and powers of 
Bank hereunder with respect to any of the foregoing so transferred; but with 
respect to any Collateral or Proceeds not so transferred, Bank shall retain 
all rights, powers, privileges and remedies herein given. Any proceeds of any 
disposition of any of the Collateral or Proceeds, or any part thereof, may be 
applied by Bank to the payment of expenses incurred by Bank in connection 
with the foregoing, including reasonable attorneys' fees, and the balance of 
such proceeds may be applied by Bank toward the payment of the Indebtedness 
in such order of application as Bank may from time to time elect.

    12.  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. Until all Indebtedness shall have been paid 
in full and all commitments by Bank to extend credit to Debtor have been 
terminated, the power of sale and all other rights, powers, privileges and 
remedies granted to Bank hereunder shall continue to exist and may be 
exercised by Bank at any time and from time to time irrespective of the fact 
that the Indebtedness or any part thereof may have become barred by any 
statute of limitations, or that the personal liability of Debtor may have 
ceased, unless such liability shall have ceased due to the payment in full of 
all Indebtedness secured hereunder.

                                          4

<PAGE>


    13.  MISCELLANEOUS. (a) The obligations of Debtor hereunder are joint and 
several; (b) Debtor hereby waives any right (i) to require Bank to make any 
presentment or demand, or give any notices of any kind, including without 
limitation any notice of nonpayment or nonperformance, protest, notice of 
protest, notice of dishonor, notice of the intention to accelerate or notice 
of acceleration hereunder, (ii) to direct the application of payments or 
security for any Indebtedness of Debtor, or indebtedness of customers of 
Debtor, or (iii) to require proceedings against others or to require 
exhaustion of security; and (c) Debtor hereby consents to extensions, 
forbearances or alterations of the terms of Indebtedness, the release or 
substitution of security, and the release of any guarantors; provided 
however, that in each instance Bank believes in good faith that the action in 
question is commercially reasonable in that it does not unreasonably increase 
the risk of nonpayment of the Indebtedness to which the action applies. Until 
all Indebtedness shall have been paid in full, no Debtor shall have any right 
of subrogation or contribution, and each Debtor hereby waives any benefit of 
or right to participate in any of the Collateral or Proceeds or any other 
security now or hereafter held by Bank.  Any requirement of reasonable notice 
to Debtor with respect to the sale or other disposition of Collateral shall 
be met if such notice is given pursuant to the requirements of Section 14 
hereof at least 5 days before the date of any public sale or the date after 
which any private sale or other disposition will be made.

    14.  NOTICES. All notices, requests and demands required under this 
Agreement must be in writing, addressed to Bank at the address specified in 
any other loan documents entered into between Debtor and Bank and to Debtor 
at the address of its chief executive office (or personal residence, if 
applicable) specified below or to such other address as any party may 
designate by written notice to each other party, and shall be deemed to have 
been given or made as follows: (a) if personally delivered, upon delivery; 
(b) if sent by mail, upon the earlier of the date of receipt or three (3) 
days after deposit in the U.S. mail, first class and postage prepaid; and (c) 
if sent by telecopy, upon receipt.

    15.  COSTS, EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. Debtor shall pay to Bank 
immediately upon demand the full amount of all payments, advances, charges, 
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees (to include outside 
counsel fees and all allocated costs of Bank's in-house counsel to the. 
extent permissible), incurred by Bank in exercising any right, power, 
privilege or remedy conferred by this Agreement or in the enforcement 
thereof, whether incurred at the trial or appellate level, in an arbitration 
proceeding or otherwise, and including any of the foregoing incurred in 
connection with any bankruptcy proceeding (including without limitation, any 
adversary proceeding, contested matter or motion brought by Bank or any other 
person) relating to Debtor or in any way affecting any of the Collateral or 
Bank's ability to exercise any of its rights or remedies with respect 
thereto. All of the foregoing shall be paid by Debtor from the date of demand 
to the date paid in full with interest at the maximum rate permitted by 
applicable law.

    16.  SUCCESSORS; ASSIGNS; AMENDMENT. This Agreement shall be binding upon 
and inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators, legal 
representatives, successors and assigns of the parties, and may be amended or 
modified only in writing signed by Bank and Debtor.

    17. SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. If any provision of this Agreement shall 
be held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision 
shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, 
without invalidating the remainder of such provision or any remaining 
provisions of this Agreement.

    18.  GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the state of Texas.

    Debtor warrants that its chief executive office (or personal residence, 
if applicable) is located at the following address: 13403 Northwest Freeway, 
Suite 200, Houston, Texas 77040.
