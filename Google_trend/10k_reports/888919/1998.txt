    In accordance with the pooling-of-interests method of accounting, the
financial information of HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries set
forth in this Form 10-K has been restated to include the accounts and operations
of AVEMCO Corporation and LDG Management Company Incorporated.
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
GENERAL
 
    HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. ("HCC") is a Delaware corporation with
principal and executive offices located at 13403 Northwest Freeway, Houston,
Texas 77040. HCC and its consolidated subsidiaries are collectively referred to
herein as the "Company" unless the context otherwise requires. HCC, through its
subsidiaries, provides specialized property and casualty insurance coverages,
managing general agency services and insurance related services both to
commercial customers and individuals. The Company's insurance products are
underwritten on both a direct and reinsurance basis and are marketed by the
Company itself and through a network of independent and affiliated agents and
brokers. The Company's principal insurance company subsidiaries are Houston
Casualty Company ("HC"), U.S. Specialty Insurance Company ("USSIC") and
Trafalgar Insurance Company ("TIC") in Houston, Texas; and AVEMCO Insurance
Company ("AIC") in Frederick, Maryland. Until recently, the Company operated IMG
Insurance Company Ltd. ("IMG") as a separate company in Amman, Jordan and
London, England. The Company is in the process of consolidating IMG's operations
with those of HC and on a going forward basis, IMG will be operated as a branch
of HC in the same locations. The Company's principal agency subsidiaries are LDG
Management Company Incorporated ("LDG") in Wakefield, Massachusetts; HCC
Underwriters, A Texas Corporation ("HCCU") in Houston, Texas; The Kachler
Corporation ("Kachler") in Houston, Texas; North American Special Risk
Associates, Inc. ("NASRA") in Northbrook, Illinois; Aviation & Marine Insurance
Group, Inc. ("AMIG") in Dallas, Texas; and Guarantee Insurance Resources, Inc.
("GIR") in Marietta, Georgia.
 
    Since its founding in 1974, the Company and its predecessor companies have
been consistently profitable, generally reporting annual increases in gross
written premium ("GWP"), net written premium ("NWP"), management fee and
commission income and total revenue. During the period 1995 through 1997, the
Company's insurance company subsidiaries had an average combined ratio of 82.3%
versus the less favorable 106.1% recorded by the U.S. property and casualty
insurance industry overall (1995-1996). During the same period, the Company's
GWP increased from $283.5 million to $346.4 million, an increase of 22%,
although growth has slowed recently; management fee and commission income
increased from $35.9 million to $75.9 million an increase of 112%; and net
earnings increased from $26.1 million to $49.8 million, an increase of 91%.
 
    The Company's insurance companies' underwriting activities are focused on
providing aviation, marine, offshore energy, property, accident and health, and
lenders single interest insurance and reinsurance on a worldwide basis. As an
insurer, the Company operates on a surplus lines or a non-admitted basis through
HC and TIC and on an admitted basis through AIC and USSIC.
 
    The Company's domestic insurance company subsidiaries are rated "A+"
(Superior) by A.M. Best Company ("A.M. Best"). HC is rated "Aq" and AIC is rated
"AAq" by Standard & Poor's Corporation ("S&P"). An A.M. Best or S&P rating is
intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurer's ability to meet its
obligations to policyholders and should not be considered as an investment
recommendation.
 
    The Company also underwrites on behalf of non-affiliiated insurance
companies through its managing general agency operations. These agency
operations specialize in domestic general aviation insurance, medical stop-loss
coverage for employee sponsored self-insured health plans, occupational accident
coverage for self-insured truckers, and a variety of accident and health related
insurance and reinsurance products. Beginning in 1996, in an effort to further
diversify its operations to enhance the Company's
 
                                       3
<PAGE>
ability to anticipate and capitalize on opportunities resulting from changing
market conditions in the insurance industry, the Company commenced a strategy of
acquiring through merger or purchase, a number of privately held companies whose
business was managing general agency activities, primarily in the medical
stop-loss and domestic general aviation insurance businesses. As a result of
these acquisitions and internal growth, since 1995, the Company's management fee
and commission income has increased from $5.9 million (prior to both
poolings-of-interests restatements) to $75.9 million. The managing general
agency operations generated $518.2 million in premium during 1997, an increase
of 55% since 1995. The Company will continue to review possible acquisition
candidates in the insurance agency and services sectors in order to further the
Company's growth in this area.
 
STRATEGY
 
    The Company's operating philosophy as an insurer is to maximize underwriting
profit while preserving the integrity of shareholders' equity. The Company
concentrates its writings in selected, narrowly defined lines of business in
which it believes there is a substantial opportunity to achieve underwriting
profits. The Company primarily underwrites first party coverages and lines of
business which have relatively short lead times between the occurrence of an
insured event and the reporting of claims to the Company. The Company's
insurance products are marketed both directly by the Company and through
independent and affiliated agents. With respect to the underwriting management,
marketing and related services, the Company seeks to offer quality underwriting,
decision-making, support and reinsurance capacity and financial and other
resources to take advantage of market opportunities for the development of new
products.
 
    The property and casualty insurance underwriting business has historically
been cyclical (though not seasonal) and within the overall cycle of the
industry, particular lines of business experience their own cycles. These cycles
are characterized by periods of excess capital and significant competition in
policy pricing, terms and conditions, followed by periods of capital shortages,
typically resulting from adverse loss experience, which leads to decreased
competition, higher premium rates and stricter underwriting standards.
 
    The position of a particular line of business in its respective underwriting
cycle depends on prevailing premium rates, availability and cost of reinsurance,
and other market conditions. The Company considers each of these factors in
determining when to increase or decrease premium volume in each line. With this
approach, the Company focuses on increasing net earnings rather than premium
volume or market share.
 
    The Company purchases a substantial amount of reinsurance to limit its net
loss from both individual and catastrophic risks. The degree to which the
Company reinsures varies by, among other things, the particular risks inherent
in the policies underwritten, pricing of available reinsurance and competitive
conditions within the relevant line of business.
 
    In its insurance company operations, the Company believes its operational
flexibility, experienced underwriting personnel, and access to and expertise in
the reinsurance marketplace allow the Company to implement its strategy of
emphasizing more profitable lines of business during periods of increased
premium rates and de-emphasizing less profitable lines of business during
periods of severe competition. In addition, through its acquisition and
ownership of insurance agency businesses, the Company believes that it has
demonstrated that those service based businesses can both complement the
Company's underwriting activities and serve as a source of revenue which may not
be subject to the same level of volatility as traditional underwriting revenues.
Many of the Company's insurance agency and services subsidiaries act as an agent
on behalf of, or provide services to, the Company's insurance company
subsidiaries as well as to non-affiliated insurers. The ability of the Company's
insurance company subsidiaries to utilize an affiliated insurance agency or
services provider, and the corollary ability of such insurance agency and
services subsidiaries to place business with, or provide other services to, an
affiliated
 
                                       4
<PAGE>
insurer, permits the Company to capture a greater portion of the total income
derived from generated premium.
 
    The Company's business plan is to expand its underwriting activities and
continue the growth of its insurance agency and services operations. However,
the Company's business plan is shaped by its underlying operating philosophy,
which is to maximize underwriting profit opportunities, while preserving the
integrity of shareholders' equity. The Company expects to continue to seek to
acquire complementary businesses with established management and reputation in
the insurance industry, whose business, the Company believes, can be enhanced
through the synergism created by the Company's underwriting capabilities and its
other owned insurance related businesses. As a result, the Company's primary
interests are not necessarily in expanding market share or GWP, but rather in
increasing net earnings. To accomplish this objective, the Company: (i) has been
and is prepared to emphasize or reduce underwritings in certain lines of
business as premium rates, the availability and cost of reinsurance and other
market conditions warrant; (ii) will continue to attempt to limit its downside
net loss exposure through the effective, prudent and conservative use of
reinsurance; (iii) will, as conditions warrant, continue to emphasize the growth
of its insurance agency and services operations, which can be expected to result
in continuing growth of management fee and commission income as a portion of
total revenues; and (iv) will continue to review the possible acquisition of
other specialty insurance companies.
 
INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION
 
    Financial information concerning the Company's operations by industry

a subsidiary of HC. AIC and USSIC operate on an admitted basis throughout the
United States and AIC also operates as an admitted insurer in Canada (except
Quebec).
 
    AVEMCO's principal insurance agency and services operations are focused in
five areas: (i) underwriting management services for lenders single interest

underwriting management and claims administration services for the Company's
agency produced, domestic general aviation business.
 
    On February 27, 1998, the Company issued 1,600,000 shares of its Common

PENDING ACQUISITIONS
 
    There are currently no acquisitions pending; however, the Company is
evaluating a number of possible acquisition candidates and expects to complete
one or more acquisitions during the remainder of 1998. The Company believes
these future acquisitions will expand and strengthen its existing lines of
business and perhaps provide access to additional specialty sectors, which
management expects will contribute to the growth of the Company.

INSURANCE COMPANY OPERATIONS
 
    The Company's property and casualty insurance company businesses specialize
in the direct underwriting, including facultative (individual policy)
reinsurance of aviation, marine, offshore energy, property, accident and health,
and lenders single interest risks and to a lesser extent, treaty reinsurance
(contractual arrangements relating to specific types of risks) on both a
proportional (where the reinsurer shares proportionately in premiums and losses)
and an excess of loss (where only losses above a fixed point or percentage are
reinsured) basis in these same lines of business.

UNDERWRITING
 
    DIRECT--The Company underwrites direct business produced through independent
agents and brokers, affiliated intermediaries, and by direct marketing efforts,
particularly in small general aviation business.
 
    REINSURANCE--The Company engages in reinsurance underwriting on a periodic
basis when market rates and other conditions make it profitable to do so, to
access business not readily available to the Company on a direct basis and to
provide reciprocity to non-affiliated insurance companies. The Company
 
                                       7
<PAGE>
began writing treaty reinsurance in 1984, but had dramatically reduced its book
of business by 1992, due to the deterioration in market conditions.
 
    The Company's current reinsurance underwriting activities are primarily in
accident and health lines of business where the Company's insurance company
subsidiaries participate in various insurance and reinsurance underwriting pools
managed by one of its subsidiaries and facultative reinsurance, particularly in
the aviation and property lines of business.
 
    The Company previously wrote excess of loss reinsurance, typically aviation,
marine and non-marine catastrophe exposures. In 1992, due to a general market
contraction of available reinsurance for excess of loss business, the Company
was unable to purchase adequate protection at a reasonable cost and, therefore,
elected not to continue writing this class other than selectively on a net
basis. The run-off of this line of business continues profitably on a net basis.
 
    The Company underwrites proportional treaty reinsurance on a selective
basis. The exposures reinsured are typically the same type of risks that the
Company underwrites on a direct basis.
 
    The Company underwrites facultative reinsurance in most of its lines of
business. Typically, this is on international business in order to comply with
local licensing requirements or as reinsurance of captives, and usually can be
considered direct business, as the Company maintains underwriting and claims
control. However, all of this business is recorded under the caption of
"Reinsurance Assumed".
 
    AVIATION--Aviation underwriting presently represents the Company's largest
overall line of business and in recent years the Company has grown into a market
leader in the aviation insurance industry. The Company insures, on both a direct
marketed and independent agency produced basis, general aviation risks,
including private aircraft owners and pilots, fixed base operations, rotor wing
aircraft, corporate aircraft, cargo operations, commuter airlines and similar
operations, many on both a domestic and international basis. At this time, the
Company does not generally insure major domestic trunk airlines, major
manufacturers or satellites. The coverages underwritten include hull (including
engines, avionics and other systems), liabilities, war, cargo and various
ancillary coverages.
 
    The Company has been underwriting aviation risks since 1981 through HC. AIC
has been insuring aviation risks since 1959. GWP has risen consistently since
1995, increasing from $132.7 million to $164.5 million in 1997. This growth has
occurred due to internal growth, particularly internationally. Although, due to
market conditions, domestic risks had not been a focus for the Company since the
early 1990's, HC resumed writing domestic general aviation risks late in 1996
and with the acquisition of AIC and USSIC in mid-1997, the Company assumed the
role of a major participant in the domestic general aviation insurance market.
The Company's position in the domestic general aviation market is further
enhanced by its aviation managing general agency operations and the Company
estimates that it presently underwrites on behalf of affiliated and
non-affiliated insurance companies approximately 25% of the overall domestic
general aviation market. The Company expects that general aviation insurance
will continue to play a key role in the Company's near-term operations. In 1997,
the Company experienced a decline in NWP due to the implementation of the
Company's reinsurance program at AIC. The Company expects its overall increases
in GWP and NWP to slow during 1998 as a result of the Company's already
substantial market share and increased competition.
 
    Treaty reinsurance is maintained on both a proportional and an excess of
loss basis to protect the Company against individual risk severity of loss and
catastrophe exposure. Management believes that the aviation risks underwritten
by the Company carry a relatively low level of catastrophe exposure.
 
    MARINE--The Company underwrites marine risks for ocean going vessels ("Blue
Water"), inland and coastal trading vessels ("Brown Water"), fishing vessels and
to a limited extent, pleasure-crafts. The coverages written include hull and
machinery, liabilities (including protection and indemnity), marine cargo and
various ancillary coverages.
 
                                       8
<PAGE>
    The Company has underwritten marine risks since 1984. Premium rates were
adequate during 1995 and 1996 but competition has created downward pressure on
these rates causing a reduction in the Company's GWP from $37.3 million in 1995
to $22.8 million in 1997 and a corresponding decrease in NWP from $32.9 million
to $17.3 million for the same period. The Company believes these rates will
remain soft during 1998.
 
    Treaty reinsurance is maintained on an excess of loss basis to protect the
Company against individual risk severity of loss and catastrophe exposure.
Management believes that the marine risks underwritten by the Company carry a
relatively low level of catastrophe exposure.
 
    OFFSHORE ENERGY--The Company has been underwriting offshore energy risks
since 1988. Offshore energy risks include drilling rigs, production and
gathering platforms, and pipelines. Coverages underwritten include physical
damage, liabilities, business interruption and various ancillary coverages.
 
    Rates have declined significantly during the past few years to levels where
profitability is unlikely. Underwriting has been on a very selective basis,
striving for quality rather than quantity, which has resulted in a continued
reduction in GWP from $14.9 million in 1995 to $7.5 million in 1997. The Company
anticipates little growth in GWP and NWP during 1998 as severe competition is
expected to continue.
 
    Treaty reinsurance is maintained on both a proportional and an excess of
loss basis to protect the Company against individual risk severity of loss and
the catastrophic exposure that exists, for example, from a hurricane in the Gulf
of Mexico.
 
    PROPERTY--The Company specializes in writing catastrophe exposed risks in
general and the property risks of large multinational corporations, covering
such commercial risks as hotels, office buildings, retail locations, factories,
industrial plants, utilities, refineries, natural gas facilities and
petrochemical plants. Coverage includes business interruption and physical
damage, including flood and earthquake.
 
    The Company has written property business since 1986. GWP grew to $124.3
million in 1995 as premium rates increased following the Northridge earthquake
in 1994. During 1996, premium rates began to soften and this trend has continued
throughout 1997 due in a large part to excess capacity and the absence of
significant catastrophe losses. GWP has declined from $124.3 million in 1995 to
$85.4 million in 1997. NWP also declined from $24.2 million to $8.8 million in
the same period. Property NWP will always be substantially less than GWP due to
the amount of reinsurance purchased to protect the Company's catastrophe
exposure. In the absence of a major catastrophe loss, which could be expected to
have a positive impact on pricing in the sector, the Company expects both GWP
and NWP to decline further during 1998 as premium rates continue to soften.
 
    Considerable treaty reinsurance is maintained on both a proportional and an
excess of loss basis to ensure adequate protection, particularly against
catastrophic exposures. The Company conservatively estimates its aggregate
exposure in any individual catastrophe zone and maintains catastrophe
reinsurance to cover its exposure to any one occurrence.
 
    ACCIDENT AND HEALTH--The Company began underwriting accident and health
risks through HC during 1996. These risks are produced primarily by the managing
general agencies which were acquired by the Company during that year. The risks
underwritten include medical stop-loss insurance for employer sponsored
self-insured health plans; reinsurance in the medical, accident and health
special risks, workers' compensation and alternative workers' compensation
areas; and occupational accident insurance for self-employed truckers. The
Company underwrites in this area on both a direct and reinsurance basis. The
Company's GWP increased from $13.0 million in 1996 to $43.2 million in 1997. The
Company expects its overall GWP and NWP to continue to increase significantly
during 1998, primarily due to the Company's anticipated utilization of AIC as a
primary insurer of medical stop-loss products underwritten by the Company's
accident and health agency operations.
 
                                       9
<PAGE>
    Management believes that its accident and health business carries a
relatively low level of catastrophe exposure.
 
    LENDERS SINGLE INTEREST--USSIC began writing lenders single interest risks
in 1984. GWP increased from $16.6 million in 1995 to $21.9 million in 1997,
however, due to the implementation of a reinsurance program when USSIC was
acquired in June, 1997, NWP decreased from $14.6 million in 1995 to $11.1
million in 1997. This coverage is marketed to banks and other financial
institutions and addresses risks of physical loss or damage to the property
securing installment loans (primarily automobiles). All of the lenders single
interest risks underwritten by the Company are produced by the Company's
subsidiary, Matterhorn Bank Programs, Inc. ("Matterhorn"). GWP is expected to
grow during 1998 but NWP will remain unchanged as the new reinsurance program
will be in effect for the entire year.
 
    Treaty reinsurance is maintained on a proportional basis to protect against
frequency of loss. Management believes that its lenders single interest business
carries a relatively low level of catastrophe exposure.
 
INSURANCE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES
 
    HOUSTON CASUALTY COMPANY--HC, the Company's principal insurance company
subsidiary, is rated A+, VIII by A.M. Best and operates worldwide in all of the
lines of business in which the Company specializes (except lenders single
interest). HC's business is produced by independent agents and brokers, the
group's agency subsidiaries, AIC, USSIC, TIC, and other insurance and
reinsurance companies worldwide. HC has a highly experienced staff of
underwriters trained to deal with the high value, complicated exposures
prevailing in many of the lines of business in which the Company specializes. As
of December 31, 1997, HC had statutory policyholders' surplus of $233.0 million.
 
    TRAFALGAR INSURANCE COMPANY--TIC, which was organized in 1993, is a wholly
owned subsidiary of HC. TIC is an Oklahoma domiciled property and casualty
insurance company, is rated A+, VI by A.M. Best and currently underwrites
domestic property risks and allows HC to offer insurance on a surplus lines
basis in certain jurisdictions where HC is not otherwise permitted to do so.
Applications for surplus lines approval are pending in many additional states
and TIC will expand its operations as approvals are received. As of December 31,
1997, TIC had statutory policyholders' surplus of $30.9 million.
 
    U.S. SPECIALTY INSURANCE COMPANY--USSIC is a Maryland domiciled property and
casualty insurance company and former subsidiary of AIC which became a
subsidiary of HC in December, 1997. The Company is in the process of effecting
the re-domestication of USSIC from Maryland to Texas, which, pending regulatory
approval, is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 1998. USSIC
is rated A+, VII by A.M. Best and has historically been an underwriter of
general aviation, pleasure-craft marine and lenders single interest risks
through a network of independent agents. USSIC operates on an admitted basis
throughout the United States (except Hawaii). The Company expects to continue
USSIC's operation primarily as a general aviation and lenders single interest
underwriter. During December, 1997, the Company increased the policyholders'
surplus of USSIC by $38.4 million and as of December 31, 1997, USSIC had
statutory policyholders' surplus of $50.1 million.
 
    IMG INSURANCE COMPANY LTD.--Organized in September, 1991, as a Jordanian
Exempt Company ("JEC"), IMG conducts substantially all of its business outside
of Jordan and has been principally engaged in insuring and reinsuring large
commercial risks in substantially the same lines of business as HC. In
connection with IMG's business, the Company has agreed to unconditionally
guarantee certain of the insurance and reinsurance business of IMG. As of
December 31, 1997, IMG had policyholders' surplus of $28.5 million. During 1998,
the operations of IMG, through its Amman, Jordan and London, England offices,
were consolidated with the operations of HC and HC is in the process of assuming
all of IMG's existing insurance obligations. On a going forward basis, IMG will
operate as a branch of HC. Management believes that this action can be expected
to enhance the direct presence of HC in the Middle Eastern,
 
                                       10

African and London insurance markets and is expected to lead to increased
underwriting opportunities for the Company in those and other international
markets.
 
    AVEMCO INSURANCE COMPANY--AIC was organized in 1959 and became a subsidiary
of the Company in June, 1997. AIC is a Maryland domiciled property and casualty
insurer, is rated A+, VII by A.M. Best and operates primarily as a direct market
writer of general aviation and pleasure-craft marine business on an admitted
basis throughout the United States and Canada (except Quebec). In addition, as a
part of the Company's overall operations, it is anticipated that AIC will become
a primary insurer of medical stop-loss products underwritten by the Company's
accident and health managing general agency subsidiaries and of lenders single
interest risks underwritten by another subsidiary of the Company. At December
31, 1997, AIC had statutory policyholders' surplus of $67.9 million.
 
INSURANCE AGENCY AND SERVICES OPERATIONS
 
    The Company's insurance agency subsidiaries act on behalf of insurance and
reinsurance companies, conducting business in the areas of insurance and
reinsurance underwriting management and claims administration. The insurance
services operations provide insurance related services including intermediary
services. The insurance agency and services subsidiaries do not assume any
insurance or reinsurance risk themselves and the revenues generated are based
entirely on management fees, commissions and profit commissions. As a result of
their operations, these subsidiaries are in a position to direct and control
such insurance premiums.
 
    LDG, GIR and MGU act as underwriting managers providing medical stop-loss
and excess coverage insurance products principally to employer sponsored
self-insured health plans. Other areas of business include medical, accident and
health special risks, workers' compensation and alternative workers'
compensation insurance. In 1997, these operations generated approximately $442.0
million in premium, the majority of which was underwritten on behalf of
non-affiliated insurance companies.
 
    AMIG, acquired by the Company in April, 1997, has provided the base, along
with the Company's insurance company subsidiary AIC, around which the Company
has rapidly developed a significant presence in the domestic general aviation
market. The underwriting management operations of AMIG have been consolidated
with those of Continental, acquired in July, 1997, Southern, acquired in August,
1997 and certain operations of USSIC, acquired in June, 1997. This combined
operation provides underwriting management services on behalf of affiliated and
non-affiliated insurance companies in the areas of private and corporate
aircraft, commercial agricultural aircraft, antique and vintage military
aircraft, small to medium sized airports, and commercial operators. During 1997,
the combined AMIG operation generated approximately $87.5 million in premium,
the majority of which was underwritten on behalf of non-affiliated insurance
companies.
 
    NASRA acts as an underwriting manager providing occupational accident
(similar to workers' compensation) insurance to self-employed truckers and
generated approximately $46.9 million in premium in 1997, the majority of which
was underwritten on behalf of non-affiliated insurance companies.
 
    Matterhorn acts as an underwriting manager providing lenders single interest
coverage to banks and other financial institutions. During 1997, Matterhorn
generated approximately $21.9 million in premium, all on behalf of affiliated
insurance companies, primarily USSIC.
 
    Kachler, which was acquired in February, 1998, is a retail insurance agency
specializing in life, accident and health insurance for employee benefit plans
of large commercial customers throughout the United States. The Company intends
to increase Kachler's revenues substantially through the acquisition of similar
businesses during 1998 and 1999.
 
                                       11
<PAGE>
    HCCU is an intermediary specializing in marketing and servicing large,
complicated insurance and reinsurance programs placed on behalf of multinational
clients operating in the same lines of business that the Company underwrites.
This business is placed with domestic and international insurance companies,
including affiliated insurance companies, on a direct basis and through other
intermediaries. In addition, HCCU acts as a reinsurance intermediary on behalf
of affiliated and non-affiliated insurance companies.
 
    The Company's overall revenue from insurance agency and services operations
is composed of management fee and commission income which increased 77% to $75.9
million in 1997 from $42.8 million in 1995. The Company's premium from managing
general agency operations was $518.2 million in 1997 an increase of 55% from
$334.7 million in 1995. Management expects continued growth in management fee
and commission revenue in 1998, both from existing operations and additional
acquisitions in this sector.
 
COMBINED INSURANCE COMPANY AND INSURANCE AGENCY OPERATIONS
 
    The Company's combined GWP was over $850.0 million in 1997, with its
insurance company operations underwriting $346.4 million and its managing
general agency operations underwriting $518.2 million, primarily on behalf of
non-affiliated insurance companies. The substantial premium base underwritten
and controlled by the Company's managing general agency operations is expected
to increase both internally and by acquisition during 1998 and will provide a
basis for significant growth for the Company's insurance company operations as
business is transferred from non-affiliated insurance companies.
 
REINSURANCE CEDED
 
    The Company principally utilizes reinsurance to reduce its net liability on
individual risks, to protect against catastrophic losses and to achieve a
desired ratio of NWP to policyholders' surplus. Various intermediaries,
including HCCU, facilitate the placement of this reinsurance coverage on behalf
of the Company and are compensated, directly or indirectly, by the reinsurers.
 
    Reinsurance is ceded under reinsurance treaties on both a proportional and
an excess of loss basis. The Company also reinsures large individual risks on a
facultative basis. Management believes that the Company reinsures its risks to a
greater extent than most of its competitors and most other insurance companies.
This strategy greatly reduces the likelihood of a significant net loss from
insurance company operations and protects the integrity of the Company's
shareholders' equity. Under its current reinsurance protections, the Company has
limited its net retained loss, across any single line of business, to a maximum
of approximately $500,000 for any one risk, but significantly less on most
risks.
 
    The type, cost and limits of reinsurance purchased can vary from year to
year based upon the Company's desired retention levels and the availability of
adequate reinsurance at a reasonable price. The majority of the Company's
reinsurance programs are renewed on a calendar year basis. For 1998, the Company
has been successful in renewing its reinsurance protections at reduced costs to
1997.
 
    The Company structures a specific reinsurance program for each line of
business it underwrites. This reinsurance is placed in order to protect the
Company from unreasonable exposure to foreseeable events. The Company places
reinsurance proportionally to cover loss frequency and for catastrophe coverage,
on an excess of loss basis to cover individual risk severity of loss and on a
catastrophe basis to cover losses involving multiple risks, such as those
resulting from a hurricane or an earthquake. The Company does not intend to
expose itself to a net loss from an individual risk in excess of its reinsurance
protection.
 
    The Company writes business in areas exposed to catastrophic losses and has
significant exposures to this type of loss in California, the Atlantic Coast of
the United States, certain United States Gulf Coast states, particularly in
Florida and Texas, the Caribbean and Mexico. The Company carefully assesses its
overall exposures to a single catastrophic event and applies procedures that it
believes are more conservative than are typically used by the industry to
ascertain the Company's probable maximum loss ("PML") from any
 
                                       12
<PAGE>
single event. The Company maintains reinsurance protection which it believes is
sufficient to cover any foreseeable event.
 
    The Company receives an overriding (ceding) commission on the premium ceded
to reinsurers which compensates the Company for the direct costs associated with
the production of the premium, the servicing of the business during the term of
the policies ceded, and the costs associated with the placement of the related
reinsurance. In addition, certain of the Company's reinsurance treaties allow
for a sharing with the Company, by the reinsurers, of the net profits generated
under such treaties.
 
    The ceding of reinsurance does not discharge the Company from liability to
its policyholders. The Company is required to pay losses even if the reinsurer
fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance contract. To minimize its
exposure to reinsurance credit risk, the Company places its reinsurance with a
diverse group of financially sound reinsurers. The Company's 1998 treaty
reinsurance program was placed with more than 57 domestic and foreign
reinsurers. As of December 31, 1997, the total amount recoverable from
reinsurers was approximately $203.3 million, of which $50.5 million represents
paid losses recoverable (in the ordinary course of business) and $155.4 million
represents outstanding losses recoverable, less a $2.5 million reserve for
uncollectible reinsurance. In addition, ceded unearned premium was $84.6
million. The Company held $93.9 million of irrevocable letters of credit and
$8.6 million in cash to collateralize a portion of the total amount recoverable
and had other payable balances due to its reinsurers of $116.6 million as
potential offsets against reinsurance recoverables. The estimated duration for
the Company's outstanding losses is 2 years, as the majority of the Company's
business has historically had shorter lead times between the occurrence of an
insured event and final settlements.
 
    Prior to the Company's acquisition of AVEMCO, AIC retained a greater
percentage of overall premiums written than HC and TIC. Following the
acquisition, the Company implemented a program of reinsurance for AIC which is
more consistent with the reinsurance programs utilized by the Company's other
insurance company subsidiaries. The effect of this change was to limit the net
retained exposure of AIC and to reduce the effect on net earnings of large
losses and high frequency of losses.
 
    Due to the Company's financial analysis of active and potential reinsurers
and its conservative strategy of diversifying its reinsurers, the Company has
never incurred a significant loss on recoverables from reinsurers. The Company
has established a reserve of $2.5 million as of December 31, 1997, to reduce the
effects of any recoverable problem.

    While there is no statutory requirement regarding a permissible premium to
surplus ratio, guidelines established by the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners ("NAIC") provide that a property and casualty insurer's annual
statutory GWP should not exceed 900% and NWP should not exceed 300% of its
policyholders' surplus. In keeping with its philosophy of protecting its
shareholders' equity and limiting its aggregate loss exposure, the Company
maintains premium to surplus ratios significantly lower than such guidelines,
and, as indicated above, below industry norms.

    The SAP basis ratio data is not intended to be a substitute for results of
operations on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
The difference between SAP and GAAP are shown in Note (15) of the Company's
consolidated financial statements. Including this information on a SAP basis is
meaningful and useful to allow a comparison of the Company's operating results
with those of other companies in the insurance industry. A.M. Best reports on
insurer performance on a SAP basis to provide for more standardized comparisons
among individual companies, as well as overall industry performance.
 
RESERVES
 
    Applicable insurance laws and regulations require that reserves be
maintained for the payment of loss and loss adjustment expense ("LAE") with
respect to both reported and incurred but not reported ("IBNR") claims under
insurance and reinsurance policies issued by the Company. In most cases, the
Company establishes reserves through an evaluation of individual claims. In some
types of aviation claims, an average reserving method is utilized until more
information becomes available which will permit a more specific individual
evaluation of claims. In the case of direct and facultative reinsurance
business, loss reserves are determined by evaluating reported claims on the
basis of the type of loss, jurisdiction of the occurrence, knowledge of the
circumstances surrounding the claim, severity of injury or damage, potential for
ultimate exposure, experience with the insured and the line of business and
policy provisions relating to the particular type of claim. The Company
establishes loss reserves for excess of loss and proportional reinsurance claims
based on information and reports received from ceding companies. Loss reserves
for IBNR losses are determined in part on the basis of statistical information
and in part on industry experience with respect to the probable number and
nature of claims arising from occurrences which have not been reported. The
Company does not discount any of its loss reserves.
 
    With respect to some classes of risks, the period of time between the
occurrence of an insured event and the final settlement of a claim may be many
years, and during this period it often becomes necessary to adjust the claim
estimates either upward or downward. Certain classes of marine and offshore
energy insurance underwritten by the Company have historically had longer lead
times between the occurrence of an insured event, reporting of the claim to the
Company, and final settlement. In such cases, the Company is forced to estimate
reserves over long periods of time, with the possibility of several adjustments
to
 
                                       14
<PAGE>
reserves. Other classes of insurance, such as most aviation, property and
accident and health business the Company underwrites, historically have shorter
lead times between the occurrence of an insured event, reporting of the claim to
the Company, and final settlement. The reserves with respect to such classes
are, therefore, less likely to be adjusted. The classes of insurance with
shorter lead times currently represent the majority of the risks underwritten by
the Company's insurance company operations.
 
    The reserving process is intended to provide implicit recognition of the
impact of inflation and other factors affecting loss payments by taking into
account changes in historical payment patterns and perceived probable trends.
However, there is no precise method for the subsequent evaluation of the
adequacy of the consideration given to inflation, or to any other specific
factor, some of which are interdependent.
 
    The Company underwrites, directly and through reinsurance, risks which are
denominated in a number of foreign currencies, and therefore establishes and
maintains loss reserves with respect to these policies in the respective
currencies. These reserves are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, which may
have an effect on the Company's earnings. From time to time, the Company may
attempt to limit its exposure to future currency fluctuations through the use of
foreign currency forward contracts.
 
    The following loss development triangles show changes in reserves in
subsequent years from the prior loss estimates based on experience as of the end
of each succeeding year on the basis of GAAP. The estimate is increased or
decreased as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of
losses for individual years. A redundancy means the original estimate was higher
than the current estimate; a deficiency means that the current estimate is
higher than the original estimate.
 
    The first line of each loss development triangle presents, for each of the
years indicated, the gross reserve liability including the reserve for IBNR
losses. The first section of each table shows, by year, the cumulative amounts
of loss and LAE paid as of the end of each succeeding year. The second section
sets forth the re-estimates in later years of incurred losses, including
payments, for the years indicated. The "cumulative redundancy (deficiency)"
represents, as of December 31, 1997, the difference between the latest
re-estimated liability and the reserves as originally estimated.

    During 1997, the Company had gross loss and LAE deficiency of $23.2 million
compared to deficiencies of $42.5 million in 1996 and $15.9 million in 1995. The
gross deficiency comes from two primary sources. Firstly, the development of
several large claims on individual policies which were either reported late or
reserves were increased as subsequent information became available, however, as
most of these policies were substantially reinsured, there was no material
effect to the Company's net earnings. Secondly, the run-off of the
retrocessional excess of loss business which the Company underwrote between 1988
and 1991. This development, $1.6 million in 1997 compared to $11.3 million in
1996 and $9.8 million in 1995, is due primarily to the delay in reporting of
catastrophe losses by the London insurance market, coupled with the
unprecedented number of catastrophes during the period in which the Company
underwrote this business. This business is also substantially reinsured, thereby
not having a material effect on the Company's net earnings.

(2) Changes in loss and LAE reserves on a GAAP basis, for losses occurring in
    prior years, reflect the net effect of the resolution of losses for other
    than the reserve value and the subsequent adjustments of loss reserves.
 
    Although the Company experienced a gross loss deficiency during 1997, 1996
and 1995, because the business is substantially reinsured in the lines where
adverse development has occurred, there is no material adverse effect on a net
loss basis.
 
    During 1997, the Company had net loss and LAE redundancy of $3.8 million
relating to prior year losses compared to redundancies of $4.9 million in 1996
and $2.8 million in 1995. The Company believes it has materially provided for
all net incurred losses.
 
                                       18
<PAGE>
    AIC, acquired in June, 1997, recorded a $10.0 million increase in loss and
LAE reserves during December, 1997, predominately related to 1995 and 1996
claims incurred prior to the Company's acquisition of AIC. This deficiency is
included in the net redundancy recorded for 1997. This increase in reserves was
made in an effort to bring AIC's reserving practices consistent with the more
conservative method used by the Company's other insurance company operations.
The Company expects the increase in loss reserves to be adequate to cover any
subsequent adverse development of AIC's prior losses.
 
    The Company has no material exposure to environmental pollution losses, as
HC only began writing business in 1981 and policies issued by HC normally
contain pollution exclusion clauses which limit pollution coverage to "sudden
and accidental" losses only, thus excluding intentional (dumping) and seepage
claims. Policies issued by AIC and USSIC, because of the types of risks insured,
principally general aviation, are not considered to have significant
environmental exposures. Therefore, the Company should not experience any
material development in reserves from environmental pollution claims.
 
INVESTMENTS
 
    Insurance company investments must comply with applicable laws and
regulations which prescribe the type, quality and concentration of investments.
In general, these laws and regulations permit investments, within specified
limits and subject to certain qualifications, in Federal, state and municipal
obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities. As of
December 31, 1997, the Company had $523.3 million of investment assets, the
majority of which were held by insurance company subsidiaries.
 
    The Company's investment policy is determined by the Company's Board of
Directors and is reviewed on a regular basis. Pursuant to its investment policy,
the Company concentrates its investments in obligations of states,
municipalities and political subdivisions, the interest income from which is
predomi-
nantly exempt from Federal income tax. The interest rates on these securities
are normally lower than rates on comparable taxable securities. The Company's
portfolio of fixed income securities available for sale principally consists of
intermediate term, tax-exempt securities. The Company generally intends to hold
such securities to maturity. However, the Company regularly re-evaluates its
position based upon market conditions, which may cause the Company to
restructure its portfolio and realize gains or losses in order to maximize its
total return on investments. Accordingly, all fixed income securities are
classified as available for sale and are recorded at market value.
 
    The Company's financial statements reflect an unrealized ("mark-to-market")
gain on fixed income securities available for sale as of December 31, 1997, of
$14.6 million. Since the Company's intention is to hold these securities until
maturity, it does not currently expect to realize any significant gain or loss
on these investments.
 
    The Company has maintained a substantial level of cash and liquid short-term
instruments in order to maintain the ability to fund large physical damage
losses of the Company's insureds, should they occur. As of December 31, 1997,
the Company had cash and short-term investments of approximately $112.6 million.
 
    The following tables reflect the investments of the Company (dollars are
expressed in thousands). The table set forth below reflects the average amount
of investments, income earned, and the yield thereon for the three years ended
December 31, 1997:

BANK LOAN
 
    Effective as of December 30, 1997, the Company entered into a $120.0 million
revolving credit facility (the "Facility") with a group of banks. Borrowings
under the Facility may be made by the Company until the expiration of the
Facility on December 30, 1999, at which time all principal is due. The Facility
is collateralized by the stock of HC and AIC. The Facility agreement contains
certain restrictive covenants, including, without limitation, minimum net worth
requirements for the Company and certain subsidiaries, restrictions on certain
extraordinary corporate actions, notice requirements for certain material
occurrences, and required maintenance of specified financial ratios. Management
believes that the restrictive covenants and other obligations of the Company
which are contained in the Facility agreement are typical for financing
arrangements comparable to the Facility. The initial funding was used, among
other things, to refinance existing indebtedness of the Company. As of March 13,
1998, the Company had outstanding indebtedness under the Facility in the amount
of $102.0 million.
 
FOREIGN EXCHANGE
 
    From time to time, the Company enters into foreign currency forward
contracts as a hedge against foreign currency fluctuations, primarily British
Pound Sterling ("GBP"). The Company's balances denominated in foreign currency
fluctuate as transactions are recorded and settled. During 1997, the average GBP
liability, for subsidiaries whose functional currency was the United States
dollar, was approximately L793,000 ($1.3 million at December 31, 1997, rate of
exchange) which was hedged by an average open forward contract balance of
approximately L125,000 ($206,000 at the December 31, 1997, rate of exchange).
There are no open foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 1997.
The Company may continue to limit its exposure to currency fluctuations through
the use of foreign currency forward contracts.
 
    The Company utilizes these foreign currency forward contracts strictly as a
hedge against existing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and it does not
do so as any form of speculative or trading investment.

COMPETITION
 
    The insurance business is generally highly competitive. The Company faces
competition from domestic and foreign insurers and agency operations, many of
whom are larger and have greater financial, marketing and management resources
than the Company. The Company's profitability is affected by many other factors,
including rate competition, severity and frequency of claims, interest rates,
state regulations, court decisions, the judicial climate and general business
conditions, all of which are outside the control of the Company. Although as an
insurer, the Company's underwriting strategy is to concentrate its writings in
selected, narrowly defined lines of business, the Company faces competition in
these selected lines of business both from other specialty insurance companies
as well as larger, more diversified insurance companies which underwrite
multiple lines of business, including the lines of business underwritten by the
Company. The Company's medical stop-loss business involves a diversified field
of participants from small, start-up operations to large, well-established
organizations. Significant growth in the number of medical stop-loss insurance
underwriters and underwriting managers in the past several years has increased
the level of competition in this area of the Company's business. The Company
also faces intense and growing pressure in this area from alternatives to
employer sponsored self-insured health plans, such as fully-insured plans, HMOs
and Point of Service plans, as well as from large well established direct
insurers and competing underwriting managers providing similar medical stop-loss
products to those offered by the Company to employer sponsored self-insured
health plans.
 
    Competition in the reinsurance marketplace is primarily due to an increase
in the number of reinsurers participating in the market as well as a tendency by
reinsureds to retain a greater percentage of their own risk. The Company
competes with other reinsurance underwriting managers and domestic and
international reinsurance companies. The Company's results of operations may
also be affected by the competition for reinsurance business between broker
reinsurance markets and direct marketing reinsurance companies. The Company also
competes with many reinsurance intermediaries in the broker reinsurance market,
some of which are affiliated with primary insurance brokers with substantial
financial resources. In its insurance agency and services operations, the
Company competes with a large number of publicly traded and private firms which
operate as independent insurance agencies or insurance services providers as
well as with insurance companies which market insurance products directly
through their employees or affiliated insurance agencies. In each of the
business areas in which the Company is engaged, a significant number of the
Company's competitors have financial resources, employees, facilities, market
recognition, marketing, management, experience, and other resources
substantially greater than those of the Company. In addition to competition in
the operation of its business, the Company faces competition from a variety of
sources in attracting and retaining qualified employees.
 
REGULATION
 
    The activities of the Company are subject to licensing requirements and
extensive regulation under the laws of the United States and its various states,
territories and possessions, as well as the laws of other countries in which the
Company's subsidiaries operate. Currently insurance companies are generally not
subject to any Federal regulation of their insurance business because of the
existence of a Federal law commonly known as the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which
provides the insurance industry with immunity from certain aspects of the
Federal anti-trust law and exempts the business of insurance from Federal
regulation. Therefore, in the United States, the Company's operations are
regulated primarily at the state level. The Company's business depends on the
validity of, and continued good standing under, the licenses and approvals
pursuant to which it operates, as well as compliance with pertinent regulations.
The Company therefore devotes significant efforts toward obtaining and
maintaining its licenses and compliance with a diverse and complex regulatory
structure.
 
    The Company's insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are
subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions
in which they do business. Within the states, the method of such regulation
varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and
supervisory
 
                                       21
<PAGE>
powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relates
primarily to approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that
must be met and maintained, including risk based capital measurements, the
licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations of
investments, restrictions of the size of risks which may be insured under a
single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, methods
of accounting, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the
form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed, and
reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such
regulations are intended primarily for the protection of policyholders rather
than shareholders. Compliance is monitored by the state insurance departments
through periodic regulatory reporting procedures and periodic examinations. The
quarterly and annual financial reports to the regulators in the United States
utilize accounting principles which are different from the GAAP used by the
Company in its reports to shareholders. The SAP, in keeping with the intent to
assure the protection of policyholders, are generally based on a liquidation
concept while GAAP is based on a going-concern concept.
 
    In addition to the regulatory supervision of the insurance company
subsidiaries of the Company, as an insurance holding company, the Company is
subject to regulation under the insurance holding company system regulatory acts
in the states of California, Maryland, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas, which
contain certain reporting requirements including registration and the filing of
annual reports. In such registration and annual reports, the Company is required
to provide current information regarding its capital structure, general
financial condition, ownership, management, and the identity of each member of
its insurance holding company system. The Company is also required to provide
prior notice to insurance regulatory authorities of certain agreements and
transactions between the Company and its affiliates. These agreements and
transactions must satisfy certain standards set forth in the insurance laws and
regulations of such states. Insurance holding company laws also regulate the
payment of dividends and other distributions by insurance companies to their
shareholders.
 
    Additionally, the insurance agency and services operations of the Company
are subject to state insurance laws and regulations which require the licensing
of insurance agents, brokers, reinsurance intermediaries, reinsurance
underwriting managers, third party administrators and managing general agents
and which regulate certain aspects of their business. These laws and regulations
may include requirements for certain provisions in contracts entered into
between the Company and various insurers or reinsurers, record keeping and
reporting requirements, limitations on authority, advertising and business
practice rules, and other matters. The manner of operating the Company's agency
activities in particular states may vary according to the licensing requirements
of the particular state, which may require, among other things, that a firm
operate in the state through a local corporation. In a few states, licenses are
issued only to individual residents or locally-owned business entities. In such
cases, the Company has arrangements with residents or business entities licensed
to act in the state.
 
    There can be no assurance given that the Company has all such required
licenses, approvals or complying contracts or that such licenses, approvals or
complying contracts can always be obtained or continued. In all jurisdictions,
the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation
by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with
relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals,
and to implement regulations, and licenses may be denied or revoked for various
reasons, including the violations of such regulations, conviction of crimes and
the like. In some instances, the Company follows practices based on its
interpretations, or those that it believes may be generally followed by the
industry, of laws and regulations, which may be different from the requirements
or interpretations of regulatory authorities. Accordingly, the possibility
exists that the Company may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying
on some or all of its activities or otherwise penalized in a given jurisdiction.
Such preclusion or suspension could have a materially adverse effect on the
business and results of operations of the Company.
 
    HC is domiciled and licensed as an admitted insurer in Texas, is an
accredited reinsurer in 30 states (including Texas), and is an approved surplus
lines insurer or is otherwise permitted to write surplus lines
 
                                       22
<PAGE>
insurance in 46 states, three U.S. territories and the District of Columbia.
When a reinsurer obtains accreditation from a particular state, insurers within
that state are permitted to obtain statutory credit for risks ceded to the
reinsurer. Surplus lines insurance is offered by non-admitted (unlicensed)
companies on risks which are not insured by admitted (licensed) companies. All
surplus lines insurance is written through licensed surplus lines insurance
brokers, who are required to ensure that no licensed admitted insurer will write
a particular risk prior to placing that risk with a surplus lines insurer.
Additionally, HC through its operations in Amman, Jordan (formerly IMG), is able
under Jordanian law to directly underwrite non-Jordanian risks and reinsure
Jordanian risks. HC is in the process of seeking regulatory approval with the
appropriate English authorities to operate a formal branch office in London,
England. Such approval, if granted, will impose additional regulatory
requirements on HC, but management expects that such approval will also permit
HC to take advantage of increased opportunities in the London insurance market,
a historical focal point for specialty property and casualty risks. TIC is
domiciled and licensed as an admitted insurer in Oklahoma, is an accredited
reinsurer in three states (including Oklahoma), and is an approved surplus lines
insurer or is otherwise permitted to write surplus lines insurance in 28 states
and the District of Columbia. AIC is domiciled and licensed as an admitted
insurer in Maryland and operates as a licensed admitted insurer in 49 other
states, the District of Columbia, and all Canadian provinces (except Quebec).
USSIC is domiciled and licensed as an admitted insurer in Maryland and operates
as a licensed admitted insurer in 48 other states and the District of Columbia.
The Company expects, pending regulatory approval, to re-domesticate USSIC from
Maryland to Texas in 1998.
 
    Under the laws of the State of Texas, HC must maintain minimum statutory
capital of $1.0 million and minimum statutory surplus of $1.0 million and may
only pay dividends out of its statutory earned surplus. The maximum amount of
dividends that HC may pay without prior regulatory approval in any 12 month
period is the greater of its statutory net investment income for the prior year,
or 10% of its statutory policyholders' surplus as of the prior year end, which
at December 31, 1997, was $23.3 million. Under the laws of the State of
Maryland, AIC and USSIC may only pay dividends out of its statutory earned
surplus. The maximum amount of dividends that AIC and USSIC may pay without
prior regulatory approval in any 12 month period is the greater of its statutory
net income or 10% of its statutory policyholders' surplus, which at December 31,
1997 was $6.8 million for AIC. However, on December 30, 1997, AIC paid an
extraordinary dividend of $13.7 million, which was approved by the Maryland
Insurance Administration and which represented a dividend of USSIC to AIC's
parent, the result of which is that USSIC has become a wholly owned subsidiary
of HC. As a result of this transaction, any dividends by AIC during the period
ending December 30, 1998 would require the prior approval of the Maryland
Insurance Administration. The maximum amount of dividends USSIC may pay HC
during 1998 is $5.0 million. Under the laws of the State of Oklahoma, TIC may
only pay dividends out of surplus funds. The maximum amount TIC may pay HC
without prior regulatory approval is the greater of statutory net income
excluding realized capital gains or 10% of statutory capital and surplus, which
at December 31, 1997 was $3.1 million.
 
    The NAIC has developed a formula for analyzing insurance companies called
risk-based capital. The risk-based capital formula is intended to establish
"minimum" capital threshold levels that vary with the size and mix of a
company's business. It is designed to identify companies with the capital levels
that may require regulatory attention. As of December 31, 1997, each of the
Company's domestic insurance company subsidiaries' total adjusted capital is
significantly in excess of the NAIC authorized control level risk-based capital.
 
PENDING LEGISLATION
 
    In recent years, state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that
modify and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate insurance
companies and insurance holding company systems. The majority of state insurance
regulators are members of the NAIC, which seeks to promote uniformity of, and to
enhance the state regulation of, insurance. In addition, the NAIC and state
insurance regulators, as part of the NAIC's state insurance department
accreditation program, have re-examined existing laws and
 
                                       23
<PAGE>
regulations, specifically focusing on insurance company investments, issues
relating to the solvency of insurance companies, licensing and market conduct
issues, interpretations of existing laws, the development of new laws, and the
definition of extraordinary dividends. Also, Congress and certain Federal
agencies have conducted investigations of the current condition of the insurance
industry in the United States to determine whether to impose Federal regulation
of insurers and reinsurers. In the past several years there have been a number
of recommendations that the McCarran-Ferguson Act (which generally exempts the
insurance business from Federal regulation) be repealed entirely or modified to
remove the industry's anti-trust exemption and subject it to Federal regulation.
The Company is not aware of any such legislation that is currently pending. If
the McCarran-Ferguson Act were to be repealed or modified, state regulation of
the insurance business would continue. This could result in an additional layer
of Federal regulation. Also from time to time, Congress and certain states have
considered various legislative proposals which would provide for governmental
earthquake insurance coverage. The Company does not know at this time the extent
to which any or all such Federal or state legislative or regulatory initiatives
will or may be adopted, and no assurance can be given that they would not, if
adopted, have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
    As of December 31, 1997, the Company had 929 employees, which included five
executive officers, 46 senior management, 94 management and 784 other personnel.
Of this number, 306 were employed by the Company's insurance subsidiaries, 499
were employed by the Company's insurance agency subsidiaries and 124 were
employed by the Company's insurance services subsidiaries. The Company is not a
party to any collective bargaining agreement and has not experienced work
stoppages or strikes as a result of labor disputes. The Company considers
relations with its employees to be good.
 
                               ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
 
    The Company's principal and executive offices are located in Houston, Texas,
in an approximately 54,000 square foot building owned by HC. LDG's principal
facility is leased office space in Wakefield, Massachusetts consisting of
approximately 34,000 square feet, which lease terminates on October 31, 2001.
AIC's principal facility is an approximately 40,000 square foot office building
owned by an AVEMCO subsidiary and located in Frederick, Maryland. AMIG's
principal facility is leased office space in Dallas, Texas consisting of
approximately 36,000 square feet, which lease terminates on August 31, 2002. The
Company owns a 48,200 square foot office building and storage complex in St.
Peters, Missouri. The Company also maintains sales and administration offices or
other facilities in over 30 locations elsewhere in the United States and in
England, Turkey and China. The majority of these additional locations are in
leased facilities.
 
                           ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
    The Company is a party to numerous claims and lawsuits which arise in the
normal course of its business. Many of the pending lawsuits involve claims under
policies underwritten or reinsured by the Company, the liabilities for which
management believes have been adequately included in its established loss
reserves. The Company believes the resolution of these lawsuits will not have a
material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.
 
          ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
 
    There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the

(1) The above prices have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of
    the five-for-two stock split, payable as a 150% stock dividend to
    shareholders of record April 30, 1996. On March 13, 1998, the closing sales
    price of one share of the Company's Common Stock as reported by the NYSE was
    $22 1/8.
 
SHAREHOLDERS
 
    The Company has one class of authorized capital stock: 100,000,000 shares of
Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share. As of March 13, 1998, there were
47,827,789 shares of issued and outstanding Common Stock held by 1,158
shareholders of record; however, the Company believes there are in excess of
15,000 beneficial owners.
 
DIVIDENDS
 
    On April 19, 1996, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had
declared a five-for-two stock split in the form of a 150% stock dividend,
payable to shareholders of record as of April 30, 1996 and that it would
purchase, for cash, any fractional shares issued in connection with this split.
 
    Beginning in June, 1996, the Company announced a planned quarterly program
of paying cash dividends to shareholders. The Company paid a cash dividend in
July, 1996 of $0.02 per share and in each succeeding quarter until the first
quarter of 1997. The Company increased the cash dividend to $0.03 per share in
April, 1997 and to $0.04 per share beginning in April, 1998. The Company
presently plans to continue to pay a $0.04 per share dividend in future
quarters. The Board of Directors may review the Company's dividend policy from
time to time, and any determination with respect thereto will be made in light
of regulatory and other conditions then existing, including the Company's
earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, loan covenants, and other
related factors. Under the terms of the Company's December 30, 1997 Facility,
the Company is prohibited from paying dividends in excess of an agreed upon
maximum amount in any fiscal year. Such limitation will not affect the ability
of the Company to pay dividends in a manner consistent with its past practice
and current expectations.

(1) On May 24, 1996, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock
    of LDG and on June 17, 1997 the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding
    common stock and options of AVEMCO. These business combinations have been
    accounted for as poolings-of-interests and, accordingly, the consolidated
    financial data shown in this table has been restated to include the accounts
    and operations of LDG and AVEMCO for all periods presented.
 
    On November 27, 1996, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of
    NASRA, on April 30, 1997, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding
    shares of Interworld Corporation and on August 8, 1997, the Company acquired
    all of the outstanding shares of Southern and Aviation Claims
    Administrators, Inc. These combinations have been accounted for as
    poolings-of-interests. However, the Company's consolidated financial
    statements have not been restated due to immateriality.
 
(2) The 1996 and prior financial statements of AVEMCO, which was acquired in
    1997, have been restated prior to their inclusion in the Company's
    historical consolidated financial statements to reflect certain prior period
    adjustments discovered in 1997. The selected financial data in this table
    has been restated to reflect these adjustments. The adjustments were for
    periods prior to HCC's ownership and relate to a restatement of the method
    of accounting for certain short-duration insurance contracts and to the
    correction of accounting errors. The adjusted consolidated financial
    statements of AVEMCO and its subsidiaries were utilized to restate the
    Company's financial statements for AVEMCO's acquisition in a
    pooling-of-interests transaction. (See Note 1 above and Note 1 of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 
(3) These amounts have been adjusted to reflect the effects of the three-for-two
    stock split payable as a 50% stock dividend to shareholders of record March
    15, 1994, and the five-for-two stock split payable as a 150% stock dividend
    to shareholders of record April 30, 1996.
 
(4) Book value per share is calculated by dividing shares outstanding into total
    shareholders' equity. Net tangible book value per share uses total
    shareholders' equity less goodwill as the numerator.

GENERAL
 
    The Company's primary sources of revenue are earned premium and investment
income derived from its insurance company operations, and management fee and
commission income generated from its insurance agency and services operations.
The Company's core underwriting activities involve providing aviation, marine,
offshore energy, property, accident and health, and lenders single interest
insurance, which is underwritten on both a direct and a reinsurance basis,
marketed directly by the Company and produced by independent agents. The Company
concentrates on first party, physical damage coverages and lines of business
which have relatively short lead times between the occurrence of an insured
event and the reporting of claims to the Company.
 
    During recent years, the Company has substantially increased its capital and
surplus through the issuance of equity securities, incurrence of debt, and
earnings, thereby enabling it to increase the underwriting capacity of its
insurance company subsidiaries. The Company has utilized this additional capital
by increasing underwriting activity across many of its core lines of business,
emphasizing lines of business and individual opportunities with the most
favorable underwriting characteristics at a particular point in time. In each
line of business, the Company also cedes premium through the purchase of
reinsurance in types and amounts appropriate to the line of business, market
conditions and the Company's desired net risk retention profile.
 
    The Company's insurance agency operations underwrite and service domestic
general aviation, medical stop-loss, lenders single interest, occupational
accident, and accident and health insurance and reinsurance business. They also
place reinsurance for the Company's insurance company operations and other
non-affiliated insurance companies.

    Since 1996, the Company has focused its acquisition activities on expanding
its insurance agency and services operations for three principal reasons.
Firstly, is an attempt to increase the management fee and commission income
revenue component of the Company's total revenue, which management believes to
be a more predictable and more stable source of revenue than the potential
underwriting gain from insurance company operations. Secondly, is an effort to
insulate the Company from a decline in its net earnings growth rate as insurance
premium rates become more competitive in the lines of business in which the
Company specializes in and the Company becomes more selective in its
underwriting approach, resulting in reduced written premium. Thirdly, is to
provide a future source of premium revenue to the Company's insurance company
subsidiaries.

1996. GWP increased to $346.4 million in 1997 from $337.3 million in 1996, due
primarily to increased aviation and accident and health premiums offset by
decreased property and marine premium. NWP for 1997 decreased to $143.4 million
from $188.3 million in 1996, due to an increase in the amount of ceded
reinsurance. Net earned premium decreased to $163.1 million in 1997 compared to

reduction in NWP and the reduced retentions of the Company. The Company expects
GWP to increase during 1998 primarily due to internal growth as the Company's
managing general agency subsidiaries transfer business from non-affiliated
insurance companies to the Company's insurance company operations. However, NWP
and net earned premium will be unchanged as the Company does not intend to
increase its retentions at this time.
 
    Management fee and commission income in 1997 increased 48% to $75.9 million
from $51.4 million in 1996, reflecting internal growth and the acquisition of
several agencies in 1997. The Company expects management fee and commission
income to continue to increase due to the effect of recent and future
acquisitions and internal growth. Net investment income increased 17% to $27.7
million in 1997 from $23.6 million in 1996 reflecting a higher level of
investment assets.
 
    Net realized investment losses from sales of equity securities were $155,000
during 1997, compared to gains of $8.3 million in 1996. During 1996, the Company
systematically liquidated the majority of its equity portfolio. Net realized
investment losses from disposition of fixed income securities were $174,000
during 1997, compared to gains of $29,000 in 1996. During 1996, AVEMCO
consummated the sale of National Assurance Underwriters, Inc., which was a
subsidiary of AVEMCO prior to the pooling-of-interests combination with the
Company. This sale generated an after tax gain of $2.2 million or $0.05 per
share.
 
    AIC, acquired in June, 1997, recorded a $10.0 million increase in loss and
LAE reserves during December, 1997, predominately relating to 1995 and 1996
claims incurred prior to the Company's acquisition of AIC. This increase in
reserves was made to bring AIC's reserving practices consistent with the more
conservative method used by the Company's other insurance company operations.
The Company expects the increase in loss reserves to be adequate to cover any
subsequent adverse development of AIC's prior losses.
 
    Loss and LAE decreased $18.0 million in 1997, to $96.5 million, reflecting
the increased use of reinsurance, despite the $10.0 million reserve
strengthening charge taken by AIC. During 1997, the Company had net loss and LAE
redundancy of $3.8 million relating to prior year losses compared to a
redundancy of $4.9 million in 1996. During 1997, the Company had gross loss and
LAE deficiency of $23.2 million compared to a deficiency of $42.5 million in
1996. The gross deficiency comes from two primary sources. Firstly, the
development of several large claims on individual policies which were either
reported late or reserves were increased as subsequent information became
available, however, as most of these policies were substantially reinsured,
there is no material effect to the Company's net earnings. Secondly, is the
run-off of the retrocessional excess of loss business which the Company
underwrote between 1988 and 1991. This development, $1.6 million in 1997
compared to $11.3 million in 1996, is primarily due to the delay in reporting of
catastrophe losses by the London insurance market, coupled with the
unprecedented number of catastrophes during the period in which the Company
underwrote this business. This business is also substantially reinsured, thereby
not having a material effect on the Company's net earnings. The Company
continues to believe it has materially provided for all net incurred losses.
 
    Compensation expense increased $7.5 million or 20% in 1997, to $44.6 million
due to the increase in personnel resulting from acquisitions completed during
1997, along with an increase in management personnel hired to oversee the
integration of the Company's many acquisitions.
 
    Other operating expense increased 20% to $31.0 million in 1997. These
expenses reflect increased expenditures required to meet the overall growth in
business and from acquisitions. Currency conversion losses amounted to $884,000
in 1997, compared to losses of $181,000 in 1996.
 
    Merger expense represents non-recurring items incurred to consummate the
acquisitions and mergers which are accounted for as poolings-of interests. The
amounts incurred during 1996 were due to the combination with LDG and included a
compensatory stock grant of $24.0 million to certain key LDG
 
                                       30
<PAGE>
employees immediately prior to the merger. The amounts incurred during 1997 were
due to the combinations with AVEMCO, Interworld and Southern.
 
    The 1996 and prior financial statements of AVEMCO were restated prior to
their combinations with those of the Company. See Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for the reasons for and the effects of this restatement.
 
    Interest expense during 1997 increased 20% to $6.0 million from $5.0 million
during 1996 due to the increased level of indebtedness primarily to fund the
cash portion of acquisitions.
 
    Income tax expense was $23.3 million in 1997, compared to $9.9 million in
1996. The 1996 amount included a deferred tax benefit of $9.6 million which was
recorded in connection with the compensatory stock grant to certain key LDG
employees. The compensation expense was a non-cash item; however, $9.6 million
of actual cash tax savings will be recognized beginning from the grant date.
Most of the other merger expenses are not deductible for income tax purposes.
Also, as an S Corporation, LDG was exempt from Federal income taxes through May
21, 1996. Had LDG been subject to Federal income tax during the period January
1, 1996 to May 21, 1996, additional income tax expense of $2.3 million would
have been recorded in 1996.
 
    Net earnings increased 29% to $49.8 million in 1997 from $38.5 million in
1996. Diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $1.07 in 1997 from $0.87 in
1996.
 
    The Company's insurance company subsidiaries' statutory combined ratio was
78.8% for 1997 compared to 83.6% in 1996. The Company's combined ratio remains
significantly better than the industry average.
 
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 VERSUS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995
 
    Total revenue during 1996 increased 16% to $270.4 million from $234.0
million in 1995. 1996 GWP decreased to $337.3 million from $339.1 million in
1995, while NWP increased from $184.3 million in 1995 to $188.3 million in 1996.
The decrease in written premium was a result of the planned exit from the
offshore energy business as a result of increased competition that has driven
rates below acceptable levels, as well as the softening in marine rates and,
more recently, property rates. Net earned premium in 1996 increased from $159.6
million to $175.3 million, reflecting the large increase in written premium
during 1995.
 
    Management fee and commission income in 1996 increased 20% to $51.4 million
from $42.8 million in 1995, reflecting internal growth. Net investment income
increased 8% to $23.6 million in 1996 from $21.7 million in 1995 reflecting a
higher level of investment assets.
 
    Realized investment gains from sales of marketable equity securities were
$8.3 million during 1996 compared to $1.3 million during 1995. Realized
investment gains from dispositions of fixed income securities were $29,000
during 1996, compared to gains of $371,000 during 1995. During 1996, the Company
liquidated most of its equity security portfolio and re-deployed those
investment assets into fixed income securities. During 1996, AVEMCO consummated
the sale of National Assurance Underwriters, Inc., which was a subsidiary of
AVEMCO prior to the pooling-of-interests combination with the Company. This sale
generated an after tax gain of $2.2 million or $0.05 per share.
 
    Loss and LAE increased $9.1 million in 1996, to $114.5 million, reflecting
the overall increase in business. During 1996, the Company had net loss and LAE
redundancy of $4.9 million relating to prior year losses compared to a
redundancy of $2.8 million in 1995. During 1996, the Company had gross loss and
LAE deficiency of $42.5 million compared to a deficiency of $15.9 million in
1995. The gross deficiency comes from two primary sources. Firstly, the
development of several large claims on individual policies which were either
reported late or reserves were increased as subsequent information became
available, however, as most of these policies were substantially reinsured,
there is no material effect to the
 
                                       31
<PAGE>
Company's net earnings. Secondly, is the run-off of the retrocessional excess of
loss business which the Company underwrote between 1988 and 1991. This
development, $11.3 million in 1996 compared to $9.8 million in 1995, is due to
the delay in reporting of catastrophe losses by the London insurance market,
coupled with the unprecedented number of catastrophes during the period in which
the Company underwrote this business. This business is also substantially
reinsured, thereby not having a material effect on the Company's net earnings.
The Company continues to believe it has materially provided for all net incurred
losses.
 
    Compensation expense decreased $6.0 million or 14% in 1996, to $37.1 million
due primarily to changes in compensation to LDG's previous principal
shareholders.
 
    Merger expense represents non-recurring items incurred to consummate the
acquisitions and mergers which are accounted for as poolings-of-interests. The
amounts incurred during 1996 were due to the combination with LDG and included a
compensatory stock grant of $24.0 million to certain key LDG employees
immediately prior to the Company's May, 1996 merger with LDG.
 
    The 1996 and prior financial statements of AVEMCO were restated prior to
their combinations with those of the Company. See Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for the reasons for and the effects of this restatement.
 
    Interest expense during 1996 decreased 23% to $5.0 million from $6.5 million
during 1995 due to the reduced level of indebtedness as a portion of the
proceeds of a June, 1995, public offering of Common Stock which was used to
retire debt.
 
    Income tax expense remained unchanged at $9.9 million in 1996, compared to
1995 despite higher pretax income in 1996. This was a result of a deferred tax
benefit of $9.6 million which was recorded in connection with the compensatory
stock grant to certain LDG employees. The compensation expense was a non-cash
item; however, $9.6 million of actual cash tax savings will be recognized
beginning from the grant date. Also, as an S corporation, LDG was exempt from
Federal income taxes through May 21, 1996. Had LDG been subject to Federal
income taxes for both years, additional income tax expense of $2.3 million and
$722,000 would have been recorded during the years ended December 31, 1996 and
1995, respectively.
 
    Net earnings increased 22% to $38.5 million in 1996 from $31.7 million in
1995. Diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $0.87 in 1996 from $0.76 in
1995.
 
    The Company's insurance company subsidiaries' statutory combined ratio was
83.6% for 1996 compared to 84.5% in 1995. The Company's combined ratio remains
significantly better than the industry average.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
    HCC completed an initial public offering of 1,437,500 shares of Common Stock
during October, 1992 and secondary public offerings of 1,254,200 shares of
Common Stock in September, 1993 and 2,012,500 shares of Common Stock in June,
1995. The offerings significantly improved the capital resources of the Company.
The net proceeds of the offerings have been used to reduce the Company's
indebtedness and to contribute capital to its insurance company subsidiaries. HC
now has more than $233.0 million in policyholders' surplus. This additional
capital enables HC to write significantly more premium and to have sufficient
financial size and strength to operate in the current insurance industry
environment.
 
    The Company receives substantial cash from premiums and reinsurance
recoverables, and, to a lesser extent, investment income, proceeds from sales
and redemptions of investment assets and management fee and commission income.
The principal cash outflows are for the payment of claims and LAE, payment of
premiums to reinsurers, purchase of investments, debt service, policy
acquisition costs, operating expenses, income and other taxes and dividends.
 
                                       32
<PAGE>
    During 1997, HC renewed its existing credit facility (the "HC Facility")
which provides for a $12.0 million bank line of credit for the issuance of
letters of credit and for short-term borrowings at the prime rate of interest.
The HC Facility is collateralized by securities with a market value equal to
125% of the total sum of the letters of credit issued and cash advances
outstanding. The HC Facility matures on April 30, 1998. As of December 31, 1997,
letters of credit in the amount of $10.3 million were issued on behalf of HC to
collateralize certain reinsurance obligations.
 
    Effective December 30, 1997, the Company executed a $120.0 million revolving
credit facility (the "Facility") with a group of banks. Borrowings under the
Facility may be made by the Company until the expiration of the Facility on
December 30, 1999, at which time all principal is due. Outstanding loans under
the Facility bear interest at the Company's option at either the prime rate
(8 1/2% at December 31, 1997) or at the current London Interbank Offering Rate
("LIBOR") (5.72% at December 31, 1997) plus 1%. The Facility is collateralized
by the common stock of HC and AIC. The agreement contains restrictive covenants,
including without limitation, minimum net worth requirements for the Company and
certain subsidiaries, restrictions on certain extraordinary corporate actions,
notice requirements for certain material occurences and required maintenance of
specified financial ratios. The initial funding from the Facility was used,
among other things, to refinance HCC's then existing outstanding loans.
 
    The Company maintains a substantial level of cash and liquid short-term
investments which are used to meet anticipated payment obligations. As of
December 31, 1997, the Company had cash and short-term investments of
approximately $112.6 million. The Company's consolidated investment portfolio of
$523.3 million as of December 31, 1997 (of which $105.3 million is short-term
investments), is available to provide additional liquidity and cash for
operations.
 
    Property and casualty insurance companies domiciled in the State of Texas
are limited in the payment of dividends to their shareholders in any 12 month
period, without the prior written consent of the Commissioner of Insurance, to
the greater of net investment income or 10% of statutory policyholders' surplus.
HC paid no dividends in 1997 to HCC. During 1998, HC's ordinary dividend
capacity will be approximately $23.3 million.
 
    The Company believes that its operating cash flows, short-term investments
and the bank lines of credit will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to
meet its anticipated needs for the foreseeable future.
 
    At December 31, 1997, the Company had a net deferred tax asset of $6.6
million compared to $12.6 million at December 31, 1996. Due to the Company's
history of consistent earnings, strong operating cash flows and expectations for
the future, it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to realize
the benefit of its deferred tax asset.
 
    As of December 31, 1997, the domestic insurance company subsidiaries' total
adjusted capital is significantly in excess of the NAIC authorized control level
risk-based capital.
 
    Industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that a property and casualty
insurer's annual statutory GWP should not exceed 900% of its statutory
policyholders' surplus and NWP should not exceed 300% of its statutory
policyholders' surplus. The Company's insurance company subsidiaries maintain a
premium to surplus ratio significantly lower than such guidelines, and for the
year ended December 31, 1997, their annual statutory GWP was 104.3% of their
statutory policyholders' surplus and their NWP was 43.1% of their statutory
policyholders' surplus.
 
IMPACT OF INFLATION
 
    The Company's operations, like those of other property and casualty
insurers, are susceptible to the effects of inflation, as premiums are
established before the ultimate amounts of loss and LAE are known. Although
management considers the potential effects of inflation when setting premium
rates for competitive reasons, such premiums may not adequately compensate the
Company for the effects of inflation. However, as the majority of the Company's
business is comprised of lines which have short lead times
 
                                       33
<PAGE>
between the occurrence of an insured event, reporting of the claims to the
Company and the final settlement of the claims, the effects of inflation are
minimized.
 
    A significant portion of the Company's revenue is related to healthcare
insurance and reinsurance products which are subject to the effects of the
underlying inflation of medical costs. Such inflation in the costs of healthcare
tends to generate increases in premiums for medical stop-loss coverage,
resulting in greater revenue, but also higher claim payments. Inflation may have
a negative impact on insurance and reinsurance operations by causing higher
claim settlements than may originally have been estimated without an immediate
increase in premiums to a level necessary to maintain profit margins. No express
provision for inflation is made, although trends are considered when setting
underwriting terms and claim reserves. Claim reserves are subject to a
continuing review process to assess their adequacy and are adjusted as deemed
appropriate. In addition, the market value of the investments held by the
Company varies depending on economic and market conditions and interest rates,
which are highly sensitive to the policies of governmental and regulatory
authorities. Any significant increase in interest rates could therefore have a
material adverse effect on the market value of the Company's investments.
 
EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS
 
    The Company underwrites risks which are denominated in a number of foreign
currencies. It establishes and maintains loss reserves with respect to these
policies in their respective currencies. These reserves are subject to exchange
rate fluctuations which can have an effect on the Company's net earnings. The
Company's principal area of exposure is with respect to fluctuation in the
exchange rate between the major European currencies and the United States
Dollar. For the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, the loss from
currency conversion was $884,000, $181,000 and $209,000, respectively.
 
    From time to time the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts
as a hedge against foreign currency fluctuations, primarily GBP. The Company's
balances denominated in foreign currencies fluctuate as transactions are
recorded and settled. During 1997, the average GBP liability, for subsidiaries
whose functional currency was the United States dollar, was approximately
L793,000 ($1.3 million at the December 31, 1997, rate of exchange) which was
hedged by an average open forward contract balance of approximately L125,000
($206,000 at the December 31, 1997, rate of exchange). There were no open
foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 1997. The Company may
continue to limit its exposure to currency fluctuations through the use of
foreign currency forward contracts.
 
    The Company utilizes these foreign currency forward contracts strictly as a
hedge against existing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and it does not
do so as any form of speculative or trading investment.
 
EFFECTS OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
    In June, 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 130
"Reporting Comprehensive Income" and SFAS No. 131 "Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information". Both statements are effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 1997. These SFAS's require that additional
information be included in a complete set of financial statements, but will have
no effect on the Company's net earnings, shareholders' equity or cash flows. The
Company does not expect to change its definition of segments when SFAS No. 131
is adopted.
 
YEAR 2000
 
    The Year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs being written using
two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year. If not
corrected, computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at
the Year 2000.
 
    The Company, together with outside vendors engaged by the Company, has made
assessments of the Company's potential Year 2000 exposure. The Company believes
that with modifications to existing
 
                                       34
<PAGE>
software and in connection with planned conversions to new software, the Year
2000 issue will be mitigated. The Company has implemented a plan to mitigate its
Year 2000 exposure, including the identification, selection and implementation
of a new Year 2000 compliant software system at an insurance company subsidiary.
Management believes that the plan is progressing such that Year 2000 exposures
will be mitigated prior to any critical date and by October, 1998 with respect
to the insurance company subsidiary where the Company's major Year 2000 risk
exists.
 
    The Company is utilizing and will continue to utilize both internal and
external resources to reprogram or replace its computer systems such that the
reprogrammed or new systems will cause the Company to be Year 2000 compliant in
advance of respective critical dates. The total estimated remaining cost of
modification of existing software and new Year 2000 compliant systems is
$4,600,000 which includes, $4,400,000 attributable to the planned purchase and
implementation of new systems, principally to replace the above mentioned
insurance company subsidiary's system. The cost of this new software will be
capitalized. The remaining estimated cost of $200,000 will be expensed as
incurred over the next two years. The level of expense is not expected to have a
material effect on results of operations. The cost of modification of existing
systems to become Year 2000 compliant and of the new Year 2000 compliant
software is to be funded out of operating cash flow, which is sufficient to
provide the funding. The cost estimates are management's best estimates based
upon assumed future events which could change.
 
    In 1997, the Company expensed $11,000 with respect to Year 2000 compliance
and capitalized $550,000 with respect to new Year 2000 compliant software
purchases and installations. The Company does not believe that it has
significant Year 2000 exposure with respect to its vendors and the Company's
software vendor subsidiary's products are Year 2000 compliant.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc.
 
    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HCC
Insurance Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and
the related consolidated statements of earnings, changes in shareholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1997. These financial statements are the responsibility of HCC Insurance
Holdings, Inc.'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the 1996 and
1995 consolidated financial statements of AVEMCO Corporation, which statements
reflect total revenues constituting 43.7 percent and 45.6 percent and net
earnings constituting 24.0 percent and 23.2 percent of the related consolidated
financial statements totals for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose report dated
January 31, 1997 except for Note 12 of which the date is February 28, 1997 and
except for Note 14 of which the date is February 18, 1998, has been furnished to
us, and our opinion, insofar as it related to data included for 1996 and 1995 is
based solely on the report of the other auditors.
 
    We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
    In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors,
the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of HCC Insurance
Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

The Board of Directors and Shareholder
AVEMCO Corporation:
 
    We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of AVEMCO Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the
two-year period ended December 31, 1996 (not included separately herein). These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
 
    We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AVMECO
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period
ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

                 HCC INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
 
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
(1) GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES
 
    HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "the
Company" or "HCC"), include domestic and foreign property and casualty insurance
companies and managing general agents, surplus lines insurance brokers and
wholesale insurance and reinsurance brokers. HCC, through its subsidiaries,
provides specialized property and casualty insurance to commercial customers
worldwide, underwritten on both a direct and reinsurance basis, in the areas of
aviation, marine, property, offshore energy, accident and health, and lenders
single interest. The principal insurance company subsidiaries are Houston
Casualty Company ("HC"), U.S. Specialty Insurance Company ("USSIC"), Trafalgar
Insurance Company ("TIC") in Houston, Texas and AVEMCO Insurance Company ("AIC")
in Frederick, Maryland. The agency subsidiaries provide underwriting management
and intermediary services for insurance and reinsurance companies, primarily in
the accident and health and aviation areas, but also in the same lines of
business that the insurance subsidiaries operate. The principal agency
subsidiaries are LDG Management Company Incorporated ("LDG") in Wakefield,
Massachusetts; Aviation and Marine Insurance Group ("AMIG" formerly Interworld
Corporation) in Dallas, Texas; HCC Underwriters, A Texas Corporation ("HCCU") in
Houston, Texas; North American Special Risk Associates, Inc. ("NASRA") in
Northbrook, Illinois and Middle East Insurance Brokers, Ltd. ("MEIB") in Amman,
Jordan.
 
    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates
and assumptions. This affects amounts reported in the financial statements and
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
 
    A description of the significant accounting and reporting policies utilized
by the Company in preparing the consolidated financial statements is as follows:
 
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
 
    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The business combinations
with AVEMCO Corporation ("AVEMCO"), LDG, NASRA, Interworld and Southern Aviation
Insurance Underwriters, Inc. ("Southern") have been recorded as
poolings-of-interests. The Company's financial statements have been restated to
include the accounts and operations of AVEMCO and LDG for all periods presented.
The financial statements have not been restated to include Interworld, Southern
and NASRA due to immateriality. (See Note 2.)
 
INVESTMENTS
 
    Fixed income securities and marketable equity securities are classified as
available for sale and are carried at quoted market value, if readily
marketable, or at management's estimated fair value, if not readily marketable.
The change in unrealized gain or loss with respect to these securities is
recorded as a direct increase or decrease to shareholders' equity, net of
related deferred income tax, if any. Fixed income securities available for sale
are purchased with the original intent to hold to maturity, but they may be
available for sale if market conditions warrant, or if the Company's investment
policies dictate, in order to maximize the Company's investment yield.
Short-term investments and restricted short-term investments are carried at cost
which approximates market value.
 
    The realized gain or loss on investment transactions is determined on an
average cost basis and included in earnings on the trade date. When impairment
of the value of an investment is considered other

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
(1) GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES
(CONTINUED)
than temporary, the decrease in value is reported in earnings as a realized
investment loss and a new cost basis is established.
 
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
 
    Property and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation expense is provided using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets. Amortization of leasehold
improvements is provided using the straight-line method over the term of the
respective lease. Upon disposal of assets, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is
included in earnings.
 
    Costs incurred in developing or purchasing management information systems
are capitalized and included in property and equipment. These costs are
amortized over their estimated useful lives from the dates the systems are
placed in service.
 
EARNED PREMIUM, DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS AND CEDING COMMISSIONS OF
  INSURANCE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES
 
    Written premium, net of reinsurance, is generally included in earnings on a
PRO RATA basis over the lives of the related policies. Policy acquisition costs,
including commissions, taxes, fees and other direct costs of underwriting
policies, and ceding commissions allowed by reinsurers, including expense
allowances, are deferred and charged or credited to earnings generally on a pro
rata basis as the premium is earned. Historical and current loss and loss
adjustment expense experience are considered in determining the recoverability
of deferred policy acquisition costs.
 
MANAGEMENT FEE AND COMMISSION INCOME
 
    Management fee and commission income is recognized on the revenue
recognition date, which is the later of the effective date of the policy, the
date when the premium can be reasonably estimated, or the date when
substantially all required services relating to the insurance placement have
been rendered to the client. Commission income relating to additional or return
premiums or other policy adjustments is recognized when the events occur and the
amounts become known or can be estimated.
 
PREMIUM AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
 
    The Company has adopted the gross method for reporting receivables and
payables on brokered transactions. Management reviews the collectibility of its
receivables on a current basis and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts
if it deems that there are accounts which are doubtful of collection. The amount
of the allowance at December 31, 1997 and 1996, is not material.
 
LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYABLE OF INSURANCE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES
 
    Loss and loss adjustment expense payable is based on undiscounted estimates
of payments to be made for reported and incurred but not reported ("IBNR")
losses, net of reinsurance and anticipated salvage and subrogation receipts.
Estimates for reported losses are based on all available information, including
reports received from ceding companies on assumed business. Estimates for IBNR
are based both on the Company's and the industry's experience. While management
believes that amounts included in the
 
                                      F-10

(CONTINUED)
accompanying financial statements are adequate, such estimates may be more or
less than the amounts ultimately paid when the claims are settled. The estimates
are continually reviewed and any changes are reflected in current operations.
 
REINSURANCE
 
    The Company records all reinsurance recoverables and ceded unearned premiums
as assets and deferred ceding commissions as a liability. All such amounts are
estimated and recorded in a manner consistent with the underlying reinsured
contracts. Management has recorded a reserve for uncollectible reinsurance based
on estimates of collectibility.
 
GOODWILL
 
    In connection with the Company's acquisitions of subsidiaries accounted for
as purchases, the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired is being
amortized using the straight-line method principally over twenty years for
acquired agency operations and forty years for acquired insurance company
operations. Managements of the acquired businesses have successfully operated in
the Company's markets for a number of years and, with the additional capital
provided by the Company, will be positioned to take advantage of increased
opportunities.
 
    The Company has no reason to expect major changes in the business conditions
in which the acquired companies operate which might affect the recoverability of
the recorded intangibles. However, in the event business conditions change, the
recoverability will be re-evaluated based upon revised projections of future
undiscounted operating income and cash flows and, if impaired, the balances will
be adjusted accordingly. Amortization charged to income for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, was $1.6 million, $684,000 and $672,000,
respectively.
 
CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
 
    Cash consists of cash in banks, generally in operating accounts. The Company
classifies certificates of deposit, corporate demand notes receivable,
commercial paper and money market funds as short-term investments. Short-term
investments are classified as investments in the consolidated balance sheets as
they relate principally to the Company's investment activities.
 
    In 1997, in connection with the acquisition of AVEMCO in a transaction
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests, the Company conformed its accounting
policies between itself and AVEMCO such that changes in cash flows from
operating, investing and financing activities are reconciled to the change in
cash in the consolidated statements of cash flows. In prior years, the Company
reconciled to the change in cash and short-term investments. Management now
deems its consolidated short-term investing to be predominately an investing
activity, not a cash management activity. Accordingly, short-term investments
are now classified as investments in the consolidated balance sheets rather than
with cash. The conforming change was made retroactively and had the effect of
increasing (decreasing) cash utilized in investing activities and (increasing)
decreasing the change in cash by ($3.4 million) and $10.8 million in 1996 and
1995, respectively, in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The conformity
change had no effect on the results of operations or shareholders' equity.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
(1) GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES
(CONTINUED)
    The Company generally maintains its cash deposits in major banks and invests
its excess cash with major banks and in investment grade commercial papers and
repurchase agreements. These securities typically mature within 90 days and,
therefore, bear minimal risk. The Company has not experienced any losses on its
cash deposits or its short-term investments.
 
RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH INVESTMENTS
 
    In conjunction with the management of reinsurance pools, the Company's
agency subsidiaries withhold premium funds for the payment of claims. These
funds are shown as restricted cash and cash investments on the consolidated
balance sheets. The corresponding liability is included within premium and
claims payable in the consolidated balance sheets. These amounts are considered
fiduciary funds, and interest earned on these funds accrues to the benefit of
the members of the reinsurance pools. Therefore, the Company does not include
these amounts as cash or cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash
flows.
 
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
 
    The functional currency of most foreign subsidiaries is the United States
dollar. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated
into United States dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet
date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange
in effect on the date the transaction occurs. The Company's foreign currency
transactions are principally denominated in British Pound Sterling ("GBP") and
other European currencies. From time to time the Company enters into foreign
currency forward contracts as a hedge against foreign currency fluctuations.
Gains or losses in the market value of foreign currency forward contracts are
recognized in the statements of earnings concurrently with the gains and losses
on the hedged balances. For the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,
the loss from currency conversion was $884,000, $181,000 and $209,000,
respectively.
 
    Some foreign subsidiaries or branches have a functional currency of either
the GBP or the Canadian Dollar ("CAD"). Cumulative translation adjustment,
representing the effect of translating these subsidiaries' or branches' assets
and liabilities into United States dollars is included in the foreign currency
translation adjustment within shareholders' equity.
 
COMPUTER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
    Revenue from custom software products is recognized using the percentage of
completion method of accounting. Other software contracts are recognized when
delivery has occurred, other remaining vendor obligations are no longer
significant, and collectibility is probable. Revenue from the sale of computer
hardware is recognized when delivery has occurred. Maintenance support is
recognized PRO RATA over the term of the maintenance agreement.
 
INCOME TAX
 
    The domestic companies and the foreign insurance company subsidiaries (which
have all elected to be taxed as domestic companies) file a single consolidated
Federal income tax return and include the foreign subsidiaries' income to the
extent required by law. Deferred income tax is accounted for using the liability
method, which reflects the tax impact of temporary differences between the bases
of assets and liabilities

for financial reporting purposes and such bases as measured by tax laws and
regulations. LDG was an S Corporation prior to its reorganization and merger
with the Company. Therefore, Federal income tax expense was not provided for
LDG's earnings until the S Corporation election was terminated on May 22, 1996.
 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
    In December, 1997, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 128. Earnings per share have been restated for all
periods presented. Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the year divided into net earnings.
Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding plus the potential common shares outstanding during the year
divided into net earnings. The shares issued in connection with the combinations
with AVEMCO and LDG are included in outstanding shares for all periods
presented. Outstanding common stock options, when dilutive, are considered to be
potential common stock for the purpose of the diluted calculation. The treasury
stock method is used to calculate potential common stock due to options.
 
STOCK SPLIT
 
    In April, 1996, the Board of Directors declared a five-for-two stock split
in the form of a 150% stock dividend on the Company's $1.00 par value Common
Stock, payable to shareholders of record April 30, 1996. The par value of the
Company's Common Stock remains unchanged. All per share, weighted average shares
outstanding and option data presented in the consolidated financial statements
and the notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effect of
the split.
 
PRIOR PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS OF AVEMCO
 
    The 1996 and prior financial statements of AVEMCO, which was acquired in
1997 in a transaction accounted for as a pooling-of-interests (See Note 2), have
been restated prior to their inclusion in the Company's historical consolidated
financial statements to reflect certain prior period adjustments discovered in
1997. The adjustments were for periods prior to HCC's ownership and relate to a
restatement of the method of accounting for certain short-duration insurance
contracts and to the correction of accounting errors. The adjustment had the
following effects with respect to amounts previously reported in AVEMCO's 1996
and prior consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31,
1996 and 1995:

    AVEMCO's retained earnings as of December 31, 1994 was decreased by
$1,226,000, net of a $233,000 tax effect, as a result of the adjustments. These
adjustments decreased the Company's basic and diluted earnings per share by
$0.07 and $0.01 for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
 
EFFECTS OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
    In June, 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 130
"Reporting Comprehensive Income" and SFAS No. 131 "Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information". Both statements are effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 1997. These SFAS's require that additional
information be included in a complete set of financial statements, but will have
no effect on the Company's net earnings, shareholders' equity or cash flows. The
Company does not expect to change its definition of segments when SFAS No. 131
is adopted.
 
RECLASSIFICATIONS
 
    Certain amounts in the 1996 and 1995 consolidated financial statements have
been reclassified to conform with the 1997 presentation. Such reclassifications
had no effect on the Company's shareholders' equity, net earnings or cash flows,
except for the conforming change in cash and short-term investments which
affected the classification of cash flows.
 
(2) ACQUISITIONS
 
LDG
 
    On May 24, 1996, the Company issued 6,250,000 shares of its Common Stock to
acquire all of the outstanding common stock of LDG. The former majority
shareholder of LDG is a director of the Company. This business combination has
been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. The Company's consolidated
financial statements have been restated to include the accounts and operations
of LDG for all periods presented.
 
NASRA
 
    On November 27, 1996, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
NASRA by issuing 1,136,400 shares of its Common Stock and a payment of $1.7
million in cash to one dissenting shareholder. This combination has been
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. However, the Company's consolidated
financial statements have not been restated due to immateriality.
 
TRM
 
    On January 24, 1997, the Company acquired all of the occupational accident
business of the TRM International, Inc. group of companies in exchange for
266,667 shares of the Company's Common Stock and $6.6 million in cash. This
acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and results of operations of
the business acquired have been included in the consolidated statements of
earnings beginning in January, 1997. Cost in excess of net assets acquired
(goodwill) of approximately $13.5 million was recorded from this acquisition.
Goodwill is being amortized over twenty years. The results of operations of TRM
for the periods prior to the acquisition are immaterial to the Company's
consolidated results of operations.

INTERWORLD
 
    On April 30, 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
Interworld Corporation in exchange for 725,000 shares of the Company's Common
Stock. This combination has been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.
However, the Company's consolidated financial statements have not been restated
due to immateriality.
 
AVEMCO
 
    On June 17, 1997, the Company issued 8,511,625 shares of its Common Stock
and 604,575 options to purchase its Common Stock to acquire all of the
outstanding common stock and options of AVEMCO. This business combination has
been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests and, accordingly, the Company's
consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the accounts and
operations of AVEMCO for all periods presented.

    The first note was payable to a bank in quarterly installments of $1.5
million plus interest increasing to quarterly installments of $1.8 million plus
interest as of October 1, 1997. Interest was payable quarterly at the prime
rate. During February, 1994, the first note was amended changing the interest
rate to a fixed rate of 6 1/2% until February 7, 1997. The rate reverted back to
the prime rate after such date or could be set at London Interbank Offering Rate
("LIBOR") plus 2 1/4% at the Company's discretion. The note was collateralized
by all of the Common Stock of HC. The loan agreement contained certain
restrictive covenants, including restrictions on certain transactions in the
Company's capital stock or the capital stock of HC and the maintenance of
required financial ratios.
 
    The second note represented a $10.0 million unsecured five-year term loan
with a bank. The loan was being repaid in 60 monthly principal installments of
$166,667, plus interest. Interest was payable on a fluctuating basis equal to
LIBOR plus 1.65%.
 
    The outstanding advance at December 31, 1996, on the line of credit, was
owed to a bank that allowed AVEMCO to borrow up to $60.0 million through April
30, 1997. Interest was payable at the lower of the bank's floating prime rate or
the daily LIBOR plus 1.45%. The Company also had the option, at any time, to
convert any portion of the outstanding principal balance of the loan into term
notes, which could be amortized over any period not to extend beyond December
31, 2000. The line of credit facility required AVEMCO to maintain a consolidated
net worth, as defined, of $48.9 million. Other covenants provided for

certain limitations on AVEMCO's liability to net worth ratio, cash flow to
current portion of long term debt, the acquisition, disposition and pledging of
assets, incurring of indebtedness, and required its insurance subsidiary to
maintain a certain statutory policyholders' surplus and net premium written to
policyholders' surplus ratio.
 
    All of the above notes were repaid during 1997. Effective December 30, 1997,
the Company executed a $120.0 million revolving credit facility ("Facility")
with a group of banks. Borrowing under the Facility may be made by the Company
until the expiration of the Facility on December 30, 1999, at which time all
principal is due. Outstanding loans under the Facility bear interest at the
Company's option of either the prime rate (8 1/2% at December 31, 1997) or at
the current London Interbank Offering Rate ("LIBOR") (5.72% at December 31,
1997) plus 1%. The loan is collateralized in part by the common stock of HC and
AIC. The agreement contains restrictive covenants, including minimum net worth
requirements for the Company and certain subsidiaries, restrictions on certain
extraordinary corporate actions, notice requirements for certain material
occurrences and the maintenance of required financial ratios. The initial
funding from the Facility was used, among other things, to refinance the then
existing outstanding loans.
 
    At December 31, 1997, HC maintained a revolving line of credit with a bank
in the maximum amount of $12.0 million available through April 30, 1998.
Advances under the line of credit are limited to amounts required to fund draws,
if any, on letters of credit issued by the bank on behalf of HC and short-term
direct cash advances. The line of credit is collateralized by securities having
an aggregate market value of up to $15.0 million, the actual amount of
collateral at any one time being 125% of the aggregate amount outstanding.
Interest on the line is payable at the bank's prime rate of interest (8 1/2% at
December 31, 1997). At December 31, 1997, letters of credit totaling $10.3
million had been issued to insurance companies by the bank on behalf of HC, with
total securities collateralizing the line of $12.9 million.
 
(6) INCOME TAX
 
    Several of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are not subject to foreign
income taxes and no material foreign income tax expense was incurred for the
three years ended December 31, 1997. United States Federal income taxes are
provided on all foreign earnings. As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company
had income taxes receivable (payable) of $3.7 million and ($1.3 million),
respectively. For Federal income tax purposes, LDG has approximately $11.4
million of net operating loss carry forwards which will expire in the year 2010.

(8)  REINSURANCE
 
    In the normal course of business the Company's insurance company
subsidiaries cede a substantial portion of their premium to non-affiliated
domestic and foreign reinsurers through quota share, surplus, excess of loss and
facultative reinsurance agreements. Although the ceding of reinsurance does not
discharge the primary insurer from liability to its policyholder, the
subsidiaries participate in such agreements for the purpose of limiting their
loss exposure and diversifying their business. Substantially all of the
reinsurance assumed by the Company's insurance company subsidiaries was
underwritten directly by the Company but issued by other non-affiliated
companies in order to satisfy local licensing or other requirements. The
following table represents the effect of such reinsurance transactions on net
premium and loss and loss adjustment expense:

    The insurance company subsidiaries require reinsurers not authorized by
their respective states of domicile to collateralize their reinsurance
obligations to the Company with letters of credit or cash deposits. At December
31, 1997, the Company held letters of credit and cash deposits in the amounts of
$93.9 million and $8.6 million, respectively, to collateralize certain
reinsurance balances. The Company has established a reserve of $2.5 million as
of December 31, 1997, to reduce the effects of any recoverable problem.
 
    In order to minimize its exposure to reinsurance credit risk, the Company
evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and places its reinsurance
with a diverse group of financially sound companies. The following table shows
reinsurance balances relating to the reinsurers with a total recoverable balance
greater than $10.0 million and the collateral and potential offsets held by the
Company as of each year end:

involved in a dispute with two reinsurers over coverage and other issues. The
Company believes the reinsurers' positions are without merit and all amounts due
from the reinsurers will be recovered. The total amount in dispute is
approximately $3.5 million.
 
(9)  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
LITIGATION
 
    The Company is a party to numerous lawsuits arising in the normal course of
business. Many of the pending lawsuits involve claims under policies
underwritten or reinsured by the Company, which management believes have been
adequately included in its established loss reserves. The Company believes the
resolution of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 
FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS
 
    From time to time the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts
as a hedge against foreign currency fluctuations, primarily GBP. The Company's
balances denominated in foreign currency fluctuate as transactions are recorded
and settled. During 1997, the average GBP liability, for subsidiaries whose
functional currency was the United States dollar, was approximately L793,000
($1.3 million at the December 31, 1997, rate of exchange) which was hedged by an
average open forward contract balance of approximately L125,000 ($206,000 at the
December 31, 1997, rate of exchange). There are no open foreign currency forward
contracts as of December 31, 1997. The Company may continue to limit its
exposure to currency fluctuations through the use of foreign currency forward
contracts.
 
    The Company utilizes these foreign currency forward contracts strictly as a
hedge against existing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and it does not
do so as any form of speculative or trading investment.
 
LEASES
 
    The Company leases administrative office facilities under long-term
non-cancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through
November, 2005. The agreements generally require the payment of utilities, real
estate taxes, insurance and repairs. The Company has recognized rent expense on
a straight-line basis over the terms of these leases. In addition, the Company
leases computer equipment and automobiles under operating leases expiring at
various dates through the year 2002. Rent expense under these leases amounted to
$3.7 million, $2.5 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31,
1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

SYSTEMS SOFTWARE
 
    The Company is committed to purchase and install major new systems software,
principally at its insurance company subsidiaries, in 1998. The approximate cost
of that software is $4.4 million.
 
CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE
 
    The Company writes business in areas exposed to catastrophic losses and has
significant exposures to this type of loss in California, the Atlantic Coast of
the United States, certain United States Gulf Coast states, particularly Florida
and Texas, the Caribbean and Mexico. The Company carefully assesses its overall
exposures to a single catastrophic event and applies procedures that it believes
are more conservative than are typically used by the industry to ascertain the
Company's probable maximum loss ("PML") from any single event. The Company
maintains reinsurance protection which it believes is sufficient to cover any
foreseeable event.

    During 1995, $63,000 was paid to a related party for construction management
services related to improvements to the Company's offices in Houston, Texas.
During 1997, the Company committed to invest $5.0 million in an investment
partnership managed by a related party. At December 31, 1997, no amount had been
invested under this commitment.
 
(11)  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
 
    The Company has defined contribution retirement plans under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code which cover substantially all of the domestic
employees who meet specified service requirements. The Company's contributions
of these plans are based on varying percentages of the employees' contributions,
up to varying maximum levels. The Company contributed $858,000, $997,000 and
$1,113,000 to the plans for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively, which is included in compensation expense in the accompanying
consolidated statements of earnings.
 
    AVEMCO had a non-contributory defined benefit retirement plan covering
substantially all of its employees who met specified age and service
requirements. Benefits were based on years of service and final average
compensation and were integrated with the provisions of the Federal Insurance
Compensation Act (Social Security), as provided for in the plan. Pension plan
assets are a diversified mix of stock and bond mutual funds. AVEMCO's funding
policy was to contribute amounts that met minimum funding requirements, but
which did not exceed the maximum funding limits as currently determined under
applicable tax regulations. This plan was terminated at December 31, 1997, at
which time the participants' accounts became fully vested. At December 31, 1997,
the vested benefits, calculated utilizing an interest rate of 7.25%, amounted to
$6.0 million and the fair value of the assets of the plan was $8.1 million. In
accordance with applicable regulations, the plan's assets will be distributed to
participants during 1998. The Company is not obligated for contributions to the
plan subsequent to December 31, 1997. It is expected that the assets of the plan
will be sufficient to cover the vested benefits which are to be paid to the
participants.
 
    Total pension expense (credit) under the AVEMCO plan amounted to $0,
($590,000), and $512,000 for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. A curtailment gain of $1,044,000 was recognized in the 1996
pension credit as a result of AVEMCO's decision to eliminate certain future
service time credits.

(12)  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
 
    Under the Texas Insurance Code, HC must maintain minimum statutory capital
of $1,000,000 and minimum statutory surplus of $1,000,000, and can only pay
dividends out of surplus funds. In addition, HC is limited in the amount of
dividends which it may pay in any twelve month period, without prior regulatory
approval, to the greater of statutory net investment income for the prior
calendar year or ten percent (10%) of statutory capital and surplus as of the
prior calendar year end. During 1998, HC's ordinary dividend capacity will be
approximately $23.3 million.
 
    AIC is limited by the state of Maryland in the amount of dividends which it
may pay in any twelve month period, without prior regulatory approval, to the
greater of statutory net income for the prior calendar year or ten percent (10%)
of statutory capital and surplus as of the prior year end. On December 30, 1997,
AIC paid an extraordinary dividend of $13.7 million, which was approved by the
Maryland Insurance Administration. AIC needs prior regulatory approval for all
dividends until December 30, 1998, at which time AIC's ordinary dividend
capacity will become approximately $6.8 million.
 
    As of December 31, 1997, all of the domestic insurance company subsidiaries
total adjusted capital greatly exceeded the NAIC authorized control level
risk-based capital.
 
(13)  STOCK OPTIONS
 
    The Company has five option plans, the 1994 Non-employee Director Stock
Option Plan, the 1996 Non-employee Director Stock Option Plan, the 1992
Incentive Stock Option Plan, the 1995 Flexible Incentive Plan, and the 1997
Flexible Incentive Plan. All plans are administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors. Each option may be used to purchase one
share of Common Stock of the Company. As of December 31, 1997, 5,987,251 shares
of Common Stock were reserved for the exercise of options, of which 3,508,226
shares were reserved for options previously granted and 2,479,025 shares were
reserved for future issuances of options.
 
    Options generally vest over a one, three or five year period and expire ten
years after grant date. All options have been granted at fixed exercise prices,
generally at the market price of the Company's Common Stock on the grant date.
Any excess of the market price on the grant date over the exercise price is
recognized as compensation expense in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. During 1996, such compensation expense amounted to $494,000. If the
fair value method of valuing compensation related to options would have been
used, pro forma net earnings and pro forma diluted earnings per share would have
been $43.8 million, or $0.94 per share for the year ended December 31, 1997, and
$37.5 million, or $0.84 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1996. The pro
forma compensation cost for the year ended December 31, 1995, is less than
$100,000. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the grant date
using the Black-Scholes single option pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions: a) risk free interest rate of 6.2% for 1997, 5.6% for 1996
and 6.6% for 1995, b) expected volatility factor of .3, c) dividend yield of
 .56% for 1997, .3% for 1996 and 0% for 1995, and d) expected option life of five
years for 1997 and six years for 1996 and 1995.

(1) Columns C and D are shown ignoring the effects of reinsurance.
 
(2) Net investment income was allocated to the company, and therefore the
    segment, on which the related investment asset was recorded. Other operating
    expenses were allocated to the company, and therefore the corresponding
    segment, which actually incurred those expenses.
 
Note: Column E is omitted because the Company has no other policy claims and
      benefits payable

                     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION


     THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement") is entered
into as of the 27th day of February, 1998 by and among HCC Insurance Holdings,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("HCCH"), The Kachler Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of HCCH ("Merger Sub"), The Kachler
Corporation ("Kachler"), a Texas corporation, Larry M. Kachler ("LMK"), Paul T.
Getty ("Getty"), and Bryant L. Manning ("Manning"), Robert P. Schanen, Jr.
("Schanen"), Robert M. Kleiderer ("Kleiderer") and Michael J. O'Donnel
("O'Donnel") (LMK, Getty, Manning, Schanen, Kleiderer and O'Donnel being
collectively referred to as the "Shareholders"). 

                                   RECITALS:

     A.     The Boards of Directors of each of HCCH, Merger Sub and Kachler have
determined to engage in a transaction pursuant to which (i) Kachler will merge
with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger"), (ii) at the Effective Time the capital
stock of Kachler shall be converted into shares of common stock, par value $1.00
per share, of HCCH (the "HCCH Common Stock") in the manner herein described, all
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

     B.     The Board of Directors of Kachler has approved, and the Board of
Directors of Kachler has resolved, subject to the terms of this Agreement, to
recommend that shareholders of Kachler approve, the Merger, this Agreement and
the Articles of Merger (as defined herein).

     C.     The Board of Directors of HCCH has approved the Merger, this
Agreement and the Articles of Merger.  HCCH, as the sole shareholder of Merger
Sub, has approved the Merger, this Agreement and the Articles of Merger.

     D.     The parties intend for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to qualify as a plan of reorganization in accordance with the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and to be accounted for as a "pooling-of-interests" for accounting
purposes.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:


                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

     SECTION 1.1   THE MERGER.

     (a)    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Kachler will
be merged into Merger Sub in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware
("Delaware Law"), whereupon 


<PAGE>

the separate existence of Kachler shall cease, and Merger Sub shall be the 
surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

     (b)    As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, Kachler and Merger
Sub shall file articles of merger, in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit "A" (the "Articles of Merger"), in the Office of the Secretary of the
State of Delaware, and make all such other filings or recordings required by
Delaware Law and as required by the Texas Business Corporation Act in connection
with the Merger.  The Merger shall become effective upon completion of the
filing of an executed original of the Plan of Merger and the Articles of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas and the Articles of Merger
with the Office of the Secretary of the State of Delaware, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the "Effective Time").  The date on
which the Effective Time shall occur is referred to herein as the "Effective
Date."

     (c)    From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to all
of the restrictions, disabilities and duties of Kachler and Merger Sub, all as
provided under Delaware Law.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
and subject thereto, at the Effective Time (i) all the rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises, of a public as well as of a private nature,
and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due on whatever
account, including without limitation subscriptions to shares, and all other
choses in action, and all and every other interest of or belongings to or due to
the Merger Sub or Kachler shall be taken and deemed to be transferred to, and
vested in, the Surviving Corporation without further act or deed; and all
property, rights and privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, and all and
every other interest shall be thereafter as effectually the property of the
Surviving Corporation, as they were of Merger Sub and Kachler, and (ii) all
debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of Merger Sub and Kachler, subject to
the terms hereof, shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall thenceforth be
responsible and liable for all the debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of
Merger Sub and Kachler, and neither the rights of creditors nor any liens upon
the property of Merger Sub or Kachler shall be impaired by the Merger, and may
be enforced against the Surviving Corporation.

     SECTION 1.2   CONVERSION OF SHARES.  At the Effective Time, each share of
common stock of Kachler outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof
cease to be outstanding and be converted into the right to receive 9.8064 shares
of HCCH Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration").

No fractional shares shall be issued and each holder of Kachler Common Stock
shall be entitled to the nearest whole share of HCCH Common Stock rounded
upwards if such fractional share exceeds .5 and otherwise rounded downwards,
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that HCCH shall under no circumstances be obligated hereunder
to issue shares of HCCH Common Stock in excess of an aggregate of 1,600,000
shares of HCCH Common Stock.

Each share of Common Stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be issued and outstanding as one
share of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.


                                       2

<PAGE>

     SECTION 1.3   EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

     (a)    Prior to the Effective Date, HCCH shall appoint Harris Trust and
Savings Bank ("Harris") to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the
Merger.

     (b)    As of the Effective Time, all shares of Kachler Common Stock that
are outstanding immediately prior thereto will, by virtue of the Merger and
without further action, cease to exist, and all such shares of Kachler will be
converted into the right to receive from HCCH the number of shares of HCCH
Common Stock determined as set forth in Section 1.2 hereof.

     (c)    At and after the Effective Time, each certificate representing
outstanding shares of Kachler Common Stock will represent the number of shares
of HCCH Common Stock into which such shares of Kachler Common Stock will be
deemed registered in the name of the holder of such certificate.  At the
Effective Time, the holder of shares of Kachler Common Stock will surrender the
certificates for such shares (the "Kachler Certificates") to HCCH for
cancellation.  Promptly following the Effective Time and receipt of the Kachler
Certificates, HCCH will cause Harris to issue to such surrendering holder
certificates for the number of shares of HCCH Common Stock to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to the terms hereof.

     (d)    All shares of HCCH Common Stock delivered upon the surrender of
Kachler Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof will be delivered to
the registered holder.  After the Effective Time, there will be no further
registration of transfers of the shares of Kachler Common Stock on the stock
transfer books of Kachler.  If, after the Effective Time, Kachler Certificates
are presented for transfer or for any other reason, they will be canceled and
exchanged and certificates therefor will be delivered as provided for herein.

     (e)    Until Kachler Certificates representing Kachler Common Stock 
outstanding prior to the Merger are surrendered pursuant to this Section 1.3, 
such certificates will be deemed, for all purposes, to evidence ownership of 
the number of whole shares of HCCH Common Stock into which the shares of 
Kachler Common Stock will have been converted.

     (f)    If prior to the Merger, HCCH recapitalizes either through a split-up
of its outstanding shares into a greater number, or through a combination of its
outstanding shares into a lesser number, or reorganizes, reclassifies or
otherwise changes its outstanding shares into the same or a different number of
shares of other classes, or declares a dividend on its outstanding shares
payable in shares or securities convertible into shares (but not cash), the
number of shares of HCCH Common Stock into which the shares of Kachler Common
Stock are to be converted will be adjusted in proportion to such change.

                                  ARTICLE III

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF KACHLER,
                     AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND SHAREHOLDERS

     Except as disclosed in a document referring specifically to this Agreement
(the "Kachler Disclosure Schedule") which has been delivered to HCCH on or
before the date hereof, each of Kachler and each Shareholder (severally and not
jointly) represents and warrants to HCCH as set forth below:

     SECTION 3.1   CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND POWER.  Kachler is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of
Texas, and has all corporate powers and all material governmental licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals (collectively, "Governmental
Authorizations") required to carry on its business as now conducted, except such
Governmental Authorizations the failure of which to have obtained would not have
a Material Adverse Effect, as hereinafter defined, on Kachler.  Kachler has
delivered to HCCH true and complete copies of Kachler's Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws as currently in effect.  Kachler is duly qualified to
do business as a foreign corporation and possesses all Governmental
Authorizations, including, without limitation, licenses to act as a life
insurance agent in those states in which it does business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the property owned or
leased by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Kachler.  For purposes of this Agreement, a "Material Adverse Effect,"
with respect to any person or entity (including without limitation Kachler and
HCCH), means a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or
otherwise), business, properties, assets, liabilities (including contingent
liabilities), results of operations or prospects of such person or entity and
its affiliated companies and subsidiaries and/or parent corporation and/or
corporations under the same stock 


                                       4

<PAGE>

ownership, taken as a whole; and "Material Adverse Change" means a change or 
a development involving a prospective change which would result in a Material 
Adverse Effect.

from accounting for the business combination to be effected by the Merger as a
pooling-of-interests.

<PAGE>

     (b)    Neither Kachler, nor any corporation or other entity which under
Section 4001(b) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), is under common control with Kachler (a "Kachler ERISA
Affiliate") maintains or within the past five years has maintained, contributed
to, or been obligated to contribute to, any "Employee Pension Benefit Plan"
("Pension Plan") or any "Employee Welfare Benefit Plan" ("Welfare Plan") as such
terms are defined in Sections 3(2) and 3(1) respectively of ERISA, which is
subject to ERISA, except as described in the Kachler Disclosure Schedule.  Each
Pension Plan and Welfare Plan disclosed in the Kachler Disclosure Schedule
(which Plans have been heretofore delivered to HCCH) and maintained by Kachler
has been maintained in all material respects in compliance with their terms and
all provisions of ERISA and the Code (including rules and regulations
thereunder) applicable thereto.

     (c)    No Pension Plan or Welfare Plan is currently subject to an audit or
other investigation by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), the Department of
Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other governmental agency
or office nor are any such Plans subject to any lawsuits or legal proceedings of
any kind or to any material pending disputed claims by employees or
beneficiaries covered under any such Plan or by any other parties.

     (d)    No "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, resulting in liability to Kachler or any Kachler ERISA
Affiliate has occurred with respect to any Pension Plan or Welfare Plan.  Each
of Kachler or any Shareholder has no knowledge of any breach of fiduciary
responsibility under Part 4 of Title I of ERISA which has resulted in liability
of Kachler, and any Kachler ERISA Affiliate, any trustee, administrator or
fiduciary of any Pension Plan or Welfare Plan.

     (e)    Neither Kachler, nor any Kachler ERISA Affiliate, since January 1,
1986, has maintained or contributed to, or been obligated or required to
contribute to, a "Multiemployer Plan," as such term is defined in
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.  Neither Kachler, nor any Kachler ERISA Affiliate
has either withdrawn, partially or completely, or instituted steps to withdraw,
partially or completely, from any Multiemployer Plan nor has any event occurred
which would enable a Multiemployer Plan to give notice of and demand payment of
any withdrawal liability with respect to Kachler, or any Kachler ERISA
Affiliate.

     (f)    There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any
employee or former employee of Kachler or any Kachler ERISA Affiliate that,
individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount that
would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Sections 162(a)(1) or 280G of
the Code, or that would give rise to any benefits after termination.

     (g)    With respect to Kachler, and each Kachler ERISA Affiliate, the
Kachler Disclosure Schedule correctly identifies each material agreement,
policy, plan or other arrangement, whether written or oral, express or implied,
fixed or contingent, to which Kachler is a party or by which Kachler or any
property or asset of Kachler is bound, which is or relates to a pension, option,
bonus, deferred compensation, retirement, stock purchase, profit-sharing,
severance pay, health, welfare, incentive, vacation, sick leave, medical
disability, hospitalization, life or other insurance or fringe benefit plan,
policy or arrangement.  Each such agreement, policy, plan or other

                                     11
<PAGE>

arrangement has been maintained in all material respects in compliance with 
its terms and all provisions of ERISA and the Code (including rules and 
regulations thereunder) applicable thereto.

     (h)    Neither Kachler nor any Kachler ERISA Affiliate maintains or has 
maintained or contributed to any Pension Plan that is or was subject to 
Section 302 of Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.  Kachler has 
made available to HCCH, for each Pension Plan which is intended to be 
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, a copy of the 
most recent determination letter issued by the IRS to the effect that each 
such Plan is so qualified and that each trust created thereunder is tax 
exempt under Section 501 of the Code, and Kachler is unaware of any fact or 
circumstances that would jeopardize the qualified status of each such Pension 
Plan or the tax exempt status of each trust created thereunder.

     (i)    Kachler does not provide retiree benefits of any kind, including 
health, medical, life, etc. and Kachler has not agreed to continue any 
employee benefits after termination of employment other than under the 
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), 
if applicable.

     (j)    Neither Kachler nor any Kachler ERISA Affiliate has sponsored or 
maintained the New York Life's Agent Pension Plan, the New York Life's 
Progress Sharing Retirement Plan (401(k)), the NYLARC Agents Reinsurance 
Stock or the New York Life's Deferred 1st Year Commission Plan or any other 
arrangement or plan maintained or sponsored by New York Life Insurance 
Company or its affiliates. No Pension Plan maintained or sponsored by Kachler 
or any Kachler Affiliate has received funds from any such arrangement of New 
York Life Insurance Company or its affiliates in a rollover, trust-to-trust 
transfer or any other transfer or deposit.

     SECTION 3.14  MATERIAL AGREEMENTS.

     (a)    The Kachler Disclosure Schedule includes a complete and accurate 
list of all contracts, agreements, leases (other than Kachler Property 
Leases, as hereinafter defined), and instruments to which Kachler is a party 
or by which it or its properties or assets are bound which individually 
involve net payments or receipts in excess of $25,000 per annum, inclusive of 
contracts entered into with customers and suppliers in the ordinary course of 
business, or that pertain to employment or severance benefits for any 
officer, director or employee of Kachler, whether written or oral, but 
exclusive of contracts, agreements, leases and instruments terminable without 
penalty upon 60 days' or less prior written notice to the other party or 
parties thereto (the "Material Kachler Agreements").

     (b)    Neither Kachler nor to its knowledge, any other party is in 
default under any Material Kachler Agreement and no event has occurred which 
(after notice or lapse of time or both) would become a breach or default 
under, or would permit modification, cancellation, acceleration or 
termination of, any Material Kachler Agreement or result in the creation of 
any security interest upon, or any person obtaining any right to acquire, any 
properties, assets or rights of Kachler, which, in any such case, has had or 
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                                       12
<PAGE>

     (c)    To the knowledge of Kachler, each such Material Kachler Agreement is
in full force and effect and is valid and legally binding and there are no
material unresolved disputes involving or with respect to any Material Kachler
Agreement.  No party to a Material Kachler Agreement has advised Kachler that it
intends either to terminate a Material Kachler Agreement or to refuse to renew a
Material Kachler Agreement upon the expiration of the term thereof.

     (d)    Kachler is not in violation of, or in default with respect to, any
term of its Articles or Certificate of Incorporation, as the case may be, or
Bylaws.

     SECTION 3.15  PROPERTIES.  To the knowledge of Kachler, it owns no real 
estate, and all leases of real property to which Kachler is a party or by 
which it is bound ("Kachler Property Leases") are in full force and effect.  
To the knowledge of Kachler there exists no default under such Kachler 
Property Leases, nor any event which with notice or lapse of time or both 
would constitute a default thereunder, which default would have a Material 
Adverse Effect.  All of the properties and assets, both real and personal, 
(collectively "Properties") which are owned by Kachler are owned free and 
clear of any Lien, except for Liens which do not have a Material Adverse 
Effect.  Kachler has good and indefeasible title with respect to such 
Properties subject to no Liens, other than those permitted under this Section 
3.15, to all of the Properties necessary for the conduct of its business other 
than to the extent that the failure to have such title would not have a 
Material Adverse Effect.

have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, Kachler is not in violation of, or has
violated, any applicable provisions of any laws, statutes, ordinances or
regulations or any term of any judgment, decree, injunction or order binding
against it.

which accommodate same century and multi-century formulas and date values, 
and date data interface values which reflect the correct century.

of HCCH, (ii) no securities of HCCH convertible into or exchangeable for shares
of capital stock or voting securities of HCCH and (iii) no options or other
rights to acquire 


                                      17

<PAGE>

from HCCH, and no obligation of HCCH to issue, any capital stock, voting 
securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock 
or other voting securities of HCCH (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) 
being referred to collectively as the "HCCH Securities").  There are no 
outstanding obligations of HCCH to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire 
any HCCH Securities.

     (b)    All shares of HCCH Common Stock issued in the Merger shall, upon

            (iv)   all of its other reports, statements, schedules and
     registration statements filed with the SEC since December 31, 1996.

     (c)    As of its filing date, no such report or statement filed pursuant to
the Exchange Act contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

     (d)    No registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act, if
declared effective by the SEC, as of the date such statement or amendment became
effective, contained any untrue

<PAGE>

statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required

statements of HCCH included in its annual reports on Form 10-K and the unaudited
financial statements of HCCH included in its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q
referred to in Section 4.7 present fairly, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a consistent basis (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto), the consolidated financial position of HCCH and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results
of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to normal
year-end adjustments and failure to include footnote disclosures in the case of
any interim financial statements).  For purposes of this Agreement, "HCCH
Balance Sheet" means the consolidated balance sheet of HCCH as of September 30,
1997, and the notes thereto, contained in HCCH's quarterly report on Form 10-Q
filed for its fiscal quarter then ended, and "HCCH Balance Sheet Date" means
September 30, 1997.

     (a)    any Material Adverse Change with respect to HCCH or any event,
occurrence or development of a state of circumstances or facts known to HCCH,
which as of the date hereof could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on HCCH;

     (b)    any amendment of any material term of any outstanding HCCH
Securities; 

     (c)    any action by HCCH or, to HCCH's knowledge, any affiliate of HCCH
which would preclude the ability of HCCH to account for the business combination
to be effected by the Merger as a "pooling of interests" under generally
accepted accounting principles; or

     (d)    the entering into of any agreement by HCCH or any person on behalf
of HCCH to take any of the foregoing actions.

     SECTION 4.10  NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES.  There are no liabilities of HCCH
of any kind whatsoever that are, individually or in the aggregate, material to

or investigations occurring in the ordinary course of business or such actions,
suits, proceedings, claims or 


                                      19

<PAGE>

investigations involving respective amounts in controversy of less than 
$10,000,000 each, there is no action, suit, proceeding, claim or 
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of HCCH, overtly threatened, 
against HCCH or any of its assets or against or involving any of its 
officers, directors or employees in connection with the business or affairs 
of HCCH, including, without limitation, any such claims for indemnification 
arising under any agreement to which HCCH is a party, which could, 
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on HCCH.  
HCCH is not subject to or in default with respect to any writ, order, 
judgment, injunction or decree which could, individually or in the aggregate, 
have a Material Adverse Effect on HCCH.

     SECTION 4.12  TAXES.

     (a)    HCCH (i) has filed when due (taking into account extensions) with
the appropriate federal, state, local, foreign and other governmental agencies,
all material tax returns, estimates and reports required to be filed by it,
(ii) either paid when due and payable or established adequate reserves or
otherwise accrued on the HCCH Balance Sheet all material Taxes, and there are no
tax deficiencies claimed in writing by any Taxing authority and received by HCCH
that, in the aggregate, would result in any tax liability in excess of the
amount of the reserves or accruals, and (iii) has or will establish in
accordance with its normal accounting practices and procedures accruals and
reserves that, in the aggregate, are adequate for the payment of all Taxes not
yet due and payable and attributable to any period preceding the Effective Time.
The HCCH Disclosure Schedule sets forth those tax returns of HCCH (or any
predecessor entities) for all periods that currently are the subject of audit by
any federal, state, local or foreign taxing authority.

     (b)    There are no material Taxes, interest, penalties, assessments or
deficiencies claimed in writing by any taxing authority and received by HCCH to
be due in respect of any tax returns filed by HCCH (or any predecessor
corporations).  Neither HCCH nor any predecessor corporation, has executed or
filed with the IRS or any other Taxing authority any agreement or other document
extending, or having the effect of extending, the period of assessment or
collection of any Taxes.

     (c)    HCCH is not a party to or bound by (or will prior to the Effective
Date become a party to or bound by) any Tax indemnity, Tax sharing or Tax
allocation agreement or other similar arrangement which includes a party other
than HCCH and its Subsidiaries.  HCCH has not been a member of an affiliated
group other than one of which HCCH was the parent, or filed or been included in
a combined, consolidated or unitary Tax return other than one filed by HCCH (or
a return for a group consisting solely of its Subsidiaries and predecessors).

     SECTION 4.13  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS; ERISA.

     (a)    Except as otherwise disclosed neither HCCH nor any corporation or
other entity which under Section 4001(b) of ERISA is under common control with
HCCH (an "HCCH ERISA Affiliate") maintains or within the past five years has
maintained, contributed to, or been obligated to contribute to, any Pension Plan
or any Welfare Plan which is subject to ERISA.  Each Pension Plan and Welfare
Plan disclosed in the HCCH Disclosure Schedule and maintained 


                                      20

<PAGE>

by HCCH has been maintained in all material respects in compliance with their 
terms and all provisions of ERISA and the Code (including rules and 
regulations thereunder) applicable thereto.

     (b)    Except as otherwise disclosed neither HCCH nor any HCCH ERISA
Affiliate maintains or has maintained or contributed to any Pension Plan that is
or was subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. 
HCCH has made available to Kachler and the Affiliated Companies, for each
Pension Plan which is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code, a copy of the most recent determination letter
issued by the IRS to the effect that each such Plan is so qualified and that
each trust created thereunder is tax exempt under Section 501 of the Code, and
HCCH is unaware of any fact or circumstances that would jeopardize the qualified
status of each such Pension Plan or the tax exempt status of each trust created
thereunder.

     (c)    To the knowledge of HCCH, no Pension Plan or Welfare Plan is
currently subject to an audit or other investigation by the IRS, the Department
of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other governmental
agency or office nor are any such Plans subject to any lawsuits or legal
proceedings of any kind or to any material pending disputed claims by employees
or beneficiaries covered under any such Plan or by any other parties.

     (d)    No "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, resulting in liability to HCCH or any HCCH ERISA
Affiliate has occurred with respect to any Pension Plan or Welfare Plan.  HCCH
has no knowledge of any breach of fiduciary responsibility under Part 4 of
Title I of ERISA which has resulted in liability of HCCH, any HCCH ERISA
Affiliate, any trustee, administrator or fiduciary of any Pension Plan or
Welfare Plan.

     (e)    Neither HCCH nor any HCCH ERISA Affiliate, since January 1, 1986,
has maintained or contributed to, or been obligated or required to contribute
to, a "Multiemployer Plan," as such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA.  Neither HCCH nor any HCCH ERISA Affiliate has either withdrawn,
partially or completely, or instituted steps to withdraw, partially or
completely, from any Multiemployer Plan nor has any event occurred which would
enable a Multiemployer Plan to give notice of and demand payment of any
withdrawal liability with respect to HCCH or any HCCH ERISA Affiliate.

     (f)    With respect to HCCH and each HCCH ERISA Affiliate, the HCCH
Disclosure Schedule correctly identifies each material agreement, policy, plan
or other arrangement, whether written or oral, express or implied, fixed or
contingent, to which HCCH is a party or by which HCCH or any property or asset
of HCCH is bound, which is or relates to a pension, option, bonus, deferred
compensation, retirement, stock purchase, profit-sharing, severance pay, health,
welfare, incentive, vacation, sick leave, medical disability, hospitalization,
life or other insurance or fringe benefit plan, policy or arrangement.

     (a)    The HCCH Disclosure Schedule includes a complete and accurate list
of all contracts, agreements, leases (other than HCCH Property Leases, as
hereinafter defined) and instruments to which HCCH is a party or by which it or
its properties or assets are bound which individually involve net payments or
receipts in excess of $15,000,000 per annum, inclusive of contracts that pertain
to employment or severance benefits for any officer, director or employee of
HCCH, whether written or oral, but exclusive of contracts entered into with
customers and suppliers in the ordinary course of business or contracts,
agreements, leases and instruments terminable without penalty by HCCH upon 60
days or less prior written notice to the other party or parties thereto (the
"Material HCCH Agreements").

     (b)    Neither HCCH, nor, to the knowledge of HCCH, any other party is in
default under any Material HCCH Agreement and no event has occurred which (after
notice or lapse of time or both) would become a breach or default under, or
would permit modification, cancellation, acceleration or termination of any
Material HCCH Agreement or result in the creation of any security interest upon,
or any person obtaining any right to acquire, any properties, assets or rights
of HCCH which, in any such case, has had or would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on HCCH.

     (c)    To the knowledge of HCCH, each such Material HCCH Agreement is in
full force and effect and is valid and legally binding and there are no material
unresolved disputes involving or with respect to any Material HCCH Agreement.

terminate a Material HCCH Agreement or to refuse to renew a Material HCCH
Agreement upon the expiration of the term thereof.

     (d)    Each of HCCH and Merger Sub, is not in violation of, or in default
with respect to, any term of its Articles or Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws.

     SECTION 4.15  PROPERTIES.  To the knowledge of HCCH, all leases of real
property to which HCCH is a party or by which it is bound ("HCCH Property
Leases") which are material to the business of HCCH are in full force and
effect.  To the knowledge of HCCH, there exists no default under such HCCH
Property Leases, nor any event which with notice or lapse of time or both would
constitute a default thereunder by HCCH, which default would have a Material
Adverse Effect on HCCH.  All of the properties and assets which are owned by
HCCH are owned free and clear of any Lien, except for Liens which do not have a
Material Adverse Effect on HCCH or which have been disclosed in the HCCH
Disclosure Schedule.  HCCH has good and indefeasible title with respect to such
owned properties and assets subject to no Liens, other than those permitted
under this Section 4.15, to all of the properties and assets necessary for the
conduct of their business other than to the extent that the failure to have such
title would not have a Material Adverse Effect on HCCH.

employed by HCCH, nor do the executive officers of HCCH know of any activities
or proceedings of any labor union to organize any such employees.

     SECTION 4.18  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.  Except for violations which do not
have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on HCCH, HCCH is not in violation of, or
has violated, any applicable provisions of any laws, statutes, ordinances or
regulations or any term of any judgment, decree, injunction or order binding
against it.

     SECTION 4.19  TRADEMARKS, TRADENAMES, ETC.  HCCH owns or possesses, or
holds a valid right or license to use, all intellectual property, patents,

Kachler shall receive a certificate to such effect signed by HCCH's President
or, any Executive Vice President and the Chief Financial Officer.

     (c)    Except as set forth in the HCCH Disclosure Schedule, there shall
have been no Material Adverse Change in HCCH since the HCCH Balance Sheet Date.

     (d)    Kachler shall have received a written opinion in form and substance
satisfactory to it from Bracewell & Patterson to the effect that the Merger will
be treated for federal income tax purposes as a tax-free reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.  In preparing such opinion, counsel may
rely on (and to the extent reasonably required, Kachler, and the Shareholders
shall make) reasonable representations as to facts related thereto.

     (e)    Kachler shall have received from Winstead Sechrest & Minick P.C.,
counsel to HCCH, an opinion in form and substance satisfactory to the

     SECTION 9.3   CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF EACH PARTY.  The respective
obligations of the parties hereunder are subject to the fulfillment, on and as
of the Effective Date, of each of the following conditions (any one or more of
which may be waived by such parties, but only in a writing signed by such
parties):

     (a)    Each of Kachler and the Shareholders shall have duly approved, where
applicable, this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the Merger, all in
accordance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements.

     (b)    No statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or
restraining order shall have been enacted, promulgated or enforced (and not
repealed, superseded or otherwise made inapplicable) by any court or
governmental authority which prohibits the consummation of the Merger (each
party agreeing to use its reasonable best efforts to have any such order, decree
or injunction lifted).


                                      34

<PAGE>

     (c)    There shall have been obtained any and all Governmental
Authorizations, permits, approvals and consents of securities or "blue sky"
commissions of any jurisdiction and of any other governmental body or agency,
that may reasonably be deemed necessary so that the consummation of the Merger
will be in compliance with applicable laws, the failure to comply with which
would have a Material Adverse Effect on HCCH, Kachler, or the Surviving
Corporation, or would be reasonably likely to subject any of HCCH, Merger Sub,
Kachler, or any of their respective directors or officers to penalties or
criminal liability.

     (d)    The waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act, if applicable, shall have expired

                               TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

prior to the Effective Time whether before or after the approval by the
shareholders of Kachler and the Affiliated Companies:

     (a)    By the mutual consent of the Boards of Directors of HCCH and
Kachler.

     (b)    By the Board of Directors of either HCCH or Kachler if there has
been a material breach by the other or, in the case of HCCH, by any Shareholder,
of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, which in either
case cannot be, or has not been, cured within 15 days after written notice of
such breach is given to the party committing such breach, provided that the
right to effect such cure shall not extend beyond the date set forth in
subparagraph (c) below.

     (c)    By the Board of Directors of either HCCH or Kachler if (i) all
conditions of Closing required by Article 0 hereof have not been met or waived
by March 31, 1998, or (ii) the Merger has not occurred by such date; provided,
however, that neither HCCH nor Kachler, shall be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this subparagraph (c) if such party is in willful and
material violation of any of its representations, warranties or covenants in
this Agreement.

     (d)    If any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or
ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise
prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have
become final and nonappealable.

     (e)    By the Board of Directors of HCCH, if LMK shall have become Disabled
or shall have died.

     SECTION 10.2  EFFECT OF TERMINATION.  Upon termination of this Agreement
pursuant to this Article X, this Agreement shall be void and of no effect and
shall result in no obligation of or liability to any party or their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents or shareholders, 


                                      35

<PAGE>

other than the obligations pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, unless 
such termination was the result of an intentional breach of any 
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement, in which case the 
party who breached the representation, warranty or covenant shall be liable 
to the other party for damages, and all costs and expenses incurred in 
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of 
this Agreement.

                                      ARTICLE XI

                                   CLOSING MATTERS

     SECTION 11.1  THE CLOSING.  Subject to termination of this Agreement as
provided in Article IX above, the closing of the transactions provided for
herein (the "Closing") will take place at the offices of Winstead Sechrest &
Minick P.C., 910 Travis Street, Suite 2400, Houston, Texas 77002 at 10:00 a.m.,
Houston Time on February 27, 1998, or, if all conditions to Closing have not
been satisfied or waived by such date, such other place, time and date as
Kachler and HCCH may mutually select (the "Closing Date").  Such Closing may,
with the consent of all Parties, take place by delivery and exchange of
documents by facsimile transmission with originals to follow by overnight mail
service courier.  Prior to or concurrently with the Closing, the Agreement of
Merger and such officers' certificates or other documents as may be required to
effect the Merger will be filed in the office of the Secretary of the State of
Texas.  Accordingly, the Merger will become effective at the Effective Time.


                                     ARTICLE XII

                             INDEMNIFICATION AND REMEDIES

     SECTION 12.1  GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SHAREHOLDERS.   Each
Shareholder, jointly and severally to the extent hereinafter set forth,
covenants and agrees to indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless HCCH,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, members, assigns, successors and affiliates
(individually, an "Indemnified Party" and collectively, "Indemnified Parties")
from, against and in respect of:

     (a)    all liabilities, losses, claims, damages, punitive damages, causes
of action, lawsuits, administrative proceedings (including informal
proceedings), investigations, audits, demands, assessments, adjustments,
judgments, settlement payments, deficiencies, penalties, fines, interest
(including interest from the date of such damages) and costs and expenses

every kind, nature and description) (collectively, "Damages") suffered,
sustained, incurred or paid by the Indemnified Parties in connection with,
resulting from or arising out of, directly or indirectly:

            (i)    any breach of any representation or warranty of Kachler or
the Shareholders set forth in this Agreement or any schedule or certificate,
delivered by or on behalf of Kachler or the Shareholders in connection herewith;
or


                                      36

<PAGE>

            (ii)   any nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement by the
Shareholders, or, prior to the Effective Time, Kachler, under this Agreement; or

            (iii)  the business, operations or assets of Kachler prior to the
Closing Date or the actions or omissions of Kachler's officers, employees or
agents prior to the Closing Date, other than Damages arising from matters
expressly disclosed in the Kachler Financial Statements, this Agreement or the
Kachler Disclosure Schedules; or

            (iv)   the matters disclosed on the Disclosure Schedule (Taxes) or
the nonfulfillment of any representation, covenant or agreement described in
Sections 3.12 (Taxes), 3.25 (Commissions) and 8.6 (Assignment of Commissions);
or

            (v)    the failure of Kachler or any Shareholder to obtain any
necessary consent relating to the leasing by Kachler of the leasehold property
utilized by Kachler; and

     (b)    any and all Damages incident to any of the foregoing or to the
enforcement of this Section 12.1.

     SECTION 12.2  LIMITATION AND EXPIRATION.  Notwithstanding the above:

     (a)    (i) there shall be no liability for indemnification under 
Section 12.1 unless the aggregate amount of Damages exceeds $75,000 (the 
"Franchise Deductible"); provided, however, if Damages exceed the Franchise 
Deductible, the Indemnifying Persons shall be liable for all such Damages and 
(ii) provided, further that the Franchise Deductible shall not apply to 
Damages arising out of any breaches of the covenants of the Shareholders set 
forth in this Agreement or representations and warranties made in Sections 
3.12 (Taxes) and 3.25 (Commissions) (the "Deductible Exclusions");

     (b)    the aggregate amount of the Shareholders' liability under this
Article XII except for matters referred to as Deductible Exclusions and for
matters of fraud as described in Section 12.6 shall not exceed an amount equal
to one-half the Merger Consideration received by such Shareholder;

     (c)    the indemnification obligations under this Article XII, or under any
certificate or writing furnished in connection herewith, shall terminate at the
date that is the later of clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 12.2(c):

            (i)    (1)    with respect to claims relating to or arising out of
(i) any Taxes arising out of or relating to the business of Kachler or (ii) the
irrevocable assignment of all commissions, fees or other amounts due to Kachler
for business for which a Shareholder has written as an employee or agent of
Kachler that relates to business that has been written prior to the Closing
Date:  (A) the date that is six (6) months after the expiration of the longest
applicable federal or state statute of limitation (including extensions
thereof), or (B) if there is no applicable statute of limitation, ten (10) years
after the Closing Date; or


                                      37

<PAGE>

                   (2)    with respect to claims other than those specified in
clause (i)(1) of this Section 12.2(c) that are of a nature and of sufficient
materiality typically expected to be encountered in the audit process, on the
completion of the first independent audit of financial statements containing
combined operations of HCCH and Kachler; or

                   (3)    with respect to all claims other than those referred
to in clause (i)(1) or (2) of this Section 12.2(c), twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time; or

            (ii)   the final resolution of claims or demands pending as of 
the relevant dates described in clause (i) of this Section 12.2(c) (such 
claims referred to as "Pending Claims").

     SECTION 12.3  AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY.  Subject to the limitations set 
forth in this Article XII and except as set forth in Section 12.2, each 
Shareholder shall be liable severally and Pro Rata (as hereinafter defined), 
net of any recoveries under insurance policies recovered from third parties 
and tax savings (hereafter in this Section 12.3 referred to as "HCCH 
Damages").  "Pro Rata" for purposes of Sections 12.1 and 12.2 with respect to 
each Shareholder shall mean the proportion that such Shareholder's holdings 
of Kachler Common Stock as of the time immediately prior to the Effective 
Time bears to the total shares of Kachler Common Stock held by all 
Shareholders as of the time immediately prior to the Effective Time. In 
seeking indemnification for HCCH Damages under this Article XII following the 
Closing, the Indemnified Persons' remedy will be limited to receiving up to 
that number of shares of HCCH Common Stock determined by dividing (a) the 
amount of the HCCH Damages by (b) the closing sale price of HCCH's Common 
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the Effective Date (the "Closing Date 
Price").  Provided, however, that irrespective as to the number of claims 
asserted by Indemnified Persons hereunder and the amount of the HCCH Damages 
for which indemnification is sought, any such Shareholder, in the aggregate, 
shall under no circumstances be required to make indemnification payments 
hereunder beyond the Closing Date Price multiplied by one-half the number of 
shares of HCCH Common Stock received by such Shareholder at the time of the 
Merger (the "Maximum Shareholder Liability").  Notwithstanding anything to 
the contrary set forth herein, in the event that at the time of the 
resolution of any such indemnification claim, such Shareholder does not hold 
the number of shares of HCCH Common Stock (including any shares otherwise 
acquired at any time before or after the Effective Time or at any time after 
any claim is made for indemnification) necessary to settle any 
indemnification claim, then such Shareholder shall pay in cash or other 
immediately available funds the cash equivalent of the remainder of his 
in-stock indemnification obligations under this Section 12.3 up to his 
Maximum Shareholder Liability.  In lieu of HCCH Common Stock, any Shareholder 
shall have the option to pay in cash or other immediately available funds the 
cash equivalent of all or any part of his in-stock Maximum Shareholder 
Liability.

     SECTION 12.4  HCCH AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY.  Subject to the limitations 
set forth in this Article XII, HCCH will indemnify and hold harmless Kachler, 
and the Kachler Shareholders and their officers, shareholders, directors, 
administrators, successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, 
demands, actions, causes of action, losses, costs, damages, liabilities and 
expenses including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees, net of any 
recoveries under insurance policies, recoveries from third parties and tax 
savings (hereafter in this Section 12.4 referred to as "Kachler Damages") 
arising out of any misrepresentation or breach of or default under any of 


                                       38

<PAGE>

the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements given or made by 
HCCH or Merger Sub in this Agreement or any certificate or exhibit delivered 
by or on behalf of HCCH or Merger Sub pursuant hereto.  In seeking 
indemnification for Kachler Damages under this Section 12.4 following the 
Closing, the Indemnified Person's remedy will be limited to receiving that 
number of additional shares of HCCH Common Stock determined by dividing (a) 
the amount of the Kachler Damages by (b) the Closing Date Price.  Provided, 
however, that irrespective of the number of claims asserted by Indemnified 
Persons hereunder in the amount of the Kachler Damages for which 
indemnification is sought, HCCH, in the aggregate, shall under no 
circumstances be obligated to make an indemnification payment hereunder 
beyond that number of additional shares of HCCH Common Stock equal to 
one-half of the total number of shares of HCCH Common Stock provided to the 
Kachler Shareholders on the Effective Date (the "Maximum HCCH Liability").  
The indemnification provided for in this Section 12.4 will not apply unless and 
until the aggregate Kachler Damages for which one or more Indemnified Person 
seeks indemnification exceeds $75,000 in the aggregate, in which event the 
indemnification provided for will include all Kachler Damages (a franchise 
deductible) up to the Maximum HCCH Liability.

     SECTION 12.5  PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION; THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.  

     (a)    Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party under this Article 
XII of notice of a claim against it for indemnification brought under this 
Article XII (a "Claim"), the Indemnified Party will, if a claim is to be made 
against an Indemnifying Party, give prompt written notice to the Indemnified 
Party of the Claim, but the failure to promptly notify the Indemnified Party 
will not relieve the Indemnified Party of any liability that it may have to 
any Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party 
demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudice by the Indemnifying 
Party's failure to give such prompt notice.  Such notice shall contain a 
description in reasonable detail of facts upon which such Claim is based and, 
to the extent known, the amount thereof.

     (b)    If any Claim referred to in this Article XII is made by a third 
party against an Indemnified Party and such Indemnified Party gives written 
notice to the Indemnifying Party of the Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be 
entitled to participate in the defense of Claim but under all circumstances 
HCCH shall be entitled to assume the defense of the Claim and, thereafter, if 
HCCH has so assumed the defense, no other party hereto will be liable under 
this Article XII for any fees of counsel or any other expenses with respect 
to the defense of the Claim in each case subsequently incurred in connection 
with the defense of the Claim unless such other party elects to retain its 
separate counsel.  If HCCH is not the Indemnifying Party and elects, in 
writing, not to assume the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall assume the 
defense and HCCH will not be liable for any fees or expenses with respect to 
the Defense of the Claim, unless HCCH elects to retain its separate counsel.

     SECTION 12.6  LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.  (a) It is a fundamental point of
mutual agreement among all Parties hereto that the Parties' liability for and in
respect of this Agreement and the Merger shall, except for matters of proved
fraud, be limited to the absolute, fixed dollar amounts and for the absolute,
fixed time limitations specified in this Article XII.  These limitations of
amount of liability and time to assert any such liability shall apply to all
claims and other 


                                       39

<PAGE>

demands, charges, allegations, liabilities, responsibilities, exposures and 
the like (collectively "Claims Against A Party") no matter how any and all of 
such Claims Against A Party may be brought or asserted, whether sounding in 
contract, tort or otherwise, including, without limitation, Claims Against A 
Party based on breach of contract, breach of representation, warranty or 
covenant, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligent 
misrepresentation, indemnity (contractual or otherwise), contribution 
(contractual or otherwise), or loss in reliance.  A Party's liability in 
matters of fraud shall be limited to two times the Maximum Shareholders 
Liability or the Maximum HCCH Liability, as the case may be.


                                 ARTICLE XIII

                                MISCELLANEOUS

     SECTION 13.1  APPOINTMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE.  Subject to the 
successorship provisions of this Section 13.1, LMK (the "Representative") is 
hereby irrevocably appointed as the attorney-in-fact and representative of 
the interests of the Shareholders for all purposes of this Agreement, and 
notice is hereby given thereof to HCCH and Merger Sub, and, without 
independent verification, HCCH and Merger Sub may rely upon Representative's 
undertakings in such capacity.  The Representative shall have full and 
irrevocable authority on behalf of the Shareholders, and shall promptly and 
completely exercise such authority in a timely fashion to:

     (a)    participate in, represent and bind the Shareholders in all respects
with respect to any arbitration or legal proceeding relating to this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the defense and settlement of any matter, and the
calculation thereof for every purpose thereunder, consent to jurisdiction, enter
into any settlement, and consent to entry of judgment, each with respect to any
or all of the Shareholders;

     (b)    receive, accept and give notices and other communications relating
to this Agreement;

     (c)    take any action that the Representative deems necessary or desirable
in order to fully effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

     (d)    execute and deliver any instrument or document that the
Representative deems necessary or desirable in the exercise of his authority
under this Section 13.1; and

     (e)    waive the fulfillment of any condition or conditions to the Closing.

     Those Shareholders who, as of the Effective Date, hold a majority of the
Kachler Common Stock may, at any time and by written action delivered to HCCH,
remove the Representative or any successor thereto, but such removal shall be
effective only upon the replacement of such Representative or successor by a new
Representative designated, by written notice delivered to HCCH, by those
Shareholders who, as of the date hereof hold a majority of Kachler Common Stock,
PROVIDED, however, that any such notice shall be effective upon actual receipt
by HCCH.  Any such written notice shall be delivered to HCCH in accordance with
the 


                                       40

<PAGE>

notice provisions set forth in Section 13.4 hereof.  If any Representative 
shall have died, become Disabled or unable to serve, those Shareholders who, 
as of the date hereof, hold a majority of Kachler Common Stock shall promptly 
designate by written notice delivered to HCCH, a replacement Representative. 
Any costs and expenses incurred by the Representative in connection with 
actions taken pursuant to or permitted by this Section 13.1 will be borne by 
the Shareholders and paid or reimbursed to the Representative Pro Rata.

     The foregoing authorization is granted and conferred in consideration 
for the various agreements and covenants of HCCH and Merger Sub contained 
herein. In consideration of the foregoing, and subject to the successorship 
provisions of this Section 13.1, this authorization granted to the 
Representative shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of 
any of the Shareholders or by operation of law, whether by death or 
incompetence of any Shareholder or by the occurrence of any other event 
except the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1 hereof.  If 
after the execution hereof any such Shareholder shall die or become 
incompetent, the Representative is nevertheless authorized and directed to 
exercise the authority granted in this Section 13.1 as if such death or 
incompetence had not occurred and regardless of notice thereof. The 
Representative shall have no liability to any Shareholder for any act or 
omission or obligation hereunder, provided that such action or omission is 
taken by the Representative in good faith and without willful misconduct.

     SECTION 13.2  FURTHER ASSURANCES.  Each party agrees to cooperate 
fully with the other parties and to execute such further instruments,
documents and agreements and to give such further written assurances as may
be reasonably requested by any other party to better evidence and reflect the
transactions described herein and contemplated hereby and to carry into effect
the intents and purposes of this Agreement.

     SECTION 13.3  FEES AND EXPENSES.  Until otherwise agreed by the parties,
each party shall bear its own fees and expenses, including counsel fees and fees
of brokers and investment bankers contracted by such party, in connection with
the transaction contemplated hereby.

     SECTION 13.4  NOTICES.  Whenever any party hereto desires or is required to
give any notice, demand, or request with respect to this Agreement, each such
communication shall be in writing and shall be effective only if it is delivered
by personal service or mailed, United States registered or certified mail,
postage prepaid, or sent by prepaid overnight courier addressed as follows:

its obligations under this Agreement with respect to Merger Sub or the Merger).

     SECTION 13.7  SEVERABILITY.  If any provision of this Agreement, or the

Agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and 
either retroactively or prospectively) only by a writing signed by those 
persons as provided in this Section 13.9.  The waiver by a party of any 
breach hereof or default in the performance hereof shall not be deemed to

Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented by Kachler, the 
Shareholders or HCCH with respect to any of the terms contained in this 
Agreement. 

     SECTION 13.10 NO WAIVER.  The failure of any party to enforce any of the
provisions hereof shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such
party thereafter to enforce such provisions.

Section or an Exhibit shall mean an Article of, a Section in, or Exhibit to,
this Agreement unless otherwise explicitly set forth.  The titles and headings
herein are for reference purposes only and shall not in any manner limit the
construction of this Agreement which shall be considered as a whole.  The words
"include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each
case to be followed by the words "without limitation."

     SECTION 13.12 COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be an original as against any party whose
signature appears thereon and all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.  This Agreement shall become binding when one or more
counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the signatures
of all the parties reflected hereon as signatories.

     SECTION 13.13 SHAREHOLDER CONTROL OF STOCK.  The Shareholders severally,
and not jointly, represent and warrant with respect to their respective shares
of Kachler Common Stock as follows:

     (a)    Kachler, O'Donnel and Kleiderer: (i) that, although such shares of

Common Stock; and (ii) that his spouse is not required to consent to or join in
this Agreement or any of the transactions herein contemplated;

     (b)    Manning, Getty and Schanen: (i) that he owns all such shares of

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Section 
13.13 will survive the Closing, will have no expiration or termination date, 
and will not be subject to any deductible amount (including the Franchise

Private Trust Company of Florida, as Escrow Agent, HCCH will withhold in cash or
approved investment securities for a period of 24 months following the Closing
Date, an amount equal to 10% of the Purchase Price.  On the Closing Date, HCCH
will deposit, or cause to be deposited in escrow pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, the cash representing the Escrow Amount, provided, however, if the
Purchase Price is reduced pursuant to Section 1.5 the Escrow Amount shall be
similarly reduced to equal 10% of the Adjusted Purchase Price, as herein
defined.  The Escrow Amount will be held as collateral for the indemnification
obligations of Belanger pending its release from escrow in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement.

     SECTION 1.5   PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT.

     (a)    The Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment after the Closing
Date as provided in this Section.  If the Earnings (as defined in subsection (b)
of this Section 1.5) are less than $3,000,000, the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted to an amount (the "Adjusted Purchase Price") that bears the same ratio
to $22,000,000 that the Earnings bears to $3,000,000.  Within five (5) days of
the determination of the Earnings as set forth in a schedule (the "Closing Date
Schedule") prepared by HCCH and Merger Sub and agreed to by Coopers & Lybrand,
LLP, Belanger shall repay to HCCH in immediately available funds the excess, if
any, of $22,000,000 over the Adjusted Purchase Price.

     (b)    "Earnings" means the aggregate pre-tax earnings of IAI and GIR 
for the calendar year ending on December 31, 1997 as shown on audited 
financial statements of IAI and GIR prepared by Coopers & Lybrand, LLP in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied 
combined for purposes of this calculation and excluding (i) costs relating to 
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement which have been accrued as of 
December 31, 1997, (ii) accrued employee bonuses associated with the 
transaction, and (iii) deferred compensation paid to Koopman in cash or 
equity.  Each of the Parties agrees to cause Coopers & Lybrand, LLP to audit 
or review such financial statements and agree to the Earnings as soon as 
practicable and to fully cooperate with Coopers & Lybrand, LLP in connection 
therewith.  The fees of Coopers & Lybrand, LLP to combine the audited 
financial statements shall be paid by GIR.  Fees of Coopers & Lybrand, LLP 
incurred in connection with the audits of GIR and IAI which are in excess of 
amounts accrued at December 31, 1997 for such audits shall be paid by 
Belanger.

     (c)    Following the Closing, the Purchase Price paid by Purchaser at the
Closing shall be adjusted in the manner set forth in Section 1.5(a) as follows:

            (i)    as soon as practicable but not later than 60 business days
     after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare a schedule setting forth
     the Earnings and, pursuant to Section 4.1(j), (A) the combined capital 
     accounts of GIR Partners' and IAI Shareholders' equity and (B) the cash and
     cash equivalents as of the opening of business on the Closing Date (the
     "Proposed Closing Date Schedule").  The Proposed Closing Date Schedule
     shall be prepared in accordance with the same accounting principles as were
     utilized in preparing the year-end December 31, 1997 financial statements
     and as set forth herein.  If the Sellers do not give notice of dispute to
     Purchasers within thirty business days after receiving the Proposed Closing
     Date Schedule, the Proposed Closing Date Schedule shall be deemed to be
     accepted by Sellers and thereupon shall become the Closing Date Schedule.
     If Sellers give notice of dispute to Purchasers within such period of
     thirty business days, Sellers and Purchasers shall negotiate in good faith
     to resolve the dispute and, if such resolution is successful, the Proposed
     Closing Date Schedule, as so revised and agreed to by the Parties shall
     become the Closing Date Schedule.  If, after fifteen days from the date
     notice of dispute is given hereunder, Sellers and Purchasers cannot agree
     on a resolution of the dispute, then either Sellers or Purchasers may
     direct Coopers & Lybrand, LLP to resolve the dispute.  Sellers and
     Purchasers shall each provide Coopers & Lybrand, LLP with all information
     they reasonably require and Coopers & Lybrand, LLP shall be entitled (to
     the extent they consider it appropriate) to base their opinion on such
     information and on the accounting or other records, and any written
     submissions made by the Sellers or Purchasers.  The costs associated with
     retaining Coopers & Lybrand, LLP in resolving the dispute shall be borne
     equally by Sellers and Purchasers.  The decision of Coopers & Lybrand, LLP
     as to the Closing Date Schedule shall be conclusive and binding upon
     Sellers and Purchasers in the absence of any manifest error.  If the
     Closing Date Schedule demonstrates that the covenants set forth in
     Section 4.1(j) have not been satisfied, the Purchase Price shall be 
     adjusted to cause any such deficiency to be satisfied.

     SECTION 1.6   ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE.  The Purchase Price shall be
allocated $4,000,000 to the purchase of the IAI Common Stock and $18,000,000 to
the purchase of the Partnership Assets, or if the Purchase Price is adjusted as
set forth herein, in the same ratios.

laws of the state of its incorporation, and has all corporate powers and all
material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals

to have obtained would not have a Material Adverse Effect, as hereinafter
defined, on IAI.  Sellers have delivered to Purchasers true and complete copies
of IAI's Articles or Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as currently in
effect.  IAI is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in

with respect to any person or entity (including without limitation IAI, GIR, and
Purchasers), means a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or
otherwise), business, properties, assets, liabilities (including contingent

prospective change which is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse

laws of the state of its organization, and has all partnership powers and all
material Governmental Authorizations required to carry on its business as now
conducted, except such Governmental Authorizations the failure of which to have
obtained would not have a Material Adverse Effect on GIR.  Sellers have
delivered to Purchasers copies of the partnership agreement of GIR and all
amendments thereto.

            (c)    Family L.P. is a limited liability limited partnership formed
and existing under the laws of the state of Georgia and has all powers and all
material Governmental Authorizations required to carry on its business as now
conducted, except such Governmental Authorizations the failure of which to have
obtained would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Family L.P.  Sellers have
delivered to Purchasers copies of the limited partnership agreement of Family
L.P. and all amendments thereto.

     SECTION 2.2   AUTHORIZATION.

     Each Seller represents and warrants that such Seller has full right, power
and authority to enter into this Agreement and each other agreement to be
entered into by such Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and that this Agreement and such other agreements contemplated hereby
constitute, or upon execution will constitute, valid and binding agreements of
such Seller, enforceable against such Seller in accordance with their respective
terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or
other similar laws effecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or
by general principles of equity.

     SECTION 2.3   GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION.  The execution, delivery and
performance by each of the Sellers of this Agreement, and the consummation of

sky" laws;

     (d)    compliance with any requirements of any federal, state, foreign or

     (e)    such other filings or registrations with, or authorizations,
consents or approvals of, governmental bodies, agencies, officials or
authorities, the failure of which to make or obtain (i) would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on either of the Companies, or
(ii) would not materially adversely affect the ability of either of the
Companies or Purchasers to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
to operate their businesses as heretofore operated.

     SECTION 2.4   NON-CONTRAVENTION.  The execution, delivery and performance
by each of the Sellers of this Agreement, and the consummation by each of the
Sellers of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not:

     (a)    contravene or conflict with IAI's Articles or Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws, the partnership agreement of GIR or the limited
partnership agreement of the Family L.P.;

     (b)    assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 2.3,

any law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon or
applicable to any of the Companies or the Sellers;

Companies or any material license, franchise, permit or other similar
authorization held by either of the Companies; or

     (d)    result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (as hereinafter
defined) on any material asset of either of the Companies;

except, with respect to clauses (b), (c) and (d) above, for contraventions,
defaults, losses, Liens and other matters referred to in such clauses that would
not be reasonably expected to have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on either of the Companies.  For purposes of this 


                                       7

Agreement, the term "Lien" means, with respect to any asset, any mortgage,

social security taxes and income tax withholding, including interest and
penalties thereon (each individually a "Tax" and collectively the "Taxes") and
there are no tax deficiencies claimed in writing by any taxing authority that,
in the aggregate, would result in any tax liability in excess of the amount of
the reserves or accruals 


                                      11

<PAGE>

Closing an amount determined by Coopers & Lybrand, LLP adequate for the payment
of all Taxes attributable to income of the Companies for the portion of 1998

     SECTION 2.12  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS, ERISA.

     (a)    Neither of the Companies is a party to any oral or written
(i) employment, severance, collective bargaining or consulting agreement not
terminable on 60 days' or less notice, (ii) agreement with any executive officer
or other key employee of such Company (A) the benefits of which are contingent,
or the terms of which are materially altered, upon the occurrence of a

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) providing any term of
employment or compensation guarantee extending for a period longer than one
year, or (C) providing severance benefits or other benefits after the
termination of employment of such executive officer or key employee regardless
of the reason for such termination of employment, (iii) agreement, plan or
arrangement under which any person may receive payments subject to the tax

value of any of 


                                      12

<PAGE>

the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     (b)    Neither of the Companies nor any corporation or other entity which
under Section 4001(b) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), is under common control with either of the Companies (an
"ERISA Affiliate") maintains or within the past five years has maintained,
contributed to, or been obligated to contribute to, any "Employee Pension
Benefit Plan" ("Pension Plan") or any "Employee Welfare Benefit Plan" ("Welfare
Plan") as such terms are defined in Sections 3(2) and 3(1) respectively of
ERISA, which is subject to ERISA, except as described on Schedule 2.12(b).  Each
Pension Plan and Welfare Plan disclosed in Schedule 2.12(b) and the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (which Plans have been heretofore delivered to Purchasers)
and maintained by either of the Companies has been maintained in all material
respects in compliance with their terms and all provisions of ERISA and the Code
(including rules and regulations thereunder) applicable thereto.

     (c)    No Pension Plan or Welfare Plan is currently subject to an audit or
other investigation by the IRS, the Department of Labor (the "DOL"), the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other governmental agency or office nor are
any such Plans subject to any lawsuits or legal proceedings of any kind or to
any material pending disputed claims by employees or beneficiaries covered under
any such Plan or by any other parties.

     (d)    No "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, resulting in liability to either of the Companies or
any ERISA Affiliate has occurred with respect to any Pension Plan or Welfare
Plan.  None of the Sellers has any knowledge of any breach of fiduciary
responsibility under Part 4 of Title I of ERISA which may result in liability of
either of the Companies or any ERISA Affiliate, any trustee, administrator or
fiduciary of any Pension Plan or Welfare Plan.

     (e)    Neither of the Companies nor any ERISA Affiliate, since January 1,
1986, has maintained or contributed to, or been obligated or required to
contribute to, a "Multiemployer Plan," as such term is defined in
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.  Neither of the Companies nor any ERISA Affiliate
has either withdrawn, partially or completely, or instituted steps to withdraw,
partially or completely, from any Multiemployer Plan nor has any event occurred
which would enable a Multiemployer Plan to give notice of and demand payment of
any withdrawal liability with respect to either of the Companies or any ERISA
Affiliate.

     (f)    There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any
employee or former employee of either of the Companies or any ERISA Affiliate
that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount
that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Sections 162(a)(1) or 280G
of the Code.

     (g)    With respect to either of the Companies and each ERISA Affiliate,
Schedule 2.12(b) and the Seller Disclosure Schedule correctly identifies each
material agreement, policy, plan or other arrangement, whether written or oral,
express or implied, fixed or contingent, to which either of the Companies is a
party or by which either of the Companies or any property or asset of either of
the Companies is bound, which is or relates to a pension, 


                                      13

<PAGE>

option, bonus, deferred compensation, retirement, stock purchase, 
profit-sharing, severance pay, health, welfare, incentive, vacation, sick 
leave, medical disability, hospitalization, life or other insurance or fringe 
benefit plan, policy or arrangement.  Each such agreement, policy, plan or 
other arrangement has been maintained in all material respects in compliance 
with its terms and all provisions of ERISA and the Code (including rules and 
regulations thereunder) applicable thereto.

     (h)    Neither of the Companies nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains or has
maintained or contributed to any Pension Plan that is or was subject to
Section 302 of Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.  Sellers have made
available to Purchasers, for each Pension Plan which is intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, a copy of the most
recent determination letter issued by the IRS to the effect that each such Plan
is so qualified and that each trust created thereunder is tax exempt under
Section 501 of the Code, and each of the Sellers is unaware of any fact or
circumstances that would jeopardize the qualified status of each such Pension
Plan or the tax exempt status of each trust created thereunder.

     (i)    One or more of the benefit plans of the Companies listed in the
Seller Disclosure Schedule may be subject to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA").  If so, each such plan has
been operated in, and is in compliance with COBRA.  All notices required to be
given under COBRA have been timely and properly given in accordance with COBRA,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and no employee, former
employee or "qualified beneficiary" (as defined in COBRA) has any claim or
contingent claim against the Companies or any ERISA Affiliate.  Neither Company
provides retiree benefits of any kind, including health, medical, life, etc. and
neither Company has agreed to continue any employee benefits after termination
of employment other than COBRA.

     SECTION 2.13  MATERIAL AGREEMENTS.

     (a)    The Seller Disclosure Schedule includes a complete and accurate list
of all contracts, agreements, leases (other than Property Leases, as hereinafter
defined), and instruments to which either of the Companies is a party or by
which it or its properties or assets are bound (1) which individually involve
net payments or receipts in excess of $25,000 per annum, inclusive of contracts
entered into with customers and suppliers in the ordinary course of business, or
(2) that pertain to employment or severance benefits for any officer, director
or employee of either of the Companies, whether written or oral, but exclusive
of contracts, agreements, leases and instruments terminable without penalty upon
60 days' or less prior written notice to the other party or parties thereto, or
(3) to which Belanger, Koopman or the Selling Corporations are the opposing
contracting party (the "Material Agreements").

     (b)    Neither of the Companies nor, to the knowledge of any of the
Sellers, any other party is in default under any Material Agreement and no event
has occurred which (after notice or lapse of time or both) would become a breach
or default under, or would permit modification, cancellation, acceleration or
termination of any Material Agreement or result in the creation of any security
interest upon, or any person obtaining any right to acquire, any properties,
assets or rights of either of the Companies, which, in any such case, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.


                                      14

<PAGE>

     (c)    To the knowledge of each of the Sellers, each such Material
Agreement is in full force and effect and is valid and legally binding and there
are no material unresolved disputes involving or with respect to any Material
Agreement.  No party to a Material Agreement has advised either of the Companies
that it intends either to terminate a Material Agreement or to refuse to renew a
Material Agreement upon the expiration of the term thereof.  No representation
or warranty is made that all benefits contemplated in the Material Agreements
will be received.

     (d)    IAI is not in violation of, or in default with respect to, any term
of its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.  None of the partners of GIR is in
violation of, or in default with respect to, any term of the partnership
agreement of GIR.

     SECTION 2.14  PROPERTIES.  Neither of the Companies owns any real estate,
and all leases of real property to which either of the Companies is a party or
by which it is bound ("Property Leases") are in full force and effect.  There
exists no default under such Property Leases, nor any event (other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) which with notice or lapse of time
or both would constitute a default thereunder, which default would have a
Material Adverse Effect.  All of the properties and assets which are owned by
either of the Companies are owned free and clear of any Lien, except for Liens
which do not have a Material Adverse Effect.  Each of the Companies has good and
indefeasible title with respect to such owned properties and assets subject to
no Liens, other than those permitted under this Section 2.14, to all of the
properties and assets necessary for the conduct of its business other than to
the extent that the failure to have such title would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

     SECTION 2.17  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.  Except for violations which do not
have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, neither of the Companies has received any
notice that it is in violation of, or has violated, any applicable provisions of

connection with: (i) the termination, if any, of employment of Martin Taylor or
Don O'Donovan at any time before or within twelve months of the Closing; or (ii)
a breach of the representation set forth in Section 2.11 (Taxes); (iii) Sellers,
GIR, or the Companies failing to have obtained or maintained any license or
other Governmental Authorization, and (iv) any costs not set forth on Sellers'
Financial Statements for failing to provide software that satisfies in full the
representations set forth in Section 2.21, whether or not a limitation is set
forth on the Disclosure Schedule; and for liability in excess of the Franchise
Deductible for all actions, suits, proceedings, claims or investigations
covered by Section 2.10 whether or not set forth on a Disclosure Schedule.

     SECTION 10.2  PURCHASERS AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY.  Subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article X, from and after the Closing Date until
the Final Date Purchasers will indemnify and hold harmless IAI, the Selling
Corporations, and the Shareholders and their respective officers, shareholders,
directors, administrators, heirs, personal representatives, successors and
assigns (hereinafter in this Section 10.2 referred to individually as a
"Purchasers Indemnified Person" and collectively as "Purchasers Indemnified
Persons") from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of
action, losses, costs, damages, liabilities and expenses including, without
limitation, reasonable legal fees (net of: (i) any recoveries under insurance
policies; (ii) recoveries from third parties; and (iii) tax savings known to
Purchasers Indemnified Persons at the time of making a claim hereunder)
(hereafter in this Section 10.2 referred to as "Seller Damages") arising out of
any misrepresentation or breach of or default under any of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements given or made by
Purchasers in this Agreement or any certificate or exhibit delivered by or on
behalf of Purchasers pursuant hereto.  The indemnification provided for in
this Section 10.2 will not apply unless and until the aggregate Seller
Damages for which one or more Purchasers Indemnified Person seeks
indemnification exceeds $75,000 in the aggregate, in which event the
indemnification provided for will include all Seller Damages (a franchise
deductible).  The aggregate liability of Purchasers for indemnification under
this Agreement shall not exceed the Purchase Price.  The Purchasers


                                      30

Indemnified Persons are only entitled to be reimbursed for the actual
indemnified expenditures or damages incurred by them for the above described
losses.  Such Purchasers Indemnified Persons are not entitled to
consequential, special, or other speculative or punitive categories of
damages.

     SECTION 10.3  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS.  The right to enforce the breach
of each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement set forth in this
Agreement will remain operative and in full force and effect for the maximum
period permitted by applicable law after the Closing except that the right to
enforce a breach of any representation or warranty in Section 2.12 (Employee
Benefit Plans, ERISA) shall not expire (the last date of such applicable period
being herein called the "Final Date"), regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the Parties to this Agreement, upon which Final Date such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall expire and be of no
further force and effect.  Any litigation or other action of any kind arising
out of or attributable to a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement, must be commenced prior to the Final
Date.  If not so commenced prior to the Final Date, any claims or
indemnifications brought under this Article X will thereafter conclusively be
deemed to be waived regardless of when such claim is or should have been
discovered.  Any such claim for indemnification brought under this Article X,
brought before the Final Date, shall survive until a final resolution of such
claim is effective.  As set forth herein, no investigation by any Party hereto
into the business, operations and conditions of the other Party shall diminish
in any way the effect of any representation or warranty made by any such Party
in this Agreement or shall relieve any Party of any of its obligations under
this Agreement.

     SECTION 10.4  PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION; THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

     (a)    Promptly after receipt by an indemnified person under this Article X
of notice of a claim against it for which such person claims indemnification
under this Article X (a "Claim"), the indemnified person will give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying Party of the Claim, but the failure to
promptly notify the indemnifying Party will not relieve the indemnifying Party
of any liability that it may have to any indemnified person, except to the
extent that the indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such action
is prejudice by the indemnified person's failure to give such prompt notice.
Such notice shall contain a description in reasonable detail of facts upon which
such Claim is based and, to the extent known, the amount thereof.

     (b)    If any Claim referred to in this Article X is made by a third party
against either Purchasers or Sellers, Purchasers shall in all circumstances
assume the defense of the Claim.  Sellers shall have the right to participate in
the defense of any Claim that might result in an indemnified loss under
Section 10.1 of this Agreement, but in such event Sellers shall pay for their
nonlegal costs and expenses incurred in connection with such participation.

                                      ARTICLE XI

                            ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

     SECTION 11.1  NEGOTIATION.  In the event that any controversy or claim
between or among the Parties (including, without limitation, any disputed claim
for indemnification) should arise out of the interpretation of or performance
under this Agreement for which no method of resolution is specifically provided
elsewhere in this Agreement, the Parties will refrain from initiating any legal
or other proceeding until all of the procedures set forth in this Article XI
have been exhausted.  The parties to the dispute, including officers of each
such party who are authorized to negotiate and enter into a settlement on
behalf of such party (the "Authorized Officers"), will meet at least once and
will attempt to resolve the matter.  Any party to the controversy may, by
delivery to each other party to the controversy of a written notice of the
controversy, request the other(s) to meet within fifteen (15) days of
delivery of such notice, at a mutually agreed time and place in Houston,
Texas.

     SECTION 11.2  ARBITRATION AND MEDIATION.  If the matter has not been
resolved by negotiation within sixty (60) days of delivery of the notice
described in Section 11.1, the Parties shall finally settle such dispute by
binding arbitration conducted expeditiously by a sole arbitrator in
accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules (including the
Supplementary Procedures for Large, Complex Disputes) of the American
Arbitration Association (the "AAA").  The place of arbitration shall be
Houston, Texas, unless some other location is mutually selected.  At any time
during the pendency of the arbitration proceeding, any party to the
controversy may make a request for non-binding mediation in accordance with
the then-current Commercial Mediation Rules of the AAA.  Upon the making or
receipt of a request for mediation, the parties to the controversy, including
the Authorized Officers, shall endeavor to settle the dispute by holding at
least one mediation session no later than thirty (30) days following delivery
of the mediation request.

     SECTION 11.3  EXTENSION OF DEADLINES.  All deadlines specified in this
Article XI may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties to the
controversy.

     SECTION 11.4  OTHER RELIEF; STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS.  Except as otherwise
allowed by this Agreement, the procedures specified in this Article XI shall be
the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution of disputes between or
among the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement; provided,
however, that a Party may seek a preliminary injunction or other preliminary
judicial relief for the purpose of maintaining the status quo if in its judgment
such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage.  Despite such action, the
Parties will continue to participate in good faith in the procedures specified
in this Article XI.  All applicable statutes of limitation shall be tolled while
the procedures specified in this Article XI are pending.  The Parties will take
such action, if any, required to effectuate such tolling.  Upon the entry of an
award in any arbitration proceeding, the recipient may file an action in any
court of competent jurisdiction for enforcement of the award.

     SECTION 11.5  COSTS.  The cost of the mediation and arbitration will be
shared equally by the parties to the controversy or claim.

by giving notice thereof to other Parties in conformity with this Section.

     SECTION 12.4  GOVERNING LAW.  The internal laws of the State of Texas
(without regard to its choice of law principles) will govern the validity of
this Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the interpretation and

instrument referenced herein constitute the entire understanding and agreement
of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
and contemporaneous agreements or understandings, inducements or conditions,
express or implied, written or oral, between Parties with respect hereto.

     SECTION 12.8  AMENDMENT AND WAIVERS.  Any term or provision of this
Agreement may be amended, and the observance of any term of this Agreement may
be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively
or prospectively) only by a writing signed by all Parties hereto in the case of
an amendment or the Party waiving compliance in the case of a waiver.  The
waiver by any Party of any breach hereof or default in the performance hereof
shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other default or any
succeeding breach or default, unless such waiver so expressly states.

     SECTION 12.9  NO WAIVER.  The failure of any Party to enforce any of the
provisions hereof shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such
Party thereafter to enforce such provisions.

     SECTION 12.10 CONSTRUCTION OF AGREEMENT.  A reference to an Article,
Section or an Exhibit shall mean an Article of, a Section in, or Exhibit to,
this Agreement unless otherwise explicitly set forth.  The titles and headings
herein are for reference purposes only and shall not in any manner limit the
construction of this Agreement which shall be considered as a whole.  The words
"include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each
case to be followed by the words "without limitation."

     SECTION 12.11 COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be an original as against any Party whose
signature appears thereon and all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.  This Agreement shall become binding when one or more
counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the signatures
of all the Parties reflected hereon as signatories.

     SECTION 12.12 APPOINTMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE.  Subject to the successorship
provisions of this Section 12.12, Bethany A. Belanger (the "Representative") is
hereby irrevocably appointed as the attorney-in-fact and representative of the
interests of each Seller for all purposes of this Agreement, and notice is
hereby given thereof to Purchasers, and, without independent verification,
Purchasers may rely upon Representative's undertakings in such capacity.  The
Representative shall have full and irrevocable authority on behalf of the
Sellers, and shall promptly and completely exercise such authority in a timely
fashion to:

     (a)    participate in, represent and bind each of the Sellers in all
respects with respect to any arbitration or legal proceeding relating to this
Agreement, including without limitation, all matters relating to any
indemnification under Article X, taking any action under Article X including,
without limitation, the defense and settlement of any matter, and the
calculation thereof for every purpose thereunder, consent to jurisdiction, enter
into any settlement, and consent to entry of judgment, each with respect to any
or all of the Sellers;

     (b)    receive, accept and give notices and other communications relating
to this Agreement;

     (c)    take any action that the Representative deems necessary or desirable
in order to fully effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

     (d)    execute and deliver any instrument or document that the
Representative deems necessary or desirable in the exercise of her authority
under this Section 12.12; and

     (e)    waive the fulfillment of any condition or conditions to the Closing.

     After the Closing, the holders of a majority of the IAI Common Stock may,
at any time and by written action delivered to Purchasers, remove the
Representative or any successor thereto, but such removal shall be effective
only upon the replacement of such Representative or successor by a new
Representative designated, by written notice delivered by Purchasers, by the
holders of a majority of the IAI Common Stock, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such
notice shall be effective only upon actual receipt by Purchasers.  If any
Representative shall have died, become incapacitated or unable to serve, the
holders of a majority of the IAI Common Stock


                                      35

<PAGE>

shall promptly designate by written notice delivered to Purchasers, a
replacement Representative.  Any costs and expenses incurred by the
Representative in connection with actions taken pursuant to or permitted by
this Section 12.12 will be borne by the Shareholders.

     The foregoing authorization is granted and conferred in consideration for
the various agreements and covenants of Purchasers contained herein.  In
consideration of the foregoing, and subject to the successorship provisions of
this Section 12.12, this authorization granted to the Representative shall be
irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any of the holders of the
IAI Common Stock or by operation of law, whether by death or incompetence of the
Sellers or by the occurrence of any other event except the termination of this
Agreement.  If after the execution hereof any Seller shall die or become
incompetent or dissolve, the Representative is nevertheless authorized and
directed to exercise the authority granted in this Section 12.12 as if such
death or incompetence or dissolution had not occurred and regardless of
notice thereof. The Representative shall have no liability to any Seller for
any act or omission or obligation hereunder, provided that such action or
omission is taken by the Representative in good faith and without willful
misconduct.

     SECTION 12.13 TRIUMPH REINSURANCE COMPANY.  Belanger currently owns all of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of Triumph Reinsurance Company, an
Arizona life reinsurance company ("Triumph"), which Purchasers will not be
acquiring hereunder.  Belanger shall retain ownership and contract of Triumph
following the Closing.  However, Purchasers agree, subject to the management and
direction of Belanger, to administer the business and operations of Triumph and
Belanger will reimburse Purchasers for all out-of-pocket costs related thereto
(with the exclusion of the direct cost of Purchasers' employees).  In addition
to the amounts otherwise held in escrow pursuant to this Agreement, Belanger
agrees to provide whatever funds are necessary to solvently manage the run-off
of the Triumph Reinsurance Company business.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Agreement
effective as of the date first above written.
