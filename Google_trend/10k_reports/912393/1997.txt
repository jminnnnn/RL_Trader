ITEM 1.        BUSINESS

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS.

Chateau Properties, Inc. (the "Company") operates as a self-administered and
self-managed equity real estate investment trust ("REIT").  Through CP Limited
Partnership, a Maryland limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership") of
which the Company is the sole general partner, the Company owns and operates 47
manufactured home community properties in Michigan, Illinois, Florida, Minnesota
and North Dakota (the "Properties").  The Company also has a 50 percent interest
in a joint venture with ROC Communities, Inc. ("ROC") that owns 6 development
communities.  The Company was formed in Maryland on August 25, 1993 to continue
and expand the manufactured home operations and business objectives of Chateau
Estates ("Chateau"), a Michigan co-partnership.  Chateau had developed, owned
and operated manufactured home community properties since 1966.

On February 11, 1997, the Company completed its merger with ROC (the "Merger").
The Merger and related transactions will be accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of ROC will be adjusted to
fair value for financial accounting purposes and the results of operations of
ROC will be included in the results of operations of the Company in 1997.

In connection with the Merger, the following related transactions occurred:
 
     -    The Company repurchased and retired 1,200,000 shares of its common
          stock, of which 450,000 were repurchased in 1996

     -    ROC purchased 350,000 shares of Chateau common stock, which was
          retired at the time of the Merger

     -    The Company issued 1.042 shares of its common stock for each
          share of ROC stock outstanding

     -    The Company paid a stock dividend equal to .0326 shares of
          Company common stock per common share/OP Unit outstanding

     -    Certain OP Unitholders converted 6,170,908 OP Units into common
          shares.  These Unitholders waived their right to receive the above
          dividend and as a result it was re-allocated to the existing
          shareholders, resulting in a distribution to the common shareholders
          of .068 shares of common stock

     -    Certain OP Unitholders purchased 984,423 additional shares of
          common stock from the Company at $25.88 per share.

Since the Merger, Chateau now owns 128 communities with an aggregate 42,986
residential homesites.  In addition, it now fee manages 6,953 residential
homesites in 34 communities.

                                      1

FORMATION OF THE COMPANY

In November 1993, the Company issued, in an initial public offering, 5,700,000
shares of common stock (the "Offering").  In connection with the Offering, the
Company engaged in the following transactions:

       *  Chateau contributed fee title to twenty of the Properties to the
          Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership interests in the
          Operating Partnership ("OP units").

       *  InterCoastal Communities, Inc. a Florida corporation and its
          affiliates (collectively "InterCoastal"), contributed fee title to one
          Property and partnership interests in partnerships which own fee title
          to six of the Properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for
          OP units.

       *  A group of six Michigan co-partnerships affiliated with Leonard
          Maas (collectively "Maas") contributed fee title to six of the
          Properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP units.

       *  The Company contributed the net proceeds of the Offering of
          $103.8 million to the Operating Partnership, in exchange for a 40.8
          percent partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as its sole
          general partner.

       *  The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds of the cash
          contribution from the Company to repay approximately $88.2 million of
          indebtedness (including related prepayment penalties) collateralized
          by mortgages on certain of the Properties and the balance was retained
          for working capital and for the possible acquisition of additional
          manufactured home communities or development of expansion sites.

Chateau, InterCoastal, and Maas are referred to together as the Chateau
Properties Group or the Predecessor.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

A manufactured home community is a residential subdivision designed and improved
with sites for the placement of manufactured homes and related improvements and
amenities.  Manufactured homes are detached, single-family homes which are
produced off-site by manufacturers and installed on sites within the community.
Manufactured homes are available in a variety of architectural styles and floor
plans, offering many amenities, custom options and on-site built additional
structures.

Modern manufactured home communities are similar to typical residential
subdivisions usually containing centralized entrances, paved streets, curbs and
gutters and parkways.  These communities frequently provide a clubhouse for
social activities and recreation and other amenities, which may include swimming
pools, shuffleboard courts, tennis  courts and laundry facilities.  Utilities
are provided or arranged for by the owner of the community.  Some communities
provide water and sewer service through public or private utilities, while
others provide these services to residents from on-site facilities.

                                      2
<PAGE>

The owner of each home in a manufactured home community leases a site from the
community.  The manufactured home community is the owner of the underlying land,
utility connections, streets, lighting, driveways, common area amenities and
other capital improvements and is responsible for enforcement of community
guidelines and maintenance.  Each owner within the manufactured home community
is responsible for the maintenance of his home and leased site.

OPERATING AND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES

The Company seeks to maximize long-term growth in income and portfolio value
through active management and expansion of certain of its existing manufactured
home communities and the selective acquisition of additional communities.  The
Company focuses on manufactured home communities that have above-average cash
flow growth potential and expects to hold such properties for long-term
investment and capital appreciation.  The Company's investment and operating
strategies include:

OPERATIONS

     *    Providing the most attractive and desirable manufactured home
          communities in its markets.

     *    Offering a more extensive selection of amenities than other
          manufactured home communities in its markets.

     *    Maintaining and upgrading on a systematic basis its manufactured
          home communities through a regular preventive maintenance and
          replacement program.

     *    Offering residents on-site services and accessibility to on-site
          managers to maximize retention, encourage home maintenance and
          improvements and minimize turnover.

     *    Providing frequent personal contact between on-site managers and
          residents to foster a sense of pride in the community.

     *    Through a non-qualified REIT subsidiary, offer potential
          community residents the convenience of purchasing a home in place.

ACQUISITIONS, DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSIONS

     *    Selectively acquiring well-located manufactured home communities
          that demonstrate the potential for increases in revenue and cash flow
          by providing a professional property management team, correcting
          operating inefficiencies, aggressively leasing and/or renovating sites
          and developing additional sites.

     *    Acquiring properties in existing markets in order to achieve
          economies of scale in management and operations, and in new markets
          where portfolios may be acquired with regional management in place.

     *    Selectively developing new communities in regions where the
          Company already does business and further development is supported by
          demographics and strong market demand.

                                       3
<PAGE>

     *    Capitalizing on opportunities to renovate and expand properties
          consistent with local market demand.

     *    Utilizing the expertise and relationships developed by the
          Company's management to identify acquisition opportunities and
          complete acquisitions directly with sellers prior to the active public
          marketing of the properties.

Important factors to the Company when evaluating potential acquisitions include:

     *    Quality of the design and construction of the communities.

     *    Current condition and appearance of the communities.

     *    Current cash flow and ability of the Company to increase cash
          flow through rental increases, enhanced operating efficiencies and
          site expansions.

     *    Existing and potential competition from other manufactured home
          communities.

     *    Economic strength of the surrounding area.

The Company intends to finance its acquisitions and expansions through its $50
million unsecured line of credit with Huntington National Bank, as lead agent,
along with Bank of America and First Chicago NBD, and/or through additional
equity and debt offerings or the issuance of OP units.  The Company also intends
to maintain debt-to-total market capitalization (i.e., total debt of the Company
as a percentage of the market value of outstanding shares of Common Stock,
including OP Units exchangeable for such shares, plus total debt) of 40 percent
or less.  At December 31, 1996, the Company had debt-to-total market
capitalization of approximately 30 percent.

EXPANSION AND IMPROVEMENT OF MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITY PROPERTIES

The Company will seek to increase the income generated from the Properties and
from any additional properties acquired by expanding the number of sites
available to be leased to residents if justified by local market conditions and
permitted by zoning and other applicable laws.  During 1996, the Company
developed 276 expansion sites.  As of December 31, 1996 the Company had 20,279
total sites, of which 1,131 were vacant.  The Company owned at such date
undeveloped land adjacent to existing communities containing approximately 1,200
expansion sites which are zoned for manufactured housing.  All necessary
utilities are available at these expansion sites, however, building permits
would need to be obtained prior to development.  This undeveloped land will
facilitate additional growth to the extent conditions warrant.  In addition,
where appropriate, the Company will consider upgrading or adding facilities and
amenities to certain communities in order to make those communities more
attractive in their markets.

During 1996, the Company expanded its Anchor Bay  community by completing the
development of 103 sites, expanded its Algoma community by developing 53 sites,
expanded its Fairways community by completing the development of 10 sites and
developed 110 sites on land adjacent to its Macomb community.

                    communities in six

 Various            Other joint ventures      $  4,200     $ 1,000     $  3,200

LEASES

The typical lease entered into between the resident and one of the Company's
manufactured home communities for the rental of a site is month-to-month or
year-to-year, renewable upon the consent of both parties  or, in some instances,
as provided by statute. Pursuant to Michigan Mobile  Home Commission Act Section
28 which governs the leasing of manufactured  home sites in Michigan,
prospective residents must be given the opportunity to sign a  lease for a fixed
term for their site. The Company's experience has been  that a majority of
Michigan residents decline to execute a lease, but like all residents of the
Company's properties, do execute less formal documentation which sets forth the
general terms of occupancy.  Leases or other terms of residents' occupancy are
cancelable for non-payment of rent, violation of community rules and regulations
or other specified defaults.

COMPETITION

All of the Properties are located in developed areas that include other
manufactured home community properties. The number of competitive manufactured
home community properties in a particular area could have a material effect on
the Company's ability to lease sites at the Properties or at any newly acquired
properties and on the rents charged.  Although the Company believes it has
adequate capital resources and its officers and directors have significant
experience, the Company competes with others that may have greater resources
than the Company and whose officers and directors may have more experience than
the Company's officers and directors. In addition, other forms of multi-family
residential properties and single-family housing provide housing alternatives to
potential residents of the Properties.

                                      5

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 1996, the Company had approximately 276 full and part-time 
employees.  The Company utilizes a resident administrator for the on-site 
administration of each of the Properties.  Important duties of on-site 
administrators as well as the office manager include extensive contact with 
residents through initial introduction to community rules and on-going 
accessibility for resident assistance.  The communities have extensive rules 
and regulations to maintain their appearance at the highest level.  
Administrators notify residents who are in violation of these rules and 
regulations. Typically, clerical and maintenance workers are employed to 
assist these individuals in the management and care of the Properties.  
Direct supervision of on-site administrators is the responsibility of the 
Company's four regional vice presidents.  These individuals have significant 
experience in addressing the needs of residents and in finding or creating 
innovative approaches to value maximization and increased cash flow from 
property operations.  Complementing this field management staff are 23 
corporate employees who assist on-site administrators in all property 
functions.

Commitment to resident satisfaction is demonstrated by the ongoing training 
that the Company provides for on-site staff.  Community administrators meet 
periodically at regional seminars to review Company philosophy and policy, to 
discuss relevant administration issues and solutions and to share ideas and 
experiences.

The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Section 856(c) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  The Company 
generally will not be subject to Federal income tax to the extent it 
distributes 95 percent of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders. REITs 
are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements. If 
the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will 
be subject to Federal income tax (including any applicable alternative  
minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate rates.  Even as a 
REIT, the Company is subject to certain state and local taxes on its income 
and property and Federal income and excise taxes to the extent of its 
undistributed income.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

At December 31, 1996 the Properties consisted of 47 manufactured home 
communities containing 20,279 sites with amenities designed for either 
retirement or family living of which 25 were located in Michigan, 13 in 
Florida, 4 in Minnesota, 3 in North Dakota and 2 in Illinois.  The Company 
also owned land adjacent to certain existing communities containing 
approximately 1,200 expansion sites which, although not yet developed, were 
zoned for manufactured housing.  Of the 47 Properties, 38 have 200 or more 
sites, with the largest having 1,533 sites.

The Company also has a 50 percent interest in a joint venture with ROC that 
owns 6 development communities.

<PAGE>

At December 31, 1996, the Properties had an average occupancy rate of 
approximately 94.4 percent with weighted average rent for the year ended 
December 31, 1996 of $285 per month.  Weighted average rent is calculated as 
net rental income for the period, on a monthly basis, divided by the weighted 
average occupied sites.  Weighted average occupancy is computed by averaging 
the occupied sites at the end of each month in the period.

The Company believes that the Properties provide amenities and common 
facilities that create a safe and attractive community for the residents. All 
of the Properties provide residents with attractive amenities with most 
offering a clubhouse, a swimming pool and a library.  Many Properties offer 
additional amenities such as sauna/whirlpool spas, indoor pools, tennis 
courts, shuffleboard courts, basketball courts, golf courses, day care 
facilities, exercise rooms and a marina.

Since residents own their homes, it is their responsibility to maintain their 
homes and the surrounding area.  It is management's role to insure that 
residents comply with community policies and to provide maintenance of the 
common areas, facilities and amenities.  The Company continually monitors 
compliance by residents with its residents' regulations to assure that the 
communities are maintained at the highest standards.  The Company holds 
periodic meetings of its property management personnel for training and 
implementation of the Company's strategies, and property administrators make 
a daily inspection of the Properties.  The Company believes that, due in part 
to this strategy, the Properties historically have had and will continue to 
have low turnover and high occupancy rates.  Since 1989, the Properties have 
averaged an annual turnover of homes (where the home is moved out of the 
community) of less than 3 percent. During this period, the average annual 
turnover of residents in the Properties (where the home is sold and remains 
within the community, typically without interruption of rental income) has 
been approximately 10-12 percent.

The Operating Partnership owns a 100 percent beneficial interest in all of 
the Properties, (other than the six properties held in the joint venture with 
ROC, in which it has a 50 percent interest), except for Emerald Lake, 
Fairways, Lakeland Junction, Lakes at Leesburg, Palm Beach Colony, Winter 
Haven Oaks and Del Tura in which it owns a 99 percent beneficial interest and 
in which the Company owns the remaining 1 percent beneficial interest.

INDEBTEDNESS

At December 31, 1996, the aggregate amount of indebtedness encumbering the 
Properties was approximately $54.4 million.  The amounts outstanding as of 
December 31, 1996 for the indebtedness encumbering each of these Properties 
is set forth (in thousands) in the following table.  Prepayment of these debt 
obligations may result in significant prepayment penalties.

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In connection with a tender offer by Manufactured Home Communities, Inc.'s 
("MHC") operating partnership for shares of the Company's Common Stock in 
September 1996, the Company commenced litigation against MHC and its 
operating partnership in United States District Court in Baltimore, Maryland 
seeking a declaratory judgment with respect to, among other things, the 7 
percent ownership limit set forth in the Company's Articles.  MHC filed a 
counterclaim against the Company, its directors and ROC in the litigation 
alleging, among other things, various breaches of fiduciary duty.  Despite 
the withdrawal by MHC of its tender offer, this litigation remains pending.

In addition, three separate purported class actions have been filed against 
the Company and its directors in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, 
Maryland alleging breaches of fiduciary duty for agreeing to a merger with 
ROC and refusing to endorse the MHC Tender Offer or the proposal received 
from Sun Communities, Inc.

The Company believes the MHC counterclaim and the State Court litigation 
(which has been consolidated) are entirely without merit and intends to 
vigorously defend these cases if pursued.

The information contained in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company, 
including amendments previously filed and those which may be filed after the 
date hereof, is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 4.   SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of the Company's security holders during 
the last quarter of its fiscal year ended December 31, 1996.

The Company expects to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends to holders 
of its Common Stock.  Subject to the needs of the Company's acquisition and 
expansion strategies and subject to the REIT qualification standards, the 
Company intends to distribute annually up to 95 percent of its cash flow.

Distributions by the Company to the extent of its current and accumulated 
earnings and profits for Federal income tax purposes will be taxable to 
stockholders as dividend income. Distributions in excess of earnings and 
profits generally will be treated as a non-taxable reduction of the 
stockholder's basis in the Common Stock to the extent thereof, with the 
remainder as taxable gain.

In May 1995, the Company issued 335,460 shares of its Common Stock in 
exchange for an equal number of OP Units.  These OP Units, which were 
exchangeable by their terms at the option of the holder, had previously been 
issued in a privately negotiated transaction in exchange for properties 
contributed on formation of the Operating Partnership in November, 1993.  The 
Company believes that these holders of OP Units were "accredited investors" 
(as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933) and issued 
these shares of Common Stock in reliance on the exemption from registration 
found in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.

At March 25, 1997, there were approximately 600 holders of record and 
approximately 12,000 beneficial owners of the Company's Common Stock.

     (4)  Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National
          Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as net income
          excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of
          property plus rental property depreciation and amortization.
          Management believes that FFO is an important and widely used measure
          of the operating performance of REITs which provides a relevant basis
          for comparison among REITs.  For all periods presented, depreciation
          of rental property is the only non-cash adjustment.  FFO (i) does not
          represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted
          accounting principles; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative
          to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows
          from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) is not
          an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.  FFO is
          calculated as follows:

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND
          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial 
condition covers the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 and should 
be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the 
Company included elsewhere herein.

On February 11, 1997, the Company completed its merger with ROC Communities, 
Inc. ("ROC") (the "Merger").  The pro forma discussion covers the years ended 
December 31, 1996 and 1995 assuming the Merger and related transactions had 
occurred on January 1, 1995.  This pro forma discussion should be read in 
conjunction with Note 12 to the financial statements of the Company included 
elsewhere herein.

HISTORICAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995

For the year ended December 31, 1996, income before majority interest and 
extraordinary item was $16,100,000, an increase of $2,121,000 from the year 
ended December 31, 1995.  The increase was due primarily to increased net 
operating income from communities owned by the Company on January 1, 1995 
(the "Core 1995 Portfolio") and to a lesser extent, the acquisition of three 
communities in 1996 and one community in 1995.  The increase in net operating 
income from the Company's Core 1995 Portfolio was due to increased occupancy 
and rental increases offset by general operating expense increases.

Rental revenue in 1996 was $64,695,000, an increase of $4,783,000 or 8.0 
percent from 1995.  Approximately 2.3 percent of the increase was due to the 
acquisitions of three communities in 1996 and one in 1995, 3.9 percent 
represented the effect of annual rent increases in the Core 1995 Portfolio 
and 1.8 percent was due to increased occupancy in the Core 1995 Portfolio.  
Weighted average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 1996, was 18,889 
sites, or 4.6 percent higher than weighted average occupancy for the year 
ended December 31, 1995. Weighted average occupancy increased in 1996 due to 
the 1996 and 1995 acquisitions and the filling of 265 additional sites that 
were either vacant at January 1, 1996 or developed in 1996.  The occupancy 
rate was 94.4 percent on 20,279 sites as of December 31, 1996, as compared 
with 94.3 percent on 19,594 sites as of December 31, 1995.  On a per site 
basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year ended December 
31, 1996 increased to $285 from $277 in 1995 or 3.2 percent due to rental 
increases in the Core 1995 Portfolio in 1996.

Interest and other income increased approximately $746,000, or 38 percent, in 
1996 from 1995.  The increase is due primarily to the inclusion of the 
results of operations of four golf courses and a marina for the period 
beginning January 1, 1996.  These operations were previously conducted by GC 
Properties, Inc. ("GCI"), a corporation wholly owned by an equity owner of 
the Company, in order to permit the Company's qualification as a REIT under 
the Internal Revenue Code. From November 23, 1993 through December 31, 1995, 
the Company recognized net lease income from GCI which was classified as 
other income.  In early 1996, the Company received a ruling from the Internal 
Revenue Service allowing the Company to conduct these operations.  Effective 
January 1, 1996, as a result of acquiring the operations of GCI, the Company 
has consolidated these operations.

Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 
1996 increased by $2,180,000 or 13.6 percent from the same period a year ago. 
Approximately $1,028,000 of the increase represents the operating costs of 
the golf course and marina operations discussed above.  The remaining 
increase of $1,152,000 or a 7.2 percent increase over the prior year, is due 
primarily to the acquisition of three communities in 1996 and one in 1995.  
On a per site basis, monthly weighted average property operating and 
maintenance expense increased from $74 in 1995 to $80 in 1996, or 8.6 
percent.  Excluding the golf course and marina operations, monthly weighted 
average property operating and maintenance expense increased 2.4 percent, on 
a per site basis, year over year.

Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 1996, increased by 
$333,000, or 7.4 percent, from the year ended December 31, 1995.  The 
increase is due primarily to acquisitions and expansions of communities and 
general increases. On a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate 
taxes were $21.40 in 1996 compared to $20.90  in 1995, an increase of 2.6 
percent. Real estate taxes may increase or decrease due to inflation, 
expansions and improvements of communities, as well as changes in taxation in 
the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

Administrative expense for 1996 was relatively constant with 1995. 
Administrative expense in 1996 was 5.7 percent of revenues as compared to 6.3 
percent in 1995.

Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December 
31, 1996, by $510,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1995.  
The increase is attributable to the indebtedness incurred to finance the 1996 
acquisitions of three communities and one in 1995, as well as the investment 
in a joint venture with ROC that owns six development communities.  Interest 
expense also increased due to the financing of the Company's repurchase and 
retirement of 450,000 shares of its common stock in connection with the 
Merger. Interest expense as a percentage of average debt outstanding 
decreased to approximately 8.1 percent in 1996 from approximately 8.9 percent 
in 1995.

Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 1996, increased $438,000 
from the same period a year ago.  The increase is due to acquisitions and 
expansions.  Depreciation expense as a percentage of average depreciable 
rental property in 1996 remained relatively unchanged from 1995.

COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994

For the year ended December 31, 1995, income before majority interest and 
extraordinary item was $13,979,000, a decrease of $918,000 from the year 
ended December 31, 1994.  The decrease was due to an increase in depreciation 
of $3,784,000 and increased interest costs of $6,456,000, which were offset 
by increased net operating income of $9,322,000.  These increases were 
primarily due to the acquisitions of one community in 1995 and 10 communities 
in 1994, as well as an increase in net rental revenue from the communities 
owned by the Company on January 1, 1994 (the "Core 1994 Portfolio").  The 
increase in net operating income from the Company's Core 1994 Portfolio was 
due to increased occupancy and rental increases offset by general operating 
expense increases. In the first quarter 1995, the Company recognized an 
extraordinary charge of $829,000 related to the early extinguishment of debt.





                                        13

Rental revenue in 1995 was $59,912,000, an increase of  $12,594,000 or 26.6 
percent from 1994.  Approximately 84.8 percent of the increase was due to the 
acquisition of one community in September 1995 and 10 communities in 1994, 
eight of which were acquired in the fourth quarter, 9.2 percent represents 
the effect of annual rent increases in the Core 1994 Portfolio and 6.0 
percent was due to increased occupancy in the Core 1994 Portfolio.

Weighted average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 1995, was 18,051 
sites, or 21 percent higher than weighted average occupancy for the year 
ended December 31, 1994. Weighted average occupancy increased in 1995 due to 
the 1995 and 1994 acquisitions and the filling of 381 additional sites that 
were either vacant at January 1, 1995, or developed in 1995.  The occupancy 
rate was 94.3 percent on 19,594 sites as of December 31, 1995, as compared 
with 92.7 percent on 19,185 sites as of December 31, 1994.

On a per site basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year 
ended December 31, 1995 increased to $277 from $264 in 1994 or 4.6 percent.  
This increase was due to acquisitions made in 1995 and 1994 and rental 
increases in the Core 1994 Portfolio in 1995, partially offset by a weighted 
average $2 per month per site rebate that the Company passed through to its 
Michigan residents. The rebate represented the net savings realized by the 
Company from a change in real estate taxation in Michigan.

Interest and other income increased approximately $1,194,000, or 159 percent, 
in 1995 from 1994 primarily due to other operating revenues generated by the 
communities acquired by the Company in November 1994.

Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 
1995, increased by $3,524,000 or 28.2 percent from the same period a year 
ago.  The increase is due primarily to the 1995 and 1994 acquisitions.  On a 
per site basis, monthly weighted average property operating and maintenance 
expense increased from $70 in 1994 to $74 in 1995, or 5.9 percent.  The 
increase on a per site basis is due principally to certain of the communities 
acquired in 1994 having a higher per site operating cost, an increase in 
advertising and other costs incurred to fill sites and utility rate 
increases.  The higher per site operating cost in certain of the acquired 
communities is due, in part, to the costs associated with the other operating 
revenues generated by these communities.  The increase in advertising 
spending resulted in the net filling of 381 sites for 1995, while only 170 
sites were filled for the year ended December 31, 1994.

Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 1995, increased by 
$688,000, or 17.9 percent, from the year ended December 31, 1994.  The 
increase is due primarily to acquisitions and expansions of communities.  On 
a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate taxes were $20.90 in 
1995 compared to $21.40 in 1994, a decrease of 2.6 percent.  The decrease was 
due primarily to a change in real estate taxation in Michigan and 
acquisitions which had a lower per site real estate tax cost, offset by 
general tax increases.  The change in real estate taxation decreased real 
estate taxes beginning in the third and fourth quarter of 1994, and first and 
second quarter of 1995.  Real estate taxes may increase or decrease due to 
inflation, expansions and improvements of communities, as well as changes in 
taxation in the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

Administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 1995, increased 
$254,000, or 7.0 percent, from the year ended December 31, 1994. 
Administrative expense in 1995 was 6.3 percent of revenues as compared to 7.5 
percent in 1994.

<PAGE>

Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December 
31, 1995, by $6,456,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1994.  
The increase is attributable to the indebtedness incurred to finance the 1995 
and 1994 acquisitions of 10 communities.  Interest expense as a percentage of 
average debt outstanding decreased to approximately 8.9 percent in 1995 from 
approximately 9.4 percent in 1994 due to debt refinancing that occurred in 
the first quarter of 1995.

Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 1995, increased 
$3,784,000 from the same period a year ago.  The increase is due to the 1995 
and 1994 acquisitions of 10 communities for a combined purchase price of 
approximately $117 million.  Depreciation expense as a percentage of average 
depreciable rental property in 1995 remained relatively unchanged from 1994.

PRO FORMA RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PRO FORMA YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 COMPARED TO PRO FORMA YEAR ENDED 
DECEMBER 31,1995

Rental revenue increased $7,200,000 or 6 percent in 1996 over 1995 due to 
increased occupancy and rental increases in communities owned by the Company 
on January 1, 1995.  Other revenues increased approximately $800,000 or 20 
percent for the year ended December 31, 1996 over 1995 due primarily to golf 
course and marina operations which were consolidated in 1996 and recorded as 
net lease income in 1995 as discussed above.

Property, operating, maintenance and administrative expense increased 
$4,100,000 or 8.3 percent in 1996 as compared to 1995.  Excluding the 
expenses of the golf course and marina operations discussed above, the 
increase would have been $3,000,000 or 6.1 percent.  This increase is due to 
the increased number of occupied sites, as well as general increases.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

HISTORICAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net cash provided by operating activities was $29,755,000 for the year ended 
December 31, 1996, compared to $28,097,000 for the year ended December 31, 
1995. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily 
to the increase in net operating income.

Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 1996, 
was $595,000.  Use of cash included distributions made to shareholders/OP 
Unit holders of $24,065,000; the payment of $932,000 to reacquire 43,333 OP 
units at $21.50 per Unit and the payment of $11,239,000 to repurchase and 
retire 450,000 shares of the Company's common stock in connection with the 
Merger.  The shares were repurchased in October 1996 at an average price of 
approximately $25.00 per share.  This use of cash was offset partially by net 
borrowings under the Company's line of credit of $36,750,000.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1996 
was $29,518,000.   This amount represented the acquisition of three 
communities, joint venture investments, capital expenditures and construction 
and development costs.  The acquisition of the three communities for an 
aggregate purchase price of $9,200,000 were financed by $8,200,000 borrowed 
on the Company's line of credit and $1,000,000 through the issuance of 43,884 
OP units.  The investment in the joint venture with ROC of $10,300,000 was 
financed by a borrowing on the Company's line of credit.  The Company also 
invested approximately 

                                     15 
<PAGE>

$3,200,000 in cash in other joint ventures.  For the year ended December 31, 
1996, construction and development costs approximated $3,700,000, while 
recurring property capital expenditures, other than construction and 
development costs, were approximately $635,000. Recurring property capital 
expenditures in 1996 increased $94,000, or 17 percent, over the same period 
in 1995, due to the increased number of communities in the Company's 
portfolio.  Capital expenditures have historically been financed with funds 
from operations and it is the Company's intention that such future 
expenditures will be financed with funds from operations.

Future acquisitions of communities and land for development of sites will be 
financed through borrowings on the line of credit, the issuance of additional 
equity or debt securities, assumption of existing secured or unsecured 
indebtedness or the issuance of OP units.  The development of expansion sites 
will be financed primarily by cash flow from operations and borrowings on the 
line of credit.  Huntington National Bank, as lead agent, along with Bank of 
America and First Chicago NBD, have agreed, until January, 1999, to lend the 
Company up to $50 million which, subject to customary conditions, is 
available to finance the development of expansion sites, the acquisition of 
additional properties and general business obligations.  This line of credit 
is unsecured and bears interest at 150 basis points over LIBOR.  At December 
31, 1996, there was $36,750,000 outstanding under the line of credit.

The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements through 
cash flow from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under its line of 
credit.

The Company anticipates meeting its long-term liquidity requirements from 
borrowings under its line of credit, from the issuance of additional debt or 
equity securities and cash flows from operations.

The Company, as an owner of real estate, is subject to various environmental 
laws.  Compliance by the Company with existing laws has not had a material 
adverse financial effect on results of operations or financial position 
during the three year period ended December 31, 1996, nor does management

On a pro forma basis as of December 31, 1996, the Company had the following 
debt outstanding (in thousands):

Fixed rate mortgages                            $113,979 
Fixed rate unsecured debt                        145,000 
Unsecured lines of credit                         66,993 
Other debt                                         2,124 
                                                -------- 
                                                $328,096 
                                                -------- 
                                                -------- 

The weighted average interest rate and remaining term of the fixed rate debt 
was approximately 8.1 percent and 4.3 years, respectively.  The only variable 
rate debt outstanding is drawn on lines of credit.  After the Merger, the 
Company has two available credit facilities aggregating $100 million, each of 
which is unsecured and bears interest at 150 basis points over LIBOR.

INFLATION

All of the leases or terms of tenants' occupancies at the communities allow 
for at least annual rental adjustments.  In addition, all leases are 
short-term (generally one year or less) and enable the Company to seek market 
rentals upon reletting the sites.  Such leases generally minimize the risk to 
the Company of any adverse effect of inflation.

OTHER

Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association of Real 
Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as net income excluding gains (or losses) 
from debt restructuring and sales of property plus rental property 
depreciation and amortization.  Management believes that FFO is an important 
and widely used measure of the operating performance of REIT's which provides 
a relevant basis for comparison among REITs.  For all periods presented, 
depreciation of rental property is the only non-cash adjustment.  FFO (i) 
does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted 
accounting principles; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net 
income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, 
investing and financing activities; and (iii) is not an alternative to cash 
flows as a measure of liquidity.  FFO is calculated as follows:

                                                    For the year            
                                                  ended December 31,

all material respects, the financial position of Chateau Properties, Inc. as

                        NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                             ---------------------


1.   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND FORMATION OF COMPANY:

     The accompanying financial statements consist of the consolidated financial
     statements of Chateau Properties, Inc. (the "Company"), a Real Estate
     Investment Trust (REIT).  The Company is engaged in the business of owning
     and operating 47 manufactured housing community properties in Michigan,
     Illinois, Florida, Minnesota and North Dakota.  In addition the Company
     owns 6 properties through a joint venture with ROC Communities, Inc. A
     manufactured housing community is real estate designed and improved with
     sites for placement of manufactured homes.  The owner of the home leases
     the site from the Company generally for a term of one year or less.

     On November 23, 1993, the Company completed a public offering of 5,700,000
     shares of $.01 par value common stock (the "Offering").  Simultaneous with
     the Offering, the Company contributed the net proceeds from the Offering
     and was admitted as the sole general partner, with an approximate 41
     percent interest, in an operating partnership (the "Operating Partnership")
     representing the successor owner of 33 manufactured housing community
     properties.  These properties were contributed by the owners of Chateau
     Properties Group (the "Predecessor") to the Operating Partnership in
     exchange for limited partnership interests (OP units) which, subject to
     certain limitations, are exchangeable at any time at the option of the
     holders for common stock of the Company on a one-for-one basis.  The
     Predecessor consisted of the manufactured housing community properties of
     Chateau Estates, a Michigan co-partnership, of InterCoastal Communities,
     Inc. and its affiliates and of six co-partnerships affiliated with Leonard
     Maas (the "Contributing Parties").  This business combination was accounted
     for as a reorganization of entities under common control, and accordingly,
     there were no changes in the basis of assets and liabilities.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

     Principles of Consolidation

     As the sole general partner, the Company has unilateral control and
     complete responsibility for management of the Operating Partnership
     including the right and power to make all decisions and actions with
     respect to the acquisition, mortgage and sale of properties and the other
     business affairs of the Operating Partnership.  Accordingly, these
     financial statements include the accounts of Chateau Properties, Inc. and
     the Operating Partnership.  All significant inter-entity balances and
     transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED:

     Majority Interest

     Income before majority interest is ascribed to the limited partners of the
     Operating Partnership (the "Majority Interest") based on their respective
     weighted average ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership.  The
     ownership percentage is determined by dividing the number of OP units held
     by the Majority interest by total OP units outstanding including the units
     held by the Company.  Issuance of additional shares of common stock or OP
     units changes the percentage ownership of both the Majority Interest and
     the Company.  Since an OP unit is equivalent to a common share (due to,
     among other things, its exchange ability for a common share), such
     transactions are treated as capital transactions and result in an equity
     transfer adjustment among shareholders' equity and Majority Interest in 
     the Company's balance sheet to account for the change in the respective
     ownership in the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

     Estimates

     The preparation of these financial statements involves the use of certain
     management estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and
     disclosures, such as the useful lives of rental properties.  Actual results
     could differ from estimates.

     Revenue Recognition

     Rental income is recognized when earned and due from residents. The leases
     entered into by residents for the rental of a site are generally for terms
     not longer than one year and renewable upon the consent of both parties or,
     in some instances, as provided by statute.

     Rental Property

     Rental property is carried at the lower of cost, less accumulated
     depreciation, or fair value.  Management evaluates the recoverability of
     its investment in rental property in accordance with Statement of Financial
     Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121, "Accounting for Impairment of Long-
     Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets To Be Disposed Of".  This statement
     requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events
     or changes in circumstances indicate that full asset recoverability is
     questionable.  Management's assessment of recoverability of its rental
     property under this statement includes, but is not limited to, recent
     operating results, expected net operating cash flow and management's plans
     for future operations.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 121 in 1995 and the
     adoption had no effect on the results of operations or financial condition
     of the Company.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED:

     Depreciation on manufactured home communities is computed primarily on the
     straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  The
     estimated useful lives of the various classes of rental property assets are
     primarily as follows:

                                                            ESTIMATED USEFUL
                  CLASS OF ASSET                             LIVES (YEARS)
     Manufactured home community improvements                  20 to 30
     Community buildings                                       25 to 30
     Furniture and other equipment                              4 to 10

     Maintenance, repairs and minor improvements to rental properties are
     expensed when incurred.  Major improvements and renewals are capitalized.
     When rental property assets are sold or otherwise retired, the cost of such
     property assets, net of accumulated depreciation compared to the sale
     proceeds, are recognized in income as gains or losses on disposition.

     Income Taxes

     The Company has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust
     ("REIT") under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
     amended.  The Company generally will not be subject to Federal income tax
     to the extent it distributes its REIT taxable income to its shareholders.
     REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational
     requirements.  If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable
     year, the Company will be subject to Federal income tax (including any
     applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular
     corporate rates.  The Company remains subject to certain state and local
     taxes on its income and property as well as Federal income and excise taxes
     on its undistributed income.

     Per Share Data

     Earnings per share are computed based upon the weighted average number of
     common shares outstanding during the period.  The conversion of an OP unit
     to common stock has no effect on earnings per common share since the
     earnings of an OP unit are equivalent to the earnings of a share of common
     stock.  Common stock equivalents for outstanding stock options are not
     materially dilutive for any period presented.  SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per
     Share" when adopted in 1997 will not have an impact on reported earnings
     per share.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED:

     Stock-Based Compensation

     During 1996 the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 for "Accounting for Stock-
     Based Compensation."  The Company has elected to continue to account for
     employee stock based compensation under Accounting Principles Board ("APB")
     Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and therefore
     the disclosure method as permitted and required by SFAS No. 123 is
     presented in Note 6.

     Cash Equivalents

     All highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or
     less are considered to be cash equivalents.

     Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments"
     requires disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments whether
     or not such instruments are recognized in the balance sheet.  Due to the
     short-term nature of the Company's financial instruments, other than debt,
     fair values are not materially different from their carrying values.

     Based on the borrowing rates available to the Company, the carrying value
     of debt approximates fair value.

     Debt Issuance Costs

     Costs incurred related to obtaining financing such as service and
     commitment fees are deferred and are amortized over the term of the related
     commitment/loans.  These costs net of accumulated amortization are included
     in prepaid expenses and other assets in the accompanying balance sheets.

     Financial Statement Reclassifications

     Certain amounts in prior year financial statements have been reclassified
     to conform with presentations adopted in the current year.

3.   ACQUISITIONS OF RENTAL PROPERTY CONTINUED

     (1)  Represents a 50 percent interest in a joint venture with ROC accounted
          for as a property acquisition and included in rental properties.

     (2)  In connection with a joint venture, the Company may guarantee up to $8
          million of debt in return for a guarantee fee.

     (3)  In connection with these two acquisitions, the Company assumed
          approximately $56 million in debt.

4.   FINANCING:

     At December 31, 1996, the Company had a $50 million line of credit
     arrangement with Huntington National Bank as lead agent for a bank group 
     to provide financing for future construction, acquisitions and general
     business obligations.  The line of credit is unsecured, bears interest at
     the prime rate of interest or, at the Company's option, LIBOR plus 150
     basis points.  At December 31, 1996, there was $36.7 million in borrowings
     outstanding on the line of credit.  The commitment contains customary 
     covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio and a restriction on 
     the incurrence of additional collateralized indebtedness without a 
     corresponding increase in rental property.  The line is renewable annually
     through January 1999.  The terms of the line of credit provide for the 
     payment of a fee of up to 12.5 basis points on the average daily unused
     amount of the line of credit.

     On March 2, 1995, the Company received approximately $74.3 million in net
     proceeds from the issuance of $75 million of unsecured Senior Notes (the
     "Notes") by the Operating Partnership.  The Notes have semi-annual interest
     payments, an effective fixed interest rate of 8.79 percent per annum and
     mature on March 2, 2000.  The Notes contain certain covenants including a
     restriction on the incurrence of collateralized indebtedness subject to
     certain provisions.

     The following table sets forth certain information regarding debt at
     December 31:

5.   MAJORITY INTEREST IN OPERATING PARTNERSHIP:

     Majority interest in the accompanying balance sheets represents the
     ownership interest in the Operating Partnership held by other than the
     Company.  As of December 31, 1996 and December 31, 1995, the majority
     interest was approximately 61 percent and 59 percent, respectively.  
     After the February 1997 merger with ROC, the majority interest will 
     become a minority interest of approximately 10 percent.

     During 1996 and 1995 the Company, through the Operating Partnership,
     purchased and retired 43,334 and 44,085 OP units, respectively, at
     approximately $21.50 and $20.00 per unit, respectively.

     On May 23, 1995, certain Operating Partnership unit holders exercised their
     right to exchange their OP units into 335,460 shares of common stock of the
     Company at a one for one exchange rate.  This transaction resulted in an
     increase to outstanding common shares, and a corresponding decrease in
     outstanding OP units.  In connection with this transaction, there were no
     proceeds received nor expenses incurred by the Company.

     The following is a summary of activity of the majority interest in the
     Operating Partnership for the periods presented including the transfer
     adjustment among the majority interest and shareholders' equity in the
     balance sheet to account for the change in the respective ownership in 
     the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

6. STOCK OPTION PLAN:

   The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting
   for Stock-Based Compensation," effective with the 1996 financial statements.
   The Company, however, has elected to measure compensation cost using the
   intrinsic value method, in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25 ("APB 25"),
   "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."

   The Company's 1993 Long Term Incentive Stock Plan, as amended on May 18,
   1995, (the "Plan") provides for up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock that
   may be granted to directors, executive officers and other key employees.
   Options granted under the Plan generally vest at a rate of 25 percent per
   year and expire in 10 years.  The Plan provides for the grant of options at
   "fair market value" per share, which represents the quoted market price of
   the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  The Plan also provides for
   the grant of restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights.

   Information concerning stock options is as follows:

     If compensation cost for stock option grants had been recognized based on
     the fair value at the grant dates for 1996 and 1995 consistent with the
     method prescribed by SFAS 123, net income and net income per share would
     have been $6,457,000 and $1.07 for the year ended December 31, 1996 and
     $5,268,000 and $.88 for the year ended December 31, 1995.

7.   SAVINGS PLAN:

     The Company has a qualified retirement plan designed to qualify under
     Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Plan").  The Plan allows the
     employees of the Company to defer a portion of their eligible compensation
     on a pre-tax basis subject to certain maximum amounts.  Contributions by
     the Company are discretionary and determined by the Company's management.
     Company contributions are allocated to each participant based on the
     relative compensation of the participant to the compensation of all
     participants.  The Company contributed approximately $300,000 and  $275,000
     to the 401(k) Plan for the Plan years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995,
     respectively.

8.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

     In order to permit the Company's qualification as a REIT under the Internal
     Revenue Code, the operations of four golf courses and a marina were
     previously conducted by GC Properties, Inc. ("GCI"), a corporation wholly
     owned by an equity owner of the Company.  Prior to 1996, the Company
     recognized net lease income from GCI which was classified as other income.
     In early 1996, the Company received a ruling from the Internal Revenue
     Service allowing it to conduct these operations.  Effective January 1,
     1996, as a result of acquiring the operations of GCI, the Company has
     consolidated these operations.  For the year ended December 31, 1996 the
     Company has included approximately $1.7 million in revenues and $1.0
     million in operating expenses for these operations. For the years ended
     December 31, 1995 and 1994 net lease income of approximately $695,000 and
     $100,000, respectively was recognized. Rental expense of approximately
     $100,000 annually has been incurred for leasing space in an office building
     owned by certain officers and equity owners.  The lease expires November
     2001.

9. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM - EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT:

    The extraordinary charge in the accompanying statements of income represent
    prepayment penalties and certain other related costs incurred in connection
    with the early extinguishment of debt.

10. CONTINGENCIES:

    The Company, as an owner of real estate, is subject to various environmental
    laws.  Compliance by the Company with existing laws has not had a material
    adverse financial effect during the three year period ended December 31,
    1996, nor does management believe it will have a material impact in the
    future.  However, management cannot predict the impact of new or changed 
    laws or regulations on its current properties or properties that it may 
    acquire.

    Several claims and legal actions arising from the normal course of business,
    none of which are environmental related matters, have been asserted against
    the Company, and are pending final resolution.  Although the amount of
    liability at December 31, 1996, if any, with respect to these matters is not
    determinable, in the opinion of management, none of these matters will 
    result in material liability.

      (a)  Operating income represents total revenues less property operating 
           and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and administrative 
           expense.  Operating income is a measure of the performance of the 
           properties before the effects of depreciation and interest and 
           related amortization costs.

      (b)  Quarterly earnings per common share amounts may not total to the full
           year amounts due to rounding and to the change in the number of 
           common shares outstanding.

     -    The Company repurchased and retired 1,200,000 shares of its common
          stock, of which 450,000 were repurchased in 1996

          ROC stock outstanding

          of .068 shares of common stock
