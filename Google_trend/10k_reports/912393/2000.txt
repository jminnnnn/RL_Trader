- -------   --------

General Development of Business

Chateau Communities, Inc. (the "Company"), a self-administered and self-managed
equity real estate investment trust ("REIT"), is one of the largest
owner/manager of manufactured home communities in the United States.  The
Company conducts substantially all of its activities through CP Limited
Partnership, a Maryland limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership"), in
which it owns, directly and through ROC Communities, Inc. ("ROC"), the other
general partner of the Operating Partnership, an approximate 89% general partner
interest.  The Company owns and operates 165 manufactured home community
properties (the "Properties") containing 51,659 homesites and 1,359 park
model/RV sites in 28 states.  The Company also fee manages 44 manufactured home
community properties containing 9,718 homesites.  The Company is also involved
in the development and expansion of manufactured home communities, and through
its subsidiary, Community Sales, Inc. (CSI), the sale of new and pre-owned
homes, brokerage of used homes and assisting residents in arranging of financing
and insurance services.

Formation of the Company

The Company was formed in Maryland on August 25, 1993, as Chateau Properties,
Inc., to continue and expand the manufactured home community operations and
business objectives of Chateau Estates ("Chateau"), a Michigan co-partnership.
Chateau had developed, owned and operated manufactured home communities and
properties since 1966.

On February 11, 1997, the Company completed a strategic merger of equals with
ROC (the "Merger").  The Merger and related transactions were accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.  Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of ROC were
adjusted to fair value for financial accounting purposes and the results of
operations of ROC are included in the results of operations of the Company
beginning in February 1997.

Industry Overview

A manufactured home community is a residential subdivision designed and improved
with homesites for the placement of manufactured homes, including related
improvements and amenities.  Manufactured homes are detached, single-family
homes which are produced off-site by manufacturers and installed on sites within
the community.  Manufactured homes are available in a variety of architectural
styles and floor plans, offering a variety of amenities, custom options and on-
site built additional structures.

Modern manufactured home communities are similar to typical residential
subdivisions and generally contain centralized entrances, paved streets, curbs
and gutters and parkways.  In addition, such communities often provide a variety
of amenities to residents which may include a clubhouse, swimming pools and
jacuzzis, playgrounds, basketball courts, picnic areas, shuffleboard courts,
tennis courts, cable television service, golf courses, marinas and laundry
facilities.  Utilities are provided or arranged for by the owner of the
community.  Some communities provide water and sewer service through public or
private utilities, while others provide these services to residents from on-site
facilities.


                                       3
<PAGE>

The owner of each home in a manufactured home community leases a site from the
community.  The manufactured home community is the owner of the underlying land,
utility connections, streets, lighting, driveways, common area amenities and
other capital improvements and is responsible for enforcement of community
guidelines and maintenance.  Each owner within the manufactured home community
is responsible for the maintenance of his home and leased site.  Additionally,
manufactured home communities tend to have stable resident bases, with
relatively few residents moving manufactured homes out of the communities.
Management thus tends to be more stable, and capital expenditure needs less
significant, relative to multi-family rental apartment complexes.

Operating and Investment Strategies

The Company seeks to maximize long-term growth in income and portfolio value
through active management and expansion of certain of its manufactured home
communities and the selective acquisition and development of additional
communities.  The Company focuses on manufactured home communities that have
growth potential and expects to hold such properties for long-term investment
and capital appreciation.  The Company's operating and investment strategies
include:

Operations

     *    Providing attractive and desirable manufactured home communities for
          existing and prospective residents;

     *    Maintaining and upgrading communities on a continuous basis through a
          program of regular and preventive maintenance and replacement;

     *    Offering residents accessibility to on-site managers to maximize
          retention, encourage home maintenance and improvements to minimize
          turnover;

     *    Providing frequent personal contact between on-site managers and
          residents to foster a sense of pride in the community and to promote
          desirability of each property;

     *    Offering potential community residents the convenience of purchasing a
          home already in place within the community or ordering a new product;

     *    Increasing value to residents and shareholders of the Company by
          providing additional value-added services to residents; and

     *    Assisting potential residents in securing financing and insurance for
          their home.

Development, Expansions and Acquisitions

     *    Utilizing the expertise and relationships developed by the Company's
          management to identify new development opportunities;

     *    Selectively developing new communities in strategically desirable
          regions where development is supported by favorable demographics and
          strong market demand; and

     *    Capitalizing on opportunities to renovate and expand properties
          consistent with local market demand;


                                       4
<PAGE>

     *    Selectively acquiring well-located manufactured home communities that
          demonstrate the potential for increases in revenue and cash flow
          through professional property management, improved operating
          efficiencies, aggressive leasing and, where appropriate, expansion on
          adjacent land;

     *    Acquiring properties in existing markets in order to achieve economies
          of scale in operations, and in new markets where portfolios may be
          acquired with regional management in place.


Financing Strategies

The Company intends to maintain a conservative and flexible capital structure
that enables it to  (i) continue to access the capital markets on favorable
terms;  (ii) enhance potential earnings growth;  (iii) minimize its level of
encumbered assets; and  (iv) limit its exposure to variable rate debt.  The
Company intends to maintain a debt-to-market capitalization ratio of
approximately 50% or less.  The Company, however, may from time to time re-
evaluate this policy and decrease or increase such ratio accordingly in light of
then current economic conditions, relative costs to the Company of debt and
equity capital, market values of the properties and other factors.

Expansion and Improvement of Manufactured Home Community Properties

The Company will seek to increase the income generated from its manufactured
home communities by expanding the number of sites available to be leased to
residents if justified by local market conditions and permitted by zoning and
other applicable laws, and by filling vacant sites.  During 1999, the Company
substantially completed the development of 525 expansion sites.  As of December
31, 1999, the Company owned undeveloped land adjacent to existing communities
containing approximately 5,600 expansion sites, which are zoned for manufactured
housing.  This undeveloped land will facilitate additional growth to the extent
market conditions warrant.  In addition, where appropriate, the Company will
consider upgrading or adding facilities and amenities to certain communities in
order to make those communities more attractive in their markets.

The Company is currently involved in seven joint ventures to construct ground-up
"greenfield communities".  In the majority of the arrangements, the Company acts
as the developer or co-developer, performs all accounting and property
management functions and, in many of the arrangements, the Company acts as a
lender to finance the development costs.  As such, the Company advances amounts
to the joint ventures to fund construction and recognizes the related interest
income as earned.  The Company primarily borrows on its line of credit to fund
the advances and, accordingly, includes the related borrowing costs in interest
expense and the related debt in its balance sheet.  In the majority of the
arrangements, the Company has the option to purchase the completed community
when it reaches a pre-determined occupancy rate.  Based on the Company's
ownership in these joint ventures the Company accounts for the investment
utilizing the equity method of accounting for six of these ventures.  The
Company is also involved in two joint ventures in which the communities are
being constructed by its joint venture partner.  The Company has similar
arrangements to lend these joint ventures funds to finance development.  Based
on the Company's investment in these ventures, the Company accounts for its
investments utilizing the equity method of accounting.

                                                                     =======


Community Sales, Inc.

The Company conducts its sales and brokerage activities through CSI, which is
operated as a taxable subsidiary of the Operating Partnership.  During 1999, CSI
sold 587 new or pre-owned homes and brokered the sales of 1,273 homes.  CSI also
has a Financial Services Division, which arranges financing and insurance
services for prospective residents.  During 1999, the Financial Services
Division arranged financing on approximately 863 loans.

Affiliated Companies

In September 1997, the Company completed the acquisition of The Windsor
Corporation ("Windsor"), the general partner in five partnerships and advisor to
one REIT, N'Tandem Trust ("N'Tandem", previously known as Windsor Real Estate
Investment Trust 8).  These six entities owned 30 manufactured home communities
(containing 6,300 homesites), all of which have been managed by the Company or
ROC on a fee basis since 1993.

In March 1998, the Company entered into an investment agreement ("Agreement")
with N'Tandem.  Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company purchased 19,139 common
equity shares of N'Tandem. The Company owns approximately 10 percent of
N'Tandem's outstanding stock and recognizes income from an advisory agreement
and interest income on the notes as earned.

During 1998, in order to finance acquisitions, N'Tandem borrowed $10.7 million
from the Company through the issuance of notes which were due November 1999 and
bore interest at the prime rate of interest plus one percent per annum.  These
notes were refinanced and the maturities extended by the Company in 1999. Also,
during 1999, N'Tandem borrowed $ 23.6 million from the Company for the
acquisition of 6 communities.  During 1999 N'Tandem obtained a line of credit
and repaid $10.7 million of these notes to the Company. As of December 31, 1999,
N'Tandem owed the Company $ 23.6 million under unsecured notes that are due
December 31, 2000 and bear interest at the prime rate of interest plus one
percent.

As of December 31, 1999 N'Tandem owned 12 communities with 2,644 homesites and
an interest in 7 communities with 1,345 homesites.

Competition

Many of the Properties are located in developed areas that include other
manufactured home communities. The number of competitive manufactured home
community properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the
Company's ability to lease sites at its communities and on the rents charged. In
addition, other forms of multi-family residential properties and single-family
housing provide housing alternatives to residents.

Employees

As of December 31, 1999, the Company had approximately 1,183 full and part-time
employees.  The Company utilizes a resident administrator for the on-site
administration of each of the Properties.  Important duties of on-site
administrators as well as the office manager include extensive contact with
residents through initial introduction to community guidelines and on-going
accessibility for resident assistance. Typically, clerical and maintenance
workers are employed to assist in the management and care of residents and
properties. Direct supervision of on-site administrators is the responsibility
of the Company's regional vice presidents and managers and four divisional
presidents.  These individuals have significant experience in addressing the
needs of residents and in finding or creating innovative approaches to value
maximization and increasing cash flow from property operations.  Field
management staff is also supported by approximately 60 corporate employees who
assist on-site administrators in all the property management functions.

Commitment to resident satisfaction is demonstrated by the ongoing training that
the Company provides for on-site staff.  Community administrators meet
periodically at regional and divisional seminars to review Company philosophy
and policy, to discuss relevant administration issues and solutions and to share
ideas and experiences.

Tax Status

The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Section 856(c) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  The Company generally
will not be subject to Federal income tax to the extent it distributes 95
percent of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders. REITs are subject to a
number of organizational and operational requirements. If the Company fails to
qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to Federal
income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable
income at regular corporate rates.  As a REIT, the Company is subject to certain
state and local taxes on its income and property and Federal income and excise
taxes to the extent of its undistributed income.

Item 2.   Properties
- -------   ----------

At December 31, 1999, the Properties consisted of 165 manufactured home
communities containing 51,659 homesites and 1,359 park model/RV sites, in 28
states, with amenities designed for either retirement or family living.  The
Company also fee managed 44 manufactured home communities containing 9,718 sites
in 15 states.  The Company also owned land adjacent to certain existing
communities containing approximately 5,600 expansion sites which, although not
yet developed, was zoned for manufactured housing.

At December 31, 1999, the Properties had an occupancy rate of approximately 91.7
percent with weighted average rent for the year ended December 31, 1999 of $302
per month.  This compares to an occupancy rate of 92.4 percent and with weighted
average rent of $292 per month for the prior year.  Weighted average rent is
calculated as rental and utility income for the period, on a monthly basis,
divided by the weighted average occupied sites.  Weighted average occupancy is
computed by averaging the number of revenue producing sites at the end of each
month in the period.

The Company believes that the Properties provide amenities and common facilities
that create a safe and attractive community for residents. All of the Properties
provide residents with attractive amenities with most offering a clubhouse, a
swimming pool, and playgrounds.  Many Properties offer additional amenities such
as sauna/whirlpool spas, indoor pools, tennis courts, libraries, shuffleboard
courts, basketball courts, golf courses, day care facilities, exercise rooms,
marinas and laundry facilities.

Since residents own their homes, it is their responsibility to maintain their
homes and the surrounding area. The communities have extensive guidelines for
maintenance.  It is management's role to provide maintenance of common areas,
facilities and amenities and to ensure that residents comply with community
policies.  The Company holds periodic meetings of its property management
personnel for training and implementation of the Company's strategies, and
property administrators make a daily inspection of the Properties.  The Company
believes that, due in part to this strategy, the Properties historically have
had and will continue to have low turnover and high occupancy rates.  Since
1989, the Properties have averaged an annual turnover of homes (where the home
is moved out of the community) of three to four percent.

Leases

The typical lease entered into between the resident and one of the Company's
manufactured home communities for the rental of a site is month-to-month or
year-to-year, renewable upon the consent of both parties or, in some instances,
as provided by statute.

Property Information

The Company classifies all of its properties in either the Stable Portfolio or
the Active Expansion Portfolio.  The Stable Portfolio includes the communities
where the Company does not have, or has not recently had, expansion of the
community.  These communities generally have stable occupancy rates.  The Active
Expansion Portfolio are those properties where the Company is currently, or has
recently, expanded the community by adding homesites to the available homesites
for rental.  Generally, these communities will have a lower occupancy rate than
our Stable Portfolio as they are in the lease-up phase.  In addition, the
Company owns three park model/RV communities.

The following table sets forth certain information, as of December 31, 1999,
regarding the Properties.

*  These properties are included in the Active Expansion Portfolio.

          other related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt.

     (3)  Does not include 1,359 park model/RV sites, purchased in 1998.

     (4)  Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association
          of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as consolidated net income
          of the Company without giving effect to gains (or losses) from debt
          restructuring and sales of property, certain non-recurring items and
          rental property depreciation and amortization.  Management believes
          that FFO is an important and widely used measure of the operating
          performance of REITs, which provides a relevant basis for comparison
          among REITs. FFO (i) does not represent cash flow from operations as
          defined by generally accepted accounting principles; (ii) should not
          be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of
          operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and
          financing activities; and (iii) is not an alternative to cash flows as
          a measure of liquidity.  FFO is calculated as follows:

NAREIT has revised its definition of FFO.  The Company plans to adopt the new
definition effective January 1, 2000.  The new definition of FFO substantially
eliminates the add back of the non-recurring items in the calculation of the
FFO.  The application of this new definition would not have affected reported
FFO for calendar year 1999 or 1997, and would have decreased FFO in 1998 by
$375,000.

Item 7.    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
- -------    --------------------------------------------------------------
Results of Operations
- ---------------------

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere  in this Annual
Report.  Certain statements in this discussion constitute "forward-looking
statements" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements may involve the Company's
plans, objectives and expectations, which are dependent upon a number of
factors, including site expansions, acquisitions, development and other new
business initiatives that are subject to a number of contingency factors such as
the effects of national and local economic conditions, changes in interest
rates, supply and demand for affordable housing and the condition of the capital
markets that may prevent the Company from achieving its objectives.

Overview

The Company is one of the largest owner/managers of manufactured home
communities in the United States. The Company added a net of 118 manufactured
home communities to its portfolio over the three-year period ended December 31,
1999.  At the end of this period, the Company's portfolio was comprised of 165
manufactured home communities containing 51,659 manufactured homesites and 1,359
park model/RV sites, located in 28 states.

Company growth since the beginning of 1997 can be attributed to the Company's
merger with ROC in February 1997 (the "Merger"), as well as acquisitions,
increased operating performance at existing communities, community expansions,
and new community development.  During 1998, the Company acquired 34 communities
(the "Acquisition Properties") in four separate portfolio acquisitions,
containing an aggregate of 7,045 manufactured homesites and 1,359 park model/RV
sites.  During 1999, the Company acquired 2 communities, containing 624 sites.

Since its organization, the Company has elected to qualify as a REIT under the
Internal Revenue Code and thus does not generally pay federal corporate income
taxes on its earnings to the extent that such earnings are distributed to
shareholders.

The Company conducts substantially all of its activities through CP Limited
Partnership ("the Operating Partnership") in which it owned a combined 89
percent general partner interest as of December 31, 1999.

For the year ended December 31, 1999, income before minority interests was
$44,962,000, an increase of $10,476,000 from the year ended December 31, 1998.
The increase was due primarily to acquisitions and increased net operating
income from the Core 1998 Portfolio.  The increase in net operating income from
the Company's Core 1998 Portfolio was due to increased occupancy and rental
increases partially offset by general operating expense increases.  Rental
revenue for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $177,789,000, an increase of
$10,583,000 from 1998.  Approximately 30 percent of the increase was due to
acquisitions, net of dispositions, and 70 percent was due to rental increases
and occupancy gains in the Company's Core 1998 Portfolio.

Weighted average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 1999 was 47,181 sites
compared with 45,882 sites for the same period in 1998.  The Company also added
525 available sites to its portfolio through the expansion of its communities.
The occupancy rate for the total portfolio was 91.7 percent on 51,659 sites as
of December 31, 1999, compared to 92.4 percent on 51,101 sites as of December
31, 1998.  The occupancy rate on the stabilized portfolio was 93.2 percent as of
December 31, 1999. On a per site basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue
for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $302 compared with $292 for the same
period in 1998. For the Company's Core 1998 Portfolio, on a per site basis,
weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1999 was
$307 compared with $295 for the same period in 1998, an increase of 4.0 percent.

Management fee, interest and other income primarily include management fee and
transaction fee income for the management of 44 manufactured home communities,
equity earnings from the Company's sales subsidiary, CSI, and interest income on
notes receivable and advances to affiliates.  The increase in 1999 from 1998 is
due primarily to increased development activities in which the Company funds the
development costs and recognizes interest income and expenses, increased equity
earnings from CSI, increased advances to affiliates other than for development,
and increases in management and transaction fees from properties managed by the
Company.

Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 1999
increased by $3,412,000 or 7.3 percent from the same period a year ago.  The
majority of the increase was due to acquisitions and increases in the Company's
Core 1998 Portfolio.  On a per site basis, monthly weighted average property
operating and maintenance expense increased to $89.21 per site, or 4.3 percent.

Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 1999 increased by $424,000 or
3.5 percent from the year ended December 31, 1998.  The increase is due
primarily to acquisitions and expansions of communities and general increases.
On a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate taxes were $22.39 in
1999 compared to $22.25 in 1998, an increase of .63 percent.  Real estate taxes
may increase or decrease due to inflation, expansions and improvements of
communities, as well as changes in taxation in the tax jurisdictions in which
the Company operates.

Administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 1999 increased primarily
due to the increased size of the Company.  Administrative expense in 1999 was
5.2 percent of total revenues as compared to 4.8 percent in 1998.

Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December
31, 1999 by $1,031,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1998.  The
increase is attributable primarily to the indebtedness incurred to finance
acquisitions and development.  Interest expense as a percentage of average debt
outstanding decreased to approximately 7.4 percent from 7.7 percent in 1998.

Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 1999, increased $2,168,000
from the same period a year ago.  The increase is directly attributable to
acquisitions and expansions.  Depreciation expense as a percentage of average
depreciable rental property in 1999 remained relatively unchanged from 1998.

For the year ended December 31, 1998, income before minority interests was
$34,486,000, an increase of $9,798,000 from the year ended December 31, 1997.
The increase was due primarily to acquisitions and the Merger, as well as
increased net operating income from the Core 1997 Portfolio.  The increase in
net operating income from the Company's Core 1997 Portfolio was due to increased
occupancy and rental increases partially offset by general operating expense
increases.  Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1998 was
$167,206,000, an increase of $32,405,000 from 1997.  Approximately 57 percent
was due to acquisitions and 18 percent was due to the Merger.  The remaining 25
percent increase was due to rental increases and occupancy gains in the
Company's Core 1997 Portfolio.

Weighted average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 1998 was 45,882 sites
compared with 38,053 sites for the same period in 1997. During 1998, the Company
increased occupancy by 627 sites, of which 344 were in its active expansion
communities.  The Company also added 407 sites to its portfolio through the
expansion of its communities.  The occupancy rate for the total portfolio was
92.4 percent on 51,101 sites as of December 31, 1998, compared to 92.0 percent
on 43,800 sites as of December 31, 1997.  The occupancy rate on the stabilized
portfolio was 94.0 percent as of December 31, 1998. On a per site basis,
weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1998 was
$292 compared with $287 for the same period in 1997. For the Company's Core 1997
Portfolio, on a per site basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue for the
year ended December 31, 1998 was $299 compared with $286 for the same period in
1997, an increase of 4.5 percent.

                                       21

Management fee, interest and other income primarily include management fee
income for the management of 36 manufactured home communities, equity earnings
from the Company's sales subsidiary, CSI, and interest income on notes
receivable and advances to affiliates.  The increase in 1998 from 1997 is due
primarily to increased development activities in which the Company funds the
development costs and recognizes interest income and expense.

Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 1998
increased by 20.3 percent from the same period a year ago.  The majority of the
increase was due to the acquisitions and the Merger. The remaining increase was
due to increases in the Company's Core 1997 Portfolio.  On a per site basis,
monthly weighted average property operating and maintenance expense remained
constant at $86.

Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 1998 increased by $2,305,000
or 23.2 percent from the year ended December 31, 1997.  The increase is due
primarily to acquisitions and expansions of communities, the Merger and general
increases.  On a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate taxes were
$22.25 in 1998 compared to $21.78 in 1997, an increase of 2.2 percent.  Real
estate taxes may increase or decrease due to inflation, expansions and
improvements of communities, as well as changes in taxation in the tax
jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

Administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 1998 increased due to
acquisitions and the Merger. Administrative expense in 1998 was 4.8 percent of
total revenues as compared to 5.0 percent in 1997.

Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December
31, 1998 by $5,369,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1997.  The
increase is attributable primarily to the indebtedness incurred to finance the
acquisitions.  Interest expense as a percentage of average debt outstanding
remained relatively constant at approximately 7.7 percent.

Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 1998, increased $8,148,000
from the same period a year ago.  The increase is directly attributable to
acquisitions and the Merger.  Depreciation expense as a percentage of average
depreciable rental property in 1998 remained relatively unchanged from 1997.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash provided by operating activities was $77,464,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1999, compared to $72,560,000 for the same period in 1998.  The
increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the
increase in net operating income.

Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 1999 was
$20,789,000.  This consisted primarily of $60,244,000 in dividends and
distributions paid to shareholders and OP Unitholders and $23,598,000 in payoffs
of mortgages, offset partially by net borrowings on the Company's lines of
credit of $60,581,000.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1999 was
$56,777,000.  This amount represents acquisitions, joint venture investments and
advances, capital expenditures and development costs. During 1999, the Company
acquired two communities with a total of 624 sites and purchased a development
property in Michigan.  These acquisitions were financed primarily by borrowings
under the Company's lines of credit.  The Company also disposed of two
properties containing 509 sites.

During 1999, the Company invested approximately $14 million in the expansion of
its existing communities, resulting in the addition of 525 available sites to
its portfolio. In addition, during 1999, the Company invested or advanced $32
million to certain affiliates of the Company.  This consisted


                                       22
<PAGE>

primarily of approximately $16 million to 9 joint ventures, through which the
Company, or its joint venture partner is developing manufactured home
communities, and $13.5 million to N'Tandem Trust, an entity in which the Company
owns approximately 10 percent of its outstanding equity. For the year ended
December 31, 1999, recurring property capital expenditures, other than
development costs, were approximately $7 million. Capital expenditures have
historically been financed out of funds from operations and it is the Company's
intention that such future expenditures will also be financed with funds from
operations.

As of December 31, 1999, the Company had a line of credit with Bank One, N.A.,
acting as lead agent, for $100 million (the "Bank One Credit Facility").  The
interest rate is at LIBOR plus 80 basis points, and matures in May 2001.  In
addition to the Bank One Credit Facility, the Company had a $7.5 million
revolving line of credit from US Bank which bears interest at a rate of LIBOR
plus 125 basis points and a maturity of September 2000 (the "USB Facility" and,
together with the Bank One Credit Facility, the "Credit Facilities").  As of
December 31, 1999, approximately $97.3 million was outstanding under the Credit
Facilities and the Company had available $10.2 million in additional borrowing
capacity.

As of December 31, 1999, the Company had outstanding, in addition to the Credit
Facilities, $245 million of unsecured senior debt with a weighted average
interest rate and remaining maturity of 7.5 percent and 3.2 years, respectively,
and $106 million of secured mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate
and remaining maturity of 7.6 percent and 1.7 years, respectively.  As of
December 31, 1999, the Company had approximately $453 million of total debt
outstanding, representing approximately 33 percent of the Company's total market
capitalization.  All of the debt is fixed rate debt, other than the Company's
Credit Facilities, and has a weighted average interest rate of 7.5 percent.

In February 2000, the Company issued $100 million of 8.5% Unsecured Senior Notes
due March 1, 2005. The Company received net proceeds of nearly $99 million,
which were used to repay $75 million of 8.75% Senior Unsecured Notes which
matured March 2, 2000.  The remaining $24 million was used to repay a portion of
the borrowings on its line of credit.

The Company, in February, also entered into a $30 million note with Bank One,
N.A.  The note can be drawn on for thirty, sixty or ninety day increments
beginning February 18, 2000, and must be repaid in full on August 18, 2000.  The
note bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 125 basis points.  The funds
available under the note are expected to be used to fund short term liquidity
needs of the Company.

The Company has another $86 million coming due in 2000 which it expects to repay
with the proceeds from the issuance of secured or unsecured debt, depending on
the current market conditions.

On February 29, 2000, the Company announced the establishment of a share
repurchase program pursuant to which it may repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of
common stock from time to time.

In addition to repayment of long-term borrowings and amounts outstanding under
the Credit Facilities, future acquisitions of communities and land for
development and new community development activities represent the principal
long-term liquidity needs of the Company.  The Company does not expect to
generate sufficient funds from operations to finance these long-term liquidity
needs and instead intends to meet its long-term liquidity requirements through
additional borrowing under the Credit Facilities or other lines of credit, the
assumption of existing secured or unsecured indebtedness and depending on market
conditions and capital availability factors, the issuance of additional equity
or debt securities.

The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including
expansion activities and capital expenditure requirements and maturing debt
obligations, through cash flows from operations and, if necessary, borrowings
under the Credit Facilities and other lines of credit.

Inflation

All of the leases or terms of tenants' occupancies at the communities allow for
at least annual rental adjustments.  In addition, all leases are short-term
(generally one year or less) and enable the Company to seek market rentals upon
reletting the sites.  Such leases generally minimize the risk to the Company of
any adverse effect of inflation.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS
133"), which is effective for the Company in the year 2000.  The only derivative
instrument the Company currently utilizes is an interest rate hedge agreement
for $75 million of its senior notes.  SFAS 133 requires that all derivative
instruments be measured on the balance sheet at fair value.  The Company
anticipates that the adoption of SFAS 133 will not have a significant effect on
its 2000 financial statements.

In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No.
133," which delays the implementation of SFAS 133 for the Company's financial
statements to January 1, 2001.

In anticipation of the $75 million senior notes maturing on March 2, 2000, the
Company entered into a $75 million interest rate hedge transaction with a
financial institution in order to hedge its exposure to interest rate
fluctuations, with a maturity of April 2000.  Under this arrangement, the
Company pays or receives an amount equal to the difference between the hedge
rate and the market rate on the date of settlement, based on an anticipated $75
million borrowing.  The realized gain or loss on the transaction settlement date
will be recorded on the balance sheet and amortized to interest expense over the
period of the related notes.  At December 31, 1999, the treasury lock rate was
lower than the market rate, therefore, the Company has an unrealized gain of
approximately $692,000.

Year 2000

The year 2000 issue exists because many computer systems and applications
abbreviate dates by eliminating the first two digits of the year, assuming that
these two digits are always "19".  As a result, date-sensitive computer programs
may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000.
Unless corrected, the potential exists for computer system failures or incorrect
processing of financial and operational information, which could disrupt
operations.

The Company believes that all systems have been appropriately modified and does
not expect the year 2000 issue will materially impact the financial condition or
operations of the Company.

Other

Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association of Real
Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as consolidated net income of the Company
without giving effect to gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of
property, certain non-recurring items and rental property depreciation and
amortization.  Management believes that FFO is an important and widely used
measure of the operating performance of REITs, which provides a relevant basis
for comparison among REITs. FFO (i) does not represent cash flow from operations
as defined by generally accepted accounting principles; (ii) should not be
considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance
or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii)
is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.  FFO is
calculated as follows:

NAREIT has revised its definition of FFO.  The Company plans to adopt the new
definition effective January 1, 2000.  The new definition of FFO substantially
eliminates the add back of the non-recurring items in the calculation of the
FFO.  The application of this new would not have affected reported FFO for
calendar year 1999 or 1997, and would have decreased FFO in 1998 by $375,000.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
- --------  ----------------------------------------------------------

The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk.  Management
has and will continue to manage interest rate risk by  (1) maintaining a
conservative ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that
variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level and (2) taking advantage
of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity.  As of December
31, 1999, the Company's Credit Facilities represented its only variable rate
debt.

The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 1999, concerning
the Company's long term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by
scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value
("FV"):

In addition, the Company has assessed the market risk for its variable rate debt
and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would have an approximate
$973,000 increase in interest expense based on $97.3 million outstanding at
December 31, 1999.

The fair value of the Company's long term debt is estimated based on discounted
cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflects the risks
associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration.

                                    _______


1.    Organization and Formation of Company:
      -------------------------------------

Chateau Communities, Inc. (the "Company"), a real estate investment trust, was
formed in November 1993 as Chateau Properties, Inc.  In 1997, the Company merged
with ROC Communities, Inc. ("ROC").

The Company considers itself to be engaged in only one industry segment.  The
Company is engaged in the business of owning and operating manufactured housing
community properties primarily through CP Limited Partnership (the "Operating
Partnership").  As of December 31, 1999, the Company owned 165 properties
containing an aggregate of 51,659 homesites and 1,359 park model/RV sites,
located in 28 states.  Approximately 26 percent of these homesites were in
Florida and 31 percent were in Michigan.  The Company also fee managed 44
properties containing an aggregate of 9,718 homesites and 175 park model/RV
sites. A manufactured housing community is real estate designed and improved
with sites for placement of manufactured homes.  The owner of the home leases
the site from the Company generally for a term of one year or less.

2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
      ------------------------------------------

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the
Company, its wholly owned qualified REIT subsidiaries and its Operating
Partnership.  The Company and ROC are the general partners of the Operating
Partnership.  All significant inter-entity balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

The Company conducts manufactured home sales and brokerage activities through
its taxable subsidiary Community Sales, Inc. ("CSI").  The Company owns 100% of
the preferred stock of CSI and is entitled to 100% of its cash flow.  The
Company accounts for its investment in CSI utilizing the equity method of
accounting.

     -----------------------------------------------------

Minority Interests

Minority interests include common operating partnership units ("OP Units") which
are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of the Company's common
stock.  Issuance of additional shares of common stock or OP Units changes the
percentage ownership of both the minority interests and the Company.  Since an
OP Unit is equivalent to a common share (due to, among other things, its
exchangeability for a common share), such transactions are treated as capital
transactions and result in an equity transfer adjustment among shareholders'
equity and minority interests in the Company's balance sheet to account for the
change in the respective ownership in the underlying equity of the Operating
Partnership.

Income before minority interests is ascribed to the holders of common OP Units
based on their respective weighted average ownership percentage of the Operating
Partnership.  The ownership percentage is determined by dividing the number of
common OP Units held by the limited partners by the total common OP Units
outstanding including the OP Units held by the Company.

Also included in minority interests is approximately $73 million, which
represents 1.5 million 8.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units
("Preferred Units").  The Preferred Units are exchangeable on or after April 20,
2008 for authorized but unissued shares of 8.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock of the Company.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles involves the use of certain management estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Rental income is recognized when earned and due from residents. The leases
entered into by residents for the rental of a site are generally for terms not
longer than one year and are renewable upon the consent of both parties or, in
some instances, as provided by statute.

Rental Property

Rental property is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Management
evaluates the recoverability of its investment in rental property whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that full asset recoverability is
questionable.  Management's assessment of the recoverability of its rental
property includes, but is not limited to, recent operating results, expected net
operating cash flow and management's plans for future operations.  If a rental
property is determined to be significantly impaired, the asset is written down
to its estimated fair value.

Depreciation

Depreciation on manufactured home communities is computed primarily on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  The
estimated useful lives of the various classes of rental property assets are
primarily as follows:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
<S>                                         <C>
                                            Estimated Useful
Class of Asset                               Lives (Years)
- ------------------------------------------  ----------------
Manufactured home community improvements        20 to 30
Community buildings                             25 to 30
Furniture and other equipment                   3 to 10
</TABLE>

Maintenance, repairs and minor improvements to rental properties are expensed
when incurred.  Major improvements and renewals are capitalized.  When rental
property assets are sold or otherwise retired, the cost of such assets, net of
accumulated depreciation compared to the sale proceeds, are recognized in income
as gains or losses on disposition.

Capitalized Interest

Interest is capitalized on development projects during periods of construction
through the substantial completion of the site.  Interest capitalized by the
Company for the years ended December 31,1999, 1998, and 1997 was $1,249,000,
$579,000 and $708,000, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (REIT)
under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The
Company generally will not be subject to Federal income tax to the extent it
distributes its REIT taxable income to its shareholders.  REITs are subject to a
number of organizational and operational requirements.  If the Company fails to
qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to Federal
income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable
income at regular corporate rates.  The Company remains subject to certain state
and local taxes on its income and property as well as Federal income and excise
taxes on its undistributed income.

2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued:
     -----------------------------------------------------


Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share are computed based upon the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period.  The conversion of an OP Unit to
common stock has no effect on earnings per common share since the earnings of an
OP Unit are equivalent to the earnings of a share of common stock. Diluted
earnings per common share are computed assuming the exercise of all outstanding
stock options which would have a dilutive effect.

Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less
are considered to be cash equivalents.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year information to
conform to the current year presentation.  These reclassifications have no
impact on net operating results previously reported.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair value of the Company's financial instruments other than debt and an
interest rate hedge approximate their carrying values at December 31, 1999 and
1998.  The fair value of the Company's debt at December 31, 1999 was estimated
to be $447 million, based on current interest rates for comparable loans.  The
fair value of the Company's debt at December 31, 1998 approximated its carrying
value.

Debt Issuance Costs

Costs incurred to obtain financing and costs of interest rate protection are
deferred and amortized on a straight line basis, which approximates the
effective interest method, over the term of the related loans or agreements.
These costs, net of accumulated amortization, are included in prepaid expenses
and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS
133"), which is effective for the Company in the year 2000.  The only derivative
instrument the Company currently utilizes is an interest rate hedge agreement
for $75 million of its senior notes.  SFAS 133 requires that all derivative
instruments be measured on the balance sheet at fair value.  The Company
anticipates that the adoption of SFAS 133 will not have a significant effect on
its 2000 financial statements.

                                       35
<PAGE>

In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No.
133," which delays the implementation of SFAS 133 for the Company's financial
statements to January 1, 2001.

In anticipation of the $75 million senior notes maturing on March 2, 2000, the
Company entered into a $75 million interest rate hedge transaction with a
financial institution in order to hedge its exposure to interest rate
fluctuations, with a maturity of April 2000.  Under this arrangement, the
Company pays or receives an amount equal to the difference between the hedge
rate and the market rate on the date of settlement, based on an anticipated $75
million borrowing.  The realized gain or loss on the transaction settlement date
will be recorded on the balance sheet and amortized to interest expense over the
period of the related notes.  At December 31, 1999, the treasury lock rate was
lower than the market rate, therefore, the Company has an unrealized gain of
approximately $692,000.

3.   Merger with ROC Communities, Inc.:
     ----------------------------------

On February 11, 1997, the Company completed its merger with ROC (the "Merger").
The Merger and related transactions was accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting.  Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of ROC were adjusted to
fair value for financial accounting purposes and the results of operations of
ROC were included in the results of operations of the Company beginning in
February 1997.

In connection with the Merger, the following transactions occurred:

- -    The Company repurchased and retired 1,200,000 shares of its common stock,

     was retired at the time of the Merger;

- -    The Company issued 1.042 shares of its common stock for each share of ROC
     stock outstanding;

- -    The Company paid a stock dividend equal to .0326 shares of Company common
     stock per common share/OP Unit outstanding;

- -    Certain OP Unitholders converted 6,170,908 OP Units into common shares.
     These OP Unitholders waived their right to receive the above dividend and
     as a result it was re-allocated to the existing shareholders, resulting in
     a distribution to the common shareholders of .068 shares of common stock;

- -    Certain OP Unitholders purchased 984,423 additional shares of common stock
     from the Company at $25.88 per share; and

- -    In May 1997 the Company's name was changed to Chateau Communities, Inc.

The total ROC purchase price of $351 million was allocated as follows:


     Rental property                               $ 501.3

Advances to CSI are primarily used to finance inventory purchases.  The Company
accounts for its investment in CSI using the equity method of accounting.

Equity investments in joint ventures
- ------------------------------------

The Company is currently involved in seven joint ventures to construct ground-up
"greenfield communities".  In the majority of the arrangements, the Company acts
as the developer or co-developer, performs all accounting and property
management functions and, in many of the arrangements, the Company acts as a
lender to finance the development costs.  As such, the Company advances amounts
to the joint ventures to fund construction and recognizes the related interest
income as earned.  The Company primarily borrows on its line of credit to fund
the advances and, accordingly, includes the related borrowing costs in interest
expense and the related debt in its balance sheet.  In the majority of the
arrangements, the Company has the option to purchase the completed community
when it reaches a pre-determined occupancy rate.  Based on the Company's
ownership in these joint ventures the Company accounts for the investment
utilizing the equity method of accounting for six of these ventures.  The
Company is also involved in two joint ventures in which the communities are
being constructed by its joint venture partner.  The Company has similar
arrangements to lend these joint ventures funds to finance development.  Based
on the Company's investment in these ventures, the Company accounts for its
investments utilizing the equity method of accounting.

N'Tandem
- --------

In September 1997, the Company completed the acquisition of The Windsor
Corporation ("Windsor"), the general partner in five partnerships and advisor to
one REIT, N'Tandem Trust ("N'Tandem", previously known as Windsor Real Estate
Investment Trust 8).  These six entities owned 30 manufactured home communities
(containing 6,300 homesites), all of which have been managed by the Company or
ROC on a fee basis since 1993.

In March 1998, the Company entered into an investment agreement ("Agreement")
with N'Tandem.  Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company purchased 19,139 common
equity shares of N'Tandem. The Company owns approximately 10 percent of
N'Tandem's outstanding stock and recognizes income from an advisory agreement
and interest income on the notes as earned.

     --------------------

In connection with the acquisitions made in 1998, the Company acquired nine
communities, containing 900 homesites and 1,100 park model/RV sites, subject to
long-term capital leases.  The leases were convertible, at the lessor's option,
into common OP Units.  The lessor exercised that option in 1999.

On December 23, 1997, the Company issued 6.92% MandatOry Par Put Remarketed
Securities/SM/ ("MOPPRS/SM/") due December 10, 2014.  The net proceeds to the
Company from the issuance before deducting offering expenses, was approximately
$102 million.  The additional $2 million, included in prepaid expenses and other
assets in the accompanying balance sheets, represents a payment made by a
remarketing dealer for the right to remarket the securities in 2004.  The
remarketing fee is being amortized over the life of the related debt.

In connection with the issuance of the MOPPRS/SM/, the Company and the Operating
Partnership entered into a remarketing agreement, dated as of December 23, 1997
(the "Remarketing Agreement"), with the remarketing dealer named therein (the
"Remarketing Dealer"), pursuant to which the MOPPRS/SM/ are subject to mandatory
tender in favor of the Remarketing Dealer on December 10, 2004 (the "Remarketing
Date"), for a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
outstanding MOPPRS/SM/.  Upon the Remarketing Dealer's election to remarket the
MOPPRS/SM/, the interest rate to the December 10, 2014 maturity date of the
MOPPRS/SM/ will be adjusted to equal the sum of 5.75% plus the Applicable Spread
(as defined in the Remarketing Agreement).  In the event the Remarketing Dealer
does not elect to remarket the MOPPRS/SM/, the MOPPRS/SM/ will mature on the
Remarketing Date.

Senior Notes payable subsequent to December 31, 1999 (in thousands) is as

10.    Savings Plan:
       -------------

The Company has a qualified retirement plan designed to qualify under Section
401 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Savings Plan"). The Savings Plan allows
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to defer a portion of their
eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis subject to certain maximum amounts.
Contributions by the Company are discretionary and determined by the Company's
management. Company contributions are allocated to each participant based on the
relative compensation of the participant to the compensation of all
participants. The Company contributed approximately $560,000, $550,000, and
$421,000 to the Plan for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997,
respectively.

11.   Related Party Transactions:
      --------------------------

Rental expense of approximately $100,000 annually has been incurred for leasing
space in an office building owned by certain officers and equity owners. The
office lease expires November 2001.

The Company, through CSI, purchases manufactured home inventory for resale from
Clayton Homes, Inc., which is affiliated with one of the Company's directors.
During 1998, CSI purchased approximately 22 homes for a cost of approximately
$540,000 from Clayton Homes, Inc.  In certain instances, the Company financed
purchase of these homes with Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, Inc.
("Vanderbilt"), which is also affiliated with the same director. As of December
31, 1998, the Company had a payable to Vanderbilt for $122,000.  During 1999 the
Company repaid this amount and purchased one home from Clayton Homes, Inc.

In addition, when CSI sells homes, the purchaser may obtain financing from
Vanderbilt.  In certain cases, for homes sold before June 1998, Vanderbilt has
recourse to the Company if the loans are not repaid.  As of December 31, 1999
there is a total of approximately $15.6 million of such amounts that are
recourse to the Company.

Included in management, interest and other income is $1,610,465 and $581,800 of
management and other fee income received from N'Tandem for the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

As of December 31, 1998 the Company had a receivable of $3.3 million from a
partnership with which several officers of the Company are affiliated, which was
paid back in 1999.  The partnership owned a manufactured home community that the
Company had the option to purchase.  The receivable was collateralized by the
property and was approved by the directors of the Company who have no interest
in the partnership.

12.   Contingencies:
      -------------

Several claims and legal actions arising from the normal course of business have
been asserted against the Company, and are pending final resolution.  In the
opinion of management, none of these matters will have a material adverse affect
upon the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of the
Company.

The Company, through its joint venture and affiliate arrangements, has
guaranteed approximately $42.8 million of debt.

14.   Subsequent Event
      ----------------

In February 2000, the Company issued $100 million of 8.5% Unsecured Senior Notes
due March 1, 2005.  The Company received net proceeds of nearly $99 million,
which were used to repay $75 million of 8.75% Senior Unsecured Notes which
matured March 2, 2000.  The remaining $24 million was used to repay a portion of
the borrowings on its line of credit.

On February 17, 2000, the company unwound an interest rate hedge that was
scheduled to mature April 1, 2000.  The Company received approximately $1.5
million, which will lower the effective yield on the above 8.5% unsecured notes
by 30 basis points.

On February 29, 2000, the Company announced the establishment of a share
repurchase program pursuant to which it may repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of
common stock from time to time.

                Amendment to By-Laws of Chateau Community, Inc


Article I, Section 8 of the By-Laws of Chateau Communities, Inc. is hereby
amended to read in its entirety as follows:

Section 8.  PROXIES.  An authorized stockholder may vote the stock owned of
            -------
record by him, either in person or by proxy authorized by the stockholder or by
his duly authorized attorney in fact.  A stockholder may authorize another
person to act as proxy by transmitting, or authorizing the transmission of, an
authorization of the person to act as proxy to (i) the person authorized to act
as proxy; or (ii) any other person authorized to receive the proxy authorization
on behalf of the person authorized to act as the proxy, including a proxy
solicitation firm or proxy support service organization.  The authorization may
be transmitted by a telegram, cablegram, datagram, electronic mail, or any other
electronic or telephonic means.  Any such proxy shall be filed with the
Secretary of the Corporation before or at the time of the meeting.  No proxy
shall be valid after eleven months from the date of its execution, unless
otherwise provided in the proxy.  A proxy is revocable by a stockholder at any
time without condition or qualification unless the proxy states that it is
irrevocable and the proxy is coupled with an interest.  A proxy may be
irrevocable for so long as it is coupled with an interest.  The interest with
which a proxy may be coupled includes an interest in the stock to be voted under
the proxy or another general interest in the Corporation or its assets or
liabilities.
