Item 1. Business

General Development of Business.

Chateau Communities, Inc. (the "Company"), a self-administered and self-managed
equity real estate investment trust ("REIT"), is the largest owner/manager of
manufactured home communities in the United States, based both on the number of
communities and the number of residential homesites owned. The Company conducts
substantially all of its activities through CP Limited Partnership, a Maryland
limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership") in which it owns, directly and
through ROC Communities, Inc. ("ROC"), the other general partner of the
Operating Partnership, an approximate 89% general partner interest. The Company
owns and operates 153 manufactured home community properties containing 47,650
homesites and 1,350 park model/RV sites in 29 states. The company also fee
manages 32 manufactured home community properties containing 6,600 homesites.

Formation of the Company

The Company was formed in Maryland on August 25, 1993, as Chateau Properties,
Inc., to continue and expand the manufactured home operations and business
objectives of Chateau Estates ("Chateau"), a Michigan co-partnership. Chateau
had developed, owned and operated manufactured home communities and properties
since 1966.

On February 11, 1997, the Company completed a strategic merger of equals with
ROC (the "Merger"). The Merger and related transactions were accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of ROC were
adjusted to fair value for financial accounting purposes and the results of
operations of ROC were included in the results of operations of the Company
beginning in February 1997.

Industry Overview

A manufactured home community is a residential subdivision designed and improved
with homesites for the placement of manufactured homes including related
improvements and amenities. Manufactured homes are detached, single-family homes
which are produced off-site by manufacturers and installed on sites within the
community. Manufactured homes are available in a variety of architectural styles
and floor plans, offering a variety of amenities, custom options and on-site
built additional structures.

Modern manufactured home communities are similar to typical residential
subdivisions and generally contain centralized entrances, paved streets, curbs
and gutters and parkways. In addition, such communities often provide a variety
of amenities to residents which may include a clubhouse , swimming pools and
jacuzzis, playgrounds, basketball courts, picnic areas, shuffleboard courts,
tennis courts, cable television service, golf courses, marinas and laundry
facilities. Utilities are provided or arranged for by the owner of the
community. Some communities provide water and sewer service through public or
private utilities, while others provide these services to residents from on-site
facilities.


                                       3
<PAGE>   4

The owner of each home in a manufactured home community leases a site from the
community. The manufactured home community is the owner of the underlying land,
utility connections, streets, lighting, driveways, common area amenities and
other capital improvements and is responsible for enforcement of community
guidelines and maintenance. Each owner within the manufactured home community is
responsible for the maintenance of his home and leased site. Additionally,
manufactured home communities tend to have relatively stable resident bases,
with relatively few residents moving manufactured homes out of the communities.
Management thus tends to be less intensive, and capital expenditure needs less
significant, relative to multi-family rental apartment complexes.

Operating and Investment Strategies

The Company seeks to maximize long-term growth in income and portfolio value
through active management and expansion of certain of its manufactured home
communities and the acquisition and selective development of additional
communities. The Company focuses on manufactured home communities that have
growth potential and expects to hold such properties for long-term investment
and capital appreciation. The Company's operating and investment strategies
include:

Operations

      *     Providing attractive and desirable manufactured home communities for
            existing and prospective residents;

      *     Aggressively managing properties to increase operating margins
            through rent and occupancy increases and expense controls;

      *     Maintaining and upgrading communities on a continuous basis through
            a program of regular and preventive maintenance and replacement;

      *     Offering residents accessibility to on-site managers to maximize
            retention, encourage home maintenance and improvements and to
            minimize turnover;

      *     Providing frequent personal contact between on-site managers and
            residents to foster a sense of pride in the community and to promote
            desirability of each Property; and

      *     Offering potential community residents the convenience of purchasing
            a home already in place within the community.


                                       4
<PAGE>   5

Acquisitions, Development and Expansions

      *     Selectively acquiring well-located manufactured home communities
            that demonstrate the potential for increases in revenue and cash
            flow through professional property management, improved operating
            efficiencies, aggressive leasing and, where appropriate, expansion
            or development;

      *     Acquiring properties in existing markets in order to achieve
            economies of scale in operations, and in new markets where
            portfolios may be acquired with regional management in place;

      *     Utilizing the expertise and relationships developed by the Company's
            management to identify acquisition and development opportunities;

      *     Selectively developing new communities in regions where management
            has significant experience and where further development is
            supported by favorable demographics and strong market demand; and

      *     Capitalizing on opportunities to renovate and expand properties
            consistent with local market demand.

Financing Strategies

The Company intends to maintain a conservative and flexible capital structure
that enables it to (i) continue to access the capital markets on favorable
terms; (ii) enhance potential earnings growth; (iii) minimize its level of
encumbered assets; and (iv) limit its exposure to variable rate debt. The
Company intends to maintain a debt-to-market capitalization ratio of
approximately 50% or less. The Company, however, may from time to time
re-evaluate this policy and decrease or increase such ratio accordingly in light
of then current economic conditions, relative costs to the Company of debt and
equity capital, market values of the properties and other factors.

Expansion and Improvement of Manufactured Home Community Properties

The Company will seek to increase the income generated from the manufactured
home communities and from any additional properties acquired by expanding the
number of sites available to be leased to residents if justified by local market
conditions and permitted by zoning and other applicable laws. During 1997, the
Company substantially completed the development of 509 expansion sites. As of
December 31, 1997, the Company had 43,800 total sites, of which approximately
3,500 were vacant. The Company owned at such date undeveloped land adjacent to
existing communities containing approximately 4,700 expansion sites, which are
zoned for manufactured housing. All necessary utilities are available at these
expansion sites, however, building permits would need to be obtained prior to
development. This undeveloped land will facilitate additional growth to the
extent conditions warrant. In addition, where appropriate, the Company will
consider upgrading or adding facilities and amenities to certain communities in
order to make those communities more attractive in their markets.

February, 1997               75 communities acquired through            see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
                             Merger with ROC                            Statements

November, 1997               Purchase of 4 communities in

</TABLE>

Community Sales, Inc. ("CSI")

Prior to the Merger, new home sales and commercial brokerage activities at the
Company's communities were conducted by third parties. As a result of the
Merger, the Company acquired the sales and brokerage capabilities of CSI, which
had previously been operated as a taxable subsidiary of ROC, and which is now
operated as a taxable subsidiary of the Operating Partnership.

The Windsor Corporation ("Windsor")

In September 1997, the Company completed the acquisition of Windsor, the general
partner of five partnerships and advisor to one REIT owning 28 manufactured home
communities (containing 5,700 homesites), all of which had been managed by ROC
on a fee basis since 1993 and by the Company since the Merger. The acquisition
was financed with the issuance of 101,239 shares of common stock and $750,000 in
cash.

Competition

Many of the Properties are located in developed areas that include other
manufactured home community properties. The number of competitive manufactured
home community properties in a particular area could have a material effect on
the Company's ability to lease sites at the Properties or at any newly acquired
properties and on the rents charged. In addition, other forms of multi-family
residential properties and single-family housing provide housing alternatives to
potential residents of the Properties.


                                       6
<PAGE>   7

Employees

As of December 31, 1997, the Company had approximately 1,000 full and part-time
employees. The Company utilizes a resident administrator for the on-site
administration of each of the Properties. Important duties of on-site
administrators as well as the office manager include extensive contact with
residents through initial introduction to community rules and on-going
accessibility for resident assistance. Administrators notify residents who are
in violation of these rules and regulations. Typically, clerical and maintenance
workers are employed to assist these individuals in the management and care of
the Properties. Direct supervision of on-site administrators is the
responsibility of the Company's regional vice presidents and managers and
divisional senior vice presidents. These individuals have significant experience
in addressing the needs of residents and in finding or creating innovative
approaches to value maximization and increased cash flow from property
operations. Complementing this field management staff are 49 corporate employees
who assist on-site administrators in all property functions.

Commitment to resident satisfaction is demonstrated by the ongoing training that
the Company provides for on-site staff. Community administrators meet
periodically at regional seminars to review Company philosophy and policy, to
discuss relevant administration issues and solutions and to share ideas and
experiences.

Tax Status

The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Section 856(c) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The Company generally
will not be subject to Federal income tax to the extent it distributes 95
percent of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders. REITs are subject to a
number of organizational and operational requirements. If the Company fails to
qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to Federal
income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable
income at regular corporate rates. Even as a REIT, the Company is subject to
certain state and local taxes on its income and property and Federal income and
excise taxes to the extent of its undistributed income.

Item 2. Properties

At December 31, 1997 the Properties consisted of 131 manufactured home
communities containing 43,800 sites, in 28 states, with amenities designed for
either retirement or family living. The Company also fee managed 31 manufactured
home communities containing 6,500 sites in 13 states. The Company also owned
land adjacent to certain existing communities containing approximately 4,700
expansion sites which, although not yet developed, was zoned for manufactured
housing.

At December 31, 1997, the Properties had an average occupancy rate of
approximately 92 percent with weighted average rent for the year ended December
31, 1997 of $287 per month. Weighted average rent is calculated as rental and
utility income for the period, on a monthly basis, divided by the weighted
average occupied sites. Weighted average occupancy is computed by averaging the
number of revenue producing sites at the end of each month in the period.


                                       7
<PAGE>   8

The Company believes that the Properties provide amenities and common facilities
that create a safe and attractive community for the residents. All of the
Properties provide residents with attractive amenities with most offering a
clubhouse, a swimming pool and a library. Many Properties offer additional
amenities such as sauna/whirlpool spas, indoor pools, tennis courts,
shuffleboard courts, basketball courts, golf courses, day care facilities,
exercise rooms and marinas.

Since residents own their homes, it is their responsibility to maintain their
homes and the surrounding area. The communities have extensive rules and
regulations to maintain their appearance at the highest level. It is
management's role to insure that residents comply with community policies and to
provide maintenance of the common areas, facilities and amenities. The Company
continually monitors compliance by residents with its residents' regulations to
assure that the communities are maintained at the highest standards. The Company
holds periodic meetings of its property management personnel for training and
implementation of the Company's strategies, and property administrators make a
daily inspection of the Properties. The Company believes that, due in part to
this strategy, the Properties historically have had and will continue to have
low turnover and high occupancy rates. Since 1989, the Properties have averaged
an annual turnover of homes (where the home is moved out of the community) of
3-4 percent. During this period, the average annual turnover of residents in the
Properties (where the home is sold and remains within the community, typically
without interruption of rental income) has been approximately 10-12 percent.

The Operating Partnership owns a 100 percent beneficial interest in all of the
Properties, except for Emerald Lake, Fairways, Lakeland Junction, Lakes at
Leesburg, Palm Beach Colony, Winter Haven Oaks and Del Tura in which it owns a
99 percent beneficial interest and in which the Company owns the remaining 1
percent beneficial interest.

Leases

The typical lease entered into between the resident and one of the Company's
manufactured home communities for the rental of a site is month-to-month or
year-to-year, renewable upon the consent of both parties or, in some instances,
as provided by statute. In some cases, leases are for one-year terms with up to
ten renewal options exercisable by the resident, with rent adjusted according to
yearly rent reviews, or by the consumer price index. Leases or other terms of
residents' occupancy are cancelable for non-payment of rent, violation of
community rules and regulations or other specified defaults.

Indebtedness

At December 31, 1997, the aggregate amount of indebtedness encumbering the
Properties was approximately $114 million. The amounts outstanding as of
December 31, 1997 for the indebtedness encumbering each of these Properties is
set forth (in thousands) in the following table. Prepayment of these debt
obligations may result in significant prepayment penalties.

The Company expects to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends to holders of
its Common Stock. Subject to the needs of the Company's acquisition and
expansion strategies and subject to the REIT qualification standards, the
Company intends to distribute annually up to 95 percent of its cash flow.

Distributions by the Company to the extent of its current and accumulated
earnings and profits for Federal income tax purposes will be taxable to
stockholders as dividend income. Distributions in excess of earnings and profits
generally will be treated as a non-taxable reduction of the stockholder's basis
in the Common Stock to the extent thereof, with the remainder as taxable gain.

At March 12, 1998, there were approximately 600 holders of record and
approximately 12,000 beneficial owners of the Company's Common Stock.

(1)   In February 1997, the Company completed the Merger with ROC. See Note 3 to
      the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the
      merger.

(2)   The extraordinary items represent prepayment penalties and certain other
      related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt.

(3)   Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association of
      Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as consolidated net income of the
      Operating Partnership without giving effect to gains (or losses) from debt
      restructuring and sales of property and rental property depreciation and
      amortization. Management believes that FFO is an important and widely used
      measure of the operating performance of REITs, which provides a relevant
      basis for comparison among REITs. For all periods presented, depreciation
      of rental property and amortization of intangibles are the only non-cash
      adjustments. FFO (i) does not represent cash flow from operations as
      defined by generally accepted accounting principles; (ii) should not be
      considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating
      performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing
      activities; and (iii) is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of
      liquidity. FFO is calculated as follows:

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Certain statements in this discussion constitute "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance
or achievements of the Company or industry to be materially different from any
future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements.

Overview

The Company is the largest owner/manager of manufactured home communities in the
United States, based both on the number of communities and the number of
residential homesites owned. The Company added 89 manufactured home communities
to its portfolio over the three-year period ended December 31, 1997. At the end
of this period, the Company's portfolio was comprised of 131 manufactured home
communities containing 43,800 homesites in 28 states.

A substantial portion of the Company's growth since the beginning of 1995 can be
attributed to the Company's Merger with ROC on February 11, 1997. The historical
results of the Company in 1997 include the results of operations of ROC since
February 1, 1997. In addition, as a result of the Merger, the Company acquired
ROC's third-party property management operations and its taxable sales and
brokerage subsidiary, CSI.

Company growth since the beginning of 1995 can also be attributed to increased
operating results at existing communities, community expansions, new community
development and additional acquisition activities.

Since its organization, the Company has elected to qualify as a REIT under the
Code and thus does not generally pay federal corporate income taxes on its
earnings to the extent that such earnings are distributed to shareholders.

The Company conducts substantially all of its activities through the Operating
Partnership in which it owned a combined 90 percent general partner interest as
of December 31, 1997.

Historical Results of Operations

Comparison of the year ended December 31, 1997 to the year ended December 31,
1996

For the year ended December 31, 1997, income before minority interest was
$24,688,000, an increase of $8,588,000 from the year ended December 31, 1996.
The increase was due primarily to the Merger, as well as acquisitions that were
consummated in 1997 and 1996 by the Company or ROC, and increased net operating
income from communities owned by the Company and ROC at the beginning of the
period (the "Core 1996 Portfolio"). The increase in net operating income from
the Company's Core 1996 Portfolio was due to increased occupancy and rental
increases partially offset by general operating expense increases. 


                                       18
<PAGE>   19

Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1997 was $134,801,000, an
increase of $67,568,000 from 1996. Approximately 80 percent of the increase was
due to the Merger, and 9 percent was due to 1997 and 1996 acquisitions made by
the Company or ROC. The remaining 11 percent increase was due to rental
increases and occupancy gains in the Company's Core 1996 Portfolio.

Weighted average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 1997 was 38,053 sites
compared with 18,889 sites for the same period in 1996. During 1997, the Company
increased occupancy by nearly 400 sites, primarily in its active expansion
communities. The occupancy rate for the total portfolio was 92.0 percent on
approximately 43,800 sites as of December 31, 1997, compared to 94.4 percent on
approximately 20,279 sites as of December 31, 1996. The decrease in the
occupancy rate is due to the increase in available sites added through
expansions of existing communities. The occupancy rate on the stabilized
portfolio was 93.6 percent as of December 31, 1997. On a per site basis,
weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 1997 was
$287, which is consistent with the same period of 1996. For the Company's Core
1996 Portfolio, on a per site basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue for
the year ended December 31, 1997 was $289 compared with $278 for the same period
in 1996, an increase of 4.1 percent.

Management fee, interest and other income primarily include management fee
income for the management of 32 manufactured home communities, equity earnings
from the Company's sales subsidiary, CSI, and interest income on notes
receivable. The increase in 1997 from 1996 is due primarily to business
activities acquired in conjunction with the Merger.

Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 1997
increased by $20,945,000 or 115 percent from the same period a year ago. The
majority of the increase was due to the Merger and 1997 and 1996 acquisitions.
The remaining increase was due to increases in the Company's Core 1996
Portfolio. On a per site basis, monthly weighted average property operating and
maintenance expense increased 6.8 percent from approximately $80 in 1996 to
approximately $86 in 1997. A portion of this increase is due to the operating
expenses related to the properties managed by the Company for a management fee
beginning in 1997.

Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 1997 increased by $5,090,000
or 105 percent from the year ended December 31, 1996. The increase is due
primarily to the Merger, acquisitions and expansions of communities and general
increases. On a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate taxes were
$21.78 in 1997 compared to $21.42 in 1996, an increase of 1.7 percent. Real
estate taxes may increase or decrease due to inflation, expansions and
improvements of communities, as well as changes in taxation in the tax
jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

Administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 1997 increased due to the
Merger. Administrative expense in 1997 was 5.0 percent of total revenues as
compared to 5.7 percent in 1996.

Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December
31, 1997 by $12,956,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1996. The
increase is attributable to the indebtedness incurred in connection with the
Merger and to finance the 1997 and 1996 acquisitions. Interest expense as a
percentage of average debt outstanding decreased to approximately 7.7 percent in
1997 from approximately 8.1 percent in 1996. The decrease is due primarily to
the ROC debt assumed in the Merger having a lower average interest rate as well
as much of the financing in connection with the Merger and the 1997 and 1996
acquisitions being done with the Company's lines of credit which had a lower
average interest rate. In addition, in July 1997, the Company renegotiated its
lines of credit into a new line with a lower borrowing rate of 110 basis points
over LIBOR versus 150 basis points over LIBOR on the old lines. 


                                       19
<PAGE>   20

Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 1997, increased $20.1
million from the same period a year ago. The increase is directly attributable
to the Merger and acquisitions. Depreciation expense as a percentage of average
depreciable rental property in 1997 remained relatively unchanged from 1996.

Comparison of year ended December 31, 1996 to year ended December 31, 1995

For the year ended December 31, 1996, income before majority interest and
extraordinary item was $16,100,000, an increase of $2,121,000 from the year
ended December 31, 1995. The increase was due primarily to increased net
operating income from communities owned by the Company on January 1, 1995 (the
"Core 1995 Portfolio") and to a lesser extent, the acquisition of three
communities in 1996 and one community in 1995. The increase in net operating
income from the Company's Core 1995 Portfolio was due to increased occupancy and
rental increases offset by general operating expense increases.

Rental revenue in 1996 was $67,233,000, an increase of $5,675,000 or 9.2 percent
from 1995. Approximately 2.3 percent of the increase was due to the acquisitions
of three communities in 1996 and one in 1995; 3.9 percent represented the effect
of annual rent increases in the Core 1995 Portfolio; 1.8 percent was due to
increased occupancy in the Core 1995 Portfolio and 1 percent was due to an
increase in amenity income. Weighted average occupancy for the year ended
December 31, 1996, was 18,889 sites, or 4.6 percent higher than weighted average
occupancy for the year ended December 31, 1995. Weighted average occupancy
increased in 1996 due to the 1996 and 1995 acquisitions and the filling of 265
additional sites that were either vacant at January 1, 1996 or developed in
1996. The occupancy rate was 94.4 percent on 20,279 sites as of December 31,
1996, as compared with 94.3 percent on 19,594 sites as of December 31, 1995. On
a per site basis, weighted average monthly rental revenue for the year ended
December 31, 1996 increased to $285 from $277 in 1995 or 3.2 percent due to
rental increases in the Core 1995 Portfolio in 1996.

The increase in amenity income of approximately $600,000 was due primarily to
the inclusion of the results of operations of four golf courses and a marina for
the period beginning January 1, 1996. These operations were previously conducted
by GC Properties, Inc. ("GCI"), a corporation wholly owned by an equity owner of
the Company, in order to permit the Company's qualification as a REIT under the
Internal Revenue Code. From November 23, 1993 through December 31, 1995, the
Company recognized net lease income from GCI, which was classified as other
income. In early 1996, the Company received a ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service allowing the Company to conduct these operations. Effective January 1,
1996, as a result of acquiring the operations of GCI, the Company has
consolidated these operations.

Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 1996
increased by $2,180,000 or 13.6 percent from the same period a year ago.
Approximately $1,028,000 of the increase represents the operating costs of the
golf course and marina operations discussed above. The remaining increase of
$1,152,000 or a 7.2 percent increase over the prior year, is due primarily to
the acquisition of three communities in 1996 and one in 1995. On a per site
basis, monthly weighted average property operating and maintenance expense
increased from $74 in 1995 to $80 in 1996, or 8.6 percent. Excluding the golf
course and marina operations, monthly weighted average property operating and
maintenance expense increased 2.4 percent, on a per site basis, year over year.


                                       20
<PAGE>   21

Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 1996, increased by $333,000,
or 7.4 percent, from the year ended December 31, 1995. The increase is due
primarily to acquisitions and expansions of communities and general increases.
On a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate taxes were $21.40 in
1996 compared to $20.90 in 1995, an increase of 2.6 percent. Real estate taxes
may increase or decrease due to inflation, expansions and improvements of
communities, as well as changes in taxation in the tax jurisdictions in which
the Company operates.

Administrative expense for 1996 was relatively constant with 1995.
Administrative expense in 1996 was 5.7 percent of revenues as compared to 6.3
percent in 1995.

Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December
31, 1996, by $510,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1995. The
increase is attributable to the indebtedness incurred to finance the 1996
acquisitions of three communities and one in 1995, as well as the investment in
a joint venture with ROC that owns six development communities. Interest expense
also increased due to the financing of the Company's repurchase and retirement
of 450,000 shares of its common stock in connection with the Merger. Interest
expense as a percentage of average debt outstanding decreased to approximately
8.1 percent in 1996 from approximately 8.9 percent in 1995.

Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 1996, increased $438,000
from the same period a year ago. The increase is due to acquisitions and
expansions. Depreciation expense as a percentage of average depreciable rental
property in 1996 remained relatively unchanged from 1995.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash provided by operating activities was $54,545,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1997, compared to $29,755,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996.
The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the
increase in net operating income as a result of the Company's larger size.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 1997,
was $21,088,000. This amount includes net proceeds of $102 million received from
the issuance of senior notes and proceeds of $25,477,000 from the issuance of
984,423 shares to certain OP Unitholders at the time of the Merger. Use of cash
included distributions made to shareholders/OP Unitholders of $42,111,000; the
payment of $19,851,000 to repurchase and retire 750,000 shares of the Company's
common stock in connection with the Merger, and net payment on the line of
credit of $45,834,000 with the proceeds from the senior notes. The shares
purchased in 1997 and 1996 as a part of the program were purchased at an average
price of approximately $25.75.


                                       21
<PAGE>   22

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1997 was
$61,309,000. This amount primarily represented the acquisition of four
communities, payment of merger costs, joint venture investments, and advances to
CSI, capital expenditures and construction and development costs. The
acquisition of the four communities for an aggregate purchase price of $20
million was financed by $19.5 million borrowed on the Company's line of credit
and $500,000 through the issuance of 16,480 OP Units. The Company invested
approximately $4 million in cash in other joint ventures. The Company also
advanced approximately $9 million to CSI. For the year ended December 31, 1997,
construction and development costs approximated $8.1 million, while recurring
property capital expenditures, other than construction and development costs,
were approximately $3.7 million. Recurring property capital expenditures in 1997
increased significantly over the same period in 1996, due to the increased
number of communities in the Company's portfolio. Capital expenditures have
historically been financed with funds from operations and it is the Company's
intention that such future expenditures will be financed with funds from
operations.

In July 1997, the Company entered into two new credit facilities with the First
National Bank of Chicago and other lenders, consisting of a $25 million term
loan and a $75 million revolving line of credit (the "First Chicago Credit
Facilities"). Effective July 1997, the interest rate on the revolving credit
facility was reduced to LIBOR plus 110 basis points (from LIBOR plus 150 basis
points). In addition, in September 1997, the Company secured a $7.5 million
revolving line of credit from Colorado National Bank which bears interest at a
rate of LIBOR plus 125 basis points (the "CNB Facility" and , together with the
First Chicago Credit Facilities, the "Credit Facilities"). As of December 31,
1997, approximately $25 million was outstanding under the Credit Facilities and
the Company had available $82.5 million in additional borrowing capacity.

On December 23, 1997, the Company issued 6.92% MandatOry Par Put Remarketed
Securities(SM) ("MOPPRS(SM)" ) due December 10, 2014. The net proceeds to the
Company from the issuance before deducting offering expenses, was approximately
$102.0 million. The net proceeds from the MOPPRS(SM) were utilized primarily to
reduce outstanding balances under the Credit Facilities and to finance
acquisitions. The MOPPRS(SM) are rated as "BBB" by Standard & Poor's Rating
Service and "Baa3" by Moody's Investors Service.

In connection with the issuance of the MOPPRS(SM), the Company and the Operating
Partnership entered into a Remarketing Agreement, dated as of December 23, 1997
(the "Remarketing Agreement"), with the remarketing dealer named therein (the
"Remarketing Dealer"), pursuant to which the MOPPRS(SM) are subject to mandatory
tender in favor of the Remarketing Dealer on December 10, 2004 (the "Remarketing
Date"), for a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
outstanding MOPPRS(SM). Upon the Remarketing Dealer's election to remarket the
MOPPRS(SM), the interest rate to the December 10, 2014 maturity date of the
MOPPRS will be adjusted to equal the sum of 5.75% plus the Applicable Spread (as
defined in the Remarketing Agreement). In the event the Remarketing Dealer does
not elect to remarket the MOPPRS(SM), the MOPPRS(SM) will mature on the
Remarketing Date.

As of December 31, 1997, the Company had outstanding, in addition to the Credit
Facilities and the MOPPRS(SM), $145 million of other unsecured senior debt with
a weighted average interest rate and maturity of 8.2 percent and 4 years,
respectively, and $114 million of secured mortgage debt with a weighted average
interest rate and maturity of 7.95 percent and 2.5 years, respectively.


                                       22

Repayment of long-term borrowings and amounts outstanding under the Credit
Facilities, future acquisitions of communities and land for development and new
community development activities represent the principal long-term liquidity
need of the Company. The Company does not expect to generate sufficient funds
from operations to finance these long-term liquidity needs and instead intends
to meet its long-term liquidity requirements through additional borrowing under
the Credit Facilities or other lines of credit, the issuance of additional
equity or debt securities and the assumption of existing secured or unsecured
indebtedness.

The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including
expansion activities and capital expenditure requirements, through cash flow
from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under the Credit Facilities and
other lines of credit.

In January 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of 16 properties, in
Connecticut, South Carolina, and Florida, containing approximately 2,333
homesites and 1,359 park/model RV sites, for a total of approximately $55.4
million. These acquisitions were financed by $33.7 million in borrowings under
the Company's line of credit, the issuance of 412,480 OP Units and $5.7 million
in cash available from the proceeds of the December 1997 Debt Offering. Nine of
the above communities, containing approximately 900 homesites and 1,100 park
model/RV sites, are subject to long-term ground leases.

In February 1998, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $53.9
million from the issuance of 1,850,000 shares of its common stock. The proceeds
from the offering were used to reduce outstanding balances under the Company's
line of credit from the January 1998 acquisitions and for the March 1998
acquisitions.

In March 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of 6 properties, 1 in
Michigan and 5 in Indiana, containing approximately 1,500 homesites, for a total
of approximately $36.7 million. These acquisitions were financed by the issuance
of common stock in February 1998 and by borrowings on the Company's line of
credit. In addition, CSI purchased a 60 percent interest in three retail sales
centers in Indiana, for approximately $1.2 million.

Inflation

All of the leases or terms of tenants' occupancies at the communities allow for
at least annual rental adjustments. In addition, all leases are short-term
(generally one year or less) and enable the Company to seek market rentals upon
reletting the sites. Such leases generally minimize the risk to the Company of
any adverse effect of inflation.

New Accounting Standards

In 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share." This accounting
standard specifies new computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for
earnings per share to be applied retroactively. Among other things, SFAS No. 128
requires presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the
income statement.

Year 2000 Compliance

The Company is currently engaged in a review with its software vendors to ensure
all systems are modified for year 2000 compliance. Since all systems are owned
and maintained by third party vendors, the Company believes that the additional
costs for compliance will not be material to future results of operations,
financial condition or cash flows of the Company.

Other

Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association of Real
Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as consolidated net income of the Operating
Partnership without giving effect to gains (or losses) from debt restructuring
and sales of property and rental property depreciation and amortization.
Management believes that FFO is an important and widely used measure of the
operating performance of REITs, which provides a relevant basis for comparison
among REITs. For all periods presented, depreciation of rental property and
amortization of intangibles are the only non-cash adjustments. FFO (i) does not
represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting
principles; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a
measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and
financing activities; and (iii) is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure
of liquidity. FFO is calculated as follows:

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of Independent Accountants

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Chateau Communities, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Chateau
Communities, Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997. We have also
audited the financial statement schedule as identified in item 14(a)(2) of this
Form 10-K. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the management of Chateau Communities, Inc. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Chateau Communities, Inc. as of
December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information required to be included therein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                     -------

1. Organization and Formation of Company:

The Company was formed in November 1993 as Chateau Properties, Inc., a real
estate investment trust ("REIT"). In 1997, the Company merged with ROC
Communities, Inc, (ROC). The Company is engaged in the business of owning and
operating manufactured housing community properties primarily through CP Limited
Partnership, its Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 1997, the Company
owned 131 properties containing an aggregate of 43,800 homesites, located in 28
states. Approximately 29 percent of these homesites were in Florida and 27
percent were in Michigan. The Company also fee managed 31 properties containing
an aggregate of 6,500 homesites. A manufactured housing community is real estate
designed and improved with sites for placement of manufactured homes. The owner
of the home leases the site from the Company generally for a term of one year or
less.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company include all
accounts of the Company, its wholly owned qualified REIT subsidiaries and its
Operating Partnership. The Company and ROC are the general partners, and as
such, the Company has unilateral control and complete responsibility for
management of the Operating Partnership including the right and power to make
all decisions and actions with respect to the acquisition, mortgage and sale of
properties and the other business affairs of the Operating Partnership. All
significant inter-entity balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Minority/Majority Interest

Income before minority/majority interest is ascribed to the limited partners of
the Operating Partnership (the Minority Interest") based on their respective
weighted average ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. The
ownership percentage is determined by dividing the number of Operating
Partnership ("OP") Units held by the limited partners by the total OP Units
outstanding including the Units held by the Company. Issuance of additional
shares of common stock or OP Units changes the percentage ownership of both the
Minority Interest and the Company. Since an OP unit is equivalent to a common
share (due to, among other things, its exchangeability for a common share), such
transactions are treated as capital transactions and result in an equity
transfer adjustment among Shareholders' equity and Minority Interest in the
Company's balance sheet to account for the change in the respective ownership in
the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

                                     -------

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued:

Investments in and Advances to Affiliates

The Company conducts manufactured home sales and brokerage activities through
its taxable subsidiary Community Sales, Inc. ("CSI"). The Company owns 100% of
the preferred stock of CSI and is entitled to 100% of its cash flow. The Company
accounts for its investment in CSI utilizing the equity method of accounting.

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles involves the use of certain management estimates and
assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures, such as the useful
lives of rental properties. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Rental income is recognized when earned and due from residents. The leases
entered into by residents for the rental of a site are generally for terms not
longer than one year and renewable upon the consent of both parties or, in some
instances, as provided by statute.

Rental Property

Rental property is carried at the lower of cost, less accumulated depreciation,
or fair value. Management evaluates the recoverability of its investment in
rental property in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 121, "Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived
Assets To Be Disposed Of". This statement requires that long-lived assets be
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that full asset recoverability is questionable. Management's assessment of
recoverability of its rental property under this statement includes, but is not
limited to, recent operating results, expected net operating cash flow and
management's plans for future operations.

Depreciation

Depreciation on manufactured home communities is computed primarily on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The
estimated useful lives of the various classes of rental property assets are
primarily as follows:

                                     -------

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued:

Maintenance, repairs and minor improvements to rental properties are expensed
when incurred. Major improvements and renewals are capitalized. When rental
property assets are sold or otherwise retired, the cost of such assets, net of
accumulated depreciation compared to the sale proceeds, are recognized in income
as gains or losses on disposition.

Capitalized Interest

Interest is capitalized on projects during periods of construction. Interest
capitalized by the Company during 1997 was $708,000.

Income Taxes

The Company has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT")
under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The
Company generally will not be subject to Federal income tax to the extent it
distributes its REIT taxable income to its shareholders. REITs are subject to a
number of organizational and operational requirements. If the Company fails to
qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to Federal
income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable
income at regular corporate rates. The Company remains subject to certain state
and local taxes on its income and property as well as Federal income and excise
taxes on its undistributed income.

Per Share Data

Basic earnings per share are computed based upon the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. The conversion of an OP unit to
common stock has no effect on earnings per common share since the earnings of an
OP unit are equivalent to the earnings of a share of common stock. Diluted
earnings per common share are computed assuming the exercise of all outstanding
stock options, which would have a dilutive effect, and the exchange of all OP
Units into common stock.

Stock-Based Compensation

During 1996 the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 for "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation." The Company has elected to continue to account for employee stock
based compensation under Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and therefore the disclosure method
as permitted and required by SFAS No. 123 is presented in Note 9.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued:

Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less
are considered to be cash equivalents.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements
to conform to the current year financial statement presentation. These
reclassifications have no impact on net operating results previously reported.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments" requires
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments whether or not such
instruments are recognized in the balance sheet. Due to the short-term nature of
the Company's financial instruments, other than debt, fair values are not
materially different from their carrying values. The carrying value of debt
approximates fair value.

Debt Issuance Costs

Costs incurred related to obtaining financing such as service and commitment
fees are deferred and are amortized over the term of the related
commitment/loans. These costs net of accumulated amortization are included in
prepaid expenses and other assets in the accompanying balance sheets.

3. Merger with ROC Communities, Inc.

On February 11, 1997, the Company completed its merger with ROC Communities,
Inc. (the "Merger"). The Merger and related transactions was accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of ROC were
adjusted to fair value for financial accounting purposes and the results of
operations of ROC were included in the results of operations of the Company
beginning in February 1997.

3. Merger with ROC Communities, Inc. Continued:

In connection with the Merger, the related transactions occurred

- -     The Company repurchased and retired 1,200,000 shares of its common stock,
      of which 750,000, and 450,000 were repurchased in 1997 and 1996,
      respectively

- -     ROC purchased 350,000 shares of Chateau common stock, in 1996, which was
      retired at the time of the Merger

- -     The Company issued 1.042 shares of its common stock for each share of ROC
      stock outstanding

- -     The Company paid a stock dividend equal to .0326 shares of Company common
      stock per common share/OP Unit outstanding

- -     Certain OP Unitholders converted 6,170,908 OP Units into common shares.
      These Unitholders waived their right to receive the above dividend and as
      a result it was re-allocated to the existing shareholders, resulting in a
      distribution to the common shareholders of .068 shares of common stock

- -     Certain OP Unitholders purchased 984,423 additional shares of common stock
      from the Company at $25.88 per share.

- -     In May 1997 the Company's name was changed to Chateau Communities, Inc

The total price of $351 million was allocated as follows:

At December 31, 1997, the Company had a $100 million line of credit arrangement,
including a $25 million term loan, with First National Bank of Chicago/NBD
acting as lead agent for a bank group to provide financing for future
construction, acquisitions and general business obligations. The line of credit
arrangement is unsecured, bears interest at the prime rate of interest or, at
the Company's option, LIBOR plus 110 basis points. At December 31, 1997, there
was $25 million in borrowings outstanding under the term loan. The line matures
in May 1999 and the term loan matures May 1998. The terms of the line of credit
provide for the payment of a fee on the average daily unused amount of the line
of credit. In addition, in September 1997, the Company secured a $7.5 million
revolving line of credit from Colorado National Bank which bears interest at a
rate of LIBOR plus 125 basis points. As of December 31, 1997, approximately $25
million was outstanding under the Company's line of credit and the Company had
available $82.5 million in additional borrowing capacity. The financing
arrangements contain customary covenants, including a debt service coverage
ratio and a restriction on the incurrence of additional collateralized
indebtedness without a corresponding increase in rental property.

On December 23, 1997, the Company issued 6.92% MandatOry Par Put Remarketed
Securities(SM) ("MOPPRS(SM)") due December 10, 2014. The net proceeds to the
Company from the issuance before deducting offering expenses, was approximately
$102.0 million. The additional $2 million represents a payment made by the
"Remarketing Dealer" for the right to remarket the securities in 2004. This
amount will be amortized over the life of the related debt.

8. Minority/Majority Interest in Operating Partnership:

Minority/majority interest in the accompanying balance sheets represents the
ownership interest in the Operating Partnership held by other than the Company.
As of December 31, 1997 and December 31, 1996, the minority/majority interest
was approximately 10 percent and 61 percent, respectively.

During 1997, in connection with the merger, and during 1995, certain OP
Unitholders converted their OP Units into 6,170,908 and 335,460 shares of common
stock, respectively, of the Company at a one for one exchange ratio. These
transactions resulted in an increase to outstanding common shares, and a
corresponding decrease in outstanding OP Units. In connection with these
transactions, there were no proceeds received nor expenses incurred by the
Company.

During 1996 and 1995 the Company, through the Operating Partnership, purchased
and retired 43,334 and 44,085 OP Units, respectively, at approximately $21.50
and $20.00 per unit, respectively.

9. Stock Option Plan:

The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation," effective with the year ended December 31, 1996. The
Company measures compensation cost using the intrinsic value method, in
accordance with APB Opinion No. 25 ("APB 25"), "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees."

The Company's 1997 Equity Compensation Plan and 1993 Long Term Incentive Stock
Plan (the "Plans") provide for up to 950,000 shares of common stock that may be
granted to directors, executive officers and other key employees. The Plan
provides for the grant of options restricted stock awards and stock appreciation
rights. The Plans provide for the grant of options at "fair market value" which
represents the quoted market price of the Company's common stock on the date of
grant. The Compensation Committee will determine the vesting schedule of each
option and the term, which term shall not exceed ten years from the date of
grant.

Information concerning stock options is as follows:

10. Savings Plan:

The Company has two qualified retirement plans designed to qualify under Section
401 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Plan"). The Plans allow the employees of
the Company to defer a portion of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis
subject to certain maximum amounts. Contributions by the Company are
discretionary and determined by the Company's management. Company contributions
are allocated to each participant based on the relative compensation of the
participant to the compensation of all participants. The Company contributed
approximately $421,000, $300,000 and $275,000 to the 401(k) Plan for the Plan
years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

11. Related Party Transactions:

Rental expense of approximately $100,000 annually has been incurred for leasing
space in an office building owned by certain officers and equity owners. The
office lease expires November 2001. For the year ended December 31, 1995 net
lease income of approximately $695,000 was recognized from a ground lease with a
corporation wholly owned by an equity owner to the Company.

The Company, through CSI, purchases manufactured home inventory for resale from
Clayton Homes, Inc., which is affiliated with one of the Company's directors.
During 1997, CSI purchased approximately 94 homes for a cost of $2.2 million. In
certain instances, the Company finances the purchase of these homes with
Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, Inc. ("Vanderbilt"), which is also affiliated
with the same director . As of December 31, 1997 the Company has a payable to
Vanderbilt for $656,000.

In addition, when CSI sells these homes, the purchaser often finances them with
Vanderbilt. In certain cases, Vanderbilt has recourse to the Company if these
loans are not repaid. As of December 31, 1997 there is a total of $11.7 million
of such amounts that are recourse to the Company.

As of December 31, 1997 the Company has a receivable of $3.3 million from a
partnership with which several officers of the Company are affiliated. The
partnership owns a manufactured home community property that the Company has the
option to purchase. The receivable is collateralized by the property and was
approved by the directors of the Company who have no interest in the
partnership.

12. Extraordinary Item - Early Extinguishment of Debt:

The extraordinary charge in the accompanying statements of income represent
prepayment penalties and certain other related costs incurred in connection with
the early extinguishment of debt.

13. Contingencies:

The Company, as an owner of real estate, is subject to various environmental
laws. Compliance by the Company with existing laws has not had a material effect
on the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of the Company,
nor does management believe it will have a material impact in the future.
However, management cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or
regulations on its current properties or properties that it may acquire.

Several claims and legal actions arising from the normal course of business,
none of which are environmental related matters, have been asserted against the
Company, and are pending final resolution. Although the amount of liability at
December 31, 1997, if any, with respect to these matters is not determinable, in
the opinion of management, none of these matters will be material to future
results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of the Company.

15. Subsequent Events:

In January 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of 16 properties, in
Connecticut, South Carolina, and Florida, containing approximately 2,333
homesites and 1,359 park/model RV sites, for a total of approximately $55.4
million. These acquisitions were financed by $33.7 million in borrowings under
the Company's line of credit, the issuance of 412,480 OP Units and $5.7 million
in cash available from the proceeds of the December 1997 Debt Offering. Nine of
the above communities, containing approximately 900 homesites and 1,100 park
model/RV sites, are subject to long-term ground leases.

In February 1998, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $53.9
million from the issuance of 1,850,000 shares of its common stock. The proceeds
from the offering were used to reduce outstanding balances under the Company's
line of credit from the January 1998 acquisitions and for the March 1998
acquisitions.

In March 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of 6 properties, 1 in
Michigan and 5 in Indiana, containing approximately 1,500 homesites, for a total
of approximately $36.7 million. These acquisitions were financed by the issuance
of common stock in February 1998 and by borrowings on the Company's line of
credit. In addition, CSI purchased a 60 percent interest in three retail sales
centers in Indiana, for approximately $1.2 million.

determined with reference to such beginning Gross Asset Value using any

      any part thereof;

            (d) organizing and holding partnership interests in partnerships
      owning or otherwise having an interest in, whether directly or indirectly,
      one or more manufactured housing community properties; and

            (e) in general, the making of any investments or expenditures, the
      borrowing and lending of money and the taking of any and all actions which
      are incidental or related to any of the purposes recited above.

      It is agreed that each of the foregoing is an ordinary part of the
Partnership's business and affairs. Property may be acquired subject to, or by
assuming, the liens, encumbrances, and other title exceptions which affect such
property. The Partnership may also be a partner, general or limited, in
partnerships, general or limited, and joint ventures created to accomplish all
or any or the foregoing.

      The Partnership purposes may be accomplished by taking any action which is
not prohibited under the Act and which is related to the acquisition, ownership,
development, improvement, operation, management, financing, leasing, exchanging,
selling or otherwise encumbering or disposing of all or any portion of the
assets of the Partnership, or any interest therein.

                                  ARTICLE FOUR
             CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS, ADMISSION OF PARTNERS, OP UNITS

      4.1 Capital Contributions. Each of the Partners (or their respective
predecessors in interest), other than ROC, have heretofore made Capital
Contributions to the Partnership. In connection with the admission of ROC as a
General Partner, and in accordance with the terms of the Contribution Agreement,
ROC is hereby contributing to the capital of the Partnership the amounts and/or
properties set forth on Exhibit C attached hereto, and in exchange therefor the
Partnership is hereby issuing to ROC that number of OP Units determined in
accordance with Section 8 of the Contribution Agreement.

      4.2 Omitted.

      4.3 Admission of Partners. Upon admission of a Partner into the
Partnership and receipt of the Partner's Capital Contribution, the Percentage
Interest of the Partner shall be set forth opposite the Partner's name in
Exhibit A attached hereto, which shall be amended as appropriate to reflect
changes in the Percentage Interest of each Partner pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement.

      4.4 Issuance and Conversion of OP Units.

            A. The interest of a Partner in the Partnership is sometimes
      referred to as being evidenced by one or more "OP Units." The aggregate
      total of all OP Units outstanding as of the date of this Agreement after
      giving effect to the Capital Contribution by ROC in accordance with
      Paragraph 4.1 hereof and the number of OP Units owned by each Partner is
      set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto.

            B. From time to time, the General Partners, subject to the
      provisions of this Paragraph 4.4(B), shall cause the Partnership to issue
      additional OP Units either (i) to existing or newly-admitted Partners
      (including itself) in exchange for the contribution by a Partner (the
      "Contributing Partner") of additional Capital Contributions to the
      Partnership, (ii) to the Company upon the issuance by the Company of
      additional shares of its common stock ("Common Stock") not in connection
      with the exchange of OP Units as provided in Paragraph 4.4(C) hereof,
      provided that any net proceeds received by the Company as a result 


                                      10.
<PAGE>   12

      of the issuance of such additional shares of Common Stock are contributed
      to the Partnership as additional Capital Contributions, in accordance with
      Paragraph 4.5(B) hereof (it being understood that the Company may issue
      shares of Common Stock in connection with stock option plans, restricted
      stock plans or other employee benefit plans without receiving any proceeds
      and that the issuance of such shares shall nonetheless entitle the Company
      to additional OP Units). The number of OP Units issued to a Contributing
      Partner under clause (i) of this Paragraph 4.4(B) shall be equal to the
      quotient (rounded to the nearest whole number) arrived at by dividing (x)
      the initial Gross Asset Value of the property contributed as additional
      Capital Contributions (net of any debt to which such property is subject
      or assumed by the Partnership in connection with such contribution) by (y)
      such price as may be determined by the General Partners in connection with
      such contributions. The number of OP Units issued to the Company under
      clause (ii) of this Paragraph 4.4(B) shall be equal to the number of
      shares of Common Stock issued. Upon the issuance of additional OP Units,
      or upon the exchange of OP Units for Common Stock as provided in Paragraph
      4.4(C) hereof, the Percentage Interests of all of the Partners shall be
      adjusted by the General Partners so that the Percentage Interest of each
      Partner is equal to the quotient (expressed as a percentage) arrived at by
      dividing the number of OP Units held by a Partner by the total number of
      OP Units then outstanding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
      contained herein, in no event shall any additional OP Units be issued
      (pursuant to this Paragraph 4.4(B) or otherwise) to the extent that the
      effect of such issuance would be to reduce the General Partners' aggregate
      Percentage Interest to less than one (l%) percent.

            C. Subject to the further provisions of this Paragraph 4.4(C), the
      Company hereby grants to each Limited Partner other than Chateau Estates,
      a Michigan co-partnership, J. Peter Ministrelli and Ministrelli
      Construction Company, a Michigan corporation, (together referred to herein
      as the "Initial Limited Partners") the right to exchange any or all of the
      OP Units held by that Partner for shares of Common Stock. In the case of
      an exchange of OP Units pursuant to this Paragraph 4.4(C), one OP Unit
      shall be exchangeable for one share of Common Stock. Such right may be
      exercised by a Limited Partner from time to time upon not less than ten
      (10) days prior written notice to the Company. The Initial Limited
      Partners shall have the right to exchange the OP Units held by such
      Initial Limited Partners for shares of Common Stock only in accordance
      with the Formula defined in the Appendix to the Private Letter Ruling
      dated April 5, 1996, issued by the Internal Revenue Service to the
      Company. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of
      its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose
      of effecting the exchange of OP Units for shares Common Stock, such number
      of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to
      effect the conversion of all outstanding OP Units subject to conversion
      and not owned by the Company. No Limited Partner shall, by virtue of being
      the holder of one or more OP Units, be deemed to be a shareholder of or
      have any other interest in the Company. In the event of any change in the
      outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, split,
      recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares
      or other similar corporate change, the number of OP Units held by each
      partner shall be proportionately adjusted so that one OP Unit remains
      exchangeable for one share of Common Stock without dilution. In the event
      the Company issues any Common Stock in exchange for OP Units pursuant to
      this Paragraph 4.4(C), any such OP Units so 


                                      11.
<PAGE>   13

      acquired by the Company shall immediately thereafter be converted in the
      hands of the Company into General Partnership Interests. Notwithstanding
      the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 4.4(C), a Limited Partner shall
      not have the right to exchange OP Units for Common Stock if (i) in the
      opinion of counsel to the Company, acceptable to such Limited Partner and
      the Company, the Company would, as a result of such exchange (or the right
      to effectuate such exchange), no longer qualify (or it would be likely
      that the Company no longer would qualify) as a real estate investment
      trust under the Code; or (ii) such exchange (or the right to effectuate
      such exchange) would violate the ownership limitations set forth in the
      Articles of Incorporation of the Company; or (iii) such exchange would
      not, in the opinion of counsel acceptable to such Limited Partner and the
      Company, be an exempt transaction under applicable securities laws.

      4.5 Additional Capital Contributions.

            A. No Partner shall be assessed or, except as provided in Paragraph
      4.5(B) below, required to contribute additional funds or other property to
      the Partnership. Any additional funds or other property required by the
      Partnership, as determined by the General Partners in their sole
      discretion, may, at the option of the General Partners and without any
      obligation to do so (except as provided for in Paragraph 4.5(B) below), be
      contributed by the General Partners as additional Capital Contributions.
      If and when the General Partners or any other Partner makes additional
      Capital Contributions to the Partnership, each such Partner shall receive
      additional OP Units as provided for in Paragraph 4.4 above. The General
      Partners shall also have the right (but not the obligation) to raise any
      additional funds required for the Partnership by causing the Partnership
      to borrow the necessary funds from third parties on such terms and
      conditions as the General Partners shall deem appropriate in their sole
      discretion. If the General Partners elect to cause the Partnership to
      borrow the additional funds, they may cause one or more of the
      Partnership's assets to be encumbered to secure the loan. No Limited
      Partner shall have the right to contribute additional Capital
      Contributions to the Partnership without the prior written consent of the
      General Partners.

            B. The net proceeds of any and all funds raised by or through the
      Company or ROC through the issuance of additional shares of common stock
      of the Company or ROC, as the case may be, shall be contributed to the
      Partnership as additional Capital Contributions, and in such event the
      Company or ROC, as the case may be, shall be issued additional OP Units
      pursuant to Paragraph 4.4 above.

            C. The net proceeds of any and all funds raised by or through the
      Company or ROC through the issuance of shares of preferred stock of the
      Company or ROC, as the case may be, shall be contributed to the
      Partnership as additional Capital Contributions, and in such event the
      Company or ROC, as the case may be, shall be issued additional OP Units
      pursuant to Paragraph 4.4 above; provided that any such OP Units
      ("Preferred OP Units") shall have such terms, preferences and limitations
      consistent with the terms, preferences and limitations of such preferred
      stock. The General Partners shall have the right to amend this Agreement
      at their sole discretion and without the consent of any other Partner
      solely as to 


                                      12.
<PAGE>   14

      matters respecting the issuance of Preferred OP Units by the Partnership.

      4.6 Return of Capital. Except as expressly provided for in this Agreement,
no Partner shall have the right to demand or to receive the return of all or any
part of his Capital Contributions to the Partnership and there shall be no
priority of one Partner over another as to the return of Capital Contributions
or withdrawals or distributions of Net Profits and Net Losses. No Partner shall
have the right to demand or receive property other than cash in return for the
contributions of such Partner to the Partnership.

      4.7 Interest. No interest shall be paid to any Partner on any contribution
to the capital of the Partnership.

      4.8 Negative Capital Accounts. No Partner shall be required to pay to the
Partnership any deficit or negative balance which may exist in its Capital
Account.

                                  ARTICLE FIVE
                          MANAGEMENT OF THE PARTNERSHIP

      5.1 Management of Partnership. The General Partners shall be the sole
managers of the Partnership business, and shall have the right and power to make
all decisions and take any and every action with respect to the property,
business and affairs of the Partnership and shall have all the rights, power and
authority generally conferred by law, or necessary, advisable or consistent with
accomplishing the purposes of the Partnership. All decisions or actions made or
taken by the General Partners hereunder shall require the consent of all General
Partners and shall be binding upon all of the Partners and the Partnership. The
powers of the General Partners to manage the Partnership business shall include,
without limitation, the power and authority to:

            (a) operate any business normal or customary for an owner of or
      investor in manufactured housing community property;

            (b) perform any and all acts necessary or appropriate to the
      operation of the Partnership assets, including, but not limited to,
      applications for rezoning, objections to rezoning of other property and
      the establishment of bank accounts in the name of the Partnership;

            (c) procure and maintain with responsible companies such insurance
      as may be available in such amounts and covering such risks as are deemed
      appropriate by the General Partner;

            (d) take and hold all real, personal and mixed property of the
      Partnership in the name of the Partnership or in the name of a nominee;

            (e) execute and deliver leases on behalf of and in the name of the
      Partnership;


                                      13.
<PAGE>   15

            (f) borrow money, finance and refinance the assets of the
      Partnership or any part thereof or interest therein;

            (g) coordinate all accounting and clerical functions of the
      Partnership and employ such accountants, lawyers, property managers,
      leasing agents and other management or service personnel as may from time
      to time be required to carry on the business of the Partnership;

            (h) acquire, encumber, sell, ground lease or otherwise dispose of
      any or all of the assets of the Partnership, or any part thereof or
      interest therein; and

            (i) organize one or more partnerships or corporations which are
      controlled, directly or indirectly by the Partnership and make any capital
      contributions required pursuant to the partnership agreements of any such
      partnership.

            (j) The Company is hereby designated as the Tax Matters Partner
      ("TMP") as defined in Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code. As Tax Matters
      Partner, the Company shall have full power and authority to act as such
      for the Partnership and the Partners, with all the rights and
      responsibilities of that position described in Sections 6222 through 6232
      of the Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Matters Partner is authorized to
      enter into any settlement with the Internal Revenue Service with respect
      to any administrative or judicial proceedings for the adjustment of
      Partnership items required to be taken into account by a Partner for
      income tax purposes, and in the settlement agreement the Tax Matters
      Partners may expressly state that such agreement shall bind all Partners
      except that such settlement agreement shall not bind any Partner (i) who
      (within the time prescribed pursuant to the Code and Regulations) files a
      statement with the Internal Revenue Service providing that the Tax Matters
      Partner shall not have the authority to enter into a settlement agreement
      on behalf of such Partner or (ii) who is a "notice partner" (as defined in
      Section 6231 of the Code) or a member of a "notice group" (as defined in
      Section 6223 (b)(2) of the Code. In addition, except as restricted
      hereunder, the Company is hereby authorized to make or revoke any election
      permitted by the Partnership by any taxing authority. If the TMP receives
      notice of a Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment ("FPAA") or if a
      request for an administrative adjustment made by the TMP is not allowed by
      the United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and the IRS does not
      notify the TMP of the beginning of an administrative proceeding with
      respect to the Partnership's taxable year to which such request relates
      (or if the IRS so notifies the TMP but fails to mail a timely notice of an
      FPAA), the TMP may, but shall not be obligated to, petition a Court for
      readjustment of partnership items. In the case of a notice of an FPAA, if
      the TMP determines that the United States District Court or Claims Court
      is the most appropriate forum for such a petition, the TMP shall notify
      each person who was Partner at any time during the Partnership's taxable
      year to which the IRS notice relates of the approximate amount by which
      its tax liability would be increased (based on such assumptions as the TMP
      may in good faith make) if the treatment of partnership items on his
      return was made consistent with the treatment of partnership items on the
      Partnership's return, as adjusted by the FPAA. Unless each such person
      deposits with the TMP, for deposit with the IRS, the approximate amount of
      such Partner's increased tax liability, 


                                      14.
<PAGE>   16

      together with a written agreement to make additional deposits if required
      to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of the Court, within thirty
      days after the TMP's notice to such person, the TMP shall not file a
      petition in such Court. Instead, the TMP may, but shall not be obligated
      to, file a petition in the United States Tax Court.

            (k) Each Limited Partner irrevocably appoints the Company as the
      Limited Partner's attorney-in-fact on the behalf and in the stead of such
      Limited Partner to execute, swear to, and file the Partnership's Amended
      and Restated Certificate of Limited Partnership and any amendment or
      revocation thereof, and to execute, sign any Partner's name to, swear to,
      and file any writing, and to give any notice which may be required by any
      rule or law, or which may be appropriate to the effecting of any action by
      or on behalf of the Partnership or the Partners which has been taken as
      provided in this Agreement. This power of attorney is coupled with an
      interest and shall not be revoked by the act, death, or incapacity of any
      Partner. This power of attorney shall survive an assignment by any Limited
      Partner of his or her interest in the Partnership.

      5.2 Limitations on Powers and Authorities of Partners. Notwithstanding the
power of the General Partners set forth in Section 5.1 above, no Partner shall
have the right or power to do any of the following:

            (a) do any act in contravention of this Agreement, or any amendment
      hereto;

            (b) do any act which would make it impossible to carry on the
      ordinary business of the Partnership, except to the extent that such act
      is specifically permitted by the terms hereof (it being understood and
      agreed that, except as hereafter provided in this Paragraph 5.2, a sale of
      any or all of the assets of the Partnership, for example, would be an
      ordinary part of the Partnership's business and affairs and is
      specifically permitted hereby); or

            (c) confess a judgment against the Partnership.

      5.3 Limited Partners. The Limited Partners shall have no right or
authority to act for or to bind the Partnership and no Limited Partner shall
participate in the conduct or control of the Partnership's affairs or business.

      5.4 Liability of General Partners. No General Partner shall be liable or
accountable, in damages or otherwise, to the Partnership or to any other Partner
for any error of judgment or for any mistakes of fact or law or for anything
which it may do or refrain from doing hereafter in connection with the business
and affairs of the Partnership except (i) in the case of fraud, willful
misconduct (such as an intentional breach of fiduciary duty or an intentional
breach of this Agreement) or gross negligence, and (ii) for other breaches of
this Agreement, but the liability of a General Partner under this clause (ii)
shall be limited to its interest in the Partnership as more particularly
provided for in Paragraph 5.8 below. No General Partner shall have any personal
liability for the return of any Limited Partner's capital.

      5.5 Indemnity. The Partnership shall indemnify and shall hold each General
Partner (and 


                                      15.
<PAGE>   17

the officer and directors thereof) harmless from any loss or damage, including
without limitation reasonable legal fees and court costs, incurred by it by
reason of anything it may do or refrain from doing hereafter for and on behalf
of the Partnership or in connection with its business or affairs; provided,
however, that (i) the Partnership shall not be required to indemnify a General
Partner (or any officer or director thereof) for any loss or damage which it
might incur as a result of its fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence in
the performance of its duties hereunder and (ii) this indemnification shall not
relieve a General Partner of its proportionate part of the obligations of the
Partnership as a Partner. In addition, each General Partner shall be entitled to
reimbursement by the Partnership for any amounts paid by it in satisfaction of
indemnification obligations owed by such General Partner to present or former
directors of such General Partner or their predecessors, as provided for in or
pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of such General Partner.
The right of indemnification set forth in this Paragraph 5.5 shall be in
addition to any rights to which the person or entity seeking indemnification may
otherwise be entitled and shall inure to the benefit of the successors and
assigns or any such person or entity. No Partner shall be personally liable with
respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Paragraph 5.5, but
such claim shall be satisfied solely out of assets of the Partnership.

      5.6 Other Activities of Partners and Agreements with Related Parties. The
General Partners shall devote their full-time efforts in furtherance of the
Partnership business, it being expressly understood that except for any direct
interest in a partnership in which the Partnership and one or more of the
General Partners (or a wholly owned subsidiary thereof) are the only partners
and in which the General Partners (or their wholly owned subsidiaries) have an
aggregate interest of not more than one (1%) percent therein, without the
consent of a Majority in Interest the General Partners shall conduct all of
their activities with respect to the manufactured housing community property
business exclusively through the Partnership and shall not conduct or engage in
any way in any other business. Except as may otherwise be agreed to in writing,
each Limited Partner, and its Affiliates, shall be free to engage in, to conduct
or to participate in any business or activity whatsoever, including, without
limitation, the acquisition, development, management and exploitation of real
and personal property (other than property of the Partnership), without any
accountability, liability or obligation whatsoever to the Partnership or to any
other Partner, even if such business or activity competes with or is enhanced by
the business of the Partnership. The General Partners, in the exercise of their
power and authority under this Agreement, may contract and otherwise deal with
or otherwise obligate the Partnership to entities in which the General Partners
or any one or more of the officers, directors or shareholders of the General
Partners may have an ownership or other financial interest, whether direct or
indirect.

      5.7 Other Matters Concerning the General Partners.

            (a) The General Partners shall be protected in relying, acting or
      refraining from acting on any resolution, certificate, statement,
      instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond,
      debenture, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to
      have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

            (b) The General Partners may exercise any of the powers granted or
      perform any of the duties imposed by this Agreement either directly or
      through agents. The General 


                                      16.
<PAGE>   18

      Partners may consult with counsel, accountants, appraisers, management
      consultants, investment bankers and other consultants selected by them,
      each of whom may serve as consultants for the Partnership. An opinion by
      any consultant on a matter which the General Partners believe to be within
      its professional or expert competence shall be full and complete
      protection as to any action taken or omitted by the General Partners based
      on the opinion and taken or omitted in good faith. The General Partners
      shall not be responsible for the misconduct, negligence, acts or omissions
      of any consultant or contractor of the Partnership or of the General
      Partners and shall assume no obligations other than to use due care in the
      selection of all consultants and contractors.

            (c) No mortgagee, grantee, creditor or other person dealing with the
      Partnership shall be required to investigate the authority of any General
      Partner or secure the approval of or confirmation by any Limited Partner
      of any act of any General Partner in connection with the conduct of the
      Partnership business.

            (d) The General Partners may retain such persons or entities as they
      shall determine (including the General Partners or any entity in which the
      General Partners shall have an interest or with which it is affiliated) to
      provide services to or on behalf of the Partnership. The General Partners
      shall be entitled to reimbursement from their Partnership for their
      out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, amounts paid and
      payable to the General Partners or any entity in which its General
      Partners shall have an interest or with which it is affiliated) incurred
      in connection with Partnership business. Such expenses shall be deemed to
      include the expenses required in connection with the administration of the
      Partnership such as the maintenance of Partnership books and records,
      management of the Partnership properties and assets and preparation of
      information respecting the Partnership needed by the Partners in the
      preparation of their individual tax returns.

      5.8 Partnership Exculpation. Except for fraud, willful misconduct and
gross negligence, no Partner shall have any personal liability whatever, whether
to the Partnership or to the other Partners, for the debts or liabilities of the
Partnership or its obligations hereunder, and the full recourse of the other
Partner shall be limited to the interest of that Partner in the Partnership. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, no officer, director or shareholder of the
General Partners shall be liable to the Partnership for money damages except for
(i) active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment or (ii)
actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services.
Without limitation of the foregoing, and except for fraud, willful misconduct
and gross negligence, no property or assets of any Partner, other than its
interest in the Partnership, shall be subject to levy, execution or other
enforcement procedures for the satisfaction of any judgment (or other judicial
process) in favor of any other Partner(s) and arising out of, or in connection
with, this Agreement. This Agreement is executed by the officers of each Partner
solely as officers of the same and not in their own individual capacities. No
advisor, trustee, director, officer, partner, employee, beneficiary,
shareholder, participant or agent of any Partner (or of any partner of a
Partner) shall be personally liable in any matter or to any extent under or in
connection with this Agreement, and the Partnership, each Partner and their
respective successors and assigns shall look solely to the interest of the other

                    ALLOCATION OF NET PROFITS AND NET LOSSES
                           CASH FLOW AND DISTRIBUTIONS

      6.1 Allocation of Net Profits and Net Losses.

      6.1.1 After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
Paragraphs 6.4 and 6.5 hereof, Net Profits for any Partnership fiscal year shall
be allocated first, one hundred percent (100%) to the General Partners to the
extent of the excess, if any, of the cumulative Net Losses allocated pursuant to
Paragraph 6.1.4, which have not effectively been reversed under Paragraphs
6.4(a) or 6.4(d) hereof, over the cumulative Net Profits allocated pursuant to
this Paragraph 6.1.1 for all prior fiscal years;

      6.1.2 Next, among the Partners in proportion to their respective
Percentage Interests.

      6.1.3 After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
Paragraphs 6.4 and 6.5 hereof, Net Losses for any Partnership fiscal year shall
be allocated among the Partners in proportion to their respective Percentage
Interests.

      6.1.4 The Net Losses allocated pursuant to Paragraph 6.1.3 hereof shall
not exceed the maximum amount of Net Losses that can be allocated without
causing any Partner who is not a General Partner to have an Adjusted Capital
Account Deficit at the end of any fiscal year. All losses in excess of the
limitations set forth in this Paragraph 6.1.4 shall be allocated to the General
Partners in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests.

      6.2 Distributions of Operating Cash Flow. As used in this Agreement,
Operating Cash Flow shall mean and be defined as the Net Profits or Net Losses
(a Net Loss being treated as a negative Net Profit amount) during the period in
question of the Partnership increased by the following:


                                      18.
<PAGE>   20

            (a) Any receipts, but excluding Capital Cash Flow and excluding the
      proceeds of any additional Capital Contributions to the Partnership
      pursuant to Paragraphs 4.1 and 4.5 hereof, which are not included in Net
      Profits including, but not limited to, capital contributions and
      withdrawals from operating reserves established by the General Partners;
      and

            (b) Any non-cash charges (such as Depreciation and amortization)
      deducted in determining Net Profits and Net Losses;

- ---and decreased by the following:

            (c) All expenditures, including any principal payments with respect
      to any indebtedness of the Partnership, which are not deducted in
      determining Net Profits or Net Losses; and

            (d) Any amounts set aside by the General Partners to provide a
      reserve for working capital needs, improvements, repairs or replacements
      or such other purposes as the General Partners shall determine in their
      sole discretion, including but not limited to reserves of cash held for
      future acquisitions.

      Operating Cash Flow of the Partnership shall be determined by the General
Partners not less frequently than quarterly and shall be distributed to or for
the benefit of the Partners in accordance with the respective Percentage
Interests of the Partners not later than fifteen (15) days following the date of
each such determination, except that with respect to OP Units issued pursuant to
clause (i) of the first sentence of Paragraph 4.4(B) hereof, the distribution
with respect to the calendar quarter in which such OP Units are first issued
shall be pro rated based upon a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
days in such calendar quarter such OP Units were outstanding and the denominator
of which is the total number of days in such calendar quarter; provided however,
that there shall be no such pro ration with respect to OP Units issued to the
Company or to an entity directly or indirectly controlled by the Company, for
which the Company issues a corresponding number of additional shares of Common
Stock.

      6.3 Capital Cash Flow. As used in this Agreement, "Capital Cash Flow"
shall mean and be defined as collectively (a) gross proceeds realized in
connection with the sale of any assets of the Partnership, (b) gross financing
or refinancing proceeds, (c) gross condemnation proceeds (excluding condemnation
proceeds applied to restoration of remaining Partnership property) and (d) gross
insurance proceeds (excluding rental insurance proceeds or insurance proceeds
applied to restoration of Partnership property), less (a) applicable closing
costs, (b) the cost to discharge any Partnership financing encumbering or
otherwise associated with the asset(s) involved in any such transaction, (c) the
establishment of reserves (as determined by the General Partners in their sole
discretion, and which may include cash held for future acquisitions), and (d)
other expenses of the Partnership then due and owing. Subject to Paragraph 8.1
below, if applicable, Capital Cash Flow shall be distributed to or for the
benefit of the Partners not less frequently than quarterly and shall be
distributed to the Partners in accordance with the respective Percentage
Interests of the Partners not later than fifteen (15) days following the date of
each such determination.

      6.4 Special Allocations. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Article Six, the following allocations may apply:

            (a) Except as provided in Paragraphs 6.4(b) and 6.4(c) hereof, in
      the event any Partner unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations,
      or distributions described in Regulations Sections
      1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or
      1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), which create or increase an Adjusted Capital
      Account Deficit items of Partnership income and gain shall be specially
      allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate,
      to the extent required by the Regulations, the Adjusted Capital Account
      Deficit created by such adjustments, allocations, or distributions as
      quickly as possible; provided that an allocation pursuant to this
      Paragraph 6.4(a) shall be made if and only to the extent that such Partner
      would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all allocations
      provided for in this Article Six have been tentatively made as if this
      Paragraph 6.4(a) were not in this Agreement.

            (b) Except as otherwise provided in Regulations Section 1.704-2(f),
      notwithstanding any other provision of this Article Six, if there is a net
      decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain during any Partnership fiscal year,
      each Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and
      gain for such year (and, if necessary, for subsequent years) in an amount
      equal to such Partner's Share of the net decrease in Partnership Minimum
      Gain, to the extent required and in the manner provided by Sections
      1.704-2(g) of the Treasury Regulations. The items to be so allocated shall
      be determined in accordance with Regulations Sections 1.704-2(f)(6) and
      1.704-2(j)(2). This Paragraph 6.4(b) is intended to comply with the
      minimum gain charge-back provision of Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and
      shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

            (c) Except as otherwise provided in Regulations Section
      1.704-2(i)(4), notwithstanding any other provision of this Article Six, if
      there is a net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain
      attributable to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt during any Partnership fiscal
      year, each Partner who has a share of the Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
      Gain attributable to such Partner Nonrecourse Debt, determined in
      accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(5), shall be specially
      allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if
      necessary, for subsequent years) in an amount equal to such Partner's
      share of the net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain
      attributable to such Partner Nonrecourse Debt, to the extent required and
      in the manner provided by Section 1.704-2(i)(4) of the Treasury
      Regulations. The items to be so allocated shall be determined in
      accordance with Regulations Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(i)(2). This
      Paragraph 6.4(c) is intended to comply with the minimum gain charge-back
      provision of Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted
      consistently therewith.

            (d) In the event any Partner has a deficit Capital Account at the
      end of any Partnership fiscal year which is in excess of the sum of (i)
      the amount such Partner is obligated to restore pursuant to any provision
      of this Agreement, and (ii) the amount such Partner is deemed to be
      obligated to restore pursuant to the penultimate sentences of 


                                      20.
<PAGE>   22

      Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5), each such Partner
      shall be specifically allocated items of Partnership income and gain in
      the amount of such excess as quickly as possible, provided that an
      allocation pursuant to this Paragraph 6.4(d) shall be made only if and to
      the extent that such Partner would have a deficit Capital Account in
      excess of such amount after all other allocations provided for in this
      Paragraph 6.4 have been made as if Paragraph 6.4(a) hereof and this
      Paragraph 6.4(d) were not in this Agreement.

            (e) To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any
      Partnership asset pursuant to Code Section 734(b) or 743(b) is required to
      be taken into account in computing Capital Accounts pursuant to Treasury
      Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the amount of such adjustment to
      the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the
      adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment
      decreases such basis) and shall be specially allocated to the Partners in
      a manner consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are
      required to be adjusted pursuant to such regulations.

            (f) Syndication Expenses for any fiscal year of the Partnership or
      other period shall be allocated to the Partners in proportion to their
      Partnership Interests, provided that if additional Partners are admitted
      to the Partnership on different dates, all Syndication Expenses shall be
      divided among the Partners who own Partnership Interests from time to time
      so that, to the extent possible, the cumulative Syndication Expenses are
      allocated with respect to each Partner in proportion to their respective
      Partnership Interests. In the event the General Partners determine that
      such result is not likely to be achieved through future allocations of
      Syndication Expenses, the General Partners may allocate a portion of Net
      Profits or Net Losses so as to achieve the same effect in the Capital
      Accounts of the Partners, notwithstanding any other provision with this
      Agreement.

            (g) Nonrecourse Deductions for any fiscal year or other period shall
      be allocated among the Partners in accordance with their respective
      Percentage Interests.

            (h) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any fiscal year or other
      period shall be allocated to the Partners who bear the economic risk of
      loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such Partner
      Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury
      Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(1).

            The allocations set forth in this Paragraph 6.4 (the "Regulatory
      Allocations") are intended to comply with certain requirements of Treasury
      Regulation Section 1.704-1(b). The Regulatory Allocations may not be
      consistent with the manner in which the Partners intend to divide
      Partnership distributions. Accordingly, the General Partners are hereby
      authorized to divide other allocations of Net Profit, Net Losses, and
      other items among the Partners so as to prevent the Regulatory Allocations
      from distorting the manner in which Partnership distributions will be
      divided among the Partners pursuant to Article 6 hereof. In general, the
      Partners anticipate that this will be accomplished by specially allocating
      other Net Profit, Net Losses, and items of income, gain, loss, and
      deduction among the Partners so that the net amount of the Regulatory
      Allocations and such special allocations to each such person is zero.
      However, the General Partners shall have discretion to accomplish this
      result 


                                      21.
<PAGE>   23

      in any reasonable manner.

      6.5   Other Allocation Rules

            (a) For purposes of determining the Net Profits, Net Losses, or any
      other items allocable to any period, Net Profits, Net Losses, and any such
      other items shall be determined on a daily, monthly, or other basis, as
      determined by the General Partners using any permissible method under Code
      Section 706 and the Regulations thereunder.

            (b) Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
      the allocation of Net Profits or Net Losses for any fiscal year of the
      Partnership during which a person acquires a Partnership Interest (other
      than on formation of the Partnership) shall take into account the
      Partners' varying interests in the Partnership for such fiscal year,
      pursuant to any method permissible under Section 706 of the Internal
      Revenue Code that is selected by the General Partners.

            (c) The Partners are aware of the income tax consequences of the
      allocations made by this Article Six and hereby agree to be bound by the
      provisions of this Article Six in reporting their share of Partnership
      income and loss for income tax purposes.

            (d) Solely for purposes of determining a Partner's proportionate
      share of the "excess nonrecourse liabilities" of the Partnership within
      the meaning of Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3), the Partners' interests
      in Partnership profits are equal to their respective Percentage Interests.

      6.6 Tax Allocations: Code Section 704(c)

            (a) Income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to any property
      contributed to the capital of the Partnership shall, solely for tax
      purposes, be allocated among the Partners so as to take account of any
      variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the Partnership
      for federal income tax purposes and its initial Gross Asset Value in
      accordance with any permissible manner or manners under Code Section
      704(c) and the Regulations thereunder .

            (b) In the event the Gross Asset Value of any Partnership asset is
      adjusted pursuant to Paragraph 1.14(b) hereof, subsequent allocations of
      income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to such asset shall take
      account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such asset for
      federal income tax purposes and its Gross Asset Value in the same manner
      or manners as under Code Section 704(c) and the Regulations thereunder.

            (c) Any elections or other decisions relating to such allocations
      shall be made by the General Partners in any permissible manner under the
      Code or the Regulations that the General Partners may elect in their sole
      discretion. Allocations pursuant to this Paragraph 6.6 are solely for
      purposes of federal, state, and local taxes and shall not affect, or in
      any way be taken into account in computing, any Partner's Capital Account
      or share of Net Profits, Net 


                                      22.
<PAGE>   24

      Losses, other items, or distributions pursuant to any provision of this
      Agreement.

      6.7 Amounts Withheld. Each Limited Partner hereby authorizes the
Partnership to withhold from or pay on behalf of or with respect to such Limited
Partner any amount of federal, state, local or foreign taxes that the General
Partners determine that the Partnership is required to withhold or pay with
respect to any amount distributable or allocable to such Limited Partner
pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any taxes required to
be withheld or paid by the Partnership pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 or
1446 of the Code. Any amount paid on behalf of or with respect to a Limited
Partner shall constitute a loan by the Partnership to such Limited Partner,
which loan shall be repaid by such Limited Partner within 15 days after notice
from the General Partners that such payment must be made unless (i) the
Partnership withholds such payment from a distribution which would otherwise be
made to the Limited Partner or (ii) the General Partners determine, in their
sole and absolute discretion, that such payment may be satisfied out of the
available funds of the Partnership which would, but for such payment, be
distributed to the Limited Partner. Any amounts withheld pursuant to the
foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) shall be treated as having been distributed to
such Limited Partner. Each Limited Partner hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably grants to the Partnership a security interest in such Limited
Partner's Partnership Interest to secure such Limited Partner's obligation to
pay to the Partnership any amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Section
6.7. In the event that a Limited Partner fails to pay any amounts owed to the
Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.7 when due, the General Partners may, in
their sole and absolute discretion, elect to make the payment to the Partnership
on behalf of such defaulting Limited Partner, and in such event shall be deemed
to have loaned such amount to such defaulting Limited Partner and shall succeed
to all rights and remedies of the Partnership as against such defaulting Limited
Partner (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions). Any
amounts payable by a Limited Partner hereunder shall bear interest at the base
rate on corporate loans at large United States money center commercial banks, as
published from time to time in the Wall Street Journal, plus four percentage
points (but not higher than the maximum lawful rate) from the date such amount
is due (i.e., 15 days after demand) until such amount is paid in full. Each
Limited Partner shall take such actions as the Partnership or the General
Partners shall request in order to perfect or enforce the security interest
created hereunder.

                               TERM OF PARTNERSHIP

      7.1 Commencement. The term of the Partnership shall be deemed to have
commenced upon the filing of the Original Certificate of Limited Partnership.

      7.2 Termination. The term of the Partnership shall end, and the
Partnership shall be dissolved and its affairs wound up in the manner hereafter
provided, solely on the first to occur of the following events ("Liquidating
Event"):

            (a) December 31, 2093;

            (b) the agreement of those Partners holding at least ninety percent
      (90%) of the 


                                      23.
<PAGE>   25

      Percentage Interests of all of the Partners determining that the
      Partnership should be dissolved;

            (c) the happening of any other event that makes it unlawful,
      impossible, or impractical to carry on the business of the Partnership; or

            (d) the withdrawal or removal of the last remaining General Partner,
      the assignment by the last remaining General Partner of its entire
      Partnership Interest (other than by virtue of a merger of such General
      Partner), or the happening of any other event that causes any General
      Partner to cease to be a general partner under the Act, provided that any
      such event shall not constitute a Liquidating Event if the Partnership is
      continued pursuant to this Paragraph 7.2.

      The Partners hereby agree that, notwithstanding any provision of the Act,
the Partnership shall not dissolve prior to the occurrence of a Liquidating
Event. Upon the occurrence of any event set forth in Paragraph 7.2(d) hereof,
the Partnership shall not be dissolved or required to be wound up if within
ninety (90) days after such event a majority in interest (within the meaning of
Section 301.7701-2(b)(1) of the Treasury Regulations, determined in accordance
with Revenue Procedure 94-46, 1994-28 I.R.B. 129, or any successor revenue
procedure or pronouncement of the Internal Revenue Service) of all the remaining
Partners agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the
appointment, effective as of the date of such event, of one or more additional
General Partners if the successor general partner is not a former General
Partner, then the interest in the Partnership of any former General Partner
shall be treated thereafter as the interest of a Limited Partner.

      7.3 Continuation. None of the following shall cause a dissolution or
termination of the Partnership: the death, legal incompetency, dissolution or
insolvency of a Limited Partner or the admission of a new General or Limited
Partner. In such event, and subject to other provisions of this Agreement, the
Partnership shall continue among the remaining Partners and the successor to
such Limited Partner's Partnership Interest. In the event of the death of an
individual Partner, such individual Limited Partner's interest in the
Partnership shall be transferred either by will, the laws of intestacy or
otherwise to the legal representative or successor of such individual Limited
Partner.

                                  ARTICLE EIGHT
                              APPLICATION OF ASSETS

      8.1 Dissolution and Liquidation. Upon the happening of any of the events
specified in Paragraph 7.2 hereof, the General Partners shall conclude the
affairs and liquidate the property and assets of the Partnership and the
proceeds of such liquidation shall be applied in the order of priority as
follows:

            (a) First, to the payment of, or to a reserve for the payment of,
      Partnership liabilities and obligations (other than those described in
      Paragraph 8.1(b) hereof) including such provision for contingent or
      unforeseen liabilities as the General Partners, or by the 


                                      24.
<PAGE>   26

      person(s) winding up the affairs of the Partnership in the event there is
      no remaining General Partner of the Partnership, may establish for any
      contingent or unforeseen liabilities or obligations of the Partnership.
      Such reserves established hereunder shall be held for the purpose of
      paying any such contingent or unforeseen liabilities or obligations and,
      at the expiration of such period as the General Partners, or such
      person(s) deems advisable, the balance of such reserves shall be
      distributed in the manner provided hereinafter in this Paragraph 8.1 as
      though such reserves had been distributed contemporaneously with the other
      funds distributed hereunder:

            (b) Second, to the General Partners and any Affiliate, an amount
      equal to the outstanding principal balance of, and all accrued and unpaid
      interest on, any loans made by them to the Partnership, apportioned
      between them, pro rata, based on the respective balances of such loans;
      and

            (c) Then, to the Partners in accordance with their respective
      Capital Accounts, after giving effect to all contributions, distributions,
      and allocations for all periods.

      To the extent that Partnership assets cannot either be sold without undue
loss or readily divided for distribution in kind to the Partners, then the
Partnership may, as determined by the General Partners or the Trustee appointed
pursuant to Paragraph 8.4 hereof, convey those assets to a trust or other
suitable holding entity established for the benefit of the Partners in order to
permit the assets to be sold without undue loss and the proceeds thereof
distributed to the Partners at a future date. The legal form of the holding
entity, the identity of the trustee or other fiduciary, and the terms of its
governing instrument shall be determined by the General Partners or the Trustee.

      8.2 Power of Attorney. The Limited Partners hereby appoint each of the
General Partners as their true and lawful attorney-in-fact to hold, collect and
disburse, in accordance with this Agreement, any Partnership receivables
existing at the time of the termination of the Partnership and the proceeds of
the collection of such receivables, including those arising from the sale of
Partnership property and assets. The foregoing power of attorney (and all other
powers of attorney granted hereunder) is a special power of attorney coupled
with an interest, is irrevocable and shall survive the transfer or assignment by
a Limited Partner of his or her Partnership Interest and the death or disability
of each Limited Partner; provided, however, such power of attorney shall
terminate upon the distribution of the proceeds of all of such receivables in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The General Partners shall be
entitled to reimbursement for the reasonable expenses incurred by them in acting
under this power of attorney.

      8.4 Appointment of Trustee. If, at the time of dissolution and winding up
of the Partnership there is no General Partner, or if the General Partners have
failed to act in accordance with this Agreement or are otherwise in default
under the terms of this Agreement, which default has not been cured, those
Limited Partners constituting a Majority in Interest shall appoint a liquidating
trustee ("Trustee") to wind up the affairs and liquidate (and/or, if applicable,
distribute) the property and assets of the Partnership, and such Trustee shall
have all powers necessary under this Article Eight and shall be compensated as
agreed upon by the Majority Interest and such Trustee. Such Trustee may, but
need not, be one of the Limited Partners.


                                      25.
<PAGE>   27

      8.5 Date of Termination. The Partnership shall be terminated when all
notes received in connection with the disposition of its assets have been paid
and all of the cash or property available for application and distribution under
Paragraph 8.1 hereof (including amounts held as reserves) shall have been
applied and distributed in accordance therewith.

                                  ARTICLE NINE
                     ASSIGNABILITY OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS
                           AND WITHDRAWAL BY A PARTNER

      9.1 Assignment by the General Partner. In no event may a General Partner
at any time assign, sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of
all or any portion of its Partnership Interest, except by operation of law,
which would include a statutory merger or consolidation of a General Partner. In
the case of a transfer of a General Partner's Partnership Interest by statutory
merger or consolidation only, the transferee receiving such interest shall
become a General Partner of the Partnership and shall succeed to the rights,
interests and obligations of the transferor General Partner in the Partnership.

      9.2 Limited Partner.

            (a) No Limited Partner or Substituted Limited Partner shall, without
      the prior written consent of the General Partners (which consent may be
      given or withheld in the sole discretion of the General Partners), sell,
      assign, distribute or otherwise transfer (a "Transfer") all or any part of
      such Partner's interest in the Partnership except by operation of law,
      gift (outright or in trust) or by sale or distribution, in each case to or
      for the benefit of his spouse or descendants, or to one or more partner,
      shareholder, beneficiary or Affiliate of such Partner, except for pledges
      or other collateral transfers effected by a Limited Partner to secure the
      repayment of a loan, and except for the exchange of OP Units for shares of
      common stock of the company, pursuant to Paragraph 4.4(C) hereof. A
      Limited Partner shall notify the General Partners of any Transfer of
      beneficial interest or other interest which occurs without a transfer of
      record ownership, as well as any pledge or other collateral transfer. No
      part of the interest of a Limited Partner shall be subject to the claims
      of any creditor, any spouse for alimony or support, or to legal process,
      and may not be voluntarily or involuntarily alienated or encumbered except
      as may be specifically provided for in this Agreement.

            (b) An assignee, legatee, distributee or other transferee (whether
      by conveyance, operation of law or otherwise) (a "Transferee") of all or
      any portion of a Limited Partner's interest in the Partnership shall be
      entitled to receive Net Profits, Net Losses and distributions hereunder
      attributable to such interest acquired by reason of such Transfer, from
      and after the effective date of the Transfer of such interest; provided,
      however, anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (a)
      no Transfer by a Limited Partner shall be effective until such Transfer
      has been consented to by the General Partners, (b) no Transferee shall be
      considered a Substituted Limited Partner without the prior written 


                                      26.
<PAGE>   28

      consent of the General Partners, in their sole discretion, (c) the
      Partnership and the General Partners shall be entitled to treat the
      transferor of such interest as the absolute owner thereof in all respects,
      and shall incur no liability for the allocation of Net Profits and Net
      Losses or distributions which are made to such transferor until such time
      as the written instrument of Transfer has been received by the General
      Partners and the "effective date" of the Transfer has passed. The
      "effective date" of any Transfer shall be the last day of the month set
      forth on the written instrument of Transfer or such other date consented
      to in writing by the General Partners as the "effective date."

            (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
      Paragraph 9.2, (i) in the event of a permitted transfer under Paragraph
      9.2(a) hereof or in the event an Affiliate distributes, in dissolution and
      liquidation or otherwise, all or any portion of its interest in the
      Partnership, the permitted transferee and/or partners in such Affiliate
      receiving such interest shall become Substituted Limited Partners, and
      shall succeed to the rights, interests and obligations of their respective
      transferor in the Partnership, in proportion to their respective interests
      so received, and (ii) no Transfer shall be effective to the extent that
      such Transfer would, by treating the interest in the Partnership so
      transferred as if it had been exchanged for Common Stock in accordance
      with Paragraph 4.4(C) hereof, violate the limitations on ownership of
      Common Stock contained in Article VII of the Articles of Incorporation of
      the Company.

            (d) Admission Adjustments. The General Partners shall, when
      necessary, cause this Agreement to be amended from time to time to reflect
      the addition or withdrawal of Partners, including the corresponding
      adjustments to Percentage Interests and OP Units required pursuant to
      Paragraphs 4.4(B), 4.4(C) and 9.2(c) hereof.

      9.3 Withdrawal of a Limited Partner. No Limited Partner may retire or
withdraw from the Partnership prior to the dissolution of the Partnership and
the completion of the winding up of the affairs and the liquidation (and/or
distribution, as the case may be) of the property and assets of the Partnership
pursuant to the provisions of Article Eight hereof.

Company and its Subsidiaries.

set forth below:

            "Award Agreement" means a written agreement in a form approved by
the Committee to be entered into by the Company and the Optionee of an Option or

            "Board" means the Board of Directors of the Company.

            "Cause" means, unless otherwise provided in the Participant's Award

gross neglect, (ii) repeatedly failing to adhere to the directions of superiors
or the Board or the written policies and practices of the Company or its

<PAGE>   2

act detrimental to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its affiliates; provided,
however, that if the Participant is a party to an employment agreement with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and such agreement provides for termination
for "Cause," "Cause" hereunder shall have the same meaning ascribed to it in the
employment agreement.

            "Change in Control" means the occurrence of one of the following:

                  a. a "person" or "group" (within the meaning of sections 13(d)
                  and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) becomes the "beneficial owner"
                  (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of
                  securities of the Company (including options, warrants, rights
                  and convertible and exchangeable securities) representing 50%
                  or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then

                  provided, however, that purchases by employee benefit plans of

                  disregarded;

                  b. any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one

                  substantially all, of the operating assets of the Company;

                  c. the execution and delivery of a definitive agreement by the
                  Company that provides for a merger or consolidation, or a
                  transaction having a similar effect (unless such merger,
                  consolidation or similar transaction is with a subsidiary of
                  the Company or with another company, a majority of whose
                  outstanding capital stock is owned by the same persons or
                  entities who own a majority of the Common Stock at such time),
                  where (A) the Company is not the surviving corporation, (B)
                  the majority of the Common Stock of the Company is no longer
                  held by the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to
                  the transaction, or (C) the Company's Common Stock is
                  converted into cash, securities or other property (other than
                  the common stock of a company into which the Company is
                  merged); provided, however, that, in the event that the
                  contemplated merger, consolidation or similar transaction is
                  not consummated, then any rights that may arise under this
                  Section 5.3(a) by virtue of such Change of Control shall cease
                  to apply;

                  d. at a time when the Common Stock is registered under Section
                  12 of the Exchange Act, a person 


                                       2
<PAGE>   3

                  other than the Company makes a tender or exchange offer for
                  50% or more of the Common Stock pursuant to which purchases of
                  any amount of Common Stock are made; or

                  e. a majority of the members of the Board are not persons who
                  (A) had been directors of the Company for at least the
                  preceding 24 consecutive months or (B) when they initially
                  were elected to the Board, (I) were nominated (if they were
                  elected by the stockholders) or elected (if they were elected
                  by the directors) with the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
                  the directors who were Continuing Directors (as defined below)
                  at the time of the nomination or election by the Board and
                  (II) were not elected as a result of an actual or threatened
                  solicitation of proxies or consents by a person other than the
                  Board or an agreement intended to avoid or settle such a proxy
                  solicitation (the directors described in clauses (A) and (B)
                  being "Continuing Directors").

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a "Change of Control" shall not include an
offering of any class of shares of common stock of the Company or any of its
affiliates under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

            "Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

            "Committee" means the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board.

            "Disability" means the occurrence of an event which would entitle an
employee of the Company to the payment of disability income under one of the
Company's approved long-term disability income plans or a long-term disability
as determined by the Committee in its absolute discretion pursuant to any other
standard as may be adopted by the Committee; provided, however, that if the
Participant is a party to an employment agreement with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and such agreement provides for termination by reason of

            4. Eligibility for and Grant of Options and Restricted Stock;
Committee Authority.

            Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall, in its
discretion as reflected by the terms of the Award Agreements: (i) authorize the
granting of Options or Restricted Stock (or both) to key employees, directors
and key consultants of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) determine and
designate from time to time those key employees, directors and key consultants
of the Company and its Subsidiaries to whom Options and Restricted Stock are to

qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, it shall constitute a separate Non-


                                       6
<PAGE>   7

Qualified Stock Option); (iv) determine the number of Shares subject to each
Option or Grant, as applicable; (v) determine the time or times when and the
manner and condition in which each Option shall be exercisable and the duration
of the exercise period, and the restrictions applicable to Restricted Stock; and
(vi) determine or impose other conditions to the grant or exercise of Options
and grant of Restricted Stock under the Plan as it may deem appropriate. In
determining the eligibility of an employee, director and key consultant to
receive an Option or Grant, as well as in determining the number of Shares to be
optioned or granted thereto, the Committee may consider his or her position and
responsibilities, the nature and value to the Company of his or her services and
accomplishments whether directly or through its Subsidiaries, his or her present
and potential contribution to the success of the Company whether directly or
through its Subsidiaries and such other factors as the Committee may deem
relevant. The Award Agreement shall contain such other terms, provisions and
conditions not inconsistent herewith as shall be determined by the Committee.
The Participant shall take whatever additional actions and execute whatever
additional documents the Committee may in its reasonable judgment deem necessary
or advisable in order to carry out or effect one or more of the obligations or
restrictions imposed on the Participant pursuant to the express provisions of
the Plan and the Award Agreement. The Committee shall cause each Option to be
designated as an Incentive Stock Option or a Non-Qualified Stock Option.

            5. Number of Shares Subject to the Plan.


                                       7
<PAGE>   8

            Subject to adjustments pursuant to Section 11, (i) no more than an
aggregate of 950,000 Shares may be the subject of Options or Grants, provided
that 250,000 of the Shares available under the Plan shall be reserved for grant
in connection with the Company's annual bonus program referred to in clause (i)
of Section 7B, and shall not be used for any other purpose hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, Shares as to which
an Option is granted under the Plan that remains unexercised at the expiration,
forfeiture or other termination of such Option and Shares of Restricted Stock
that are forfeited may be the subject of the grant of further Options or Grants
of a type for which the Shares were initially available. Shares of Common Stock
issued hereunder may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued
shares or treasury shares. The certificates for Shares issued hereunder may
include any legend which the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any
restrictions on transfer hereunder or under the Award Agreement, or as the
Committee may otherwise deem appropriate.

            The aggregate Fair Market Value, determined as of the date an Option
is granted, of the Common Stock for which any optionee may be awarded Incentive
Stock Options which are first exercisable by the optionee during any calendar
year under the Plan (or any other stock option plan required to be taken into
account under Section 422(d) of the Code) shall not exceed $100,000.

            6. Options.

            A. Option Price.


                                       8
<PAGE>   9

            The Option Price shall be determined by the Committee on the date
the Option is granted and reflected in the Award Agreement. Any particular Award
Agreement may provide for different exercise prices for specified amounts of
Shares subject to the Option. The Option Price with respect to each Incentive
Stock Option shall not be less than 100% (or 110%, in the case of an individual
described in Section 422(b)(6) of the Code (relating to certain 10% owners)) of
the Fair Market Value of a Share on the day the Option is granted.

            B. Period of Option and Vesting.

            (a) Unless earlier expired, forfeited or otherwise terminated, each
Option shall expire in its entirety upon the tenth anniversary of the date of
grant or shall have such other term as is set forth in the applicable Award
Agreement (except that, in the case of an individual described in Section
422(b)(6) of the Code (relating to certain 10% owners) who is granted an
Incentive Stock Option, the term of such Option shall be no more than five years
from the date of grant). The Option shall also expire, be forfeited and
terminate at such times and in such circumstances as otherwise provided
hereunder or under the Award Agreement.

            (b) Each Option, to the extent that there has been no termination of
the Optionee's employment (or other service, if applicable) and the Option has
not otherwise lapsed, expired, terminated or been forfeited, shall first become
exercisable according to the terms and conditions set forth in the Award
Agreement, as determined by the Committee at the time of grant. 


                                       9
<PAGE>   10

Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement or herein, no Option (or
portion thereof) shall ever be exercisable if the Optionee's employment or other
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries has terminated before the time at
which such Option would otherwise have become exercisable, and any Option that
would otherwise become exercisable after such termination shall not become
exercisable and shall be forfeited upon such termination. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6B(b), Options exercisable pursuant to the
schedule set forth by the Committee at the time of grant may be fully or more
rapidly exercisable or otherwise vested at any time in the discretion of the
Committee. Upon and after the death of an Optionee, such Optionee's Options, if
and to the extent otherwise exercisable hereunder or under the applicable Award
Agreement after the Optionee's death, may be exercised by the Successors of the
Optionee.

            C. Exercisability Upon and After Termination of Optionee.

            (a) The Committee shall provide in the Award Agreement the extent
(if any) to which any Option may be exercised upon the Optionee's termination of
employment (or other service).

            (b) Except as may otherwise be expressly set forth in this Section
6C, and except as may otherwise be expressly provided under the Award Agreement,
no provision of this Section 6C is intended to or shall permit the exercise of
the Option to the extent the Option was not exercisable upon cessation of
employment or other service.


                                       10
<PAGE>   11

            D. Exercise of Options.

            (a) Subject to vesting and other restrictions provided for hereunder
or otherwise imposed in accordance herewith, an Option may be exercised, and
payment in full of the aggregate Option Price made, by an Optionee only by
written notice (in the form prescribed by the Committee) to the Company
specifying the number of Shares to be purchased.

            (b) Without limiting the scope of the Committee's discretion
hereunder, the Committee may impose such other restrictions on the exercise of
Incentive Stock Options (whether or not in the nature of the foregoing
restrictions) as it may deem necessary or appropriate.

            E. Payment.

            (a) The aggregate Option Price shall be paid in full upon the
exercise of the Option. Payment must be made by one of the following methods:

                  (i) a certified or bank cashier's check;

                  (ii) the proceeds of a Company loan program or third-party
            sale program or a notice acceptable to the Committee given as
            consideration under such a program, in each case if permitted by the
            Committee in its discretion, if such a program has been established
            and the Optionee is eligible to participate therein;

                  (iii) if approved by the Committee in its discretion, Shares
            of previously owned Common Stock (not subject to restrictions
            hereunder) having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of
            exercise equal to the aggregate Option Price;

                  (iv) if approved by the Committee in its discretion, through
            the written election of the Optionee to have Shares withheld by the
            Company from the Shares otherwise to be received, with such withheld
            Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of exercise
            equal to the aggregate Option Price;


                                       11
<PAGE>   12

            or

                  (v) by any combination of such methods of payment or any other
            method acceptable to the Committee in its discretion.

            (b) The Committee, in its discretion, may also permit the Optionee
to elect to exercise an Option by receiving a combination of Shares and cash,
or, in the discretion of the Committee, either Shares or solely in cash, with an
aggregate Fair Market Value (or, to the extent of payment in cash, in an amount)
equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which
the Option is being exercised over the aggregate Option Price, as determined as
of the day the Option is exercised.

            (c) Except in the case of Options exercised by certified or bank
cashier's check, the Committee may impose limitations and prohibitions on the
exercise of Options as it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, any
limitation or prohibition designed to avoid accounting consequences which may
result from the use of Common Stock as payment upon exercise of an Option. Any
fractional Shares resulting from an Optionee's election that are accepted by the
Company shall in the discretion of the Committee be paid in cash.

            F. Tax Withholding -- Options.

            The Committee may, in its discretion, require the Optionee to pay to
the Company at the time of exercise of any Option the amount that the Committee
deems necessary to satisfy the Company's obligation to withhold federal, state
or local income or other taxes incurred by reason of the exercise. Upon exercise
of the Option, the Optionee may, if approved by the 


                                       12
<PAGE>   13

Committee in its discretion, make a written election to have Shares then issued
withheld by the Company from the Shares otherwise to be received, or to deliver
previously owned Shares (not subject to restrictions hereunder), in order to
satisfy the liability for such withholding taxes. In the event that the Optionee
makes, and the Committee permits, such an election, the number of Shares so
withheld or delivered shall have an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of
exercise sufficient to satisfy the applicable withholding taxes. Where the
exercise of an Option does not give rise to an obligation by the Company to
withhold federal, state or local income or other taxes on the date of exercise,
but may give rise to such an obligation in the future, the Committee may, in its
discretion, make such arrangements and impose such requirements as it deems
necessary or appropriate. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the
contrary, the Optionee's satisfaction of any tax-withholding requirements
imposed by the Committee shall be a condition precedent to the Company's
obligation as may otherwise be provided hereunder to provide Shares to the
Optionee, and the failure of the Optionee to satisfy such requirements with
respect to the exercise of an Option shall cause such Option to be forfeited.

            G. Exercise by Successors and Payment in Full.

            An Option may be exercised, and payment in full of the aggregate
Option Price made, by the Successors of the Optionee only by written notice (in
the form prescribed by the Committee) to the Company specifying the number of
Shares to be purchased. Such notice shall state that the aggregate Option Price
will be 


                                       13
<PAGE>   14

paid in full, or that the Option will be exercised as otherwise provided
hereunder, in the discretion of the Company or the Committee, if and as
applicable.

            H. Nontransferability of Option.

            Each Option granted under the Plan shall by its terms be
nontransferable by the Optionee except by will or the laws of descent and
distribution of the state wherein the Optionee is domiciled at the time of his
death; provided, however, that the Committee may (but need not) permit other
transfers, where the Committee concludes that such transferability (i) does not
result in accelerated taxation, (ii) does not cause any Option intended to be an
Incentive Stock Option to fail to be described in Section 422(b) of the Code and
(iii) is otherwise appropriate and desirable.

            7. Restricted Stock.

            A. Certificates for Restricted Stock.

            (a) Each Grantee shall be issued a stock certificate in respect of
Shares of Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan. Such certificate shall be
registered in the name of the Grantee, and (without limiting the provisions
relating to the legending of Share certificates contained in Section 5) shall
bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions
applicable to such award, substantially in the following form:

            The transferability of this certificate and the shares of stock
            represented hereby are subject to the terms and conditions
            (including forfeiture) of the Corporation's Equity Participation
            Plan and an Agreement 


                                       14
<PAGE>   15

            entered into between the registered owner and the Corporation.
            Copies of such Plan and Agreement are on file in the offices of the
            Corporation.

            (b) The Committee shall require that the stock certificates
evidencing such Shares be held in custody by the Company until the restrictions
thereon shall have lapsed, and that, as a condition of any Restricted Stock
award, the Grantee shall have delivered a stock power, endorsed in blank,
relating to the stock covered by such award. If and when such restrictions so
lapse, the stock certificates shall be delivered by the Company to the recipient
or his or her designee.

            B. Restrictions and Conditions.

            The Shares of Restricted Stock awarded pursuant to the Plan shall be
subject to the following restrictions and conditions:

                  (i) Subject to the provisions of the Plan and the Award
            Agreements, during a period set by the Committee commencing with the
            date of such award and ending on a date established by the
            Committee, the Grantee shall not be permitted voluntarily or
            involuntarily to sell, transfer, pledge, anticipate, alienate,
            encumber or assign Shares of Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan
            (or have such shares attached or garnished). Unless otherwise
            determined by the Committee, the restriction period with respect to
            Shares issued to Grantees on account of their elections to receive
            all or a portion of their annual bonuses under the Company's annual
            bonus program in Shares of Restricted Stock hereunder shall be for a
            period of three years from the date of grant.

                  (ii) Except as provided in the foregoing clause (i), the
            Grantee shall have, in respect of the Shares of Restricted Stock,
            all of the rights of a stockholder of the Company, including the
            right to vote the Shares, and the right to receive any cash
            dividends. Certificates for shares of Stock (not subject to
            restrictions) shall be delivered to the Grantee promptly after, and
            only after, the period of 


                                       15
<PAGE>   16

            forfeiture shall expire without forfeiture in respect of such Shares
            of Restricted Stock.

                  (iii) Subject to the provisions of the Award Agreement and
            clause (iv) below, upon the termination of employment (or other
            service, if applicable) with the Company and its Subsidiaries for
            any reason or by the Grantee during the applicable restriction
            period, all Shares still subject to restriction shall be forfeited
            by the Grantee.

                  (iv) In the event the Grantee's employment with the Company
            and its Subsidiaries terminates on account of death, Retirement or
            Disability of the Grantee during the applicable restriction period,
            restrictions will immediately lapse on all Restricted Stock granted
            under this Section 7.

            C. Tax Withholding -- Restricted Stock.

            The Committee may, in its discretion, require the Grantee to pay to
the Company at the time of vesting of any Restricted Stock (or other income
recognition event, such as election under Section 83(b) of the Code) the amount
that the Committee deems necessary to satisfy the Company's obligation to
withhold federal, state or local income or other taxes incurred by reason of the
vesting (or other such event). Upon vesting (or such other event), the Grantee
may, if approved by the Committee in its discretion, make a written election to
have Shares withheld by the Company from the Shares otherwise to be released
from restriction, or to deliver previously owned Shares (not subject to
restrictions hereunder), in order to satisfy the liability for such withholding
taxes. In the event that the Optionee makes, and the Committee permits, such an
election, the number of Shares so withheld or delivered shall have an aggregate
Fair Market Value on the date of exercise sufficient to satisfy the applicable
withholding taxes. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan 


                                       16
<PAGE>   17

to the contrary, the Grantee's satisfaction of any tax-withholding requirements
imposed by the Committee shall be a condition precedent to the release of any
restrictions as may otherwise be provided hereunder, and the failure of the
Grantee to satisfy such requirements with respect to the vesting of Restricted
Stock (or another income recognition event) shall cause the applicable
Restricted Stock to be forfeited.

            8. Regulations and Approvals.

            (a) The obligation of the Company to sell Shares with respect to
Options granted under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules
and regulations, including all applicable federal and state securities laws, and
the obtaining of all such approvals by governmental agencies as may be deemed
necessary or appropriate by the Committee.

            (b) The Committee may make such changes to the Plan as may be
necessary or appropriate to comply with the rules and regulations of any
government authority or to obtain tax benefits applicable to stock options or
restricted stock.

            (c) Each Option and grant of Restricted Stock is subject to the
requirement that, if at any time the Committee determines, in its discretion,
that the listing, registration or qualification of Shares issuable pursuant to
the Plan is required by any securities exchange or under any state or federal
law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body is necessary
or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the grant of an Option or
the issuance of Shares of Restricted Stock or other Shares, no Options shall be
granted or payment made 


                                       17
<PAGE>   18

or Shares issued or grant of Restricted Stock made, in whole or in part, unless
listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval has been effected or
obtained free of any conditions in a manner acceptable to the Committee.

            (d) In the event that the disposition of stock acquired pursuant to
the Plan is not covered by a then current registration statement under the
Securities Act, and is not otherwise exempt from such registration, such Shares
shall be restricted against transfer to the extent required under the Securities
Act, and the Committee may require any individual receiving Shares pursuant to
the Plan, as a condition precedent to receipt of such Shares, to represent to
the Company in writing that the Shares acquired by such individual are acquired
for investment only and not with a view to distribution and that such Shares
will be disposed of only if registered for sale under the Securities Act or if
there is an available exemption for such disposition.

            9. Interpretation and Amendments; Other Rules.

            The Committee may make such rules and regulations and establish such
procedures for the administration of the Plan as it deems appropriate. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may (i) determine (A)
the conditions under which a Participant will be considered to have retired or
become disabled and (B) whether any Participant has done so; (ii) establish or
assist in the establishment of a program (which need not be administered in a
nondiscriminatory or uniform manner) under which the Company or a third party
may make bona-fide loans 


                                       18
<PAGE>   19

on arm's-length terms to any or all Optionees to assist such Optionees with the
satisfaction of any or all of the obligations that such Optionees may have
hereunder or under which third-party sales may be made for such purpose
(including, without limitation, a loan program under which the Company or a
third party would advance the aggregate Option Price to the Optionee and be
repaid with Option stock or the proceeds thereof and a sale program under which
funds to pay for Option stock are delivered by a third party upon the third
party's receipt from the Company of stock certificates); (iii) determine the
extent, if any, to which Options or Shares (whether or not Shares of Restricted
Stock) shall be forfeited (whether or not such forfeiture is expressly
contemplated hereunder); (iv) interpret the Plan and the Award Agreements
hereunder, with such interpretations to be conclusive and binding on all persons
and otherwise accorded the maximum deference permitted by law; and (v) take any
other actions and make any other determinations or decisions that it deems
necessary or appropriate in connection with the Plan or the administration or
interpretation thereof. Unless otherwise expressly provided hereunder, the
Committee, with respect to any Option or Grant, may exercise its discretion
hereunder at the time of the award or thereafter. In the event of any dispute or
disagreement as to the interpretation of the Plan or of any rule, regulation or
procedure, or as to any question, right or obligation arising from or related to
the Plan, the decision of the Committee shall be final and binding upon all
persons. The Board may amend the Plan as it shall deem advisable, except that no
amendment may adversely 


                                       19
<PAGE>   20

affect a Participant with respect to Options or Restricted Stock previously
granted unless such amendments are in connection with compliance with applicable
laws; provided that the Board may not make any amendment in the Plan that would,
if such amendment were not approved by the holders of the Common Stock, cause
the Plan to fail to comply with any requirement of applicable law or regulation,
unless and until the approval of the holders of such Common Stock is obtained.
General 162(m) provision -- Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Committee may (subject to such considerations as may arise under Section 16
of the Exchange Act, or under other corporate, securities or tax laws) take any
steps it deems appropriate, that are not inconsistent with the purposes and
intent of the Plan, to take into account the provisions of Section 162(m) of the
Code.

            10. Changes in Capital Structure.

            If (i) the Company or its Subsidiaries shall at any time be involved
in a merger, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, reorganization, exchange
of shares, sale of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or a transaction similar thereto, (ii) any stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, stock combination, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar change in the capital structure of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, or any distribution to holders of Common Stock other than
cash dividends, shall occur or (iii) any other event shall occur which in the
judgment of the Committee necessitates action by way of adjusting the terms of
the outstanding Options and Restricted Stock, then 


                                       20
<PAGE>   21

the Committee may forthwith take any such action as in its judgment shall be
necessary to preserve to the Participants rights substantially proportionate to
the rights existing prior to such event, and to maintain the continuing
availability of Shares under Section 4 (if Shares are otherwise then available)
in a manner consistent with the intent hereof, including, without limitation,
adjustments in (x) the number and kind of shares subject to Options and Grants,
(y) the Option Price, and (z) the number and kind of shares available under
Section 4. To the extent that such action shall include an increase or decrease
in the number of shares subject to outstanding Options and Grants, the number of
shares available under Section 4 above shall be increased or decreased, as the
case may be, proportionately.

            If a Change of Control shall occur, then the Committee may make such
adjustments as it, in its discretion, determines are necessary or appropriate in
light of the Change of Control (including, without limitation, the substitution
of stock other than stock of the Company as the stock optioned or granted (as
applicable) hereunder, and the acceleration of the exercisability of the Option
or vesting of the Restricted Stock), provided that the Committee determines that
such adjustments do not have a substantial adverse economic impact on the
Participant as determined at the time of the adjustments.

            The judgment of the Committee with respect to any matter referred to
in this Section 11 shall be conclusive and binding upon each Participant without
the need for any amendment to the Plan.


                                       21
<PAGE>   22

            11. Notices.

            All notices under the Plan shall be in writing, and if to the
Company, shall be delivered to the Board or mailed to its principal office,
addressed to the attention of the Board; and if to the Participant, shall be
delivered personally or mailed to the Participant at the address appearing in
the records of the Company. Such addresses may be changed at any time by written
notice to the other party given in accordance with this Section 12.

            12. Rights as Stockholder.

            Neither the Optionee nor any person entitled to exercise the
Optionee's rights in the event of death shall have any rights of a stockholder
with respect to the Shares subject to an Option, except to the extent that a
certificate for such Shares shall have been issued upon the exercise of the
Option as provided for herein.

            13. Rights to Employment. Nothing in the Plan or in any Option or
Restricted Stock granted pursuant to the Plan shall confer on any individual any
right to continue in the employ or other service of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and its shareholders to terminate the individual's employment or
other service at any time.

            14.   Exculpation and Indemnification.

            To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company shall indemnify
and hold harmless the members of the Board and the members of the Committee from
and against any and all liabilities, 


                                       22
<PAGE>   23

costs and expenses incurred by such persons as a result of any act or omission
to act in connection with the performance of such person's duties,
responsibilities and obligations under the Plan, other than such liabilities,
costs and expenses as may result from the gross negligence, bad faith, willful
misconduct or criminal acts of such persons.

            15. Captions.

            The use of captions in this Plan is for convenience. The captions
are not intended to provide substantive rights.

            16. Governing Law.

            THE PLAN SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF MARYLAND, WITHOUT
REFERENCE TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS.
