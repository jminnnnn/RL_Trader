- -------           --------

General Development of Business

Chateau Communities, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed equity real
estate investment trust ("REIT"), and the largest owner/manager of manufactured
home communities in the United States. We conduct substantially all of our
activities through CP Limited Partnership, a Maryland Limited Partnership (the
"Operating Partnership"), in which we own, directly and through ROC Communities,
Inc. ("ROC"), the other general partner of the Operating Partnership, an
approximate 83% general partner interest. We consider ourselves to be engaged in
only one industry segment. We own and operate 217 manufactured home communities
(the "Properties") containing 70,723 homesites and 1,359 park model/RV sites in
33 states. We also fee manage 38 manufactured home community properties
containing 8,118 homesites. In addition, we are involved in the development and
expansion of manufactured home communities, and through our subsidiary,
Community Sales, Inc. ("CSI"), the sale of new and pre-owned homes, brokerage of
used homes and in assisting residents in arranging financing and insurance
services.

Formation of the Company

We were formed in Maryland on August 25, 1993, as Chateau Properties, Inc., to
continue and expand the manufactured home community operations and business
objectives of Chateau Estates, a Michigan co-partnership, which had developed,
owned and operated manufactured home communities and properties since 1966.

Industry Overview

A manufactured home community is a residential subdivision designed and improved
with homesites for the placement of manufactured homes, including related
improvements and amenities. Manufactured homes are detached, single-family homes
which are produced off-site by manufacturers and installed on sites within the
community. Manufactured homes are available in a variety of architectural styles
and floor plans, offering a variety of amenities, custom options and on-site
built additional structures, such as a garage, carport or storage unit.

Modern manufactured home communities are similar to typical residential
subdivisions and generally contain centralized entrances, paved streets, curbs,
gutters and parkways. In addition, such communities often provide a variety of
amenities to residents which may include: a clubhouse; swimming pools and
jacuzzis; playgrounds; basketball, shuffleboard, and tennis courts; picnic
areas; cable television service; golf courses; marinas; and laundry facilities.
Utilities are provided or arranged for by the owner of the community. Some
communities provide water and sewer service through public or private utilities,
while others provide these services to residents from on-site facilities.

The owner of each home in a manufactured home community leases a site from the
community. The manufactured home community is the owner of the underlying land,
utility connections, streets, lighting, driveways, common area amenities and
other capital improvements and is responsible for enforcement of community
guidelines and maintenance. Each resident within the manufactured home community
is responsible for the maintenance of his/her home and leased site.

Additionally, manufactured home communities tend to have stable resident bases,
with relatively few residents moving their homes out of the communities.
Management thus tends to be more stable, and capital expenditures needs less
significant, relative to multi-family rental apartment complexes.

Operating and Investment Strategies

We seek to maximize long-term growth in income and portfolio value through
active management and expansion of certain manufactured home communities and
selective acquisition and development of additional communities. We focus on
manufactured home communities that have growth potential and expect to hold such
properties for long-term investment and capital appreciation. We have reviewed
the focus of our basic property management activities to include:

Operations

       *      Collections

       *      Budget Control

       *      Sales and marketing

       *      Community appearance

       *      Resident Relations

Development, Expansion and Acquisitions

       *      Utilizing the expertise and relationships developed by our
              management to identify acquisition and development opportunities;

       *      Selectively developing new communities in strategically desirable
              regions where development is supported by favorable demographics
              and strong market demand;

       *      Capitalizing on opportunities to renovate and expand properties
              consistent with local market demand;

       *      Selectively acquiring well-located manufactured home communities
              that demonstrate the potential for increase in revenue and cash
              flow through professional property management, improved operating
              efficiencies, aggressive leasing and, where appropriate, expansion
              on adjacent land; and

                                       4

Financing Strategies

We intend to maintain a conservative and flexible capital structure that enables
us to (i) continue to access the capital markets on favorable terms; (ii)
enhance potential earnings growth; (iii) minimize our level of encumbered
assets; and (iv) limit our exposure to variable rate debt. We intend to maintain
a debt-to-market capitalization ratio of approximately 50% or less. We will,
however, re-evaluate this policy from time to time and decrease or increase such
ratio accordingly in light of then current economic conditions, relative costs
to us of debt and equity capital, market values of the properties and other
factors.

During 2001, we made a significant acquisition of 46 communities for $552
million. In connection with this acquisition, we increased our leverage to just
over fifty percent. Simultaneously, we announced a disposition strategy to
identify non-core assets for disposition. The proceeds from the dispositions
will be used to reduce our short-term debt issued in connection with the
acquisition and ultimately to reduce our debt to market capitalization ratio.
During 2001, we disposed of seven properties for an aggregate sales price of $42
million and reduced our debt to market capitalization ratio to 48 percent as of
December 31, 2001.

To the extent we seek to obtain additional financing in the future, we may,
depending on market conditions, do so through additional equity or debt
financings. Equity financing may include sales of our common stock or preferred
stock or issuance of common or preferred partnership units by our operating
partnership for cash. We may also issue our equity securities in exchange for
property acquisitions. Debt financings are expected to involve the issuance of
senior notes by our operating partnership, additional mortgage financings and
borrowings under existing or new revolving credit facilities.

Expansion and Improvement of Manufactured Home Community Properties

We will seek to increase the income generated from our manufactured home
communities by expanding the number of sites available to be leased to
residents, if justified by local market conditions and permitted by zoning and
other applicable laws, and by filling vacant sites. We are currently involved in
expansion of our existing properties, as well as the development of our 14
greenfield developments. The majority of these greenfield properties are owned
through joint ventures. During 2001, we substantially completed the development
of approximately 350 sites. As of December 31, 2001, we owned undeveloped land
adjacent to existing communities containing approximately 4,800 expansion sites,
and greenfield developments which contain approximately 4,900 future sites, all
of which are zoned for manufactured housing. The undeveloped land will
facilitate additional growth to the extent market conditions warrant. In
addition, where appropriate, we will consider upgrading or adding facilities and
amenities to certain communities in order to make those communities more
attractive in their market.

Other Policies

We may, although we have no plans to do so, make acquisitions, investments and
engage in development activities outside of the strategies described above. In
connection with our joint venture investments, we may make loans to the joint
ventures as part of the financing package. We may also invest in the securities
of other issuers in connection with a proposed or contemplated acquisition. We
will not engage in trading, underwriting or agency distribution of securities of
other issues. We have in the past and may in the future, depending on market
conditions, repurchase our common stock. At all times, we will seek to operate
in a manner consistent with maintaining our REIT status.

2001 Property Acquisitions

During 2001, we purchased CWS Communities Trust ("CWS"), a private real estate
investment trust for $552 million. The portfolio consisted of 46 manufactured
home communities with approximately 16,600 homesites, approximately 1,500
expansion sites and three RV communities with 431 RV sites in 11 states. The
properties are concentrated in Florida, Georgia and Texas. In addition to CWS,
we also completed 3 acquisitions in Indiana, Georgia and Colorado for a total of
1,445 homesites and an aggregate purchase price of $43 million.

2001 Property Dispositions

In the third quarter of 2001, we began implementing a disposition plan and
started identifying a number of mature properties that no longer meet our
portfolio objectives. As of December 31, 2001, we had sold 7 properties for
approximately $42 million. The net proceeds from these sales, of approximately
$37 million were used primarily to pay down the Acquisition Facility. These
dispositions resulted in a net gain of $585,000.

<PAGE>

Sales Brokerage and Finance

We conduct our sales and brokerage activities through our taxable subsidiary,
Community Sales, Inc. ("CSI"). During 2001, CSI sold 684 new or pre-owned homes
and brokered sales of 1,221 homes. CSI also has a financial services division,
which arranges financing and insurance services for prospective residents and,
on a limited basis, provides financing to residents. During 2001, the financial
services division arranged financing on approximately 750 loans and provided
financing on approximately 40 loans, including a balance of approximately $1.8
million.

Competition

Many of the Properties are located in developed areas that include other
manufactured home communities. The number of competitive manufactured home
community properties in a particular area could have a material effect on our
ability to lease sites at our communities and the rents charged. In addition,
other forms of multi-family residential properties and single-family housing
provide housing alternatives to residents.

Employees

As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately 1,400 full and part-time
employees. We utilize a resident administrator for the on-site administration of
each of the Properties. Important duties of on-site administrators, as well as
the office manager, include extensive contact with residents through initial
introduction to community guidelines and on-going accessibility for resident
assistance. Typically, clerical and maintenance workers are employed to assist
in the management and care of residents and the properties. Direct supervision
of on-site administrators is the responsibility of our regional vice presidents
and managers and four divisional presidents. These individuals have significant
experience in addressing the needs of residents and are charged to find or
create innovative approaches to value maximization and increasing cash flow from
property operations. Approximately 90 corporate employees support on-site
administrators in all property management functions, as well as divisional and
regional property management staff.

Commitment to resident satisfaction is demonstrated by ongoing training that we
provide for all our employees. Community administrators meet periodically at
regional and divisional seminars to review Company philosophy and policy, to
discuss relevant administration issues and solutions, and to share ideas and
experiences.

Tax Status

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Section 856(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). We are generally not subject to
Federal income tax to the extent we distribute 90 percent of our REIT taxable
income to our shareholders. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and
operational requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year,
we will be subject to Federal income tax (including any applicable alternative
minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. As a REIT, we are
subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property and Federal
income and excise taxes to the extent of our undistributed income.

Item 2.           Properties
- -------           ----------

On December 31, 2001, we owned and operated 217 manufactured home communities
containing 70,723 homesites and 1,359 park model/RV sites, in 33 states, with
amenities designed for either retirement or family living. We also fee managed
38 manufactured home communities containing 8,118 sites in 14 states. In
addition, we owned land adjacent to certain existing communities containing
approximately 4,800 expansion sites, and greenfield developments with a
potential of approximately 4,900 future sites, which, although not yet
developed, are zoned for manufactured housing.

                                       6

<PAGE>

As of December 31, 2001, occupancy in our stabilized portfolio was 92.5 percent.
The active expansion portfolio had occupancy of 79.5 percent, while our
greenfield development portfolio had occupancy of 30.8 percent, for a total
occupancy of 88.3 percent. On a per-site basis, weighted monthly rental revenue
for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $331 compared with $316 for the same
period in 2000, an increase of 4.6 percent. Weighted average rent is calculated
as rental and utility income for the period, on a monthly basis, divided by the
weighted average occupied sites. Weighted average occupancy is computed by
averaging the number of revenue producing sites at the end of each month in the
period.

We believe that our properties provide amenities and common facilities that
create a safe and attractive community for residents. All of our properties
provide residents with appealing amenities with most offering a clubhouse, a
swimming pool and playgrounds. Many properties offer additional amenities such
as jacuzzis, indoor pools, libraries, shuffleboard, basketball, and tennis
courts, golf courses, day care facilities, exercise rooms, marinas and laundry
facilities.

Since residents own their homes, it is their responsibility to maintain their
homes and surrounding area. The communities have extensive guidelines for
maintenance. It is our role to maintain common areas, facilities and amenities
and to ensure that residents comply with community guidelines. We hold periodic
meetings of our property management team for training and implementation of our
strategies. In addition, the property administrators are expected to make a
daily inspection of their community. We believe that, due in part to this
strategy, the Properties historically have had and will continue to have low
turnover and high occupancy rates.

Leases

The typical lease entered into between the resident and one of our manufactured
home communities for the rental of a site is month-to-month or year-to-year,
renewable upon consent of both parties or, in some instances, as provided by
statute.

Property Information

We classify all our properties in either the stable, greenfield development, or
active expansion portfolio. The stable portfolio includes communities where we
do not have, or have not recently had, expansion of the community. These
communities normally have stable occupancy rates. The greenfield development
portfolio includes properties where we are developing the community. The active
expansion portfolio includes properties where we are currently, or have
recently, expanded the community by adding homesites to the available homesites
for rent. Generally, both the greenfield and the active expansion portfolios
will have a lower occupancy rate than the stable portfolio, as they are in the
lease-up phase. In addition, we own three park model/RV communities.

The following table sets forth certain information, as of December 31, 2001,
regarding our properties, excluding the three park model/RV communities. A park
model/RV community is a community where the majority of the sites are leased on
an annual basis, although the resident only occupies the home for a portion of
the year. A minority of the sites are rented with recreational vehicles on a
daily, weekly or monthly basis. This table excludes four of our greenfield
properties as there are currently no developed sites.

Our policy is generally to add expansion sites to the extent that market
conditions warrant. The cost of each site expansion varies depending on location
and market conditions and generally range from $15,000 to $18,000 per site. We
expect to fund the cost of our new site expansions for these properties out of
our cash generated from operations, or borrowing from our line of credit.

dividend income. Distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will
be treated as a non-taxable reduction of the shareholder's basis in the common
stock to the extent thereof, with the remainder as taxable gain.

At March 15, 2002 there were approximately 600 holders of record and
approximately 12,500 beneficial owners of our common stock.

     to gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of property and
     rental property depreciation and amortization. Management believes that FFO
     is an important and widely used measure of the operating performance of
     REITs, which provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. FFO (i)
     does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally
     accepted accounting principles; (ii) should not be considered as an
     alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash
     flows from operating, investing and financing activities; (iii) is not an
     alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity; and (iv) may not be
     comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. FFO is
     calculated as follows:

NAREIT has revised its definition of FFO. We adopted the new definition
effective January 1, 2000. The new definition of FFO substantially eliminates
the add-back of non-recurring items in the calculation of FFO. The application
of this new definition decreased FFO in 1998 by $375,000, and had no effect on
any other years reported.

Item 7.   Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
- ------    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
          of Operations
          -------------

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Certain statements in this discussion constitute "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Such forward-looking statements may involve our plans, objectives and
expectations, which are dependent upon a number of factors, including site
expansions, development, acquisitions, dispositions and other new business
initiatives which are all subject to a number of contingency factors such as the
effects of national and local economic conditions, changes in interest rates,
supply and demand for affordable housing and the condition of the capital
markets that may prevent us from achieving our objectives.

Overview

We added 19,622 manufactured home sites to our portfolio over the three-year
period ended December 31, 2001. This includes acquisitions and dispositions of
manufactured home communities, as well as our development activity. At the end
of this period, our portfolio comprised 217 manufactured home communities
containing 70,723 manufactured homesites and 1,359 park model/RV sites, located
in 33 states.

We also provide property management and advisory services to N'Tandem Trust
("N'Tandem"). N'Tandem owns 36 communities with an aggregate of 7,882 homesites.
We own approximately ten percent of N'Tandem's outstanding equity and have made
loans and advances to N'Tandem.

We conduct substantially all of our activities through CP Limited Partnership
(the "Operating Partnership") in which we owned a combined 83 percent general
partner interest as of December 31, 2001. In addition, effective January 1,
2001, we consolidated six development joint ventures that we control. The
effects of consolidation were not material to our financial position or results
of our operations.

We also conduct manufactured home sales and brokerage activities through our
taxable subsidiary Community Sales, Inc. ("CSI").

Company growth since the beginning of 1999 can be attributed to community
acquisitions, increased operating performance at existing communities, community
expansions, and new community development, offset somewhat by property
dispositions. On August 1, 2001, we purchased CWS Communities Trust ("CWS"), a
private real estate investment trust for approximately $552 million. The
portfolio consisted of 46 manufactured home communities with approximately
16,600 homesites and approximately 1,500 expansion sites and three RV
communities with 431 RV sites in 11 states. This transaction extended our
leading position in the manufactured housing community sector, making us
substantially larger than our next largest REIT competitor in that sector.

Since our organization, we have elected to qualify as a REIT under the Internal
Revenue Code and thus do not generally pay Federal corporate income taxes on
earnings to the extent that such earnings are distributed to shareholders in
accordance with REIT requirements.

 Historical Results of Operations

Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2001 to the year ended December 31,
2000

The following table summarizes certain information relative to our properties,
as of and for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. We consider all
communities owned by us at both January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001, as the
"Core 2000 Portfolio".

</TABLE>


For the year ended December 31, 2001, income before minority interests was
$36,118,000, a decrease of $12,604,000 from the year ended December 31, 2000.
The decrease was due primarily to increased depreciation due to the acquisition
of CWS. Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $224,431,000, an
increase of $37,468,000 from 2000. Approximately 81 percent of the increase was
due to acquisitions, net of dispositions, and 19 percent was due to rental
increases in our Core 2000 Portfolio.

As of December 31, 2001, occupancy in our stabilized portfolio, was 92.5
percent. The active expansion portfolio had occupancy of 79.5 percent, while our
greenfield development portfolio had occupancy of 30.8 percent, for a total
occupancy of 88.3 percent. On a per-site basis, weighted monthly rental revenue
for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $331 compared with $316 for the same
period in 2000, an increase of 4.6 percent.

Management fee and other income primarily include management fee and transaction
fee income for the management of 38 manufactured home communities and equity
earnings from CSI.

Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2001
increased by $18,360,000 or 35.0 percent from the prior year. The majority of
the increase was due to the acquisition of CWS, along with increased bad debt
and collection costs of approximately $5,300,000 and operating expense increases
in our Core 2000 Portfolio. The increase in bad debt expense was due to economic
conditions as well as the implementation of our enterprise-wide technology
solution. In many of our market areas the economic conditions have created a
more difficult than normal collections environment, which has significantly
impacted the cost of collections, as well the overall ability to collect past
due amounts. In addition, difficulties encountered related to the implementation
and utilization of our enterprise-wide technology solution, which was initiated
in the last quarter of 2000, was also a factor in the unusually high expense
recognized in 2001.

The majority of problems were isolated to less than 10 percent of our
communities, and we are working diligently to bring the collections performance
of these locations in line with the rest of the portfolio. Although we believe
that these issues have been substantially resolved, we will continue to monitor
the collections performance of each community as well as to improve operational
processes to ensure timely billing and collection of delinquent accounts.

Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased by $2,276,000
or 17.0 percent from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase is due
primarily to acquisitions, expansion of communities, and increases in property
tax rates. On a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate taxes were
$24.10 in 2001 compared to $23.57 in 2000. Real estate taxes may increase or
decrease due to inflation, expansion and improvement of communities, as well as
changes in taxation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.

Administrative expense in 2001 was 4.1 percent of total revenues as compared to
4.8 percent in 2000.

Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December
31, 2001 by $11,218,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2000. The
increase is attributed primarily to the indebtedness incurred to finance
acquisitions and lending activities. Interest expense as a percentage of average
debt outstanding decreased to approximately 6.8 percent in 2001 from 7.3 percent
in 2000, due to lower interest rates, and greater amounts of variable rate debt.

Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $13,999,000
from the same period a year ago. The increase is directly attributed to
acquisitions, expansions, and additions of rental property. Depreciation expense
as a percentage of average depreciable rental property in 2001 remained
relatively unchanged from 2000.

Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2000 to the year ended December 31,
1999

The following table summarizes certain information relative to our properties,
as of and for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999. We consider all
communities owned by us at both January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2000 as the
"Core 1999 Portfolio".

For the year ended December 31, 2000, income before minority interests was
$48,722,000, an increase of $3,760,000 from the year ended December 31, 1999.
The increase was due primarily to increased net operating income from the Core
1999 Portfolio and acquisitions. The increase in net operating income from our
Core 1999 Portfolio was due to increased occupancy and rental increases
partially offset by general operating expense increases. Rental revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2000 was $186,963,000, an increase of $9,174,000 from
1999. Approximately 17 percent of the increase was due to acquisitions, net of
dispositions, and 83 percent was due to rental increases and occupancy gains in
our Core 1999 Portfolio.

Weighted average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 2000 was 47,466 sites
compared with 47,181 sites for the same period in 1999. The occupancy rate for
the total portfolio was 91.1 percent on 52,347 sites as of December 31, 2000,
compared to 91.7 percent on 51,659 sites as of December 31, 1999. The occupancy
rate on the stabilized portfolio (communities where we do not have or have not
recently had, expansion of the community) was 94.7 percent as of December 31,
2000. We also added 275 available sites to our portfolio through expansion of
our communities. On a per-site basis, weighted monthly rental revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2000 was $316 compared with $302 for the same period in
1999.

Management fee and other income primarily includes management fee and
transaction fee income for the management of 44 manufactured home communities
and equity earnings from CSI.

                                       20

<PAGE>

Included in interest income and management fee and other income is approximately
$3.2 million of interest and related fees, from N'Tandem.

Property operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2000
increased by $1,913,000 or 3.8 percent from the prior year. The majority of the
increase was due to operating expense increases in our Core 1999 Portfolio, and
to a lesser extent, acquisitions. On a per site basis, monthly weighted average
property operating and maintenance expense increased to $91.03 per site, or 2.0
percent.

Real estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased by $751,000 or
5.9 percent from the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase is due primarily
to acquisitions, expansions of communities, and increases in property tax rates.
On a per site basis, monthly weighted average real estate taxes were $23.57 in
2000 compared to $22.39 in 1999, an increase of 5.3 percent. Real estate taxes
may increase or decrease due to inflation, expansions and improvements of
communities, as well as changes in taxation in the tax jurisdictions in which we
operate.

Administrative expense in 2000 was 4.8 percent of total revenues as compared to
5.2 percent in 1999.

Interest and related amortization costs increased for the year ended December
31, 2000 by $4,082,000, as compared with the year ended December 31, 1999. The
increase is attributed primarily to the indebtedness incurred to finance
acquisitions and lending activities. Interest expense as a percentage of average
debt outstanding decreased to approximately 7.3 percent in 2000 from 7.4 percent
in 1999.

Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $2,094,000
from the same period a year ago. The increase is directly attributed to
acquisitions, expansions, and additions. Depreciation expense as a percentage of
average depreciable rental property in 2000 remained relatively unchanged from
1999.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash provided by operating activities was $88.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001, compared to $85.0 million for the same period in 2000. The
increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to increases
in net operating income, offset by the changes in operating assets and
liabilities.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was
$371.1 million. In 2001, we purchased CWS Communities Trust ("CWS"), a private
real estate investment trust for a net amount of approximately $320 million and
three additional communities for $22.2 million in cash. We also sold seven
properties and received net proceeds of $36.7 million in the latter part of
2001. Total investments in development, expansion, and property and equipment
were $40.9 million in 2001 and we advanced $12.1 million on our notes
receivables.

On August 3, 2001 we purchased CWS for $552 million, consisting of $323 million
borrowed under a bridge facility, $151 million in assumed liabilities, 2,040,878
OP Units (valued for purposes of the transaction at $30.935 per OP Unit) and
$9.9 million in 7.5% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2012 (the "August 2012 Notes").
The portfolio consisted of 46 manufactured home communities with approximately
16,600 homesites and approximately 1,500 expansion sites and three RV
communities with 431 RV sites in 11 states. We financed the cash portion of this
transaction primarily through borrowings of a $323 million bridge facility (the
"Acquisition Facility"), which carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus 150 basis
points, and matures August 2, 2002. In connection with this transaction, we
agreed to issue in a private placement to the holders of the August 2012 Notes,
an aggregate of 309,371 OP Units at $30.935 per OP Unit, in exchange for the
issuance by such holders of 7.5% notes, due August 2010, subject to extension in
certain events. These notes are collateralized by the related OP Units. We also
acquired three other communities in 2001 for approximately $10 million in OP
units and approximately $22 million in cash, which were financed primarily by
borrowings under our lines of credit.

                                       21

<PAGE>

During 2001, we invested approximately $26 million in the expansion and
development of our communities; resulting in the addition of approximately 350
available sites to our portfolio in 2002, and including finish costs on sites
added previously and substantial progress on sites that will be added to our
portfolio in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2001, recurring property
capital expenditures, other than development costs, were approximately $7.2
million. Capital expenditures have historically been financed out of operating
cash flow and it is our intention that such future expenditures will also be
financed out of operating cash flow. In addition, during 2001, we advanced $12
million to non-affiliated entities that own or are developing manufactured home
communities.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001
was $282.1 million. This consisted primarily of the issuance of $150 million of
debt and net borrowings under our Credit Facilities and the Acquisition Facility
of $213.1 million. These were offset partially by $72.7 million in dividends and
distributions paid to shareholders and OP Unitholders.

On October 23, 2001, we issued $150 million of 7.125% Senior Unsecured Notes,
due 2011 in a private placement. Net proceeds of $148.3 million were used to
repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the Acquisition Facility.
In connection with the private placement, we entered into a hedge of forecasted
interest payments. We recorded a hedge loss of approximately $7.1 million in
other comprehensive income and will amortize this into interest expense over the
life of the debt.

In October 2001, we extended $50 million of our $70 million 7.54% senior
unsecured notes scheduled to mature in November 2003 to October 2021 at 8.3%.

In addition to the Acquisition Facility, we have a $125 million line of credit
arrangement with BankOne, NA acting as lead agent for a bank group to provide
financing for future construction, acquisitions and general business obligations
(the "BankOne Credit Facility"). The line of credit is unsecured, bears interest
at the prime rate of interest or, at our option, LIBOR plus 90 basis points. The
line is scheduled to mature in 2004. In addition, we have a $7.5 million
unsecured line of credit from US Bank, which bears interest at a rate of LIBOR
plus 125 basis points and matures in March 2002, which is under discussion for
an extension, (the "US Bank Facility" and, together with the BankOne Credit
Facility the "Credit Facilities"). As of December 31, 2001, approximately $125.1
million was outstanding under our Credit Facilities and we had $7.4 million
available in additional borrowing capacity.

As of December 31, 2001, we had outstanding, in addition to the Credit
Facilities, $470.0 million of unsecured senior debt with a weighted average
interest rate and remaining maturity of 7.5 percent and 6.9 years, respectively,
$285.6 million of secured mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate
and remaining maturity of 7.6 percent and 7.5 years, respectively, and $163
million on our Acquisition Facility with an interest rate of 3.6 percent. As of
December 31, 2001, we had approximately $1.1 billion of total debt outstanding,
representing approximately 48.4 percent of our total market capitalization. All
of the debt is fixed rate debt, other than our Credit Facilities and Acquisition
Facility. The fixed rate debt carries a weighted average interest rate of 7.5
percent.

In the third quarter of 2001, we began implementing a disposition plan,
identifying a number of properties that do not fit strategically with our
overall investment portfolio, due to location, proximity to other properties,
alternative investment opportunities or other factors. As of December 31, 2001,
we had sold seven properties for approximately $42 million. The net proceeds
from these sales, of approximately $37 million were used primarily to pay down
the Acquisition Facility. Due to the timing of these sales, approximately $11
million was received in January of 2002. Since December 31, 2001, we have sold
an additional three properties for approximately $6.2 million. The net proceeds
were used to pay down the Acquisition Facility. As of March 15, 2002, we had
$145.8 million outstanding under the Acquisition Facility and $22.4 million
available under our Credit Facilities. We will continue to evaluate our
properties and, depending on market conditions, expect to sell additional
communities in 2002.

                                       22

<PAGE>

We expect to re-pay the balance of the Acquisition Facility, which matures in
August of 2002, depending on current market conditions and capital availability
factors, with proceeds from the disposition of properties, and the issuance of
additional debt or equity securities.

Our principal long term liquidity needs include: repayment of long-term
borrowings and amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities and the
Acquisition Facility, future acquisitions of communities and land for
development, and new and existing community development activities. We do not
expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to finance these long-term
liquidity needs and instead intend to meet our long-term liquidity requirements
through additional borrowing under the Credit Facilities or other lines of
credit, the assumption of existing secured or unsecured indebtedness and,
depending on market conditions and capital availability factors, the issuance of
additional equity or debt securities.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including expansion
activities and capital expenditure requirements, through cash flow from
operations and, if necessary, and depending on our operating performance,
borrowings under the Credit Facilities and other lines of credit.

The following is a summary of our aggregate commitments, in millions, as of
December 31, 2001:

</TABLE>

     (1)   These guarantees expire at various times.

The financing arrangements contain customary covenants, including a debt service
coverage ratio and a restriction on the incurrence of additional collateralized
indebtedness without a corresponding increase in rental property. We were out of
compliance on one of our covenants as of December 31, 2001 associated with both
our BankOne Credit Facility and the Acquisition Facility. Also, in February
2002, we were out of compliance on another of our covenants under both
agreements that limit the amount of variable rate debt outstanding. In February
2002, we received waivers from the lenders and amended the agreements to change
the covenant for the remaining term of the Acquisition Facility and until March
2003 for the Credit Facility.

In March 2002, Moody's Investor Service lowered our debt rating to Baa3 from
Baa2. The reason for the change was due to a weaker capital structure and
coverage ratios since completing the CWS acquisition. Standard and Poors has not
changed its rating of BBB. In the event that our debt rating is lowered again,
it may have an impact on the cost of our debt.

We currently own approximately 10 percent of N'Tandem's outstanding stock and
account for our investment utilizing the equity method of accounting. We also
recognize income from a property management agreement, an advisory agreement,
overhead reimbursements and interest income on advances as earned. The amount of
fee income and interest income earned is outlined in the table below.

Interest is earned on the loan to N'Tandem (Prime plus one percent, or 5.75
percent at December 31, 2001) and includes fees paid by N'Tandem for the
subordination of our loan to the N'Tandem bank debt ($730,000 in both 2001 and
2000). The transaction fees are related to acquisition services provided by us
to N'Tandem and are calculated as three percent of the acquisition price. The
advisory fees are charged based on one percent of N'Tandem's average assets. The
management fees are charged based on five percent of revenues of properties
managed by us on behalf of N'Tandem. Overhead reimbursement fees are based on a
fixed fee per site. We expect to receive modest increases on the recurring fees
due to increases in expected revenues and sites. However, as the non-recurring
fees are subject to the completion of a transaction, these are difficult to
predict.

N'Tandem currently has net losses of approximately $8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001 and also has experienced negative cash flows from operations.
We serve as a guarantor on N'Tandem's $20 million line of credit. We do not have
any agreements to fund future operating losses of N'Tandem, however our ability
to recover our fees charged to N'Tandem and our loans and advances to N'Tandem
is dependent on the ultimate sale of the N'Tandem properties. N'Tandem will
likely continue to generate negative cash flow from operations in the near term.
We believe that based on current market conditions the loans and advances to
N'Tandem, which totaled approximately $33 million at December 31, 2001, will be
recovered from the ultimate sale of the properties.

The following table summarizes certain financial information for N'Tandem for
the years ending December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, which requires us to make certain estimates and
assumptions. A summary of our significant accounting policies is provided in
Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following section is a
summary of certain aspects of those accounting policies that both require our
most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the
portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that
there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in
making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being
reported on our consolidated financial statements.

     .    When we acquire real estate properties, we allocate the components of
          these acquisitions using relative fair values computed using our
          estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions impact the
          amount of costs allocated between land and different categories of
          land improvements as well as the amount of costs assigned to
          individual properties in multiple property acquisitions. These
          allocations also impact depreciation expense and gains or losses
          recorded on future sales of properties.

     .    We recognize an impairment loss on a real estate asset to be held and
          used in operations if the asset's undiscounted expected future cash
          flows are less than its depreciated cost. We compute a real estate
          assets undiscounted expected future cash flow using certain estimates
          and assumptions.

     .    We use two different accounting methods to report our investments in
          entities: the consolidation method and the equity method. We use the
          consolidation method when we own most of the outstanding voting
          interests in an entity and/or can control its operations. We use the
          equity method of accounting when we own an interest in an entity and
          can exert significant influence over the entity's operations but
          cannot control the entity's operations. We review these investments
          regularly for possible impairment using certain estimates and
          assumptions regarding undiscounted expected future cash flows. We also
          review these investments regularly for proper accounting treatment.
          However, a key factor in this review, the determination of whether or
          not we can control or exert significant influence over an entity's
          operations, is subjective in nature.

     .    We report receivables net of an allowance for receivables that may be
          uncollectible in the future. We review our receivables regularly for
          potential collection problems in computing the allowance recorded
          against our receivables; this review process requires we make certain
          judgments regarding collections that are inherently difficult to
          predict.

     .    Collectibility of advances to N'Tandem and other Notes Receivable is
          based on the determination of the fair market value of the properties
          and the related net proceeds from the ultimate liquidation of the
          properties.

Inflation

All of the leases or terms of tenants' occupancies at the communities allow for
at least annual rental adjustments. In addition, all leases are short-term
(generally one year or less) and enable us to seek market rentals upon reletting
the sites. Such leases generally minimize the risk to us of any adverse effect
of inflation.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires all business
combinations to be accounted for by the purchase method and defines criteria
under which intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination
be recognized as assets apart from goodwill. SFAS No. 141 is effective for all
fiscal business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 changes
the useful life of goodwill recorded on a company's books from 40 years to
indefinite and requires goodwill to be reviewed annually for impairment. SFAS
No. 142 is effective for all fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.
Adoption of SFAS No. 141 and No. 142 did not have and is not expected to have a
significant impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment on
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and provides
guidance for measuring the amount of impairment. SFAS No. 144 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. As individual properties to be
sold qualify as components of an entity, properties classified as held for sale
or sold in a reporting period will be treated as discontinued operations for
reporting purposes. The statement of income will reflect the properties' results
of operations, including any gains or losses recognized, as a separate component
in the income statement.

Other

Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association of Real
Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as consolidated net income without giving
effect to gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of property and
rental property depreciation and amortization. Management believes that FFO is
an important and widely used measure of the operating performance of REITs,
which provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. FFO (i) does not
represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting
principles; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a
measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and
financing activities; (iii) is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of
liquidity; and (iv) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported
by other companies. FFO is calculated as follows:

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
- -------   ----------------------------------------------------------

Our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. Management has and will
continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a conservative ratio of
fixed-rate, long-term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is
kept at an acceptable level and (2) taking advantage of favorable market
conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. As of December 31, 2001, our Credit
and Acquisition Facilities represented our only variable rate debt.

</TABLE>

We face market risk relating to our fixed-rate debt upon re-financing of such
debt and depending upon prevailing interest rates at the time of such
re-finance. As a result of our successful re-financing and extension of our
fixed-rate debt, as illustrated in the above chart, we will not need to
re-finance any of our fixed-rate debt until 2003. Our Acquisition Facility
matures in August of 2002. We expect to re-pay the balance, depending on current
market conditions and capital availability factors, with proceeds from the
disposition of properties, a bank term loan, or the issuance of additional debt
or equity securities.

In addition, we have assessed the market risk for our variable rate debt and
believe that a 1% increase in LIBOR rates would result in an approximate $2.9
million increase in interest expense based on $287.8 million of variable rate
debt outstanding at December 31, 2001.

The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows
at interest rates that management believes reflect the risks associated with
long term debt of similar risk and duration.

                        Report of Independent Accountants

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Chateau Communities, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 14(a)(1) and (2) present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Chateau Communities, Inc. (the "Company") at December
31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
three years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and the
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

                   Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   Organization and Formation of Company:
     -------------------------------------

Chateau Communities, Inc. (the "Company"), a real estate investment trust, was
formed in August 1993 as Chateau Properties, Inc.

The Company considers itself to be engaged in only one industry segment. The
Company is engaged in the business of owning and operating manufactured housing
community properties primarily through CP Limited Partnership (the "Operating
Partnership"). As of December 31, 2001, the Company owned 217 properties
containing an aggregate of 70,723 homesites and 1,359 park model/RV sites,
located in 33 states. Approximately 28 percent of these homesites were in
Florida, 24 percent were in Michigan, and 10 percent were in Georgia. The
Company also fee managed 38 properties containing an aggregate of 8,118
homesites. A manufactured housing community is real estate designed and improved
with sites for placement of manufactured homes. The owner of the home leases the
site from the Company, generally for a term of one year or less.

2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
     ------------------------------------------

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the
Company, its wholly owned qualified REIT subsidiaries, its Operating
Partnership, and controlled joint ventures. The Company and ROC Communities,
Inc. are general partners of the Operating Partnership. All significant
inter-entity balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Investments in joint ventures or entities, which we do not control but exercise
significant influence over, are accounted for using the equity method.

The Company conducts manufactured home sales and brokerage activities through
its taxable service corporation, Community Sales, Inc. ("CSI"). The Company owns
100% of the preferred stock of CSI and is entitled to 100% of its cash flow and
economics. The Company accounts for its investment in CSI utilizing the equity
method of accounting, since the Company does not own any of the voting common
stock of CSI. Equity earnings or losses are recorded as management fee and other
income in the accompanying statements of income.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions. These estimates may affect the reported amount of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year information to
conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications have no impact
on net operating results previously reported.

Revenue Recognition

Rental income is recognized when earned and due from residents. The leases
entered into by residents for the rental of a site are generally for terms not
longer than one year and are renewable upon the consent of both parties or, in
some instances, as provided by statute. Rent received in advance is deferred and
recognized in income when earned.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Income Taxes

The Company has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (REIT)
under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The
Company generally will not be subject to Federal income tax to the extent it
distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its shareholders. REITs
are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements. If the
Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be
subject to Federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax)
on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. The Company remains subject to
certain state and local taxes on its income and property as well as Federal
income and excise taxes on its undistributed income.

For income tax purposes, distributions paid to common shareholders consist of
ordinary income, capital gains, return of capital or a combination thereof. For
the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, distributions declared per
share were taxable as follows:

                    ==================== =====================  ====================
</TABLE>


Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share are computed based upon the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. The conversion of an operating
partnership unit ("OP Unit") to common stock has no effect on earnings per
common share since the earnings of an OP Unit are equivalent to the earnings of
a share of common stock. Diluted earnings per common share are computed assuming
the exercise of all outstanding stock options that would have a dilutive effect.

Rental Property

Rental property is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Management
evaluates the recoverability of its investment in rental property whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that full asset recoverability is
questionable. Management's assessment of the recoverability of its rental
property includes, but is not limited to, recent operating results, expected net
operating cash flow and management's plans for future operations. In the event
that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of rental
property may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If
an evaluation were required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows
associated with the asset would be compared to the asset's carrying amount to
determine if a write down is required. If this review indicates that the assets
will not be recoverable, the carrying value of the Company's assets would be
reduced to their estimated market value.

Rental Property Held for Sale

Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of book value or fair value less
costs to sell the assets. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company
identified four communities for disposition and as such, reclassified these
assets from rental property to rental property held for sale. As a result, the
Company evaluated its carrying value of these assets, and recognized an asset
impairment charge of approximately $2.1 million. These charges have been
included in the Company's accompanying consolidated statements of income.

              Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Depreciation

Depreciation on manufactured home communities is computed primarily on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The
estimated useful lives of the various classes of rental property assets are
primarily as follows:

                                                             Estimated Useful
Class of Asset                                                 Lives (Years)
- --------------                                              --------------------
Manufactured home community improvements                         20 to 30
Community buildings                                              25 to 30
Furniture and other equipment                                     3 to 10
Computer software and hardware                                    3 to 7

Maintenance, repairs, and minor improvements to rental properties are expensed
when incurred. Major improvements and renewals are capitalized and depreciated
over their estimated useful lives. When rental property assets are sold or
otherwise retired, the cost of such assets, net of accumulated depreciation,
compared to the sales proceeds, are recognized in income as gains or losses on
disposition.

Capitalized Interest

Interest is capitalized on development projects during periods of construction
through the substantial completion of the site. Interest capitalized by the
Company for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, was $4,368,000,
$1,646,000, and $1,249,000, respectively.

Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less
are considered to be cash equivalents.

Debt Issuance Costs

Costs incurred to obtain financing are deferred and amortized on a straight-line
basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the
related loans or agreements. These costs, net of accumulated amortization, are
included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair value of the Company's financial instruments other than debt
approximate their carrying values at December 31, 2001 and 2000. The fair value
of the Company's debt at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was estimated to be $1.1
billion and $533 million, respectively, based on current interest rates for
comparable loans.

                            Chateau Communities, Inc

              Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Minority Interests

Minority interests include common OP Units that are convertible into an
equivalent number of shares of the Company's common stock. Issuance of
additional shares of common stock by the Company, results in the issuance to the
Company of an equal amount of OP Units, thus changing the percentage ownership
of both the minority interests and the Company. Since an OP Unit is equivalent
to a common share (due to, among other things, its exchangeability for a common
stock share), such transactions are treated as capital transactions and result
in an equity transfer adjustment among shareholders' equity and minority
interests in the Company's consolidated balance sheet to account for the change
in the respective ownership in the underlying equity of the Operating
Partnership.

Income before minority interests is ascribed to the holders of common OP Units
based on their respective weighted average ownership percentage of the Operating
Partnership. The ownership percentage is determined by dividing the number of
common OP Units held by the limited partners by the total common OP Units
outstanding, including the OP Units held by the Company.

Also included in minority interests is approximately $73 million, which
represents 1.5 million 8.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units
("Preferred Units"). The Preferred Units are exchangeable on or after April 20,
2008 for authorized but unissued shares of 8.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock of the Company.

Derivatives

The Company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and for
Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS No. 138, on January 1, 2001. SFAS No.
133 provides comprehensive guidelines for the recognition and measurement of
derivatives and hedging activities and, specifically, requires all derivatives
to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with
an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. Upon adoption of
SFAS No. 138, the Company recorded a transition adjustment of $658,000 as a
cumulative effect to accumulated other comprehensive income, which is included
in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cumulative effect
adjustment relates to net deferred gains on prior hedges of anticipated
refinancing of debt which had been completed at the date of adoption. The amount
in the accumulated other comprehensive income account will be amortized over the
remaining life of the related debt instruments.

In assessing the fair value of its financial instruments, both derivative and
non-derivative, CP Limited uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are
based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date.
Primarily, CP Limited uses quoted market prices or quotes from brokers or
dealers for the same or similar instruments. These values represent a general
approximation of possible value and may never actually be realized.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income is defined as all changes in shareholders' equity,
exclusive of transactions with owners, such as capital investments.
Comprehensive income includes net income and changes in certain assets and
liabilities that are reported directly in equity such as changes in the fair
value of derivatives.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires all business
combinations to be accounted for by the purchase method and defines criteria
under which intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination
be recognized as assets apart from goodwill. SFAS No. 141 is effective for all
fiscal business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 changes
the useful life of goodwill recorded on a company's books to an indefinite life
and requires goodwill to be reviewed annually for impairment. SFAS No. 142 is
effective for all fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Adoption of
SFAS No. 141 and No. 142 did not have and is not expected to have a significant
impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment on
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and provides
guidance for measuring the amount of impairment. SFAS No. 144 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. As individual properties to be
sold qualify as components of an entity, properties classified as held for sale
or sold in a reporting period will be treated as discontinued operations for
reporting purposes. The statements of income will reflect the properties'
results of operations, including any gains or losses recognized, as a separate
component in the income statement.

3.   Acquisitions and Dispositions of Rental Property:
     -------------------------------------------------

Acquisition of CWS

On August 3, 2001 the Company purchased CWS Communities Trust ("CWS"), a private
real estate investment trust for $552 million, consisting of $323 million in
cash (including the payoff of $20 million in debt), $151 million in assumed
liabilities, 2,040,878 OP Units (valued for purposes of the transaction at
$30.935 per OP Unit) and $9.9 million in 7.5% Unsecured Installment Notes due
2012 (the "7.5% Notes"). The portfolio consisted of 46 manufactured home
communities with approximately 16,600 homesites and 1,518 expansion sites and
three RV communities with 431 RV sites in 11 states. The Company financed the
cash portion of this transaction primarily through borrowings on a $323 million
bridge facility (the "Acquisition Facility"), which carries an interest rate of
LIBOR plus 120 basis points, and matures August 2, 2002.

In connection with the CWS acquisition, the following related transactions
occurred:

 .    As of August 2, 2001, certain limited partners in the CWS operating
     partnership ("CWS OP") amended their $26 million loans and agreed to, among
     other things, replace the collateral with a proportionate amount of OP
     Units, provide for an initial purchase price for such OP Units subject to
     our repurchase option at $27.17 per OP Units, eliminate our right to
     exercise this repurchase option in the event of a prepayment of these loans
     in full prior to January 1, 2003 and lower the exercise price of this
     repurchase option in the event that certain distributions are made to the
     borrowers. The maturity dates of these loans range between June 14, 2009
     and September 26, 2010. These loans bear initial interest rates of 6.25% or
     6.5%, increasing at increments of 25 basis points on each anniversary of
     each loan, but not to exceed 7.5%, and are included in Investment in and
     advances to affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as
     of December 31, 2001.

 .    The Company agreed to issue to the holders of the 7.5% Notes, an aggregate
     of 309,371 OP Units, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $9.6
     million paid to the Company through the issuance of 7.5% promissory notes
     due 2010 secured by the OP Units held by the obligor. As of December 31,
     2001, the Company has issued $9,570,000 of such notes/OP Units and the
     notes are included in Investment in and advances to affiliates in the
     accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2001.

The total CWS purchase price and liabilities assumed was allocated as follows:

           Rental property                             $         519,691
           Net working capital                                    32,299

                                                       =================


The following unaudited pro forma income statement information has been prepared
as if the CWS Acquisition and related transactions had occurred on January 1,

Dispositions

In the third quarter of 2001, the Company began implementing a plan to sell a
number of mature properties that no longer meets its portfolio objectives. As of
December 31, 2001, the Company had sold 7 properties for approximately $42
million. The net proceeds from these sales, approximately $37 million, were used
primarily to pay down the Acquisition Facility. Due to the timing of these
sales, approximately $11 million was received in January of 2002. The Company
will continue to evaluate its properties and, depending on market conditions,
expects to sell additional communities in 2002. In 1999, the Company disposed of
two communities, with 509 homesites, for a net amount of $11.7 million,
resulting in a gain of $2.8 million.

4.   Notes Receivable
     ----------------

Notes receivable are from entities that are not affiliated with the Company and
all own, or are developing, manufactured home communities. These notes are
collateralized by manufactured home communities or by partnership interests in
partnerships that own manufactured home communities. These notes have a weighted
average interest rate of 10.9% and mature between 2002 and 2022. Management has
evaluated the collectibility of these notes and has determined that no valuation
allowance is necessary.

N'Tandem
- --------

The Company currently owns approximately 10 percent of N'Tandem's outstanding
equity, wholly owns N'Tandem's external advisor and provides management and
other services to N'Tandem for a fee. As such, the Company possesses significant
influence over the operating and financial decisions of N'Tandem, and
accordingly, accounts for its investment in N'Tandem utilizing the equity method
of accounting. The Company also recognizes income from a property management
agreement, an advisory agreement and interest income on advances as earned, as
more fully outlined in Note 12.

The Company has loaned N'Tandem approximately $27 million and advanced an
additional $6 million over the past several years. The loan is due December
2002, is unsecured and bears interest at the prime rate of interest plus one
percent per annum.

As of December 31, 2001, N'Tandem owned 36 communities with 7,882 homesites.

- ---------------------------------

These notes are loans to former CWS shareholders of $26 million (the "$26
Million Notes") and promissory notes of $9.6 million (the "$9.6 Million Notes")
(see note 3). The collateral for the loans are the OP Units held by the former
CWS shareholders. The loan agreements provide for principal payment of the loans
through the use of the collateral or cash. Interest on the $26 Million Notes are
payable quarterly at an annual rate of 6%, increasing by one-quarter of one
percent on each anniversary date of the loan agreement up to a maximum of 8.25%
and 7.5% on the $9.6 Million Notes. The Company earned $793,000 of interest
income for these notes in 2001.

The Company has $100 million 6.92% MandatOry Par Put Remarketed Securities(SM)
("MOPPRS(SM)") due December 10, 2014. The remarketing dealer paid The Company $2
million for the right to remarket the securities in 2004. The remarketing fee is
being amortized over the life of the related debt. Upon the remarketing dealer's
election to remarket the MOPPRS(SM), the interest rate to the December 10, 2014
maturity date of the MOPPRS(SM) will be adjusted to equal the sum of 5.75% plus
the Applicable Spread (as defined in the remarketing agreement). In the event
the remarketing dealer does not elect to remarket the MOPPRS(SM), the MOPPRS(SM)
will mature in 2004.

As of December 31, 2001 the Company has a total of 36 collateralized properties.

The financing arrangements contain customary covenants, including a debt service
coverage ratio and a restriction on the incurrence of additional collateralized
or variable rate indebtedness without a corresponding increase in rental
property. The Company was out of compliance on one of its covenants as of
December 31, 2001 associated with both its BankOne Credit Facility and the
Acquisition Facility. Also, in February 2002, the Company was out of compliance
on another covenant under both agreements that limit the amount of variable rate
debt outstanding. In February 2002, the Company received waivers from the
lenders and amended the agreements to change the covenants for the remaining
term of the Acquisition facility and until March 2003 for the Credit Facility.

The Acquisition Facility matures in August of 2002. The Company expects to
re-pay the balance, depending on current market conditions and capital
availability factors, with proceeds from the disposition of properties, a bank
term loan, or the issuance of additional debt or equity securities.

The aggregate amount of principal maturities for the fixed rate debt, including
the Unsecured Senior Notes and Unsecured Installment Notes, subsequent to
December 31, 2001 (in thousands) is as follows:

7. Minority Interests in Operating Partnership:
   --------------------------------------------

Minority interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets represent
both the common and preferred ownership interest in the Operating Partnership
held by third parties. The common minority interest represents common OP Units,
which are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of the Company's
common stock. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, common minority interest was
approximately 17 and 11 percent, respectively.

Common OP Unitholders may convert their common OP Units into shares of common

9. Comprehensive Income:
   ---------------------

In August 2001, the Company entered into a forward interest rate swap agreement
to hedge the anticipated issuance of $150 million of senior notes, which were
issued pursuant to a debt issuance in October 2001. The purpose of the swap was
to hedge future interest rate payments on the fixed rate bonds to be issued.
This swap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge, in accordance with SFAS No.
133. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the Company recorded a loss on the swap of
approximately $7.1 million as of the date of the debt issuance in other
comprehensive income, which is included in the equity section of the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under SFAS No. 133, the Company began amortizing the
amounts in other comprehensive income related to this hedge once the debt was
issued.

11.  Savings Plan:
     -------------

The Company has a qualified retirement plan designed to qualify under Section
401 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Savings Plan"). The Savings Plan allows
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to defer a portion of their
compensation on a pre-tax basis subject to certain maximum amounts.
Contributions by the Company are discretionary and determined by the Company's
management. Company contributions are allocated to each participant based on the
relative compensation of the participant to the compensation of all
participants. The Company contributed approximately $250,000, $500,000, and
$560,000 for the Plan years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively.

12.  Related Party Transactions:
     ---------------------------

Rental expense of approximately $130,000 annually has been incurred for leased
space in an office building owned by certain officers and equity owners.

When CSI sells homes, the purchaser may obtain financing from Vanderbilt
Mortgage and Finance, Inc. ("Vanderbilt"), which is affiliated with one of the
Company's directors. In certain cases, for homes sold before June 1998,
Vanderbilt has recourse to the Company if the loans are not repaid. As of
December 31, 2001 there is a total of approximately $13.2 million of such
amounts that are recourse to the Company.

Included in management fee and other income and interest income are amounts
earned from N'Tandem, as outlined below:

                                         ==========   ==========   ==========

Interest is earned on the loan to N'Tandem (Prime plus one percent, or 5.75
percent at December 31, 2001) and includes fees paid by N'Tandem for the
subordination of the loan to the N'Tandem, $730,000 in both 2001 and 2000. The
transaction fees are related to acquisition services provided by the Company to
N'Tandem and are calculated as three percent of the acquisition price. The
advisory fees are charged based on one percent of N'Tandem's average assets. The
management fees are charged based on five percent of revenues of properties
managed by the Company on behalf of N'Tandem. Overhead reimbursement fees are
based on a fixed fee per site.

In December 2000, the Company purchased a manufactured home community from a
partnership owned by two officers of the Company for $2,550,000. This community
contains 295 developed homesites (See Note 3.)

13.  Contingencies:
     --------------

Several claims and legal actions arising from the normal course of business have
been asserted against the Company, and are pending final resolution. In the
opinion of management, none of these matters will have a material adverse effect
upon the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of the
Company.

The Company, through its joint venture and affiliate arrangements, has
guaranteed approximately $48.4 million of debt, $20 million of which is to
N'Tandem.

               2001 EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES

          Chateau Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation, wishes to attract
employees to the Company and its Subsidiaries and induce employees to remain
with the Company and its Subsidiaries, and to provide them with long-term
incentives for sustained high levels of performance. In furtherance thereof, the
Chateau Communities, Inc. 2001 Equity Compensation Plan For Certain Employees is
designed to provide equity-based incentives to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

          1.   Definitions.

          Whenever used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings set
forth below:

          "Award" means the award of either or both of an Option or Restricted
Stock under the Plan as the context requires.

          "Award Agreement" means a written agreement in a form approved by the
Committee to be entered into by the Company and a Participant, and also refers,
if applicable, to any employment agreement between the Company and the
Participant, the provisions of which relate to Options or Grants.

          "Board" means the Board of Directors of the Company.

          "Cause" means, unless otherwise provided in the Participant's Award
Agreement, (i) engaging in (A) willful or gross misconduct or (B) willful or
gross neglect, (ii) repeatedly failing to adhere to the directions of superiors
or the Board or the written policies and practices of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or its affiliates, (iii) the commission of a felony or a crime of
moral turpitude, or any crime involving the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any
affiliate thereof, (iv) fraud, insubordination, misappropriation or
embezzlement, (v) a material breach of the Participant's employment agreement
(if any) with the Company or its Subsidiaries or its affiliates, or (vi) any
illegal act detrimental to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its affiliates;
provided, however, that if the Participant is a party to an employment agreement
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and such agreement provides for
termination for "Cause," "Cause" hereunder shall have the same meaning ascribed
to it in the employment agreement.

          "Change in Control" means the occurrence of one of the following:

               (a)   a "person" or "group" (within the meaning of sections 13(d)
               and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) becomes the "beneficial owner"
               (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of
               securities of the Company (including options, warrants, rights
               and convertible and exchangeable securities) representing 50% or
               more of the combined voting power of the Company's then
               outstanding securities in any one or more transactions; provided,
               however, that purchases by employee benefit plans of the Company
               and by the Company or its affiliates shall be disregarded;

               (b)   any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one
               transaction or a series of related transactions) of all, or
               substantially all, of the operating assets of the Company;

               (c)   the execution and delivery of a definitive agreement by the
               Company that provides for a merger or consolidation, or a
               transaction having a similar effect (unless such merger,
               consolidation or similar transaction is with a





<PAGE>

               subsidiary of the Company or with another company, a majority of
               whose outstanding capital stock is owned by the same persons or
               entities who own a majority of the Common Stock at such time),
               where (A) the Company is not the surviving corporation, (B) the
               majority of the Common Stock of the Company is no longer held by
               the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the
               transaction, or (C) the Company's Common Stock is converted into
               cash, securities or other property (other than the common stock
               of a company into which the Company is merged);

               (d)   at a time when the Common Stock is registered under Section
               12 of the Exchange Act, a person other than the Company makes a
               tender or exchange offer for 50% or more of the Common Stock
               pursuant to which purchases of any amount of Common Stock are
               made; or

               (e)   a majority of the members of the Board are not persons who
               (A) had been directors of the Company for at least the preceding
               24 consecutive months or (B) when they initially were elected to
               the Board, (I) were nominated (if they were elected by the
               stockholders) or elected (if they were elected by the directors)
               with the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the directors who were
               Continuing Directors (as defined below) at the time of the
               nomination or election by the Board and (II) were not elected as
               a result of an actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or
               consents by a person other than the Board or an agreement
               intended to avoid or settle such a proxy solicitation (the
               directors described in clauses (A) and (B) being "Continuing
               Directors").

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a "Change of Control" shall not include an
offering of any class of shares of common stock of the Company or any of its
affiliates under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

          "Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

          "Committee" means the Executive Compensation Committee of  the  Board.

          "Common Stock" means the Company's Common Stock, par value $.01 per
share, either currently existing or authorized hereafter.

          "Company" means Chateau Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation.

          "Disability" means the occurrence of an event which would entitle an
employee of the Company to the payment of disability income under one of the
Company's approved long-term disability income plans or a long-term disability
as determined by the Committee in its absolute discretion pursuant to any other
standard as may be adopted by the Committee; provided, however, that if the
Participant is a party to an employment agreement with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and such agreement provides for termination by reason of
"Disability," "Disability" hereunder shall have the same meaning ascribed to it
in the employment agreement.

          "Exchange Act" means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

          "Fair Market Value" per Share as of a particular date means (i) if
Shares are then listed on a national stock exchange, the closing sales price per
Share on the exchange for the last preceding date on which there was a sale of
Shares on such exchange, as determined by the Committee; (ii) if Shares are not
then listed on a national stock exchange but are then traded on an
over-the-counter market, the average of the closing bid and asked prices for the

<PAGE>

          3.   Administration of Plan.

          The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee shall
consist of at least two individuals each of whom shall be a "nonemployee
director" as defined in Rule 16b-3 as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("Rule 16b- 3") under the Exchange Act and shall, at such times as

applicable, no member of the Committee may act as to matters under the Plan
specifically relating to such member.

          4.   Eligibility for and Grant of Options and Restricted Stock;
Committee Authority.

          Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall, in its
discretion as reflected by the terms of the Award Agreements: (i) authorize the
granting of Options or Restricted Stock (or both) to employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries; (ii) determine and designate from time to time those
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to whom Options and Restricted
Stock are to be granted and the number of Shares to be optioned or granted (as
applicable) to each employee; (iii) determine the number of Shares subject to
each Award; (iv) determine the time or times when and the manner and condition
in which each Option shall be exercisable and the duration of the exercise
period, and the restrictions applicable to Restricted Stock; and (v) determine
or impose other conditions to any Award under the Plan as it may deem
appropriate. In determining the eligibility of an employee to receive an Award,
as well as in determining the number of Shares to be subject to any such Award,
the Committee may consider his or her position and responsibilities, the nature
and value to the Company of his or her services and accomplishments whether
directly or through its Subsidiaries, his or her present and potential
contribution to the success of the Company whether directly or through its
Subsidiaries and such other factors as the Committee may deem relevant. The
Award Agreement shall contain such other terms, provisions and conditions not
inconsistent herewith as shall be determined by the Committee. The Participant
shall take whatever additional actions and execute whatever additional documents
the Committee may in its reasonable judgment deem necessary or advisable in
order to carry out or effect one or more of the obligations or restrictions
imposed on the Participant pursuant to the express provisions of the Plan and
the Award Agreement.

          5.   Number of Shares Subject to the Plan.

          Subject to adjustments pursuant to Section 10, (i) no more than an
aggregate of 1,000,000 Shares may be the subject of Awards. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 5, Shares as to which an Option is granted
under the Plan that remain unexercised at the expiration, forfeiture or other
termination of such Option and Shares of Restricted Stock that are forfeited may
be the subject of further Awards of a type for which the Shares were initially
available. Shares issued hereunder may consist, in whole or in part, of
authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares. The certificates for Shares
issued hereunder may include any legend which the Committee deems appropriate to
reflect any restrictions on transfer hereunder or under the Award Agreement, or
as the Committee may otherwise deem appropriate.

          6.   Options.

          A.   Option Price.

                                       4

<PAGE>

          The Option Price shall be determined by the Committee on the date the
Option is granted and reflected in the Award Agreement. Any particular Award
Agreement may provide for different exercise prices for specified amounts of
Shares subject to the Option.

          B.   Period of Option and Vesting.

          (a)  Unless earlier expired, forfeited or otherwise terminated, each
Option shall expire in its entirety upon the 10th anniversary of the date of
grant or shall have such other term as is set forth in the applicable Award
Agreement. The Option shall also expire, be forfeited and terminate at such
times and in such circumstances as otherwise provided hereunder or under the
Award Agreement.

          (b)  Each Option, to the extent that there has been no termination of
the Optionee's employment (or other service, if applicable) and the Option has
not otherwise lapsed, expired, terminated or been forfeited, shall first become
exercisable according to the terms and conditions set forth in the Award
Agreement, as determined by the Committee at the time of grant. Unless otherwise
provided in the Award Agreement or herein, no Option (or portion thereof) shall
ever be exercisable if the Optionee's employment with the Company and its
Subsidiaries has terminated before the time at which such Option would otherwise
have become exercisable, and any Option that would otherwise become exercisable
after such termination shall not become exercisable and shall be forfeited upon
such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
6B(b), Options exercisable pursuant to the schedule set forth by the Committee
at the time of grant may be fully or more rapidly exercisable or otherwise
vested at any time in the discretion of the Committee. Upon and after the death
of an Optionee, such Optionee's Options, if and to the extent otherwise
exercisable hereunder or under the applicable Award Agreement after the
Optionee's death, may be exercised by the Successors of the Optionee.

          C.   Exercisability Upon and After Termination of Optionee.

          (a)  The Committee shall provide in the Award Agreement the extent (if
any) to which any Option may be exercised upon the Optionee's termination of
employment.

          (b)  Except as may otherwise be expressly set forth in this Section
6C, and except as may otherwise be expressly provided under the Award Agreement,
no provision of this Section 6C is intended to or shall permit the exercise of
the Option to the extent the Option was not exercisable upon cessation of
employment.

          D.   Exercise of Options.

          Subject to vesting and other restrictions provided forhereunder or
otherwise imposed in accordance herewith, an Option may be exercised, and
payment in full of the aggregate Option Price made, by an Optionee only by
written notice (in the form prescribed by the Committee) to the Company
specifying the number of Shares to be purchased.

          E.   Payment.

          (a)  The aggregate Option Price shall be paid in full upon the
exercise of the Option. Payment must be made by one of the following methods:

               (i)    a certified or bank cashier's check;

               (ii)   the proceeds of a Company loan program or third-party sale
               program or a notice acceptable to the Committee given as
               consideration under such a program, in each case if permitted by
               the Committee in its discretion, if such a program has been
               established and the Optionee is eligible to participate therein;

                                       5

<PAGE>

               (iii)  if approved by the Committee in its discretion, Shares of
               previously owned Common Stock (not subject to restrictions
               hereunder) having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of
               exercise equal to the aggregate Option Price, which Common Stock
               was owned by the Participant at least six months prior to such
               delivery;

               (iv)   if approved by the Committee in its discretion, through
               the written election of the Optionee to have Shares withheld by
               the Company from the Shares otherwise to be received, with such
               withheld Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date
               of exercise equal to the aggregate Option Price; or

               (v)    by any combination of such methods of payment or any other
               method acceptable to the Committee in its discretion.

          (b)  The Committee, in its discretion, may also permit the Optionee to
elect to exercise an Option by receiving a combination of Shares and cash, or,
in the discretion of the Committee, either Shares or solely in cash, with an
aggregate Fair Market Value (or, to the extent of payment in cash, in an amount)
equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which
the Option is being exercised over the aggregate Option Price, as determined as
of the day the Option is exercised.

          (c)  Except in the case of Options exercised by certified or bank
cashier's check, the Committee may impose limitations and prohibitions on the
exercise of Options as it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, any
limitation or prohibition designed to avoid accounting consequences which may
result from the use of Common Stock as payment upon exercise of an Option. Any
fractional Shares resulting from an Optionee's election that are accepted by the
Company shall in the discretion of the Committee be paid in cash.

          F.   Tax Withholding-- Options.

          The Committee may, in its discretion, require the Optionee to pay to
the Company at the time of exercise of any Option the amount that the Committee
deems necessary to satisfy the Company's obligation to withhold federal, state
or local income or other taxes incurred by reason of the exercise. Upon exercise
of the Option, the Optionee may, if approved by the Committee in its discretion,
make a written election to have Shares then issued withheld by the Company from
the Shares otherwise to be received, or to deliver previously owned Shares (not
subject to restrictions hereunder), in order to satisfy the liability for such
withholding taxes. In the event that the Optionee makes, and the Committee
permits, such an election, the number of Shares so withheld or delivered shall
have an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of exercise sufficient to
satisfy the applicable withholding taxes. Notwithstanding anything contained in
the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, the Optionee's satisfaction of
any tax-withholding requirements imposed by the Committee shall be a condition
precedent to the Company's obligation as may otherwise be provided hereunder to
provide Shares to the Optionee, and the failure of the Optionee to satisfy such
requirements with respect to the exercise of an Option shall cause such Option
to be forfeited.

          G.   Exercise by Successors and Payment in Full.

          An Option may be exercised, and payment in full of the aggregate
Option Price made, by the Successors of the Optionee only by written notice (in
the form prescribed by the Committee) to the Company specifying the number of
Shares to be purchased. Such notice shall state that the aggregate Option Price
will be paid in full, or that the Option will be exercised as otherwise provided
hereunder, in the discretion of the Company or the Committee, if and as
applicable.

          H.   Nontransferability of Option.

                                       6

<PAGE>

          Each Option granted under the Plan shall by its terms be
nontransferable by the Optionee except by will or the laws of descent and
distribution of the state wherein the Optionee is domiciled at the time of his
death; provided, however, that the Committee may (but need not) permit other
transfers, where the Committee concludes that such transferability (i) does not
result in accelerated taxation, and (ii) is otherwise appropriate and desirable.

          7.   Restricted Stock.

          A.   Certificates for Restricted Stock.

          (a)  Each Grantee shall be issued a stock certificate in respect of
Shares of Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan. Such certificate shall be
registered in the name of the Grantee, and (without limiting the provisions
relating to the legending of Share certificates contained in Section 5) shall
bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions
applicable to such Award, substantially in the following form:

          The transferability of this certificate and the shares of stock
          represented hereby are subject to the terms and conditions (including
          forfeiture) of the Company's 2001 Equity Compensation Plan For Certain
          Employees and an Agreement entered into between the registered owner
          and the Company. Copies of such Plan and Agreement are on file in the
          offices of the Company.

          (b)  The Committee shall require that the stock certificates
evidencing such Shares be held in custody by the Company until the restrictions
thereon shall have lapsed, and that, as a condition of any Restricted Stock
Award, the Grantee shall have delivered a stock power, endorsed in blank,
relating to the stock covered by such Award. If and when such restrictions so
lapse, the stock certificates shall be delivered by the Company to the recipient
or his or her designee.

          B.   Restrictions and Conditions.

          The Shares of Restricted Stock awarded pursuant to the Plan shall be
subject to the following restrictions and conditions:

               (i)   Subject to the provisions of the Plan and the Award
               Agreements, during a period set by the Committee commencing with
               the date of such Award and ending on a date established by the
               Committee, the Grantee shall not be permitted voluntarily or
               involuntarily to sell, transfer, pledge, anticipate, alienate,
               encumber or assign Shares of Restricted Stock awarded under the
               Plan (or have such Shares attached or garnished). Unless
               otherwise determined by the Committee, the restriction period
               with respect to Shares issued to Grantees on account of their
               elections with the consent of the Committee to receive all or a
               portion of their annual bonuses under the Company's discretionary
               annual bonus program in Shares of Restricted Stock hereunder
               shall be for a period of three years from the date of the Award.

               (ii)  Except as provided in the foregoing clause (i), the Grantee
               shall have, in respect of the Shares of Restricted Stock, all of
               the rights of a stockholder of the Company, including the right
               to vote the Shares, and the right to receive any cash dividends.
               Certificates for Shares not subject to restrictions shall be
               delivered to the Grantee promptly after, and only after, the
               period of forfeiture shall expire without forfeiture in respect
               of such Shares of Restricted Stock.

                                       7

<PAGE>

               (iii) Subject to the provisions of the Award Agreement and clause
               (iv) below, upon the termination of employment with the Company
               and its Subsidiaries for any reason or by the Grantee during the
               applicable restriction period, all Shares still subject to
               restriction shall be forfeited by the Grantee.

               (iv)  In the event the Grantee's employment with the Company and
               its Subsidiaries terminates on account of death, Retirement or
               Disability of the Grantee during the applicable restriction
               period, if and to the extent provided in the Award Agreement, all
               restrictions shall immediately lapse on all Restricted Stock
               granted pursuant to such Award Agreement.

          C.   Tax Withholding -- Restricted Stock.

          The Committee may, in its discretion, require the Grantee to pay to
the Company at the time of vesting of any Restricted Stock (or other income
recognition event, such as election under Section 83(b) of the Code) the amount
that the Committee deems necessary to satisfy the Company's obligation to
withhold federal, state or local income or other taxes incurred by reason of the
vesting (or other such event). Upon vesting (or such other event), the Grantee
may, if approved by the Committee in its discretion, make a written election to
have Shares withheld by the Company from the Shares otherwise to be released
from restriction, or to deliver previously owned Shares (not subject to
restrictions hereunder), in order to satisfy the liability for such withholding
taxes. In the event that the Optionee makes, and the Committee permits, such an
election, the number of Shares so withheld or delivered shall have an aggregate
Fair Market Value on the date of exercise sufficient to satisfy the applicable
withholding taxes. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the
contrary, the Grantee's satisfaction of any tax-withholding requirements imposed
by the Committee shall be a condition precedent to the release of any
restrictions as may otherwise be provided hereunder, and the failure of the
Grantee to satisfy such requirements with respect to the vesting of Restricted
Stock (or another income recognition event) shall cause the applicable
Restricted Stock to be forfeited.

          8.   Regulations and Approvals.

          (a)  The obligation of the Company to sell Shares with respect to
Options granted under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules
and regulations, including all applicable federal and state securities laws, and
the obtaining of all such approvals by governmental agencies as may be deemed
necessary or appropriate by the Committee.

          (b)  The Committee may make such changes to the Plan as may be
qnecessary or appropriate to comply with the rules and regulations of any
government authority or to obtain tax benefits applicable to stock options or
restricted stock.

          (c)  Each Award is subject to the requirement that, if at any time the
Committee determines, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or
qualification of Shares issuable pursuant to the Plan is required by any
securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or
approval of any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a
condition of, or in connection with, the Award, no Options shall be granted or
payment made or Shares issued or grant of Restricted Stock made, in whole or in
part, unless listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval has been
effected or obtained free of any conditions in a manner acceptable to the
Committee.

          (d)  In the event that the disposition of stock acquired pursuant to
the Plan is not covered by a then current registration statement under the
Securities Act, and is not otherwise exempt from such registration, such Shares
shall be restricted against transfer to the extent required under the Securities
Act, and the Committee may require any individual receiving Shares pursuant to
the Plan, as a

                                       8

<PAGE>

condition precedent to receipt of such Shares, to represent to the Company in
writing that the Shares acquired by such individual are acquired for investment
only and not with a view to distribution and that such Shares will be disposed
of only if registered for sale under the Securities Act or if there is an
available exemption for such disposition.

          9.   Interpretation and Amendments; Other Rules.

          The Committee may make such rules and regulations and establish such
procedures for the administration of the Plan as it deems appropriate. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may (i) determine (A)
the conditions under which a Participant will be considered to have retired or
become disabled and (B) whether any Participant has done so; (ii) establish or
assist in the establishment of a program (which need not be administered in a
nondiscriminatory or uniform manner) under which the Company or a third party
may make bona-fide loans on arm's-length terms to any or all Optionees to assist
such Optionees with the satisfaction of any or all of the obligations that such
Optionees may have hereunder or under which third-party sales may be made for
such purpose (including, without limitation, a loan program under which the
Company or a third party would advance the aggregate Option Price to the
Optionee and be repaid with Option stock or the proceeds thereof and a sale
program under which funds to pay for Option stock are delivered by a third party
upon the third party's receipt from the Company of stock certificates); (iii)
determine the extent, if any, to which Options or Shares (whether or not Shares
of Restricted Stock) shall be forfeited (whether or not such forfeiture is
expressly contemplated hereunder); (iv) interpret the Plan and the Award
Agreements hereunder, with such interpretations to be conclusive and binding on
all persons and otherwise accorded the maximum deference permitted by law; and
(v) take any other actions and make any other determinations or decisions that
it deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the Plan or the
administration or interpretation thereof. The Committee may, in its discretion,
establish a program under which, in each case in which dividends (or, in the
discretion of the Committee, certain dividends) are payable with respect to an
outstanding Share, an equivalent amount with respect to each Share subject to an
outstanding Option shall be (i) paid currently to the applicable Optionee, (ii)
deferred for eventual payment to the Optionee (with or without interest or other
deemed earnings), (iii) credited as a reduction to the exercise price of the
Option or (iv) any combination of the foregoing. Unless otherwise expressly
provided hereunder, the Committee may, with respect to any Award, exercise its
discretion hereunder at the time of the Award or thereafter. In the event of any
dispute or disagreement as to the interpretation of the Plan or of any rule,
regulation or procedure, or as to any question, right or obligation arising from
or related to the Plan, the decision of the Committee shall be final and binding
upon all persons. The Board may amend the Plan as it shall deem advisable,
except that no amendment may adversely affect a Participant with respect to
Options or Restricted Stock previously granted unless such amendments are in
connection with compliance with applicable laws; provided that the Board may not
make any amendment in the Plan that would, if such amendment were not approved
by the holders of the Common Stock, cause the Plan to fail to comply with any
requirement of applicable law or regulation, unless and until the approval of
the holders of such Common Stock is obtained. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Committee may (subject to such considerations as may arise
under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, or under other corporate, securities or
tax laws) take any steps it deems appropriate, that are not inconsistent with
the purposes and intent of the Plan, to take into account the provisions of
Section 162(m) of the Code.

          10.  Changes in Capital Structure.

                                       9

<PAGE>

          If (i) the Company or its Subsidiaries shall at any time be involved
in a merger, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, reorganization, exchange
of shares, sale of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or a transaction similar thereto, (ii) any stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, stock combination, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar change in the capital structure of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, or any distribution to holders of Common Stock other than
cash dividends, shall occur or (iii) any other event shall occur which in the
judgment of the Committee necessitates action by way of adjusting the terms of
the outstanding Options and Restricted Stock, then the Committee may forthwith
take any such action as in its judgment shall be necessary to preserve to the
Participants rights substantially proportionate to the rights existing prior to
such event, and to maintain the continuing availability of Shares under Section
5 (if Shares are otherwise then available) in a manner consistent with the
intent hereof, including, without limitation, adjustments in (x) the number and
kind of shares subject to Options and Grants, (y) the Option Price, and (z) the
number and kind of shares available under Section 5. To the extent that such
action shall include an increase or decrease in the number of shares subject to
outstanding Options and Grants, the number of shares available under Section 5
above shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, proportionately.

          If a Change in Control shall occur, then the Committee may make such
adjustments as it, in its discretion, determines are necessary or appropriate in
light of the Change in Control (including, without limitation, the substitution
of stock other than stock of the Company as the stock optioned or granted (as
applicable) hereunder, and the acceleration of the exercisability of the Option
or vesting of the Restricted Stock), provided that the Committee determines that
such adjustments do not have a substantial adverse economic impact on the
Participant as determined at the time of the adjustments.

          The judgment of the Committee with respect to any matter referred to
in this Section 10 shall be conclusive and binding upon each Participant without
the need for any amendment to the Plan.

          11.   Notices.

          All notices under the Plan shall be in writing, and if to the Company,
shall be delivered to the Board or mailed to its principal office, addressed to
the attention of the Board; and if to the Participant, shall be delivered
personally or mailed to the Participant at the address appearing in the records
of the Company. Such addresses may be changed at any time by written notice to
the other party given in accordance with this Section 11.

          12.   Rights as Stockholder.

          Neither the Optionee nor any person entitled to exercise the
Optionee's rights in the event of death shall have any rights of a stockholder
