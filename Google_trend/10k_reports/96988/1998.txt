ITEM 1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Business Development

Marlton Technologies, Inc. (the "Issuer" or "Company") was incorporated as a New
Jersey corporation in 1966. The Issuer's business was related to computerized
electronic telecommunication systems until 1988, when it sold substantially all
of its operating assets.

On August 7, 1990, the Issuer acquired the business of Sparks Exhibits Corp.
("Sparks") in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Sparks custom designs and manufactures
sophisticated trade show exhibits, displays, architectural and museum interiors,
graphics and signage, provides trade show services and designs and sells
portable exhibits. During the fourth quarter of 1990, the Issuer acquired the
accounts and assets of the trade show exhibit division of a competitor and also
established a portable exhibits group. The Issuer subsequently formed (i) Sparks
Exhibits, Inc. ("Exhibits") during July 1991 in the Atlanta, Georgia area,
(ii)Sparks Exhibits, Ltd. ("Limited") during July 1992 in the San Diego,
California area, and (iii) Sparks Exhibits Incorporated ("Incorporated") during
December 1992 in the Orlando, Florida area, in each case by acquiring the assets
of trade show exhibit manufacturing companies. During August 1993, the rights
and related business assets to a panelized portable trade show exhibit owned by
Limited were transferred to a 51% Issuer -owned subsidiary, Expose Display
Systems , Inc. ("EDSI"), with the manufacturing and distribution facilities
moved to Los Angeles, California during March 1994. During April 1996, the
Issuer acquired the stock of Piper Productions, Inc. ("Piper") in Orlando,
Florida, and in December 1996 the operations of Incorporated were combined into
Piper. In addition to Incorporated's trade show exhibit business, Piper produces
business theater, theme park attractions, themed interiors, theatrical scenery
and special effects. On December 31, 1997, the Issuer acquired DMS Store
Fixtures Corp. ("DMS") in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. DMS supplies custom
made fixtures and displays to national retailers, department stores and consumer
products manufacturers. Currently all of the Issuer's operating revenues are
derived from Sparks, Exhibits, Limited , Incorporated (collectively, the "Sparks
Companies"), EDSI, Piper and DMS.


Business of Issuer

         Products and Services:

The Sparks Companies custom design and manufacture sophisticated trade show
exhibits, displays, architectural and museum interiors, graphics and signage,
provide trade show services, and sell portable exhibits. EDSI produces and
distributes a line of panelized portable exhibits. Piper is a theatrical
construction company that specializes in the manufacture of scenery for live
shows, television, theme park attractions, themed interiors and themed trade
show exhibits. Clients include industry, government, museum, theme park
companies and commercial establishments. Graphics and industrial designers
develop and manage custom design requirements from concept through final
construction, employing sophisticated computer-aided



                                       1

Business of Issuer, continued

design software and hardware. Complete graphics facilities provide full in-house
dark room capabilities, silk-screening, and state of the art computerized
design/graphics. Electronics and audiovisual capabilities include on-staff
electronic specialists, consultants, and vendor relationships which provide
multi-media equipment and programs, fiber-optic technology, laser disk video
interactive program production, video and computer games, simulators, and
customized software and hardware applications. The Sparks Companies are full
service exhibit houses, providing show service coordination, freight
coordination, refurbishing, storage and marketing literature distribution. Many
clients are Fortune 1000 firms, who typically contract for custom trade show
exhibit projects in excess of $100,000. Additionally, a majority of these
clients store their exhibits at a Sparks Company facility, where ongoing
refurbishing and coordination of clients' trade show schedules are provided. The
Sparks Companies also represent domestic clients who desire to exhibit at
international trade shows. The Sparks Companies design such exhibits, and,
through an international network of independent exhibit manufacturers, arrange
for the manufacture and delivery of trade show exhibits to the desired trade
show. The Sparks Companies also design and manufacture trade show exhibits for a
number of United States subsidiaries of foreign corporations, for use in
domestic trade shows. In 1992, Limited began to produce and distribute panelized
portable exhibits known as "Expose", through a network of predominantly U.S.
portable exhibit dealers, including the Sparks Companies and unaffiliated
dealers. Since August 1993, EDSI has assumed responsibility for this portable
exhibit production and distribution. DMS is engaged in the business of supplying
custom store fixtures, showcases and point of purchase displays for retailers.
DMS has expertise and capabilities to take a design from concept to
installation. Engineers and designers work with the customers to develop the
fixture design through computer aided design equipment and development of a
prototype, if necessary. Engineering drawings are then produced and provided to
a factory for production. DMS utilizes various manufacturers with whom it has
developed long standing business relationships for the production of its
products. These factories work closely with the DMS management team. The retail
fixture industry includes outfitting new retail stores and remodeling existing
stores, including specialty apparel chains, "category killer" stores, department
stores, outlet stores, supermarkets, building supply stores and drug stores.


         Marketing and Distribution:

Sales by the Sparks Companies to domestic customers for both domestic and
foreign trade shows and sales by Piper and DMS to primarily domestic customers
are solicited through internal marketing groups. Purchase of sophisticated
exhibit and display products usually involves a substantial dollar commitment by
the customer as significant expertise is required to properly meet the
customer's needs. Sales personnel are required to be knowledgeable with respect
to the design and manufacturing of sophisticated exhibit and display products as
well as complying





                                       2
<PAGE>



Business of Issuer, continued

with internal profitability requirements. In addition to the sales personnel,
senior officers devote substantial time and effort to sales and marketing
activities. EDSI's panelized portable exhibits are marketed by EDSI's minority
shareholder, Abex Display Systems, Inc. ("ADSI"), to retail portable exhibit
dealers by direct solicitation, media advertising and participation in trade
shows for the portable exhibit industry.

         Manufacturing and Raw Materials:

The Sparks Companies design, develop and manufacture custom trade show exhibits
utilizing an in-house staff of designers, carpenters, electricians and
warehousemen. Specialty items such as steel work and studio production are
subcontracted. The Sparks Companies also subcontract the manufacture of exhibits
for foreign trade shows. The Sparks Companies coordinate shipping, exhibit
set-up and removal at the customer's trade show and, in most cases, subsequently
store the exhibit for the customer. Piper's manufacturing comprises various
technical and artistic disciplines. Piper employs scenic carpenters and metal
workers to fabricate scenery which is painted by skilled scenic artists. DMS
utilizes manufacturers with whom it has developed long standing business
relationships from the early 1980's for the production of its products. Raw
materials for custom, scenic and portable exhibits, store fixtures and displays,
as well as subcontractor work, are readily available from various vendors.
Patents, trademarks and licenses are not important to operations. The
Philadelphia and King of Prussia, PA operations are the only unionized
facilities, with a three-year labor contract expiring June 30, 1998 in
Philadelphia, and a three year labor contract expiring November 14, 1998 in King
of Prussia, PA. Portable exhibit configurations, together with graphics and
signage, are typically designed by the Sparks Companies for a client. Portable
exhibits are produced by EDSI, in the case of Expose, or are purchased from
unrelated manufacturers for resale. Graphics and signage may be produced
internally or subcontracted. Geographic distribution rights are typically
granted by portable exhibit manufacturers based on annual sales volume levels.
The Sparks Companies have obtained such distribution rights from their primary
sources of portable exhibits, and other portable exhibit dealers have been
granted such distribution rights with regard to Expose. Amounts spent by EDSI
during each of the last three years on the development of new products,
including the required machinery, equipment and tooling to manufacture and
produce the products approximates $28,000, $325,000 and $144,000, during 1997,
1996 and 1995, respectively. Other than previously described, the Company made
no material disbursements during each of the last three fiscal years for
research and development activities.

         Seasonality of Business:

Trade shows traditionally occur regularly throughout the year with the exception
of the third quarter when business to business trade shows are historically at a
low point. The Sparks Companies' business has also been of a seasonal nature due
to the fact that trade show activities in specific industries, such as health
care and telecommunications, are a function of the seasonal show schedules in
such industries. DMS' business tends to be slower in the fourth and first
quarters due to retailers desires not to install or plan new fixtures during
their traditionally busy year end season. The Sparks Companies have embarked on
a program to seek new clients and sales people with client bases in different
industries to reduce the effects of the slower sales



                                       3

Business of Issuer, continued

period. Additionally, the Issuer is now offering other products and services,
such as sales of scenic and themed exhibits, portable exhibits, and permanent
exhibits which are less seasonal in nature.


         Working Capital:

The Sparks Companies', Piper's, EDSI's and DMS' working capital requirements are
fulfilled by funds generated through operations, bank term loans and revolving
credit facilities. Working capital requirements are generally not affected by
project size requirements or accelerated delivery for major customers due to
general policies of progress billing on larger jobs. Additionally, the Sparks
Companies, Piper, EDSI and DMS do not require continuous allotments of raw
materials from suppliers and other than DMS, do not generally provide extended
payment terms to customers other than lease and purchase arrangements with
credit-worthy customers, not exceeding terms of three years.

         Significant Customers:

During 1997 and 1996, no individual customer accounted for at least 10% of
consolidated net sales. However, DMS annual sales have historically been
significantly reliant upon two customers for a major portion of their annual
revenues. The Company expects this situation to continue during 1998.


         Backlog:

The Sparks Companies', Piper's and EDSI's backlog of orders at December 31,
1997, and 1996 was approximately $18,000,000 and $8,500,000, respectively. DMS's
backlog of orders at December 31, 1997 and 1996 was approximately $5,600,000 and
$7,400,000, respectively. The higher backlog level for DMS at December 31, 1996
was primarily due to an international order received but not delivered as of
that date. Generally, DMS's backlog of orders are recognized as sales during the
subsequent six month period. The entire current backlog relates to expected 1998
sales. The Sparks Companies, Piper, EDSI and DMS maintain a client base from
which new orders are continually generated, including refurbishing of existing
trade show exhibits stored in Sparks Companies' facilities. There are also a
significant amount of Sparks Companies, Piper and DMS proposals outstanding with
current and prospective clients. Sales for the Sparks Companies routinely occur
during the period immediately preceding customer trade shows.

         Competition:

The Sparks Companies, Piper and DMS compete with other companies offering
similar products and providing similar services on the basis of price, quality,



                                       4

Business of Issuer, continued

performance and client-support services. The custom trade show exhibit, scenic
and themed exhibit, permanent exhibit manufacturing market, retail store fixture
and display market and portable exhibits sales market include a large number of
national and regional companies, some of which have substantially greater sales
and resources than the Sparks Companies, Piper and DMS. In addition to their
Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Diego and Orlando manufacturing facilities, the
Sparks Companies and Piper utilize their national and international affiliations
and relationships to meet customers needs in other geographic areas. EDSI
competes primarily with other manufacturers of portable exhibits, some of which
have substantially greater operating histories, sales and resources than EDSI.
Due to the lack of specific public information, the Sparks Companies', Piper's,
EDSI's and DMS's competitive position is difficult to ascertain.

         Environmental Protection:

The Sparks Companies', Piper's, EDSI's and DMS's compliance with Federal, state
and local provisions regulating discharge of materials into the environment or
otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had and is not
expected to have a material effect upon their capital expenditures, earnings,
and competitive position.

         Employees:

The total number of persons employed by the Issuer is approximately 310 of which
305 are full-time employees.


ITEM 2.  DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY

The Issuer currently leases five primary facilities as follows:

          Location     Square Footage            Purpose

Philadelphia, PA          235,000   Office, showroom, warehouse & manufacturing
Austell, GA                81,000   Office, showroom, warehouse & manufacturing
El Cajon, CA               80,000   Office, showroom, warehouse & manufacturing
King of Prussia, PA        60,000   Office and warehouse
Orlando, Florida           45,000   Office, warehouse & manufacturing

The Issuer's subsidiaries also have approximately five sales offices of under
1,000 square feet each. Additionally, EDSI operates in approximately 90,000
square feet of office, showroom, warehouse and manufacturing space within the
minority shareholder's North Hollywood, California facility.

<PAGE>


ITEM 2.  DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY, continued


         The Sparks Companies' and Piper's office, showroom, warehouse and
manufacturing facilities and DMS's office and warehouse facilities were all in
good condition and adequate for 1997, based on normal five-day operations, and
are adequate for 1998 operations, including any foreseeable internal growth. The
Issuer does not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring additional space, if
necessary.

ITEM 3   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Issuer is not involved in any material pending legal proceedings.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

The following proposals were submitted and approved at a special meeting held on
December 12, 1997:

          (i)    To approve the acquisition of DMS Store Fixtures Corp.:
                 For:     2,929,453        Against: 57,934   Abstain: 4,484

         (ii)    Increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock from
                 10,000,000 to 50,000,000 shares:
                 For:     3,333,698        Against: 355,007  Abstain: 7,134

         (iii)   To authorize 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock:
                 For:     3,510,091        Against: 374,194  Abstain: 20,534

The following table shows the high and low sales prices of the Common Stock, par
value $.10 per share, of the Issuer on its principal market, the American Stock
Exchange:

ITEM 5   MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, continued

         No dividends were paid during the past two fiscal years. The Issuer
currently intends to employ all available funds in the business. Future dividend
policy will be determined in accordance with the financial requirements of the
business. However, the Issuer's bank loan agreement provides that the Issuer may
not pay dividends to its shareholders without the bank's prior consent. Unless
waived, this restriction will preclude the Issuer from paying dividends.

As of March 24, 1998, there were 1,106 holders of record of the Issuer's common
stock.

         In connection with the Issuer's December 31, 1997 acquisition of DMS,
the Issuer issued 2,000,000 unregistered shares of Common Stock to the sellers
of DMS, 100,000 unregistered warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock to Legg
Mason Wood Walker, Incorporated as a financial advisor fee, and 62,500
unregistered warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock to CoreStates Bank,
N.A. as a loan commitment fee. The warrants are exercisable for a period of four
years from issuance, at a price of $6.19 per share, the average closing price of
Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange for the twenty trading day period
prior to the acquisition. During January 1996, the Issuer issued 500,000
unregistered shares of its Common Stock to Tsubasa System Company, Ltd., the
Issuers joint venture shareholder in Sparks Japan, in connection with an
amendment to a distribution and licensing agreement affecting Sparks Japan. The
Issuer relied upon the exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933, since all of those issuances were to a limited group of
sophisticated parties in a private, non-underwritten transaction.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

General Overview

The Company's core business is the custom design, manufacture and sale of
sophisticated trade show exhibits, displays, signage and graphics for clients in
industry, government, consumer electronics, athletic goods, healthcare,
telecommunications and other specialized fields.

During March 1995, the Company and a Japan-based diversified manufacturing and
marketing company, Tsubasa System Company Ltd. ("Tsubasa") entered into an
agreement to organize a new Japanese corporation, Sparks Exhibits Japan ("SEJ"),
and grant exclusive Japan distribution rights to SEJ for the Company's portable
exhibits products and technology and to license the name and logo of "Sparks
Exhibits" in Japan. See Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements.

During April 1996, the Company acquired Piper Productions, Inc. ("Piper") of
Orlando, Florida which produces business theater, theme park attractions, themed
interiors, theatrical scenery and special effects. The acquisition of Piper
enhanced the Company's ability to pursue exhibit opportunities within Piper's
areas of expertise. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.

On December 31, 1997, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary ("DMS"),
acquired all of the partnership interests (the "Acquisition") in DMS Store
Fixtures, L.P. ("L.P.") held by L.P.'s three principals and three corporate
holders (the "Sellers", collectively). The aggregate consideration paid by the
Company was $14,500,000 in cash and 2.25 million unregistered shares of the
Company's common stock of which 250,000 shares are contingent upon DMS achieving
at least $12.5 million of cumulative pre-tax earnings through December 31, 2002.
The Acquisition was funded, in part, by a $13.5 million five year collateralized
term loan through a bank and is accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the
assets and liabilities of DMS were recorded at their estimated fair value as of
December 31, 1997 with the difference of approximately $17.0 million including
related acquisition costs recorded as goodwill and other assets. As part of the
Acquisition, the Company entered into five year employment agreements with each
of the three individual principals of L.P. commencing January 1, 1998.

Management's aggressive growth plan, since the August 1990 acquisition of Sparks
Exhibits Corp. ("Sparks"), and most recent acquisition of DMS, has resulted in
the dramatic expansion of the Company's client base, the development of new
business groups for expansion of its products and services, and the extension
into major geographic markets in the United States and internationally.
Management believes the acquisitions and the continuing development of the new
business groups will position the Company to increase its revenue base and move
toward its goal of becoming a leading dimensional marketing company through the
continued offering of expanded products and services to a larger customer
network.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1997 As Compared with 1996

Sales

Revenues for 1997 of $48.7 million exceeded 1996 revenues of $38.3 million by
approximately 27%.

The $10.4 million revenue increase during 1997 over 1996 revenues was
attributable to sales increases from the reported business groups as follows:

                                       1997                        1996
                                       ----                        ----
 
Trade show exhibits group           $37,387,000                 $30,939,000
Permanent and scenic
  displays group                     11,329,000                   7,377,000
                                   ------------               -------------

          Total revenues            $48,716,000                $38,316,000
                                    ===========                ===========

The Trade show exhibits group experienced a 21% increase in its 1997 revenues
compared with 1996. The increase reflects the Company's continuing program of
client expansion which was experienced in all three custom trade show exhibit
manufacturing facilities - Philadelphia, Atlanta and San Diego. The Rental group
experienced higher 1997 revenues as compared with their 1996 revenues due to the
Company's investments in their marketing efforts. Expose' Display Systems, Inc.
("EDSI"), the Company's majority-owned joint venture, experienced 53% growth in
revenues during 1997 as compared with 1996 due to the increased acceptance of
EDSI's product lines by Abex Display Systems, Inc.'s ("ADSI") national
distribution network and the increasing impact of the 1996 introduction of
EDSI's LS (laminate system) into the marketplace. Sparks' Portable sales group,
a distributor of ADSI's products, experienced an expected 42% reduction in 1997
revenues as compared with 1996 revenues due to the closing of two stand-alone
portable exhibit sales distribution offices during the fourth quarter of 1996.

The permanent and scenic displays group experienced a 54% increase in its 1997
revenues compared with 1996. The increase was due to a dramatic increase in
sales generated by Piper during the twelve months of 1997 as compared with
Piper's nine months of operations during 1996. Piper was acquired by the Company
on April 1, 1996. The Museum/Production group experienced a 17% decline in 1997
revenues as compared with 1996 revenues due, only, to the timing of sales. The
Museums/Production group currently has approximately $5.3 million of in-process
contracts. Revenues related to these contracts should be recognized
predominantly during 1998.

Operating Profits

The 27% increase in 1997 revenues as compared with 1996 revenues contributed to
a 69% increase in the Company's operating profits during the respective periods.
The Company maintained a relatively consistent gross profit level of 28.4% and
28.1% during the respective annual periods of 1997 and 1996. Selling, general
and administrative costs, as a percentage of sales, fell by approximately 0.8%
during 1997 as compared with 1996, also contributing to the higher operating
profits recorded during 1997.

Other Income (Expense)

Other income decreased from $1,344,000 during 1996 to $349,000 during 1997. This
significant decrease in other income during 1997 is attributable to the $1.2
million gain from the contract amendment recorded during 1996. Interest income
increased during 1997 as compared with 1996 due to additional interest and gains
from the sale of certain investments during 1997. Interest expense decreased
during 1997 due to the overall reduction of the Company's long-term debt
balances from 1996.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes,
increased to approximately 24% during 1997 as compared with 13% during 1996. The
higher 1997 rate as compared with the 1996 rate reflects a reduced benefit from
the release of valuation allowances based upon the Company's expected
realization of future benefits from its net operating loss and business tax
credit carryforwards.

Net Income

During 1997, net income decreased to $2,003,000 ($.36 per diluted share) as
compared with 1996 net income of $2,340,000 ($.45 per diluted share). The
decrease is attributable to the $1.2 million gain from the contractual amendment
which took place during 1996. Additionally, the tax provision during 1997, as a
percentage of income before income taxes, increased to 24% from the 13% tax
provision rate utilized during 1996, as more fully described in the "Income
Taxes" section of this MD&A. Exclusive of the effects of the different tax rates
used to provide for income taxes and the 1996 gain from the contractual
amendment, 1997 net income per diluted common share increased approximately 65%
as follows:

                                                   1997                 1996

Backlog:

The Company's backlog of orders at December 31, 1997 was approximately $23.6
million as compared with approximately $8.5 million as of December 31, 1996.
Exclusive of the $5.6 million of DMS' backlog of orders at December 31, 1997,
the $9.5 million increase in backlog is attributable to new orders generated
through the Museums and International groups, EDSI and Piper and from
experienced account executives with established client bases in the Company's
core business - Custom trade show exhibits. The entire current backlog relates
to expected 1998 sales.

1996 As Compared with 1995

Sales

Revenues for 1996 of $38.3 million, represents a 38.5% increase over 1995
revenues of $27.7 million. The $10.6 million increase during 1996 over 1995
revenues was attributed to sales increases from the reported business groups as
follows:


                                                     1996             1995

                                                  ===========     ===========


The Trade show exhibits group experienced a 25% increase in its 1996 revenues as
compared with its 1995 revenues due to higher sales generated by the Rental,
International and Expose' groups during 1996. Additionally, the Company's core
business - custom tradeshow exhibits, experienced a 17% increase in its 1996
revenues over 1995 revenues reflecting the Company's continued program of client
expansion. However, the increase was only experienced in the Philadelphia and
San Diego facilities where 1996 revenues exceeded those facilities' 1995
revenues by 35%. The Atlanta and Melbourne, Florida facilities experienced a
decline in their core business revenues during 1996 as compared with 1995
predominantly due to less work having been transferred into those facilities by
the Philadelphia location during 1996. Accordingly, management consolidated the
Melbourne, Florida facility into the Orlando-based Piper Productions facility
during January 1997. The Rental groups' 1996 increase was partially due to being
operational for the entire year as compared with four months of operations
during 1995. The International group experienced higher 1996 revenues as
compared with its 1995 revenues due to their start-up growth and the Company's
investments in their marketing since 1993. EDSI, the Company's majority-owned
joint venture, experienced 45% growth in revenues during 1996 as compared with
1995 due to the increased acceptance of EDSI's Expose' product line by ADSI's
national distribution network and the 1996 introduction of EDSI's Expose' LS
(laminate system) into the marketplace.

Sales,  continued

The $4.6 million revenue increase experienced by the Permanent and scenic
displays group during 1996 as compared with 1995 revenues was primarily due to
the April 1996 acquisition of Piper Productions in Orlando, Florida. The Piper
operations generated approximately 75% of the 1996 revenues for the Permanent
and scenic displays group, the balance generated by the Museum sales group whose
sales were 41% higher during 1996 than its 1995 sales level.

Operating Profits

The Company recorded an 82% (approximately, $600,000) increase in operating
profits during 1996 as compared with 1995. The 1996 gross profit percentage
decreased marginally from a 1995 gross profit percentage of 2.1% to 28.1% during
1996. This decrease was primarily due to the higher 1996 sales from the
Permanent and scenic displays group which historically generate lower gross
margins than the Trade show exhibits group. The 1996 selling costs, $1.7 million
higher as compared with the same period during 1995, were attributed primarily
to sales commissions on the higher revenues and increased sales and marketing
costs in connection with the development of the Company's three-year strategic
marketing plan initiated in 1997. However, as a percentage of sales, selling
costs were approximately 0.5% lower during 1996 as compared with 1995. General
and administrative costs, as a percentage of sales, decreased approximately 1.3%
during 1996 as compared with 1995. The higher sales levels and related gross
profits more than offset the increased selling and general and administrative
costs, contributing to the $600,000 increase in 1996 operating profits as
compared with 1995 operating profits.

Operating profits related to the Expose' product during 1996 were consistent
with 1995 operating profits. While there was a 45% increase in 1996 revenues
over 1995 revenues, EDSI's operating profit margin decreased 2.1% in 1996 as
compared with 1995. Pursuant to the July 1993 agreement with ADSI, the minority
partner in EDSI, contractual cost allocations from ADSI to EDSI increased as
sales from the Expose' products became a larger percentage of ADSI's overall
sales to its distribution network. Accordingly, while EDSI sales increased, so
did the allocated fixed, selling and administrative costs; this had a direct
impact on EDSI's 1996 operating results. Additionally, EDSI incurred higher
expenses during 1996 in connection with the introduction of its newest product
line, Expose' LS.

During the fourth quarter of 1996, management closed the two stand-alone
Portable sales offices due to their consistently marginal returns and the fixed
costs associated with maintaining separate showrooms away from the Company's
manufacturing facilities.

<PAGE>


Other Income (Expense):

Other income increased by approximately $1,368,000 during 1996 as compared with
1995. This increase is attributed to the $1,200,000 gain the Company recorded
during 1996 in connection with the contractual amendment more fully described in
Note 4 to the consolidated statements. Net interest income improved by $124,000
during 1996 as compared with 1995 due to larger cash reserves available for
investment. Other items generated a $46,000 positive swing during 1996 as
compared with 1995 other items.

Income Taxes:

The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes,
increased to 13% during 1996. The provision incorporates federal, state and
local income taxes of approximately $350,000 as compared with an income tax
benefit of $538,000 during 1995. This increase was due to higher 1996 taxable
income and a smaller effective tax rate benefit resulting from the release of
valuation allowances.

Net Income:

During 1996, net income increased to $2,340,000 ($.45 per diluted share) as
compared with 1995 net income of $1,253,000 ($.32 per diluted share). The
dramatic increase, however, is partially attributable to the 1996 gain from the
contractual amendment of $1,200,000. Exclusive of the effects of this gain,
earnings per diluted share for 1996 increased 70%, or $.07 per share ($0.17
during 1996 as compared with $0.10 during 1995) as follows:

                                                     1996             1995

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    During 1997, the Company increased its cash reserves by $2,285,830,
exclusive of the $1,529,260 of cash transferred to the Company as part of the
December 31,1997 acquisition of DMS. As a result of the record sales levels
achieved during 1997 and the increased backlog of orders not yet delivered as of
December 31, 1997, the Company increased its accounts receivable and inventory
balances by approximately $5.9 million, exclusive of the $ 4.9 million of
DMS-acquired trade receivables and inventory. This increase, however, was offset
by a $7.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, net of $1.9
million of DMS-acquired accounts payable and accrued expenses. This increase in
accounts payable and accrued expenses, exclusive of the DMS-related current
liabilities, primarily relates to the $5.4 million increase in customer deposits
collected against contracts not completed as of December 31, 1997 as compared
with customer deposit balances as of December 31, 1996. Other current assets,
exclusive of $558,000 acquired as part of the DMS acquisition, increased
approximately $327,000 predominantly due to increases in prepaid expense
balances as of December 31, 1997 as compared with December 31, 1996 balances.

     The Company spent approximately $1.3 million for capital assets during
1997, net of $161,000 of property and equipment acquired in the DMS acquisition.
These expenditures included $391,000 for machinery, equipment, leasehold
improvements, furniture, fixtures and other office equipment. Additionally, the
Company invested approximately $400,000 for revenue-producing rental property
and equipment and approximately $100,000 to upgrade its Computerized Assisted
Design ("CAD") equipment. The Company is currently installing a new management
information system ("MIS") to replace its existing computerized business system
during 1998. As part of that investment, the Company expended approximately 
$400,000 during 1997 for hardware systems, consulting, site preparation and
training toward the installation of new technology.

During 1997, the Company did not borrow against its revolving credit facility to
support the higher trade receivables and inventory levels, as well as the
capital investments it required during the year. Additionally during 1997, the
Company repaid approximately $623,000 of bank term debt and $75,000 of
scheduled principal payments to various sellers of businesses acquired by the
Company prior to 1997. During 1997, the Sellers of Sparks exchanged $283,877 of
convertible term notes into 206,456 shares of the Company's common stock (see
Note 2).

    The December 31, 1997 acquisition of DMS (see Note 2) by the Company
significantly impacted the balance sheet ratios from a historically-comparative
perspective. The addition of approximately $17.0 million of intangible assets
(goodwill and other assets) and $13.5 million of new term debt related to the
Acquisition greatly increased the Company's leverage ratio of debt to net worth
as well as the current ratio (current assets/current liabilities). Accordingly,
comparative information to December 31, 1996 ratios are not meaningful and is,
therefore, not presented in this discussion. As of December 31, 1997, the
Company maintained a current ratio of 1.7 to 1.0 and a debt to net worth ratio
of 1.26 to 1.00. The Company was in compliance with all lending institution
covenants (see Note 10) as of December 31, 1997 and no amounts were outstanding
on the $6.5 million revolving credit facility.

OUTLOOK

The record sales volume of $48.7 million greatly contributed to the higher
operating profits the Company experienced during 1997. The Company expects
continued sales growth from its Tradeshow exhibits group and Permanent and
scenic displays group during 1998. Sales growth is expected in all four of the
Company's manufacturing facilities in Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Diego and
Orlando. The expected continuing expansion of the Company's Western region has
created the need for a significantly larger facility in San Diego county.
Accordingly, the Company is currently negotiating a lease for another sales and
production facility, within the San Diego area, to be used as a low-cost
producer of tradeshow and permanent exhibitry, in addition to being a major
storage facility for client exhibit properties.

   The Company's historic overall gross profit percentages may be difficult to
maintain in light of the expected increase in 1998 sales volume from the Museum
and production group, the Rental group and Piper, whose historic margins fall
below traditional custom exhibit margins. Additionally, the Company's core
business client base of Fortune 1000 companies, as well as Pacific Rim clients,
are more tightly managing their marketing budgets which could negatively impact
the Company's historic custom exhibit margins. The expected higher revenues and
gross profit dollars from the Trade show exhibits group and the Permanent and
scenic displays group should enhance the Company's 1998 operating profits by
aiding the Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Diego and Orlando facilities to generate
more consistent operating efficiencies.

The Company and ADSI are negotiating the exchange of the Company's 51% majority
interest in EDSI, forgiveness of $1.1 million of inter-company debt plus
approximately $200,000 of cash, for a 25% interest in ADSI. Should this
transaction be completed, the Company's investment in ADSI will be accounted for
using the equity method, with the Company no longer consolidating EDSI's
revenues and expenses within its operating results. The Company will only
recognize its pro-rata portion, 25%, of ADSI's operating results within its
statement of operations.

The Company is continuing its project of replacing existing management
information systems hardware and software with state-of-the-art technology
positioning the organization to effectively meet the changing environment of
information processing among its clients and suppliers as well as year 2000
issues. Additionally, the new technology should increase operating efficiencies
between the Company's four regional manufacturing facilities as information is
processed and managed more seamlessly. The Company now maintains a formal
Management Information System ("MIS") Department staffed with two experienced
professionals who are responsible to guide the Company in its acquisition and
utilization of new hardware and software technology. The Company believes this
necessary investment in technology, approximating $1.1 million during 1997 and
1998, will assist it in minimizing the need for additional administrative
personnel as its sales growth continues.

Again, management is encouraged by the Company's overall performance during 1997
and realizes certain areas will continue to require additional attention and
resources during 1998. While the Company's West Coast operation continues to
build upon its progress from 1996 and 1997, the Company will seek additional
account executives for the Western region to enhance the possibility of positive
trends in sales and operating profits during 1998 and beyond. Conversely, the
Atlanta operation continues to perform below expectations. While management



                                       16

OUTLOOK, continued

remains encouraged by the contributions of the Rental group in the Atlanta
facility during 1997, the Company's core custom exhibits group continues to
suffer from an insufficient Atlanta client base to support the fixed costs of
that operation, becoming increasingly dependent upon the transfer of custom
exhibit work from the Philadelphia, San Diego and Orlando facilities. The
Company will continue its search for experienced sales executives with an
existing base of custom exhibit clients to contribute the additional sales
volume which will assist in stabilizing the Atlanta operation.

Sparks Japan did not significantly impact 1997 operating margins through the
limited production by EDSI of certain exhibit products for Sparks Japan clients.
However, portable / modular exhibit sales in the Japan marketplace remain
relatively new, requiring significant time and effort to introduce these
products to Japanese exhibitors who have traditionally built and scrapped their
exhibits for each trade show. Portable / modular exhibits, successfully marketed
in the United States, can provide the Japanese exhibitor a large assortment of
design capabilities while simultaneously offering reconfigurability and
reusability for their future trade shows. Additionally, these exhibits provide
the Japanese exhibitor an alternative to the environmentally-unfriendly practice
of exhibit disposal. Any increase in Sparks Japan sales volume should benefit
the sales volume of EDSI and ADSI since Sparks Japan features the Expose' and
Exposure (ADSI's proprietary exhibit product) product lines in most of its sales
efforts.

The December 31, 1997 acquisition of DMS (see Note 2) has significantly impacted
the Company's balance sheet as of the acquisition date and will significantly
impact the Company's future results of operations. The acquisition of DMS will
further expand the Company's range of exhibit and display products, contributing
toward its objective of becoming a world-class leader in dimensional marketing
services. The competency and experience of the DMS management group should
provide the Company a firm base to expand the DMS business within an extremely
fragmented industry without needing significant additions to its management
structure. DMS' operating history of over 50 years and their long-term customer
relationships (one of DMS' two largest customers has purchased product from DMS
for over 40 years) should contribute to the Company a relatively consistent
stream of revenues, cash flow and profitability, which should translate into
higher shareholder value.

By meeting the challenges outlined above, maintaining the highest standards for
product quality and customer service, and, aggressively seeking acquisition
possibilities within industries that meet management's financial and synergistic
requirements, the Company will be positioned to take advantage of future
opportunities.

YEAR 2000 DATE CONVERSIONS

The Company's management information system department is currently replacing
its computer systems and applications necessary to position the Company to meet
the changing environment of information processing including meeting year 2000
date conversion with no material effect on customers or disruption to business
operations. These actions are necessary to ensure that the systems and
applications will recognize and process the year 2000 and beyond. Major areas of
potential business impact have been identified and conversion efforts are
underway. It is expected that the total cost of compliance over the cost of
normal software and hardware upgrades/replacements will not be material to the
Company's results of operations.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Effective January 1, 1998 the Company will adopt the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income".
SFAS 130 establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income
and its components in the financial statements. Reclassification of financial
statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes is required.
The Company is in the process of determining its preferred format. The adoption
of SFAS 130 will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 131, "Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information" effective with the financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 1998. SFAS 131 establishes standards
for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating
segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises
report selected information about operating segments in interim financial
reports issued to stockholders. It also establishes standards for related
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers.
Financial statement disclosures for prior periods are required to be restated.
The Company is in the process of evaluating the disclosure requirements. The
adoption of SFAS 131 will not have a material impact on the Company's
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS



The Board of Directors
 and Shareholders
Marlton Technologies, Inc.:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule of Marlton Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries as listed in
Item 14(a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) on page 20 of this Form 10-K. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Marlton
Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information required to be included therein.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.       Summary of Accounting Policies:

                  Basis of Presentation:

                  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
         Marlton Technologies, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority
         owned subsidiary (the "Company"). All inter-company accounts and
         transactions have been eliminated.

                  Activity included in the consolidated statements of operations
         consists primarily of the design, manufacture, sale and servicing of
         sophisticated custom and portable trade show exhibits and museum
         interiors and the manufacturing of panelized portable exhibits, themed
         interiors, theme park attractions, staging and sets.

                  On December 31, 1997, the Company acquired the assets and
         liabilities of DMS Store Fixtures, L.P. ("LP") through its
         newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary DMS Store Fixtures Corp. ("DMS"),
         a supplier of custom store fixtures and displays to national retailers,
         department stores and consumer product manufacturers. Accordingly, no
         activity from the operations of DMS are included in the results of
         operations of the Company for any periods presented. However, the
         acquired assets and liabilities of DMS are recorded at their estimated
         fair value with the excess purchase price and related costs of
         acquisition recorded as goodwill at December 31, 1997 (see Note 2).

                  Cash and Cash Equivalents:

                  For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company
         considers all investments with an initial maturity of three months or
         less at the time of their purchase to be cash equivalents. Temporary
         cash investments comprise principally short-term government funds. At
         various times throughout the year the Company maintained cash balances
         in excess of FDIC limits.

                  Inventory:

                  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
         first-out) or market.

                  Property and Equipment:

                  Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
         provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
         the respective assets ranging primarily from 3 to 10 years. Assets and
         accumulated depreciation accounts are reduced for the sale or other
         disposition of property and the resulting gain or loss is included in
         income.

                  Rental Assets:

                  Rental assets, which include manufactured and purchased
         exhibit components, are stated at cost. Depreciation is recorded on a
         usage basis, primarily over 1 to 3 years.

                  Long-Lived Assets

                  The Company's policy is to record an impairment loss against
         long-lived assets, including property and equipment, goodwill and other
         intangibles in the period when it is determined that the carrying
         amount of such assets may not be recoverable. This determination
         includes evaluation of factors such as current market value, future
         asset utilization, business climate and future undiscounted cash flows
         expected to result from the use of the net assets.

                  The excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired
         (goodwill) is amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging
         from 5 to 30 years. Customer lists, which are recorded at cost, are
         amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of
         5 to 15 years and are included as components of Other Assets. Also
         included in Other Assets are debt issue costs, deposits relating to
         certain facility leases and the long-term portion of certain prepaid
         expenses.


                  Revenue Recognition:

                  Revenues on trade show exhibit sales and themed interiors and
         sets are recognized using the completed contract method. Revenues on
         permanent exhibit installations which are generally six months or
         longer in duration are recognized on the percentage of completion
         method. Progress billings are generally made throughout the production
         process. Progress billings which are unpaid at the balance sheet date
         are not recognized in the financial statements as accounts receivable.
         Progress billings which have been collected on or before the balance
         sheet date are classified as customer deposits and are included as
         components of Accrued expenses and other.

1.         Summary of Accounting Policies, continued:

                  Income Taxes

                  The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities
based upon the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are calculated based on the difference between the financial and tax
bases of assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates in effect
during the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.

                  Use of Estimates:

                  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

                  Concentration of Credit Risk:

         The Company's financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts
receivable. The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments with high
credit quality institutions.

         The Company's accounts receivable are with customers throughout the
United States and international. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations
of its customers' financial condition and generally requires progress payments
which mitigate its loss exposure.

         Two major retailers comprise the majority of DMS' customer base. While
DMS is affected by the well-being of the retail industry and its major
customers, management does not believe significant credit risks exist with
respect to its trade receivables.

         Fair Value of Financial Instruments

         Financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents and
long-term debt. The recorded values of cash and cash equivalents approximate
their fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value
of long-term debt is estimated based on current interest rates offered to the
Company for similar remaining maturities. The recorded value of these financial
instruments approximate their fair value at December 31, 1997 and 1996.

                  Per Share Data

                  Basic net income per common share is calculated using the
         average shares of common stock outstanding, while diluted net income
         per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
         stock options were exercised. Prior periods have been restated in
         accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 128
         "Earnings Per Share.". Restated diluted net income per common share
         amounts do not differ materially from previously reported primary net
         income per common share amounts.

                  Recently Issued Accounting Standards

                  Effective January 1, 1998 the Company will adopt the
         provisions of SFAS 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income." SFAS 130
         establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income
         and its components in the financial statements. Reclassification of
         financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative
         purposes is required. The Company is in the process of determining its
         preferred format. The adoption of SFAS 130 will not have a material
         impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial
         position or cash flows.

                  The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 131,
         "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information"
         effective with the financial statements for the year ended December 31,
         1998. SFAS 131 establishes standards for the way that public business
         enterprises report information about operating segments in annual
         financial statements and requires that those enterprises report
         selected information about operating segments in interim financial
         reports issued to stockholders. It also establishes standards for
         related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and
         major customers. Financial statement disclosures for prior periods are
         required to be restated. The Company is in the process of evaluating
         the disclosure requirement. The adoption of SFAS 131 will not have a
         material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations,
         financial position or cash flows.

2.       Acquisitions:

                  DMS Stores Fixtures, Inc.:

         On December 31, 1997, the Company acquired the assets and liabilities
         of LP, a supplier of custom made store fixtures and displays to
         national retailers, department stores and consumer product
         manufacturers. Total consideration paid by the Company for LP, was
         $13.5 million in cash and an additional $1.0 million of cash held in
         escrow until the December 31, 1997 guaranteed net worth of $5.5 million
         in LP was verified and released by Company management during February
         1998. Additionally, the Company issued 2 million unregistered shares of
         its common stock, with an additional 250,000 shares contingent upon DMS
         achieving at least $12.5 million in cumulative pre-tax earnings through
         December 31, 2002. As part of this acquisition, the Company entered
         into five year employment agreements with the three principals of LP,
         one of which, is the father of the Company's Chief Executive Officer
         providing minimum annual base salaries ranging from $125,000 to
         $250,000. One individual is eligible to receive an annual bonus up to a
         maximum of $250,000 per year during the term of his five year
         employment agreement based on the after-bonus, pre-tax earnings of DMS.
         The Company will maintain key man life insurance of $2.0 million on one
         of the individuals and a $2.0 million "second-to-die" policy on the
         remaining two individuals. The Company incurred fees of approximately
         $860,000 as part of the Acquisition, including approximately $214,000
         for the value of 162,500 warrants for the Company's common stock which
         were issued to the Company's financial advisor and lending institution.
         The value of the warrants issued to the lending institution,
         approximating $82,000, is included as a component of Other assets and
         will be amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the
         Company's loan agreement, five years, commencing January 1, 1998.

                  The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase
         method of accounting. The excess cost, including related costs of the
         transaction, over the net assets acquired, amounting to approximately
         $16.9 million on a preliminarily allocated basis, will be amortized on
         a straight-line basis over a period of 30 years commencing January
         1998.

                  The following table summarizes the unaudited consolidated pro
         forma information assuming the acquisition occurred at the beginning of
         each of the following periods. The pro forma effect of the Piper
         acquisition is not material and, accordingly, has been excluded from
         the pro forma presentation.

           Diluted                               7,634,000         7,246,000

         Net income per common share:

           Diluted                                $.37               $.49


                  Pro forma net income presented for 1997 and 1996 include two
         significant non-recurring items. Prior to LP being acquired by the
         Company, it charged $792,000 against its 1997 earnings for the value of
         stock compensation paid to certain LP employees. During 1996, the
         Company recorded a $1.2 million gain from a contractual amendment.
         Exclusive of the after-tax effect of these two significant
         non-recurring items during 1997 and 1996, pro forma net income for the
         respective period was $3,418,000 ($.45 per diluted common share) and
         $2,484,000 ($.34 per diluted common share).

                  The pro forma consolidated results of operations include
         adjustments to give effect to amortization of goodwill, interest
         expense on acquisition debt and certain other adjustments, together
         with related income tax effects. The unaudited pro forma information is
         not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have
         occurred had the purchase been made at the beginning of the periods
         presented or the future results of the combined operations.

                  Piper Productions, Inc.:

                  The Company acquired 100% of the stock of Piper Productions,
         Inc. ("Piper") of Orlando, Florida, effective April 1, 1996. Total
         consideration paid for Piper, including related expenses, approximated
         $200,000. The Company made a cash payment of $50,000 at closing, and
         issued a $100,000 note bearing interest at 6% payable in 5 equal annual
         installments which commenced on April 1, 1997. Up to $200,000 in

2.       Acquisitions, continued:

         additional consideration is payable should Piper achieve defined sales
         levels through 2001.

                  The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase with the
         operating results of Piper included in the consolidated statement of
         income from the acquisition date. Accordingly, the acquired assets and
         liabilities have been recorded at their estimated fair values at the
         date of acquisition.


                           Sparks Exhibits Corp.:

                  In August, 1990, the Company acquired Arrow Exhibits, Inc. 
         ("Arrow") and transferred the operations to its newly formed 
         subsidiary, Sparks Exhibits Corp. ("Sparks").

                  The Agreement provided for certain additional consideration to
         be paid to the Sellers based on defined operating results of Sparks
         through December 31, 1994. During 1995 the Company paid $478,618 as
         additional consideration. The final cumulative contingent earn-out
         obligation to the Sellers of $333,972 payable in August 7, 1995 was
         satisfied by a cash payment of $50,095 and issuance of three two-year
         notes totaling $283,877 bearing interest at 8%, payable quarterly and
         convertible to the Company 's common stock at $1.375 per share. The
         Sellers converted their two-year notes into the Company's common stock
         during January 1997. All additional consideration paid to the Sellers
         has been recorded as goodwill.


                  Expose Display Systems, Inc.:

                  During July 1993, the Company and Abex Display Systems, Inc.
         ("ADSI"), entered into an agreement to organize a new California
         corporation, Expose Display Systems, Inc. ("EDSI"). The Company
         acquired 51% of EDSI with ADSI acquiring the balance. EDSI granted to
         ADSI exclusive worldwide distribution and marketing rights for
         "Expose", a portable display product, through December 2005 contingent
         upon ADSI meeting defined sales levels.

                  EDSI sales, net of inter-company revenues, for 1997, 1996 and
         1995 approximated $4.7 million, $3.1 million and $2.1 million,
         respectively. As of December 31, 1997 and 1996 $253,000 and $120,000,
         respectively, was owed to ADSI by EDSI.

3.        Net Income per Common Share:

         Income per share amounts have been restated in accordance with SFAS
         128, "Earnings Per Share." This restatement did not result in a
         material change between diluted per common share amounts and previously
         reported primary per common share amounts.

         The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net
         income per common share (in thousands):

Options and warrants to purchase 190,000 shares of common stock at prices
ranging from $5.00 per share to $7.00 per share were outstanding at December 31,
1997, but were not included in the computation of diluted income per common
share because the option's and warrant's exercise price was greater than the
average market price of the common shares.

4.        Gain on Japan Transaction:

         The Company and Tsubasa System Company, Ltd. ("Tsubasa") a diversified
manufacturing and marketing company entered into a distribution and license
agreement during 1995 and jointly formed a Japanese corporation, Sparks Japan,
to market portable exhibits in Japan. Sparks Japan was capitalized with 
$250,000, 90% owned by Tsubasa and 10% owned by the Company. In an amendment to 
that agreement during January 1996, the Company agreed to eliminate certain 
future payments from Sparks Japan and to issue to Tsubasa 500,000 unregistered 
shares of the Company's common stock in exchange for $3,000,000 and a commitment
from the Company to provide requisite technical, operational and marketing 
support

to the operation. The agreement also requires that the funds received by the
Company are to be used only for its operating activities and to acquire
companies, products and services within the exhibit industry, unless prior
approval is obtained from Tsubasa.

         In the event that Sparks Japan does not achieve certain sales levels by
December 31, 1998 and the Company's common stock is trading at less than $3.00
per share at that time, if requested by Tsubasa, the Company is required to, at
its option, either repurchase the Tsubasa shares at $3.00 per share or make a
cash payment per share to Tsubasa equal to the difference between the December
31, 1998 trading price and $3.00.

         A gain of $1,000,000 was recognized in 1996 representing the
consideration received less amounts allocated to the 500,000 shares of common
stock issued, the "put option" and the incremental direct costs expected to be
incurred by the Company with respect to complying with certain requirements of
the agreement. During the fourth quarter of 1996, management re-evaluated the
put option and expected direct costs, resulting in a $200,000 increase to the
recorded gain during 1996. Included in Accrued expenses and other at December
31, 1997 and 1996 are accrued contractual costs of $467,409 and $713,299,
respectively.


5.       Cash Flows Information:

Cash paid for interest in 1997, 1996 and 1995 amounted to $28,053, $121,049, and
$140,206, respectively.

Cash paid for income taxes in 1997, 1996 and 1995 amounted to $61,170, $30,398
and $9,509, respectively.

Cash paid for the acquisition of LP was calculated as follows:

10.      Debt Obligations:

         Notes Payable:

         The Company, in connection with the December 31, 1997 acquisition of
LP, entered into a $13.5 million five-year term loan and a $6.5 million
five-year revolving credit facility with a lending institution, both
collateralized by all of the Company's assets. Borrowings under the term loan
and revolving credit facility bear interest at rates equal to adjusted LIBOR
plus applicable spreads ranging from 75 to 100 basis points. The applicable
spreads are dependent upon the Company's debt to capitalization ratio, measured
on a quarterly basis. A final payment is due during 2002 provided the Company
has not fully repaid the term loan due to contractually-required prepayments
equal to 50% of defined excess cash flow, applied in the inverse order of the
installments' due date.

           Both the term loan and revolving credit facility include, among other
things, certain financial covenants requiring the maintenance of certain minimum
financial ratios and restricts the Company's ability to pay dividends. No
amounts under the revolving credit facility were outstanding as of December 31,
1997. The Company is subject to an annual commitment fee of 75 basis points on
the average annual unused portion of the revolving credit facility, payable in
arrears, commencing January, 1999.

         Option Plan ("1984 Plan"). The plan provides for the granting of

         employees, directors and others to purchase, for a period of five
         years, a maximum of 65,900 common shares at prices and terms determined

         shares to directors and consultants who are neither principal
         stockholders, nor receive salary compensation. Prices are determined as
         in the Nonqualified Stock Option Plan.

                  The 1992 Director Stock Plan (as amended through July
         1996)("1992 Plan"), with a total of 200,000 authorized shares, was

         stock options may be granted to Directors at a price not less than
         market value on the date of the grant.

12.         Warrants and Stock Options, continued

                  The Company has adopted the disclosure -only provisions of
         SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-based Compensation." The Company will
         continue to apply the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
         25 in accounting for its stock option plans. If the Company had elected
         to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of the options
         granted at grant date as prescribed by SFAS 123, net income and diluted
         income per common share would have been reduced to the pro forma
         amounts as follows:

                                          Year ended December 31,
                                               1997         1996        1995

                  The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date
         of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Assumptions
         used to calculate the fair value of option grants in 1997, 1996 and
         1995 include the following:

13.      Employee Benefit Plans:

                  The Company maintains a defined contribution savings plan
         under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code which provides
         retirement benefits to certain employees of the Company and its
         wholly-owned subsidiaries who meet certain age and length of service
         requirements. The Company's contribution to the Plan is determined by
         management. Charges to income, as determined by the market value of
         Company stock when contributed, with respect to this Plan were
         approximately $55,000, $50,000 and $32,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
         respectively.

                                                     ----------   ------------
                Net deferred tax asset              $1,582,000     $1,978,000
                                                    ==========    ===========

         The decrease in the valuation allowance in 1996 resulted from the
         release of valuation allowance based on the re-evaluation of the
         realizability of future benefits of net operating loss carryforwards.

         During the fourth quarter of 1997, as a result of the acquisition of
         DMS, the Company reassessed its ability to utilize its general business
         credit carryforwards which expire primarily in 1998. Based on this
         reassessment, a benefit of approximately $350,000 was recognized
         related to release of valuation allowance and approximately $450,000 of
         gross deferred tax asset and valuation allowance were written off.

         Realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent upon generating
         sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the net operating loss
         carryfowards (NOL's) and general business credits. Although realization
         is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the
         recorded net deferred tax asset will be realized.

                As of December 31, 1997, the Company had federal NOL's of
         approximately $843,000, expiring through 2008 and general business 
         carryforwards of approximately $1,406,000 which expire primarily in 
         1998.

                           MARLTON TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
                        INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

        THIS STOCK OPTION (the "Option") is granted this 23rd day of May, 1997,
by MARLTON TECHNOLOGIES, INC., a New Jersey corporation (the "Company") to
ROBERT B. GINSBURG (the "Optionee").

                              W I T N E S S E T H ;

        1. Grant. Pursuant to the Company's 1990 Incentive Stock Option Plan
(the "Plan"), the Company hereby grants to the Optionee Incentive Stock Options
(the "Options") to purchase on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth an
aggregate of Twenty Thousand (20,000) shares of the Company's Common Stock, par
value, $.10 per share (the "Option Shares"), at the purchase price of $3.375 per
share (the "Option Price"), subject to adjustment as provided in Paragraph 5.
Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Plan.

        2. Term. This Option Agreement and Optionee's right to acquire Options
vested in accordance with Paragraph 3 shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. (local
Philadelphia time) on April 30, 2007, notwithstanding the earlier death, Total
Disability or termination of employment of the Optionee.

        3. Vesting. (a) The Options will vest (all such Options upon vesting
shall constitute Accrued Installments under the Plan) on the basis of the
following criteria:

               Options to purchase 1,667 Option Shares will vest each month
        (with respect to the first and last months hereunder 15 or more days of
        employment in a month shall be deemed a full month, and less than 15
        days of employment in a month shall be deemed no employment during such
        month) commencing June 1, 1997 that Optionee continues in the employment
        of the Company, provided the aggregate of the vested Option Shares
        pursuant to this subparagraph does not exceed 20,000.

               (b) All Options will vest immediately in their entirety in the
event Optionee is terminated without cause by the Company. Options will continue
to vest for a period of twelve months (pro-rated for partial years) after
termination of employment of Optionee due to death or Total Disability. Any such
vested Options of the deceased Optionee may be exercised prior to their
expiration only by the person or persons to whom the Optionee's Option rights
pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

        4. Method of Exercise and Payment. This Option may be exercised with
respect to vested Option Shares from time to time, in whole or in part. When
exercisable under Paragraph 3, the Option may be exercised by written notice to
the Company specifying the total number of Option Shares to be exercised. The
notice shall be accompanied by payment in cash or by check equal to the


                                       54

aggregate Option Price of all Option Shares covered by such notice, or Optionee
may elect to pay for some or all of the Option Shares with shares of Common
Stock of the Company previously acquired and owned by Optionee at the time of
exercise of this Option, in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.06(b) of
the Plan. Such exercise shall be effective upon the actual receipt by the
Company of such written notice and payment.

        5. Adjustments. The Option Shares and the Option Price are subject to
adjustment as provided in Section 6.09 of the Plan. The Option Price will also
be adjusted in the event shares, or options to acquire shares, of Common Stock
are issued after the date of this Option Agreement to officers or directors of
the Company at a price (or, in the case of options, having an exercise price)
lower than the Option Price. In such event, the Option Price will be adjusted to
equal the purchase price of such shares or the exercise price of such options,
as the case may be, but in no event will the Option Price be less than the Fair
Market Value of shares of the Company's Common Stock on the date of this Option
Agreement unless Optionee elects in writing to have this Option Agreement
treated as a Non-Qualified Option under the Plan.

        6. Notices. Any notice to be given to the Company shall be addressed to
the Company at its principal executive office, and any notice to be given to the
Optionee shall be addressed to the Optionee at the address then appearing on the
personnel records of the Company or at such other address as either party
hereafter may designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be deemed
to have been duly given when deposited in the United States mail, addressed as
aforesaid, registered or certified mail, and with proper postage and
registration or certification fees prepaid.

        7. Tax Provision. This Option Agreement shall be interpreted and
construed in a manner consistent with, and to satisfy the requirements of, the
incentive stock option provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as it
may be amended from time to time (the "Code") and of the Plan. This Option
Agreement is intended to satisfy the requirements of the Plan, Section 422A(b)
of the Code and qualify for special tax treatment under Section 421 et seq of
the Code.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has granted this Option on the day and
year first above written.

                  THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT is made as of this 31st day of
December, 1997 by and between Lawrence Schan, a resident of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania (the "Employee"), and DMS Store Fixtures Corp., a corporation
formerly known as DMS Acquisition Corporation and organized and existing under
the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Company").

                  WHEREAS, the Company is engaged in the business of designing,
producing and marketing store fixtures and displays (the "Business").

                  WHEREAS, the Company desires to employ Employee and Employee
desires to be employed by the Company for a period of time in the future upon
the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

                  WHEREAS, Employee possesses significant knowledge of the
Business, which knowledge the Company and Employee both desire to be available
to the Company for a period of time in the future upon the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth.

                  WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Employee in connection with the consummation of the acquisition by the Company
of DMS Store Fixtures, L.P. is a material inducement to the Company's agreement
to consummate such acquisition.

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
obligations contained herein, and intending to be legally bound, the parties,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, agree as follows:

I. Employment and Term. The Company hereby employs Employee and Employee hereby
accepts employment with the Company, as President and Chief Operating Officer
(such position, Employee's "Position") for a period commencing on the date
hereof and continuing for a period of five (5) years, subject to the provisions
of Section 9 hereof (the "Term").

I. Duties. During the term of his employment, Employee shall serve the Company
faithfully and to the best of his ability and shall devote his full time,
attention, skill and efforts to the performance of the duties required by or
appropriate for his Position. Employee agrees to assume such duties and
responsibilities commensurate with his position and consistent with Employee's
historic duties. Employee shall report to the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company.

I. Other Business Activities. During the Term, Employee will not, without the
prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly engage in any other
business activities or pursuits whatsoever, except activities in connection with
any charitable or civic activities, personal investments and serving as an


                                       61

<PAGE>


executor, trustee or in other similar fiduciary capacity; provided, however,
that such activities do not interfere with his performance of his
responsibilities and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

I. Compensation. The Company shall pay Employee, and Employee hereby agrees to
accept, as compensation for all services rendered hereunder and for Employee's
covenant not to compete as provided for in Section 8 hereof, an initial base
salary at the annual rate of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (as
the same may hereafter be increased, the "Base Salary"). The Base Salary shall
be inclusive of all applicable income, social security and other taxes and
charges which are required by law to be withheld by the Company or which are
requested to be withheld by Employee, and which shall be withheld and paid in
accordance with the Company's normal payroll practice for its similarly situated
employees from time to time in effect. In addition to the Base Salary, the
Company shall pay Employee a bonus (the "Bonus") as set forth on Schedule A.

I. Benefits. Employee shall be entitled to those employee benefits which the
Company from time to time generally makes available to its employees
("Benefits").

I. Confidentiality. Employee recognizes and acknowledges that the Proprietary
Information (as hereinafter defined) is a valuable, special and unique asset of
the Business of the Company. As a result, both during the Term and thereafter,
Employee shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, for any
reason either directly or indirectly divulge to any third-party or use for his
own benefit, or for any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of the Company,
any confidential, proprietary, business and technical information or trade
secrets of the Company or of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company
("Proprietary Information") revealed, obtained or developed in the course of his
employment with the Company. Such Proprietary Information shall include, but
shall not be limited to, the intangible personal property described in Section
7(b) hereof, any information relating to methods of production and manufacture,
research, computer codes or instructions (including source and object code
listings, program logic algorithms, subroutines, modules or other subparts of
computer programs and related documentation, including program notation),
computer processing systems and techniques, concepts, layouts, flowcharts,
specifications, know-how, any associated user or service manuals or other like
textual materials (including any other data and materials used in performing the
Employee's duties), all computer inputs and outputs (regardless of the media on
which stored or located), hardware and software configurations, designs,
architecture, interfaces, plans, sketches, blueprints, and any other materials
prepared by the Employee in the course of, relating to or arising out of his
engagement by the Company, or prepared by any other Company employee or
contractor for the Company or its customers, costs, business studies, business
procedures, finances, marketing data, methods, plans and efforts, the identities
of customers, contractors and suppliers and prospective customers, contractors
and suppliers, the terms of contracts and agreements with customers, contractors
and suppliers, the Company's relationship with actual and prospective customers,
contractors and suppliers and the needs and requirements of, and the Company's


                                       62
<PAGE>


course of dealing with, any such actual or prospective customers, contractors
and suppliers, personnel information, customer and vendor credit information,
and any other materials that have not been made available to the general public,
provided, that nothing herein contained shall restrict Employee's ability to
make such disclosures during the course of his employment as may be necessary or
appropriate to the effective and efficient discharge of the duties required by
or appropriate for his Position or as such disclosures may be required by law;
and further provided, that nothing herein contained shall restrict Employee from
divulging or using for his own benefit or for any other purpose any Proprietary
Information that is readily available to the general public so long as such
information did not become available to the general public as a direct or
indirect result of Employee's breach of this Section 6. Failure by the Company
to mark any of the Proprietary Information as confidential or proprietary shall
not affect its status as Proprietary Information under the terms of this
Agreement.

I. Property.

1. All right, title and interest in and to Proprietary Information shall be and
remain the sole and exclusive property of the Company. During the Term, Employee
shall not remove from the Company's offices or premises any documents, records,
notebooks, files, correspondence, reports, memoranda or similar materials of or
containing Proprietary Information, or other materials or property of any kind
belonging to the Company unless necessary or appropriate in accordance with the
duties and responsibilities required by or appropriate for his Position and, in
the event that such materials or property are removed, all of the foregoing
shall be returned to their proper files or places of safekeeping as promptly as
possible after the removal shall serve its specific purpose. Employee shall not
make, retain, remove and/or distribute any copies of any of the foregoing for
any reason whatsoever except as may be necessary in the discharge of his
assigned duties and shall not divulge to any third person the nature of and/or
contents of any of the foregoing or of any other oral or written information to
which he may have access or with which for any reason he may become familiar,
except as disclosure shall be necessary in the performance of his duties; and
upon the termination of his employment with the Company, he shall leave with or
return to the Company all originals and copies of the foregoing then in his
possession, whether prepared by Employee or by others.

a) Employee agrees that all right, title and interest in and to any innovations,
designs, systems, analyses, ideas for marketing programs, and all copyrights,
patents, trademarks and trade names, or similar intangible personal property
which have been or are developed or created in whole or in part by Employee (1)
at any time and at any place while the Employee is employed by Company and
which, in the case of any or all of the foregoing, are related to and used in
connection with the Business of the Company, (2) as a result of tasks assigned
to Employee by the Company, or (3) from the use of premises or personal property
(whether tangible or intangible) owned, leased or contracted for by the Company
(collectively, the "Intellectual Property"), shall be and remain forever the
sole and exclusive property of the Company. The Employee shall promptly disclose
to the Company all Intellectual Property, and the Employee shall have no claim
for additional compensation for the Intellectual Property.


                                       63
<PAGE>


a) The Employee acknowledges that all the Intellectual Property that is
copyrightable shall be considered a work made for hire under United States
Copyright Law. To the extent that any copyrightable Intellectual Property may
not be considered a work made for hire under the applicable provisions of the
United States Copyright Law, or to the extent that, notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions, the Employee may retain an interest in any Intellectual
Property that is not copyrightable, the Employee hereby irrevocably assigns and
transfers to the Company any and all right, title, or interest that the Employee
may have in the Intellectual Property under copyright, patent, trade secret and
trademark law, in perpetuity or for the longest period otherwise permitted by
law, without the necessity of further consideration. The Company shall be
entitled to obtain and hold in its own name all copyrights, patents, trade
secrets, and trademarks with respect thereto.

a) Employee further agrees to reveal promptly all information relating to the
same to an appropriate officer of the Company and to cooperate with the Company
and execute such documents as may be necessary or appropriate (1) in the event
that the Company desires to seek copyright, patent or trademark protection, or
other analogous protection, thereafter relating to the Intellectual Property,
and when such protection is obtained, to renew and restore the same, or (2) to
defend any opposition proceedings in respect of obtaining and maintaining such
copyright, patent or trademark protection, or other analogous protection.

a) In the event the Company is unable after reasonable effort to secure
Employee's signature on any of the documents referenced in Section 7(b)(iii)
hereof, whether because of Employee's physical or mental incapacity or for any
other reason whatsoever, Employee hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the
Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as Employee's agent and
attorney-in-fact, to act for and in his behalf and stead to execute and file any
such documents and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the
prosecution and issuance of any such copyright, patent or trademark protection,
or other analogous protection, with the same legal force and effect as if
executed by Employee.

I. Covenant not to Compete. The Employee shall not, during the Term and for a
period of two (2) years thereafter or, if longer, for a period of five (5) years
following the date hereof (such period the "Restricted Period"), do any of the
following directly or indirectly without the prior written consent of the
Company:

1. engage or participate in any business activity competitive with the Company's
Business, or the fixture, display or custom exhibit business of any of the
Company's subsidiaries or affiliates, as same are conducted during the Term with
respect to any period during the Term, or upon the termination of Employee's
employment hereunder;

1. become interested in (as owner, stockholder, lender, partner, co-venturer,
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or otherwise) any person, firm,


                                       64
<PAGE>

corporation, association or other entity engaged in any business that is
competitive with the Business of the Company or the fixture, display or custom
exhibit business of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company as conducted
during the Term with respect to any period during the Term, or upon the
termination of Employee's employment hereunder with respect to any period
thereafter, or become interested in (as owner, stockholder, lender, partner,
co-venturer, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or otherwise) any
portion of the business of any person, firm, corporation, association or other
entity where such portion of such business is competitive with the business of
the Company or the fixture, display or custom exhibit business of any subsidiary
or affiliate of the Company as conducted during the Term with respect to any
period during the Term, or upon termination of Employee's employment hereunder
with respect to any period thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee
may hold not more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding securities of any
class of any publicly-traded securities of a company that is engaged in
activities referenced in Section 8(a) hereof;

1. solicit or call on, either directly or indirectly, any (i) customer with whom
the Company shall have dealt at any time during the two (2) year period
immediately preceding the termination of Employee's employment hereunder; or
(ii) any supplier with whom the Company shall have dealt at any time during the
two (2) year period immediately preceding the termination of Employee's
employment hereunder;

1. influence or attempt to influence any supplier, customer or potential
customer of the Company to terminate or modify any written or oral agreement or
course of dealing with the Company; or

1. except in his capacity as an employee of the Company, influence or attempt to
influence any person to either (i) terminate or modify his employment,
consulting, agency, distributorship or other arrangement with the Company, or
(ii) employ or retain, or arrange to have any other person or entity employ or
retain, any person who has been employed or retained by the Company as an
employee, consultant, agent or distributor of the Company at any time during the
two (2) year period immediately preceding the termination of Employee's
employment hereunder.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, at the end of the five (5)
year employment period initially contemplated hereby, the Company does not offer
Employee a position with the Company at a comparable compensation package, the
Restricted Period shall be reduced to a period of one (1) year following the    
Term.

Term upon the occurrence of any one of the events described in this Section 9.
Upon termination, Employee shall be entitled only to such compensation and
benefits as described in this Section 9.

A. Termination for Absenteeism.

1. Regular attendance at work or conducting work is an essential element of the
job for which Employee has been hired. Without limiting the Company's right to
terminate Employee pursuant to Section 9.1 or 9.3 hereof, in the event that
Employee is absent from work for 60 consecutive days (other than for medical
reasons where Employee is reasonably expected to return to work within 120 days

employment hereunder may be terminated by the Company.

1. In the event of a termination of Employee's employment hereunder pursuant to
Section 9.1(a), Employee will be entitled to receive all accrued and unpaid (as

compensation and benefits payable or provided in accordance with the terms of
any then existing compensation or benefit plan or arrangement ("Other
Compensation"), including payment prescribed under and disability of life
insurance plan or arrangement in which he is a participant or to which he is a

Section 9.1(b), the Company shall have no liability or obligation to Employee
for compensation or benefits hereunder by reason of such termination.


                                       66
<PAGE>


A. Termination by Death. In the event that Employee dies during the Term,
Employee's employment hereunder shall be terminated thereby and the Company
shall pay to Employee's executors, legal representatives or administrators an
amount equal to the accrued and unpaid portion of his Base Salary and Other
Compensation for the month in which he dies. Except as specifically set forth in
this Section 9.2, the Company shall have no liability or obligation hereunder to
Employee's executors, legal representatives, administrators, heirs or assigns or
any other person claiming under or through him by reason of Employee's death,
except that Employee's executors, legal representatives or administrators will
be entitled to receive the payment prescribed under any death or disability
benefits plan in which he is a participant as an employee of the Company, and to
exercise any rights afforded under any compensation or benefit plan then in
effect.

A. Termination for Cause.

1. The Company may terminate Employee's employment hereunder at any time for
"cause" upon written notice to Employee. For purposes of this Agreement, "cause"
shall mean: (i) any breach by Employee of any of his obligations under Sections
6, 7 or 8 of this Agreement, (ii) material breach by Employee of Sections 2 or 3
of this Agreement which breach is not cured by Employee within thirty (30) days
after receipt of written notice thereof from the Company, or (iii) other conduct
of Employee involving any type of disloyalty to the Company or willful
misconduct with respect to the Company, including without limitation fraud,
embezzlement, theft or proven dishonesty in the course of his employment or
conviction of a felony.

1. In the event of a termination of Employee's employment hereunder pursuant to
Section 9.3(a), Employee shall be entitled to receive all accrued but unpaid (as
of the effective date of such termination) Base Salary and Benefits. All Base
Salary, Benefits and Other Compensation shall cease at the time of such
termination, subject to the terms of any benefit or compensation plan then in
force and applicable to Employee. Except as specifically set forth in this
Section 9.3, the Company shall have no liability or obligation hereunder by
reason of such termination.

I. Other Agreements. Employee represents and warrants to the Company that:

1. There are no restrictions, agreements or understandings whatsoever to which
Employee is a party which would prevent or make unlawful Employee's execution of
this Agreement or Employee's employment hereunder, or which is or would be
inconsistent or in conflict with this Agreement or Employee's employment
hereunder, or would prevent, limit or impair in any way the performance by
Employee of his obligations hereunder,

1. That Employee's execution of this Agreement and Employee's employment
hereunder shall not constitute a breach of any contract, agreement or


                                       67
<PAGE>

understanding, oral or written, to which Employee is a party or by which
Employee is bound, and

1. That Employee is free to execute this Agreement and to enter into the employ
of the Company pursuant to the provisions set forth herein.

1. That Employee shall disclose the existence and terms of the restrictive
covenants set forth in this Agreement to any employer that the Employee may work
for during the term of this Agreement (which employment is not hereby
authorized) or after the termination of the Employee's employment at the
Company.

I. Survival of Provisions. The provisions of this Agreement set forth in

I. Specific Enforcement; Extension of Period.

1. Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in Sections 6, 7, and 8

Company and its affiliates and that the Company would not have entered into this
Agreement in the absence of such restrictions. Employee also acknowledges that
any breach by him of Sections 6, 7, or 8 hereof will cause continuing and

<PAGE>

irreparable injury to the Company for which monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy. The Employee shall not, in any action or proceeding to enforce
any of the provisions of this Agreement, assert the claim or defense that an
adequate remedy at law exists. In the event of such breach by Employee, the
Company shall have the right to enforce the provisions of Sections 6, 7, and 8
of this Agreement by seeking injunctive or other relief in any court, and this
Agreement shall not in any way limit remedies of law or in equity otherwise
available to the Company. If an action at law or in equity is necessary to
enforce or interpret the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover, in addition to any other relief, reasonable attorneys'
fees, costs and disbursements. In the event that the provisions of Sections 6,
7, or 8 hereof should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, or
other limitations permitted by applicable law in any applicable jurisdiction,
then such provisions shall be deemed reformed in such jurisdiction to the
maximum time, geographic, or other limitations permitted by applicable law.

1. In the event that Employee shall be in breach of any of the restrictions
contained in Section 8 hereof, then the Restricted Period shall be extended for
a period of time equal to the period of time that Employee is in breach of such
restriction.

I. Consent to Suit. Any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be instituted in any federal or state court of general
jurisdiction in Pennsylvania, and the Employee hereby consents to the personal
and exclusive jurisdiction of such court and hereby waives any objection that
the Employee may have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding and any
claim or defense of inconvenient forum.

I. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same instrument.

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to
be executed the day and year first written above.

                  THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT is made as of this 31st day of
December, 1997 by and between Ira Ingerman, a resident of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania (the "Employee"), and DMS Store Fixtures Corp., a corporation
formerly known as DMS Acquisition Corporation and organized and existing under
the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Company").

                  WHEREAS, the Company is engaged in the business of designing,
producing and marketing store fixtures and displays (the "Business").

                  WHEREAS, the Company desires to employ Employee and Employee
desires to be employed by the Company for a period of time in the future upon
the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

                  WHEREAS, Employee possesses significant knowledge of the
Business, which knowledge the Company and Employee both desire to be available
to the Company for a period of time in the future upon the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth.

                  WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Employee in connection with the consummation of the acquisition by the Company
of DMS Store Fixtures, L.P. is a material inducement to the Company's agreement
to consummate such acquisition.

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
obligations contained herein, and intending to be legally bound, the parties,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, agree as follows:

I. Employment and Term. The Company hereby employs Employee and Employee hereby
accepts employment with the Company, as Co-Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
(such position, Employee's "Position") for a period commencing on the date
hereof and continuing for a period of five (5) years, subject to the provisions
of Section 9 hereof (the "Term").

I. Duties. During the term of his employment, Employee shall serve the Company
faithfully and to the best of his ability and shall devote such time, attention,
skill and efforts to the performance of the duties required by or appropriate
for his Position. Employee agrees to assume such duties and responsibilities
commensurate with his position and consistent with Employee's historic duties.
Employee shall report to the Chief Executive Officer of Marlton Technologies,
Inc. ("Marlton").

I. Other Business Activities. During the Term, Employee will not, without the
prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly engage in any other


                                       72
<PAGE>


business activities or pursuits which unreasonably interfere with his
performance of his responsibilities and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

I. Compensation. The Company shall pay Employee, and Employee hereby agrees to
accept, as compensation for all services rendered hereunder and for Employee's
covenant not to compete as provided for in Section 8 hereof, an initial base
salary at the annual rate of One Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($125,000)
(as the same may hereafter be increased, the "Base Salary"). The Base Salary
shall be inclusive of all applicable income, social security and other taxes and
charges which are required by law to be withheld by the Company or which are
requested to be withheld by Employee, and which shall be withheld and paid in
accordance with the Company's normal payroll practice for its similarly situated
employees from time to time in effect.

I. Benefits. Employee shall be entitled to those employee benefits which the
Company from time to time generally makes available to its employees
("Benefits").

I. Confidentiality. Employee recognizes and acknowledges that the Proprietary
Information (as hereinafter defined) is a valuable, special and unique asset of
the Business of the Company. As a result, both during the Term and thereafter,
Employee shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, for any
reason either directly or indirectly divulge to any third-party or use for his
own benefit, or for any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of the Company,
any confidential, proprietary, business and technical information or trade
secrets of the Company or of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company
("Proprietary Information") revealed, obtained or developed in the course of his
employment with the Company. Such Proprietary Information shall include, but
shall not be limited to, the intangible personal property described in Section
7(b) hereof, any information relating to methods of production and manufacture,
research, computer codes or instructions (including source and object code
listings, program logic algorithms, subroutines, modules or other subparts of
computer programs and related documentation, including program notation),
computer processing systems and techniques, concepts, layouts, flowcharts,
specifications, know-how, any associated user or service manuals or other like
textual materials (including any other data and materials used in performing the
Employee's duties), all computer inputs and outputs (regardless of the media on
which stored or located), hardware and software configurations, designs,
architecture, interfaces, plans, sketches, blueprints, and any other materials
prepared by the Employee in the course of, relating to or arising out of his
engagement by the Company, or prepared by any other Company employee or
contractor for the Company or its customers, costs, business studies, business
procedures, finances, marketing data, methods, plans and efforts, the identities
of customers, contractors and suppliers and prospective customers, contractors
and suppliers, the terms of contracts and agreements with customers, contractors
and suppliers, the Company's relationship with actual and prospective customers,
contractors and suppliers and the needs and requirements of, and the Company's
course of dealing with, any such actual or prospective customers, contractors
and suppliers, personnel information, customer and vendor credit information,
and any other materials that have not been made available to the general public,


                                       73
<PAGE>

provided, that nothing herein contained shall restrict Employee's ability to
make such disclosures during the course of his employment as may be necessary or
appropriate to the effective and efficient discharge of the duties required by
or appropriate for his Position or as such disclosures may be required by law;
and further provided, that nothing herein contained shall restrict Employee from
divulging or using for his own benefit or for any other purpose any Proprietary
Information that is readily available to the general public so long as such
information did not become available to the general public as a direct or
indirect result of Employee's breach of this Section 6. Failure by the Company
to mark any of the Proprietary Information as confidential or proprietary shall
not affect its status as Proprietary Information under the terms of this
Agreement.

I. Property.

1. All right, title and interest in and to Proprietary Information shall be and
remain the sole and exclusive property of the Company. During the Term, Employee
shall not remove from the Company's offices or premises any documents, records,
notebooks, files, correspondence, reports, memoranda or similar materials of or
containing Proprietary Information, or other materials or property of any kind
belonging to the Company unless necessary or appropriate in accordance with the
duties and responsibilities required by or appropriate for his Position and, in
the event that such materials or property are removed, all of the foregoing
shall be returned to their proper files or places of safekeeping as promptly as
possible after the removal shall serve its specific purpose. Employee shall not
make, retain, remove and/or distribute any copies of any of the foregoing for
any reason whatsoever except as may be necessary in the discharge of his
assigned duties and shall not divulge to any third person the nature of and/or
contents of any of the foregoing or of any other oral or written information to
which he may have access or with which for any reason he may become familiar,
except as disclosure shall be necessary in the performance of his duties; and
upon the termination of his employment with the Company, he shall leave with or
return to the Company all originals and copies of the foregoing then in his
possession, whether prepared by Employee or by others.

a) Employee agrees that all right, title and interest in and to any innovations,
designs, systems, analyses, ideas for marketing programs, and all copyrights,
patents, trademarks and trade names, or similar intangible personal property
which have been or are developed or created in whole or in part by Employee (1)
at any time and at any place while the Employee is employed by Company and
which, in the case of any or all of the foregoing, are related to and used in
connection with the Business of the Company, (2) as a result of tasks assigned
to Employee by the Company, or (3) from the use of premises or personal property
(whether tangible or intangible) owned, leased or contracted for by the Company
(collectively, the "Intellectual Property"), shall be and remain forever the
sole and exclusive property of the Company. The Employee shall promptly disclose
to the Company all Intellectual Property, and the Employee shall have no claim
for additional compensation for the Intellectual Property.


                                       74
<PAGE>


a) The Employee acknowledges that all the Intellectual Property that is
copyrightable shall be considered a work made for hire under United States
Copyright Law. To the extent that any copyrightable Intellectual Property may
not be considered a work made for hire under the applicable provisions of the
United States Copyright Law, or to the extent that, notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions, the Employee may retain an interest in any Intellectual
Property that is not copyrightable, the Employee hereby irrevocably assigns and
transfers to the Company any and all right, title, or interest that the Employee
may have in the Intellectual Property under copyright, patent, trade secret and
trademark law, in perpetuity or for the longest period otherwise permitted by
law, without the necessity of further consideration. The Company shall be
entitled to obtain and hold in its own name all copyrights, patents, trade
secrets, and trademarks with respect thereto.

a) Employee further agrees to reveal promptly all information relating to the
same to an appropriate officer of the Company and to cooperate with the Company
and execute such documents as may be necessary or appropriate (1) in the event
that the Company desires to seek copyright, patent or trademark protection, or
other analogous protection, thereafter relating to the Intellectual Property,
and when such protection is obtained, to renew and restore the same, or (2) to
defend any opposition proceedings in respect of obtaining and maintaining such
copyright, patent or trademark protection, or other analogous protection.

a) In the event the Company is unable after reasonable effort to secure
Employee's signature on any of the documents referenced in Section 7(b)(iii)
hereof, whether because of Employee's physical or mental incapacity or for any
other reason whatsoever, Employee hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the
Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as Employee's agent and
attorney-in-fact, to act for and in his behalf and stead to execute and file any
such documents and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the
prosecution and issuance of any such copyright, patent or trademark protection,
or other analogous protection, with the same legal force and effect as if
executed by Employee.

I. Covenant not to Compete. The Employee shall not, during the Term and for a
period of two (2) years thereafter or, if longer, for a period of five (5) years
following the date hereof (such period the "Restricted Period"), do any of the
following directly or indirectly without the prior written consent of the
Company:

1. engage or participate in any business activity competitive with the Company's
Business, or the fixture, display or custom exhibit business of any of the
Company's subsidiaries or affiliates, as same are conducted during the Term with
respect to any period during the Term, or upon the termination of Employee's
employment hereunder;

1. become interested in (as owner, stockholder, lender, partner, co-venturer,
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or otherwise) any person, firm,
corporation, association or other entity engaged in any business that is


                                       75
<PAGE>


competitive with the Business of the Company or the fixture, display or custom
exhibit business of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company as conducted
during the Term with respect to any period during the Term, or upon the
termination of Employee's employment hereunder with respect to any period
thereafter, or become interested in (as owner, stockholder, lender, partner,
co-venturer, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or otherwise) any
portion of the business of any person, firm, corporation, association or other
entity where such portion of such business is competitive with the business of
the Company or the fixture, display or custom exhibit business of any subsidiary
or affiliate of the Company as conducted during the Term with respect to any
period during the Term, or upon termination of Employee's employment hereunder
with respect to any period thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee
may hold not more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding securities of any
class of any publicly-traded securities of a company that is engaged in
activities referenced in Section 8(a) hereof;

1. solicit or call on, either directly or indirectly, any (i) customer with whom
the Company shall have dealt at any time during the two (2) year period
immediately preceding the termination of Employee's employment hereunder; or
(ii) any supplier with whom the Company shall have dealt at any time during the
two (2) year period immediately preceding the termination of Employee's
employment hereunder;

1. influence or attempt to influence any supplier, customer or potential
customer of the Company to terminate or modify any written or oral agreement or
course of dealing with the Company; or

1. except in his capacity as an employee of the Company, influence or attempt to
influence any person to either (i) terminate or modify his employment,
consulting, agency, distributorship or other arrangement with the Company, or
(ii) employ or retain, or arrange to have any other person or entity employ or
retain, any person who has been employed or retained by the Company as an
employee, consultant, agent or distributor of the Company at any time during the
two (2) year period immediately preceding the termination of Employee's
employment hereunder.

Term upon the occurrence of any one of the events described in this Section 9.
Upon termination, Employee shall be entitled only to such compensation and
benefits as described in this Section 9.

this Section 9.2, the Company shall have no liability or obligation hereunder to
Employee's executors, legal representatives, administrators, heirs or assigns or
any other person claiming under or through him by reason of Employee's death,

Section 9.3, the Company shall have no liability or obligation hereunder by
reason of such termination.

1. There are no restrictions, agreements or understandings whatsoever to which
Employee is a party which would prevent or make unlawful Employee's execution of
this Agreement or Employee's employment hereunder, or which is or would be
inconsistent or in conflict with this Agreement or Employee's employment
hereunder, or would prevent, limit or impair in any way the performance by
Employee of his obligations hereunder,

1. That Employee's execution of this Agreement and Employee's employment
hereunder shall not constitute a breach of any contract, agreement or


                                       78

any breach by him of Sections 6, 7, or 8 hereof will cause continuing and
irreparable injury to the Company for which monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy. The Employee shall not, in any action or proceeding to enforce
any of the provisions of this Agreement, assert the claim or defense that an
adequate remedy at law exists. In the event of such breach by Employee, the
Company shall have the right to enforce the provisions of Sections 6, 7, and 8

contained in Section 8 hereof, then the Restricted Period shall be extended for
a period of time equal to the period of time that Employee is in breach of such
restriction.

I. Consent to Suit. Any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be instituted in any federal or state court of general
jurisdiction in Pennsylvania, and the Employee hereby consents to the personal
and exclusive jurisdiction of such court and hereby waives any objection that
the Employee may have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding and any
claim or defense of inconvenient forum.

December, 1997 by and between Stanley Ginsburg, a resident of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania (the "Employee"), and DMS Store Fixtures Corp., a corporation
formerly known as DMS Acquisition Corporation and organized and existing under
the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Company").

                  WHEREAS, the Company is engaged in the business of designing,
producing and marketing store fixtures and displays (the "Business").

                  WHEREAS, the Company desires to employ Employee and Employee
desires to be employed by the Company for a period of time in the future upon
the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

                  WHEREAS, Employee possesses significant knowledge of the
Business, which knowledge the Company and Employee both desire to be available
to the Company for a period of time in the future upon the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth.

                  WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Employee in connection with the consummation of the acquisition by the Company
of DMS Store Fixtures, L.P. is a material inducement to the Company's agreement
to consummate such acquisition.

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
obligations contained herein, and intending to be legally bound, the parties,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, agree as follows:

I. Employment and Term. The Company hereby employs Employee and Employee hereby
accepts employment with the Company, as Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
(such position, Employee's "Position") for a period commencing on the date
hereof and continuing for a period of five (5) years, subject to the provisions
of Section 9 hereof (the "Term").

I. Duties. During the term of his employment, Employee shall serve the Company
faithfully and to the best of his ability and shall devote such time, attention,
skill and efforts to the performance of the duties required by or appropriate
for his Position. Employee agrees to assume such duties and responsibilities
commensurate with his position and consistent with Employee's historic duties.
Employee shall report to the Chief Executive Officer of Marlton Technologies,
Inc. ("Marlton").

I. Other Business Activities. During the Term, Employee will not, without the
prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly engage in any other


                                       83
<PAGE>


business activities or pursuits which unreasonably interfere with his
performance of his responsibilities and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

I. Compensation. The Company shall pay Employee, and Employee hereby agrees to
accept, as compensation for all services rendered hereunder and for Employee's
covenant not to compete as provided for in Section 8 hereof, an initial base
salary at the annual rate of One Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand (Dollars
($125,000) (as the same may hereafter be increased, the "Base Salary"). The Base

taxes and charges which are required by law to be withheld by the Company or
which are requested to be withheld by Employee, and which shall be withheld and
paid in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practice for its similarly
situated employees from time to time in effect.

I. Benefits. Employee shall be entitled to those employee benefits which the
Company from time to time generally makes available to its employees
("Benefits").

I. Confidentiality. Employee recognizes and acknowledges that the Proprietary
Information (as hereinafter defined) is a valuable, special and unique asset of
the Business of the Company. As a result, both during the Term and thereafter,
Employee shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, for any
reason either directly or indirectly divulge to any third-party or use for his
own benefit, or for any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of the Company,
any confidential, proprietary, business and technical information or trade
secrets of the Company or of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company
("Proprietary Information") revealed, obtained or developed in the course of his
employment with the Company. Such Proprietary Information shall include, but
shall not be limited to, the intangible personal property described in Section
7(b) hereof, any information relating to methods of production and manufacture,
research, computer codes or instructions (including source and object code
listings, program logic algorithms, subroutines, modules or other subparts of
computer programs and related documentation, including program notation),
computer processing systems and techniques, concepts, layouts, flowcharts,
specifications, know-how, any associated user or service manuals or other like
textual materials (including any other data and materials used in performing the
Employee's duties), all computer inputs and outputs (regardless of the media on
which stored or located), hardware and software configurations, designs,
architecture, interfaces, plans, sketches, blueprints, and any other materials
prepared by the Employee in the course of, relating to or arising out of his
engagement by the Company, or prepared by any other Company employee or

contractors and suppliers and the needs and requirements of, and the Company's
course of dealing with, any such actual or prospective customers, contractors
and suppliers, personnel information, customer and vendor credit information,
and any other materials that have not been made available to the general public,
provided, that nothing herein contained shall restrict Employee's ability to
make such disclosures during the course of his employment as may be necessary or
appropriate to the effective and efficient discharge of the duties required by
or appropriate for his Position or as such disclosures may be required by law;
and further provided, that nothing herein contained shall restrict Employee from
divulging or using for his own benefit or for any other purpose any Proprietary
Information that is readily available to the general public so long as such
information did not become available to the general public as a direct or
indirect result of Employee's breach of this Section 6. Failure by the Company
to mark any of the Proprietary Information as confidential or proprietary shall
not affect its status as Proprietary Information under the terms of this
Agreement.

I. Property.

1. All right, title and interest in and to Proprietary Information shall be and
remain the sole and exclusive property of the Company. During the Term, Employee
shall not remove from the Company's offices or premises any documents, records,
notebooks, files, correspondence, reports, memoranda or similar materials of or
containing Proprietary Information, or other materials or property of any kind
belonging to the Company unless necessary or appropriate in accordance with the
duties and responsibilities required by or appropriate for his Position and, in
the event that such materials or property are removed, all of the foregoing
shall be returned to their proper files or places of safekeeping as promptly as
possible after the removal shall serve its specific purpose. Employee shall not
make, retain, remove and/or distribute any copies of any of the foregoing for
any reason whatsoever except as may be necessary in the discharge of his
assigned duties and shall not divulge to any third person the nature of and/or
contents of any of the foregoing or of any other oral or written information to
which he may have access or with which for any reason he may become familiar,
except as disclosure shall be necessary in the performance of his duties; and
upon the termination of his employment with the Company, he shall leave with or
return to the Company all originals and copies of the foregoing then in his
possession, whether prepared by Employee or by others.

a) Employee agrees that all right, title and interest in and to any innovations,
designs, systems, analyses, ideas for marketing programs, and all copyrights,
patents, trademarks and trade names, or similar intangible personal property
which have been or are developed or created in whole or in part by Employee (1)
at any time and at any place while the Employee is employed by Company and
which, in the case of any or all of the foregoing, are related to and used in
connection with the Business of the Company, (2) as a result of tasks assigned
to Employee by the Company, or (3) from the use of premises or personal property
(whether tangible or intangible) owned, leased or contracted for by the Company
(collectively, the "Intellectual Property"), shall be and remain forever the
sole and exclusive property of the Company. The Employee shall promptly disclose
to the Company all Intellectual Property, and the Employee shall have no claim
for additional compensation for the Intellectual Property.


                                       85
<PAGE>



a) The Employee acknowledges that all the Intellectual Property that is
copyrightable shall be considered a work made for hire under United States
Copyright Law. To the extent that any copyrightable Intellectual Property may
not be considered a work made for hire under the applicable provisions of the
United States Copyright Law, or to the extent that, notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions, the Employee may retain an interest in any Intellectual
Property that is not copyrightable, the Employee hereby irrevocably assigns and
transfers to the Company any and all right, title, or interest that the Employee
may have in the Intellectual Property under copyright, patent, trade secret and
trademark law, in perpetuity or for the longest period otherwise permitted by
law, without the necessity of further consideration. The Company shall be
entitled to obtain and hold in its own name all copyrights, patents, trade
secrets, and trademarks with respect thereto.

a) Employee further agrees to reveal promptly all information relating to the
same to an appropriate officer of the Company and to cooperate with the Company
and execute such documents as may be necessary or appropriate (1) in the event
that the Company desires to seek copyright, patent or trademark protection, or
other analogous protection, thereafter relating to the Intellectual Property,
and when such protection is obtained, to renew and restore the same, or (2) to
defend any opposition proceedings in respect of obtaining and maintaining such
copyright, patent or trademark protection, or other analogous protection.

a) In the event the Company is unable after reasonable effort to secure
Employee's signature on any of the documents referenced in Section 7(b)(iii)
hereof, whether because of Employee's physical or mental incapacity or for any
other reason whatsoever, Employee hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the
Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as Employee's agent and
attorney-in-fact, to act for and in his behalf and stead to execute and file any
such documents and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the
prosecution and issuance of any such copyright, patent or trademark protection,
or other analogous protection, with the same legal force and effect as if
executed by Employee.

I. Covenant not to Compete. The Employee shall not, during the Term and for a
period of two (2) years thereafter or, if longer, for a period of five (5) years
following the date hereof (such period the "Restricted Period"), do any of the
following directly or indirectly without the prior written consent of the
Company:

1. engage or participate in any business activity competitive with the Company's
Business, or the fixture, display or custom exhibit business of any of the
Company's subsidiaries or affiliates, as same are conducted during the Term with
respect to any period during the Term, or upon the termination of Employee's
employment;

1. become interested in (as owner, stockholder, lender, partner, co-venturer,
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or otherwise) any person, firm,
corporation, association or other entity engaged in any business that is


                                       86
<PAGE>


competitive with the Business of the Company or the fixture, display or custom
exhibit business of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company as conducted
during the Term with respect to any period during the Term, or upon the
termination of Employee's employment hereunder with respect to any period
thereafter, or become interested in (as owner, stockholder, lender, partner,
co-venturer, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or otherwise) any
portion of the business of any person, firm, corporation, association or other
entity where such portion of such business is competitive with the business of
the Company or the fixture, display or custom exhibit business of any subsidiary
or affiliate of the Company as conducted during the Term with respect to any
period during the Term, or upon termination of Employee's employment hereunder
with respect to any period thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee
may hold not more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding securities of any
class of any publicly-traded securities of a company that is engaged in
activities referenced in Section 8(a) hereof;

1. solicit or call on, either directly or indirectly, any (i) customer with whom

two (2) year period immediately preceding the termination of Employee's

retain, any person who has been employed or retained by the Company as an
employee, consultant, agent or distributor of the Company at any time during the
two (2) year period immediately preceding the termination of Employee's

this Section 9.2, the Company shall have no liability or obligation hereunder to
Employee's executors, legal representatives, administrators, heirs or assigns or
any other person claiming under or through him by reason of Employee's death,

I. Other Agreements. Employee represents and warrants to the Company that:

1. There are no restrictions, agreements or understandings whatsoever to which
Employee is a party which would prevent or make unlawful Employee's execution of
this Agreement or Employee's employment hereunder, or which is or would be
inconsistent or in conflict with this Agreement or Employee's employment
hereunder, or would prevent, limit or impair in any way the performance by
Employee of his obligations hereunder,

1. That Employee's execution of this Agreement and Employee's employment
hereunder shall not constitute a breach of any contract, agreement or


                                       89
<PAGE>



understanding, oral or written, to which Employee is a party or by which

Sunday or legal holiday.

I. Specific Enforcement; Extension of Period.

1. Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in Sections 6, 7, and 8
hereof are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the
Company and its affiliates and that the Company would not have entered into this
Agreement in the absence of such restrictions. Employee also acknowledges that


                                       91
<PAGE>


any breach by him of Sections 6, 7, or 8 hereof will cause continuing and
irreparable injury to the Company for which monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy. The Employee shall not, in any action or proceeding to enforce
any of the provisions of this Agreement, assert the claim or defense that an
adequate remedy at law exists. In the event of such breach by Employee, the
Company shall have the right to enforce the provisions of Sections 6, 7, and 8
of this Agreement by seeking injunctive or other relief in any court, and this
Agreement shall not in any way limit remedies of law or in equity otherwise
available to the Company. If an action at law or in equity is necessary to
enforce or interpret the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover, in addition to any other relief, reasonable attorneys'
fees, costs and disbursements. In the event that the provisions of Sections 6,
7, or 8 hereof should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, or
other limitations permitted by applicable law in any applicable jurisdiction,
then such provisions shall be deemed reformed in such jurisdiction to the
maximum time, geographic, or other limitations permitted by applicable law.

1. In the event that Employee shall be in breach of any of the restrictions
contained in Section 8 hereof, then the Restricted Period shall be extended for
a period of time equal to the period of time that Employee is in breach of such
restriction.

I. Consent to Suit. Any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be instituted in any federal or state court of general
jurisdiction in Pennsylvania, and the Employee hereby consents to the personal
and exclusive jurisdiction of such court and hereby waives any objection that
the Employee may have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding and any
claim or defense of inconvenient forum.

I. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same instrument.

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to
be executed the day and year first written above.
