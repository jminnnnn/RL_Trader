ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Business Development

Marlton Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated as a New Jersey
corporation in 1966. The Company's business was related to computerized
electronic telecommunication systems until 1988 when it sold substantially all
of its operating assets.

In August 1990, the Company acquired the business of a Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania designer and manufacturer of custom trade show exhibits, museum
interiors and graphics, and provider of trade show services. In late 1990, the
Company acquired the trade show exhibit division of a competitor and also
established a portable exhibits group. The Company subsequently formed
subsidiaries (i) during July 1991 in the Atlanta, Georgia area, (ii) during July
1992 in the San Diego, California area, and (iii) during December 1992 in the
Orlando, Florida area, in each case by acquiring the assets of trade show
exhibit design and manufacturing companies. During April 1996, the Company
acquired an Orlando, Florida producer of business theater, theme park
attractions, themed interiors, theatrical scenery and special effects. On
December 31, 1997, the Company acquired DMS Store Fixtures Corp. ("DMS") in King
of Prussia, Pennsylvania, which was relocated to the Company's Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania location in March 2000. DMS supplies custom made fixtures and
displays to national retailers, department stores and consumer products
manufacturers. In April 1998, the Company acquired a San Francisco, California
area producer of exhibit properties for industrial and corporate theater events.
In 1999, as part of a nationwide branding and marketing strategy, all of the
Company's operating subsidiaries except DMS began doing business under the name
Sparks Exhibits & Environments (collectively "Sparks"). Currently, all of the
Company's operating revenues are derived from Sparks and DMS.

In February 1998, the Company acquired a 25% interest in Abex Display Systems,
Inc. ("Abex"), a portable/modular trade show exhibit manufacturer based in Los
Angeles, California. In February 1999, the Company acquired a 25% equity
interest in an Amsterdam, Netherlands area trade show exhibit design and
manufacturing company, which simultaneously changed its name to Sparks Europe,
B.V. ("Sparks Europe"). The Company's investments in Abex and Sparks Europe are
accounted for using the equity method with the Company recognizing its pro-rata
portion of Abex and Sparks Europe operating results.

Business Description

Products and Services

The Company is engaged in the custom design, production and sale of exhibits and
environments for trade shows, retail stores, theme parks, themed interiors,
museums, arenas, executive briefing centers and corporate events. Clients
include industry, government, entertainment and commercial establishments. The
Company manages custom trade show projects from concept through final
construction, employing sophisticated graphics and exhibit designers and
computer-aided design software and hardware. In-house facilities provide a wide
range of computerized design and production of graphics. Electronics and
audiovisual capabilities include on-staff electronic specialists and vendor
relationships which provide multi-media equipment and programs, interactive
program production and customized computer applications. The Company provides
full service trade show exhibit services, including coordination, refurbishing,
shipping, storage and marketing literature distribution. Many clients are
Fortune 1000 firms, who typically contract for custom trade show exhibit
projects costing in excess of $200,000. Additionally, a majority of these
clients store their trade show exhibits at a Company facility, where ongoing
refurbishing and coordination of clients' trade show schedules are provided. The
Company also represents domestic clients who desire to exhibit at international
trade shows. The Company designs such exhibits, and through Sparks Europe or an
international network of independent exhibit manufacturers, arranges for the
manufacture and delivery of trade show exhibits to the desired trade show. The
Company also designs and manufactures trade show exhibits for a


                                       2
<PAGE>
number of United States subsidiaries of foreign corporations for use in domestic
trade shows. In addition, the Company produces sophisticated themed exhibits for
educational and entertainment venues such as museums and theme parks. Typically,
the customer or its design firm prepares the design for the Company to fabricate
using carpentry, sculpture, metal working and scenic artist skills. The Company
also supplies custom store fixtures, showcases and point of purchase displays
for retailers, having the expertise and capability to take a design from concept
to installation. Engineers and designers work with the customers to develop the
fixture design through computer aided design equipment. Engineering drawings are
then produced and provided to third-party manufacturers with whom the Company
has developed long-standing business relationships for the production of its
products. These manufacturers work closely with an experienced Company project
management team. Custom store fixture opportunities includes outfitting new
retail stores and remodeling existing stores, including specialty apparel
chains, department stores, outlet stores and drug stores. The Company made no
significant disbursements during any of the last three fiscal years for research
and development activities.

Marketing and Distribution

Sales by the Company to domestic customers for both domestic and international
use are solicited through internal sales and marketing groups. Purchase of
sophisticated exhibits and environments usually involves a substantial
expenditure by the customer, and significant expertise is required to properly
meet the customer's needs. Sales personnel are required to be knowledgeable with
respect to the design and manufacturing of sophisticated exhibits and
environments and to comply with internal profitability requirements. Sales are
typically made directly to the end user of the product or service. In addition
to the sales personnel, senior officers devote substantial attention to sales
and marketing activities.

Manufacturing and Raw Materials

The Company designs and manufactures custom trade show exhibits utilizing an
in-house staff of designers, carpenters, electricians and warehouse employees.
Specialty items such as studio production are subcontracted. The Company also
subcontracts to Sparks Europe and others the manufacture of exhibits for foreign
trade shows. The Company coordinates shipping, exhibit set-up and removal at the
customer's trade show and, in most cases, subsequently stores the exhibit for
the customer. For scenic projects, the Company employs scenic carpenters and
metal workers to fabricate scenery which is painted by skilled scenic artists.
The Company utilizes a network of manufacturers for the production of its store
fixture and display products. Raw materials for custom, scenic and portable
exhibits, store fixtures and displays, as well as subcontractors for specialty
work, have historically been available on commercially reasonable terms from
various vendors. Portable exhibit configurations, together with graphics, are
typically designed by the Company for a client and are purchased from Abex or
unrelated manufacturers for resale. Graphics may be produced internally or
subcontracted. Geographic distribution rights are typically granted by portable
exhibit manufacturers based on annual sales volume levels. The Company has
obtained such distribution rights from Abex, its primary source of portable
exhibits.

Seasonality of Business

Trade shows typically occur regularly throughout the year with the exception of
the third quarter when business to business trade shows are traditionally at a
low point. Trade show activities in specific industries, such as health care and
telecommunications, tend to be a function of seasonal show schedules within
those industries. The custom store fixture business tends to be slower during
the fourth and first quarters due to retailers' desires not to install or plan
new fixtures during their traditionally busy year-end season. The Company seeks
new clients and sales people with client bases in different industries to reduce
the effects of the slower sales periods. Additionally, the Company offers other
products and services, such as sales of scenic and themed exhibits,
portable/modular exhibits, and permanent exhibits which tend to be less seasonal
in nature, and in certain cases, manufacturing can be spread over longer periods
of time.

Working Capital

The Company's working capital requirements are fulfilled by funds generated
through operations and revolving credit facilities. Working capital requirements
are generally not affected by project size requirements or accelerated delivery
for major trade show exhibit, scenic and themed exhibit customers due to general
policies of progress billing on larger jobs. However, custom store fixtures are
generally produced upon receipt of purchase orders from large retailers, but are
held in inventory and are not billed to the customer until delivery requisitions
are issued by the customer. The Company does not require continuous allotments
of raw materials from suppliers and does not generally provide extended payment
terms to customers.

Significant Customers

No customer accounted for over 10% of the Company's consolidated net sales in
2000 or accounts receivable at December 31, 2000. One customer accounted for 12%
of consolidated net sales in 1999 and 13% of accounts receivable at December 31,
1999. During 1999 and 2000, the Company took steps to diversify its customer
base.

Backlog

Backlog of orders at December 31, 2000 and 1999 was approximately $18.0 million
and $30.8 million, respectively. The backlog decrease is principally
attributable to lower orders for an insolvent customer and for store fixtures.
Generally, backlog of orders are recognized as sales during the subsequent six
month period. The current backlog relates primarily to expected 2001 sales. The
Company maintains a client base from which new orders are continually generated,
including refurbishing of existing trade show exhibits stored in the Company's
facilities. There are also a significant amount of proposals outstanding with
current and prospective clients.

Competition

The Company competes with other companies offering similar products and
providing similar services on the basis of price, quality, performance,
financial resources, and client-support services. The custom trade show exhibit,
scenic and themed exhibit, permanent exhibit, retail store fixture and display,
and portable exhibits sales markets include a large number of national and
regional companies, some of which have substantially greater sales and resources
than the Company. In addition to its domestic manufacturing facilities, the
Company utilizes its national and international affiliations and relationships
to meet customers needs in other geographic areas. Due to the lack of specific
public information, the Company's competitive position is difficult to
ascertain.

Environmental Protection

The Company's compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating
discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment has not had, and is not expected to have, a
material effect upon its capital expenditures, earnings and competitive
position.

Employees

The total number of persons employed by the Company is approximately 340 of
which 335 are full-time employees. The Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, operations
have a three-year labor contract expiring June 30, 2001 and a three-year labor
contract expiring November 14, 2001.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

The Company currently leases five primary facilities as follows:

</TABLE>

                                       4
<PAGE>
The Company's subsidiaries also have two sales offices of under 1,000 square
feet each. The Company's office, showroom, warehouse and manufacturing
facilities were all in good condition and adequate for 2000, based on normal
five-day operations, and are adequate for operations in 2001, including any
foreseeable internal growth. The Company does not anticipate significant
difficulty in acquiring additional space, if necessary. In the fourth quarter of
2000, the Company consolidated its San Carlos, California manufacturing and
warehousing into its El Cajon, California facility, while maintaining a San
Carlos sales and design office. The Company intends to consolidate its Orlando,
Florida manufacturing and warehousing operation into its Austell, Georgia
facility during the second quarter of 2001, while maintaining a sales office in
Orlando.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company from time to time is a defendant and counterclaimant in various
lawsuits that arise out of, and are incidental to, the conduct of its business.
The resolution of pending legal matters should not have a material effect upon
the financial position of the Company.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No dividends were paid during the past two fiscal years. The Company currently
intends to employ all available funds in the business. Future dividend policy
will be determined in accordance with the financial requirements of the
business. However, the Company's bank loan agreement provides that the Company
may not pay dividends to its shareholders without the bank's prior consent.
Unless the bank's consent is obtained, this restriction will preclude the
Company from paying dividends.

As of April 13, 2001, there were 954 holders of record of the Company's Common
Stock.

In January 2000, 37,210 shares of Common Stock were issued to the Company's
financial advisor as partial compensation for the advisor's services in
restructuring the Company's bank debt. On the date of issuance, shares of the
Company's Common Stock had a market value of $2.69 per share. In addition,
59,454 shares were contributed in 2000 to the Company's 401(k) plan or awarded
to employees, without receipt of any proceeds by the Company. No underwriter was
employed in any of these transactions. These sales were isolated transactions
involving a sophisticated party and employees, and were exempt from registration
under Section 4(2) or Rule 701 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

GENERAL OVERVIEW

The Company's business is the custom design, production and sale of exhibits and
environments for trade shows, museums, theme parks, themed interiors, arenas,
executive briefing centers, corporate events and retail stores for clients in
industry, government, entertainment and commercial establishments.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2000 As Compared With 1999

Net Sales

                                 (in thousands)
                                                          % increase
Revenue Sources                 2000          1999        (decrease)
- ---------------                 ----          ----        ----------

Trade show exhibits          $56,182       $47,265            19%
Permanent/scenic displays     36,351        47,319           (23)
                             -------       -------           ---
Total                        $92,533       $94,584            (2)%
                             =======       =======           ===

Total net sales decreased $2.1 million, or 2%, in 2000 as compared with 1999 net
sales as a result of higher sales of trade show exhibits, which grew $8.9
million or 19%, offset by lower sales of permanent/scenic displays, which
decreased $11 million or 23%. Higher trade show exhibit sales were due primarily
to new clients and to higher sales of services provided at trade shows. Lower
sales of permanent/scenic displays were principally attributable to a decrease
in business from a customer that became insolvent and to lower sales for the
Company's store fixtures business as major retail customers delayed new store
openings and renovations.

Operating Profits

The Company revised its 1999 financial statements. See Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Operating profit decreased to $60,000 in 2000 from $3.1 million, in 1999. A
provision for accounts receivable and inventory related to customer insolvency
and disputes reduced third quarter 2000 operating profit by $2 million.
Additionally, relocation of operations and losses incurred by the Company's
permanent/scenic displays operations reduced fourth quarter 2000 operating
profit by approximately $1 million.

By the second quarter of 2001, the Company expects to have relocated and
consolidated three of its operations within the past fifteen months. The
Company's store fixtures business was relocated in March of 2000 and
consolidated with its Philadelphia, PA, operations, and West Coast production
operations were consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2000. In the first quarter
of 2001, management decided to consolidate its Southeast region production
operations, which is planned for completion during the second quarter of 2001.
These actions are expected to improve the Company's competitive position and
eliminate operating losses realized in the West Coast and Southeast region
facilities that were relocated.

Selling expenses increased to $11 million, or 11.9% of sales, in 2000 from $9.3
million, or 9.8% of sales in 1999. This increase was due in part to higher trade
show exhibit sales, which are subject to higher sales commissions and variable
selling expenses. The Company also invested in additional sales personnel in
2000.

Administrative and general expenses increased $1.6 million to $9.2 million, or
10% of sales, in 2000 from $7.6 million, or 8% of sales, in 1999. This increase
was attributable to several factors, including higher bad debt provisions ($0.8
million), higher business insurance costs, consulting fees, amortization of loan
origination fees, management recruiting expenses and relocation costs to
consolidate the Company's store fixtures business.

                                       8
<PAGE>
Other Income (Expense)

Interest expense increased to $1.4 million in 2000 from $1.1 million in 1999 due
to higher borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility. This increase
was due in part to finance working capital requirements resulting from losses
incurred in the permanent/scenic displays businesses and from slower billing and
collections of accounts receivable. The Company deployed new computer systems
during 1999 and 2000, which caused delays in customer billings and collections.

A write down of $465,000 was incurred in 1999 related to the Company's
investment in Abex Europe, which went into receivership under UK law in October
1999.

Income Taxes

The benefit from income taxes was 19% of the pre-tax loss in 2000 as compared
with a 47% provision in 1999 largely due to differences between book and tax
treatment of goodwill amortization.

Net Income

A net loss of $1.1 million ($.15 per fully diluted share) was incurred in 2000
as compared with net income of $0.8 million ($.10 per fully diluted share) in
1999. The decrease in 2000 was attributable primarily to losses associated with
the permanent/scenic displays businesses that required higher bad debt and
inventory provisions and higher selling, administrative and general expenses.

Backlog

The Company's backlog of orders was approximately $18 million at December 31,
2000 as compared with $30.8 million at December 31, 1999. This decrease was due
in large part to lower orders for permanent/scenic displays.

1999 As Compared With 1998

Net Sales

Trade show exhibits           $47,265        $41,777            13%
Permanent/scenic displays      47,319         48,957            (3)
EDSI                               --            400          (100)
                              -------        -------          ----
    Total                     $94,584        $91,134             4%
                              =======        =======          ====

Total net sales increased $3.5 million, or 4%, in 1999 as compared with 1998,
led by higher sales of trade show exhibits, which grew $5.5 million, or 13%. The
increase in sales of trade show exhibits was principally attributable to a full
year of sales for significant new clients secured near the end of 1998,
resulting from the Company's continuing initiatives focused on client expansion.
Net sales of permanent/scenic displays, comprised primarily of the Company's
store fixtures business acquired at the end of 1997 and the Sparks Florida
business acquired in 1996, decreased $1.6 million, or 3%. This decrease was
primarily the result of lower sales for store fixtures, partially offset by
higher sales for scenic displays. Lower sales for store fixtures were due in
large part to a decrease in purchases by a large client, and higher sales for
scenic displays were the result of securing new clients during 1999. There were
no sales in 1999 for Expose Display Systems, Inc. ("EDSI") as a result of an
exchange of the Company's interest in EDSI in connection with the acquisition of
a minority interest in Abex as of February 1, 1998.

                                       9
<PAGE>
Operating Profits

Operating profits decreased $2.3 million, to $3.1 million in 1999 from $5.3
million in 1998. This decrease was principally attributable to lower operating
profits generated by the permanent displays and store fixtures businesses
largely resulting from lower revenues. The permanent displays operating profit
decrease resulted, in large part, from bids on large jobs that did not provide
adequate profit margins. Trade show exhibits margins also decreased in 1999.

Selling expenses decreased to 9.8% of net sales in 1999 from 10.6% in 1998,
while administrative and general expenses increased to 8.1% of net sales in 1999
from 7.3% in 1998. The decrease in selling expenses was due in large part to
lower variable expenses incurred by the store fixtures business and to lower
sales commission rates incurred for certain new clients for the trade show
exhibit business. The increase in administrative and general expenses was
principally attributable to higher depreciation related to investments in
computer systems and to improvements in the Company's facilities in the western
United States.

Other Income (Expense)

Interest income decreased to $137,000 in 1999 from $241,000 in 1998 due to lower
average cash balances, which was largely the result of reductions in accounts
payable and other accrued expenses. Interest expense increased $123,000 in 1999
primarily due to short-term borrowings from the Company's revolving credit
facility necessary to meet working capital requirements. A write-down of
$465,000 was incurred in 1999 for the Company's investment in Abex Europe Ltd.,
which went into receivership on October 15, 1999.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes increased to 47% of pre-tax income in 1999 as
compared with 38% in 1998. This increase was principally attributable to
non-deductible goodwill amortization, as well as to 1998 valuation allowances
for net operating loss carryforwards.

Net Income

Net income decreased to $0.8 million ($0.10 per diluted share) in 1999 from $2.8
million ($.35 per diluted share) in 1998. The decrease was principally
attributable to lower operating profit generated by the permanent displays
business, lower sales of store fixtures, the write-down of investment in the
Abex Europe affiliate, lower margins for trade show exhibits and a higher
effective income tax rate.

Backlog

The Company's manufacturing backlog of orders was approximately $30.8 million at
December 31, 1999 as compared with $27 million at December 31, 1998.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

On January 21, 2000, the Company restructured its bank debt by executing a
Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the "Facility") with its bank providing
for borrowing capacity up to $30 million. This new Facility was used to
refinance a term loan and a construction loan and to replace the Company's
previous revolving credit facility. Fees for the new facility totaled $532,000,
comprised of $432,000 of cash payments and issuance of 37,210 shares of the
Company's common stock. The new Facility is collateralized by all of the
Company's assets and bears interest at rates based on the LIBOR, adjusted for
applicable spreads ranging from 2.0% to 2.75%. The Company is subject to an
annual commitment fee of 1/4% on the average unused portion of the revolving
credit facility. This new Facility includes certain financial covenants
requiring a minimum net worth and maintenance of certain financial ratios, and
restricts the Company's ability


                                       10
<PAGE>
to pay dividends. The Company was not in compliance with the financial covenants
of this new Facility at September 30, 2000 and at December 31, 2000. An
Amendment to the new Facility was executed on February 16, 2001, whereby the
Company received the appropriate waivers and which changed the financial
covenant provisions to remove $2 million of charges incurred during the third
quarter of 2000 determined to be non-recurring under the terms of the Amendment.

On April 16, 2001, another Amendment and waiver to the Facility was executed
which changed the financial covenant provisions to remove $1 million of charges
incurred during the fourth quarter of 2000 determined to be non-recurring under
the terms of the Amendment, to reduce the minimum net worth requirement from $29
million to $28 million, and to lower the Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio from 3.5:1
to 3.25:1 at June 30, 2000, to 3:1 at December 31, 2001 and to 2.75:1
thereafter. This Amendment also reduced the borrowing capacity to $25 million,
shortened the maturity date of the credit facility to January 21, 2004,
increased certain interest spreads above LIBOR and requires the bank's consent
for future Company acquisitions and further investments in affiliates. This
Amendment and waiver brought the Company into compliance with the new Facility.
Costs of $10,000 incurred in connection with this Amendment will be amortized
over the remaining term of the new Facility. Borrowings under the new Facility
were $16 million at December 31, 2000.

The Company has maintained essentially the same cash balance at the end of 2000
as compared with the balance at the end of 1999. Cash provided by operating
activities of $473,000 was largely the result of an increase of $4.7 million in
accounts receivable, offset by depreciation and amortization of $2.7 million and
a $2.4 million decrease in inventories. The accounts receivable increase was due
to delays in billing and collection, which was attributable to several factors,
including deployment of a new computer system. Capital expenditure totaled $2.6
million for 2000, and included investments in new rental assets, facilities
expansion and computer upgrades. The current portion of long-term debt was
reduced by $2.9 million as a result of the debt restructuring. Working capital
increased to $15.4 million at the end of 2000 from $11.2 million at the end of
1999, largely as a result of the increase in accounts receivable and the debt
restructuring.

OUTLOOK

The Company expects continued sales growth from trade show exhibits and lower
sales from permanent/scenic displays during 2001. Management has taken steps to
improve its human resource talent and has taken steps to consolidate operations.
The Company's store fixtures operation and San Carlos, CA production and
warehousing operations were consolidated with other operations during 2000. The
Company also plans to relocate and consolidate its Orlando, Florida production
operation in the second quarter of 2001. Consolidation of these operations it
expected to reduce costs during the second half of 2001 and beyond.

The Company installed new computer systems during 1999 and upgraded the related
software during the fourth quarter of 2000. Although these computer information
systems have improved, the Company continues to experience problems related to
these systems. Management is taking further steps to improve the software
systems using outside consultants and to improve the hardware and communications
reliability of the Company's computer systems.

Management believes that the trade show exhibit client base of Fortune 1000
companies will continue to tightly manage their marketing budgets, which may
impact the Company's trade show exhibit profit margins. The Company continues to
pursue operating efficiency improvements to mitigate the impact of margin
pressure from its client base. Management plans ongoing investment in human
resources, particularly for new sales executives and support staff to create
long term growth opportunities.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities", which will require that all derivative
financial instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the
balance sheet. SFAS No. 133 will be effective no later than for the Company's
first quarter of 2001. In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, which amended
SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 138 provides additional guidance related to accounting
for derivative instruments and hedging activities. This statement is applicable
for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The adoption of these statements
is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results
of operation, financial position or cash flows.

         AMENDMENT NO. 1 dated as of February 16, 2001, by and among MARLTON
TECHNOLOGIES, INC., a New Jersey corporation ("Marlton"), and certain
subsidiaries executing this Amendment as Borrowers (together with Marlton,
collectively, the "Borrowers") and FIRST UNION NATIONAL BANK, a national banking
association, as Bank (the "Bank") and as Agent (the "Agent").

         WHEREAS, the Borrowers, the Agent and the Banks entered into a certain
 Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement dated as of
 January 21, 2000 (as amended on the date hereof and hereafter, the "Credit
 Agreement"); capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein having the meanings
 set forth in the Credit Agreement; and

         WHEREAS, the parties wish to amend certain provisions of the Credit
Agreement;

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein
contained, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows, effective on the date first above written.

          1. Excluded Reserves. For purposes of determining compliance with the
 covenants set forth hi Section 6.25, 6.26 and 6.27 of the Agreement and for
 purposes of the definition of "Applicable Margin," for the fiscal quarters
 ending on September 30, 2000, December 31, 2000, March 31, 2001 and June 30,
 2001 (but not thereafter), EBITDA shall be calculated without taking into
 account an aggregate of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) (but no more) recorded
 as accounts receivable and inventory reserves (the "Excluded Reserves") as of
 the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2000; provided that, to the extent there
 is a decrease in or reversal of the Excluded Reserves, the resulting income
 shall not be taken into account for the above-referenced purposes.

          2.  "Applicable Margin." The definition of "Applicable Margin" shall
be amended to read in full as follows:

              "Applicable Margin" means, in accordance with the table and text
below:


                                                           Applicable Margin:

                                                         LIBOR Loans      Base
If the ratio of Senior Funded Debt to                    and Letter of    Rate
EBITDA is:                                               Credit Fees:     Loans:
- -------------------------------------                    -----------------------

Higher than 3.00:1 (it being                                2.75%         0.50%
acknowledged that the maximum
permitted ratio of Senior Funded Debt
to EBITDA may never exceed the
amount permitted under Section 6.25)

3.00:1 or lower, but higher than 2.50:1                     2.00%         0.00%

2.50:1 or lower, but higher than 2.00:1                     1.75%        -0.25%

Less than or equal to 2.00:1                                1.25%        -0.25%

                                       18

<PAGE>



                  The calculation of the Applicable Margin pursuant to the above
                  tables shall be made quarterly, based upon the Interim
                  Financial Statements or Financial Statements, as applicable,
                  of MTI and its Subsidiaries as at the last day of each such
                  fiscal quarter and for the fiscal period then ended. In the
                  event that the Applicable Margin changes, such change shall
                  become effective for Eurodollar Loans then existing or
                  thereafter made, as of the first day of the fiscal quarter
                  immediately following the date on which such financial
                  statements are delivered to the Agent. In the event that such
                  financial statements are not delivered to the Agent on or
                  before the date required under this Agreement, the Applicable
                  Margin shall be calculated as if the Funded Debt to EBITDA is
                  greater than 3.00:1, effective upon the last day of the fiscal
                  quarter to which such financial statements relate, and until
                  such financial statements are delivered showing that the
                  Borrowers are entitled to a lower rate hereunder.

         3. Senior Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio. Section 6.25 shall be amended to
 read in full as follows:

                  The Borrowers will not permit the ratio of Senior Funded Debt,
                  determined as of the last day (a "Measurement Date") of each
                  period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of MTI, to EBITDA
                  for such period to be greater than (a) 3.50:1.00 for each such
                  period ending on or prior to September 30, 2001, and (b)
                  thereafter, 3.25:1.0.

         4. Representations and Covenants. The Borrowers hereby represent,
 warrant and certify that, assuming the effectiveness of Paragraph 1 of this
 Amendment: (a) all representations and warranties contained in the Credit
 Agreement, including without limitation the schedules thereto (updated as
 attached hereto), are true, correct and complete on and as of the date hereof,
 (b) all covenants and agreements made in the Credit Agreement have been
 complied with and fulfilled, (c) no Default or Event of Default is in existence
 on the date hereof, and (d) this Amendment has been duly authorized, executed
 and delivered by each Borrower and is the legal, valid and binding obligation
 of each of the Borrowers, enforceable in accordance with its terms.

         5. Ratification. Other than as specifically set forth herein, the
Borrowers hereby ratify and confirm the Credit Agreement and all instruments and
agreements relating thereto, and confirm that (a) all of the foregoing remain in
full force and effect, (b) each of the foregoing is enforceable against the
Borrowers in accordance with its terms, and (c) Borrowers have no defenses to
its obligations or claims relative to the Credit Agreement.

         6. Miscellaneous. Article IX of the Credit Agreement is incorporated
 herein by reference and shall apply to this Amendment. Execution of this
 Amendment shall not constitute an agreement by the Agent or any Bank to execute
 any other amendment or modification of the Credit Agreement. References to the
 Credit Agreement in any document relating thereto shall be deemed to include
 this Amendment. This Amendment may be executed in counterparts.

         7.   Effectiveness. This Amendment shall be effective when (a) the
Agent has received a Fifty Thousand Dollar ($50,000) amendment fee and (b) the
parties have each received a fully executed copy of this Amendment.

         WHEREAS, the parties wish to amend certain provisions of the Credit
Agreement;

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein
contained, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows, effective on the date first above written.

         1. Facility Amount. The "Background" section of the Credit Agreement
shall be amended to reduce the amount of the Facility from $30 million to $25
million and to eliminate any reference to a possible increase in the Facility to
$35 million.

         2. Definitions. Section 1.1 shall be amended as follows:

(a)  "Applicable Margin" shall be amended in full as follows:


       "Applicable Margin" means, in accordance with the table and text below:


                                              Applicable Margin:


       If the ratio of Funded                 LIBOR Loans and         Base
       Debt to EBITDA is:                     Letter of Credit Fees:  Rate Loans
       -----------------                      ---------------------   ----------

       higher than 2.50:1 (it being                  2.75%              0.75%
       acknowledged that the maximum
       permitted ratio of Funded Debt to

                  The calculation of the Applicable Margin pursuant to the above

                delivered to the Agent on or before the date required under
                this Agreement, the Applicable Margin shall be calculated as
                if the Funded Debt to EBITDA is greater than 2.50:1, effective
                upon the last day of the fiscal quarter to which such
                financial statements relate, and until such financial
                statements are delivered showing that the Borrowers are
                entitled to a lower rate hereunder.

(b)  The definition of "Maturity Date" shall be amended to read in full as
     follows:

                "Maturity Date" means, unless the Loans are earlier
                accelerated pursuant to Section 7.2., the date which is the
                fourth (4th) anniversary of the Closing Date.

(c)  "Revolving Credit Commitment" shall be amended to read in full as follows:

                "Revolving Credit Commitment" means $25,000,000, as such
                amount may be reduced pursuant to Section 2.1(D) hereof.

       6.13(B)(4) shall be deleted.

       full as follows:

                SECTION 6.24 Minimum Net Worth. MTI will maintain at the end
                of each fiscal quarter, commencing the fiscal quarter ending
                June 30, 2001, consolidated Net Worth in an amount not less
                than $28,000,000 plus 50% of MTI's cumulative consolidated net
                income for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2001 and each

We consent to the incorporation by the reference in the registration statement
of Marlton Technologies, Inc. on Form S-8 (File No. 33-3647) of our report dated
April 6, 2001, except for Note 11, as to which the date is April 16, 2001, on
our audits of the consolidated financial statements of Marlton Technologies,

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS



To the Shareholders
and Board of Directors of
Marlton Technologies, Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 14(a)(1) on page 13, after the restatement described in
Note (2), present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Marlton Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Marlton
Technologies, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries and the effects of minority
investments in non-consolidated businesses (the "Company"). Investments in
affiliates, representing the Company's 20% or more but less than 50%
investments, are accounted for using the equity method. All inter-company
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Activity included in the consolidated statements of operations consists
primarily of the design, manufacture, sale and servicing of sophisticated custom
and portable/modular trade show exhibits and the manufacturing of museum
interiors, themed interiors, theme park attractions, custom store fixtures and
point of purchase displays.

The Company operates in one segment.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all investments with an initial maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments comprise principally
short-term government funds. At various times throughout the year the Company
may maintain cash balances in excess of FDIC limits.

Inventory

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market and
include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead costs.

Long-Lived Assets

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets,
ranging primarily from 3 to 10 years. Assets and accumulated depreciation
accounts are reduced for the sale or other disposition of property, and the
resulting gain or loss is included in income. Rental assets, which include
manufactured and purchased exhibit components, are stated at cost. Depreciation
is recorded on a usage basis.

The excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) is
amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 5 to 30 years.
Included in other assets are loan origination fees, which are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the related debt agreement.

The Company's policy is to record an impairment loss against long-lived assets,
including investment in affiliates, property and equipment, goodwill and other
intangibles, in the period when it is determined that the carrying amount of
such assets may not be recoverable. This determination includes evaluation of
factors such as current market value, future asset utilization, business climate
and future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the net
assets.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues on trade show exhibit sales, themed interiors and custom store fixtures
and point of purchase displays are recognized using the completed contract
method. Revenues on permanent exhibit installations which are generally six
months or longer in duration, are recognized on the percentage of completion
method. Progress billings are generally made throughout the production process.
Progress billings which are unpaid at the balance sheet date are not recognized
in the financial statements as accounts receivable. Progress billings which have
been collected on or before the balance sheet date are classified as customer
deposits and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the future
tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements
or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated based on the
difference between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
the currently enacted tax rates in effect during the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company's financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit
risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts
receivable. The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments with high
quality credit institutions. The Company's accounts receivable are primarily
with customers throughout the United States. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally requires
progress payments which mitigate its loss exposure.

No individual customer accounted for over 10% of consolidated net sales in 2000
or accounts receivable at December 31, 2000. One customer accounted for 12% of
consolidated net sales in 1999 and 13% of accounts receivable at December 31,
1999. The Company has taken steps to diversify its customer base during 1999 and
2000.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt.
The recorded values of cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair value
due to the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of long-term debt
is estimated based on current interest rates offered to the Company for similar
remaining maturities. The recorded value of these financial instruments
approximate their fair value at December 31, 2000 and 1999.

Per Share Data

Basic net income per common share is calculated using the average shares of
common stock outstanding, while diluted net income per common share reflects the
potential dilution that could occur if stock options were exercised.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities", which will require that all derivative
financial instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the
balance sheet and measured at fair value. SFAS No. 133 will be effective no
later than for the Company's first quarter of 2001. In June 2000, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 138, which amended SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 138 provides
additional guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities. This statement is applicable for fiscal years beginning after June
15, 2000. The adoption of these statements is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company's consolidated results of operation, financial position or
cash flows.

2. REVISIONS TO 1999 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company revised its 1999 financial statements principally as a result of
inaccurate information produced for 1999 by a new computer system, which led to
inaccurate cost of sales and related inventory and accounts payable amounts at
December 31, 1999. None of these adjustments impacted the Company's reported
cash flows. The adjustments are summarized below:

3. ACQUISITIONS

On April 1, 1998, the Company acquired 100% of the stock of Rusty Hinges, Inc.
d/b/a Steele Productions ("Steele") located in the San Francisco, California
area. Steele produces exhibit properties for industrial and corporate theater
events throughout the United States. The transaction included a cash payment of
approximately $395,000, a five year note approximating $197,000 payable in
annual installments bearing interest at 7.25% per annum, and 42,391 shares of
the Company's common stock valued at approximately $250,000. The excess cost of
the acquisition, including related costs of the transaction, over the net assets
acquired of approximately $190,000 is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over 10 years. In the fourth quarter 2000, these production operations were
consolidated into the Company's El Cajon, CA subsidiary.

7. INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATES

On February 19, 1999, the Company paid $258,451 and issued 70,160 shares of its
common stock having a market value of $3.25 per share for a 25% minority
interest in Hans Uljee Explotatie en Beheer B.V. ("Uljee"), a Netherlands-based
organization focusing on exhibit fabrication, interior design, event displays
and graphics production. The excess cost over the 25% equity acquired was
$362,000 which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years.
Subsequent to the Company's 25% investment, Uljee changed its name to Sparks
Europe, B.V. ("Sparks Europe"). Should Sparks Europe attain defined cumulative
net income levels, the Company will be required to pay an additional amount in
Eurodollars and/or its common stock, at the Company's option.

On February 1, 1998, the Company exchanged its 51% majority interest in Expose
Display Systems, Inc. ("EDSI") and paid approximately $180,000 in cash for a 25%

Europe went into receivership under UK law, and the Company recognized an
impairment loss of approximately $465,000 related to its investment in Abex
Europe.

During 1997, the Company began a multi-year project to install a computer system
to support its information processing and access needs. Direct internal and
external costs, subsequent to the preliminary stage of this project, were
capitalized as property and equipment. Capitalized costs will be amortized over
the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from three to five
years, beginning when each site installation or module is complete and ready for
its intended use. Total depreciation and amortization of property and equipment,
was $1,787,000, $1,613,000 and $1,219,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively.

11. DEBT OBLIGATIONS

In connection with the December 31, 1997 acquisition of DMS Store Fixtures, L.P.
("DMS"), the Company entered into a $13.5 million five-year term loan and a $6.5
million five-year revolving credit facility with a lending institution, both
collateralized by all of the Company's assets. On January 21, 2000, the Company
restructured its bank debt with an amended revolving credit facility, providing
for borrowing capacity up to $30 million. This new facility was used to
refinance the term loan and is intended to finance capital expenditures,
permitted acquisitions and other working capital requirements as needed. The new
facility is collateralized by all of the Company's assets and bears interest at
rates based on the LIBOR adjusted for applicable spreads ranging from 2.0% to
2.75% dependent on the Company's Funded Debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,
Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") ratio. The Company is subject to an
annual commitment fee of 1/4 % on the average unused portion of the revolving
credit facility. This new facility includes certain financial covenants
requiring a minimum net worth and maintenance of certain financial ratios, and
restricts the Company's ability to pay dividends. Fees totaling $532,000,
comprised of $432,000 of cash payments and issuance of 37,210 shares of the
Company's common stock, will be amortized over the term of the new facility. The
interest rates charged during 2000 ranged from 6.31% to 8.04% for the new
facility.

The Company was not in compliance with the financial covenants of the new
facility at September 30, 2000 and at December 31, 2000. On February 16, 2001,
the Company and the lender amended the financial covenants of the credit
facility to remove $2 million for certain non-recurring charges from EBITDA for
the third quarter ended September 30, 2000. Costs of $50,000 incurred in
connection with this amendment will be amortized over the remaining term of the
new facility.

On April 16, 2001, the Company received the appropriate waivers from the lender
and amended the financial covenants of the new facility to remove $1 million for
certain non-recurring charges from EBITDA for the fourth quarter ended December
31, 2000, to reduce the minimum net worth requirement from $29 million to $28
million, and to lower the Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio from 3.5:1 to 3.25:1 at
June 30, 2000, to 3:1 at December 31, 2001 and to 2.75:1 thereafter. This
amendment also reduced the borrowing capacity to $25 million, shortened the
maturity date of the credit facility to January 21, 2004, increased certain
interest spreads above LIBOR and requires the bank's consent for future Company
acquisitions and further investments in affiliates. Costs of $10,000 incurred in
connection with this amendment will be amortized over the remaining term of the
credit facility.

The Company obtained a $1.0 million credit facility in September 1999 to fund
the construction of an office expansion, which was refinanced, by the new
revolving credit facility.

12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company leases two facilities from partnerships controlled by two
shareholders of the Company. One lease, which expires on May 14, 2019, requires
minimum annual rent of $771,000 at a fixed rate for the first 10 years, and the
Company is responsible for taxes, insurance and other operating expenses. This
annual rent is comparable to the amount charged by the previous lessor. There
were advances of $826,000 made to one of the partnerships at December 31, 1999
included in prepaid and other current assets made in connection with a
construction loan for a facility expansion. These advances were repaid in
February 2000.

The second lease for a separate facility expired on April 1, 2000. The previous
expiration date for this lease was May 1, 2001, which was changed, without
penalty, to April 1, 2000 as a result of management's decision to relocate and
consolidate its DMS operation. The annual rent for this facility was $180,000,
and the Company was responsible for taxes, insurance and other operating
expenses.

In connection with the DMS acquisition, employment agreements were made with two
shareholders of the Company, which provide for guaranteed minimum payments of
approximately $270,000 included in other accrued liabilities and $270,000 in
other long-term liabilities. These agreements were mutually terminated in
January 2001 eliminating the guaranteed minimum payments after February 2, 2001.

respectively.

The Company is engaged in legal proceedings in the normal course of business.
The Company believes that any unfavorable outcome from these suits not covered
by insurance would not have a material adverse effect on the financial
statements of the Company.

14. WARRANTS AND STOCK OPTIONS

Warrants

On October 12, 1999, the Company issued warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share to the Company's financial
adviser in connection with a debt restructuring project. These warrants are
exercisable on or before October 12, 2004.

In December 1997, the Company issued warrants to purchase 100,000 and 62,500
shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.19 per share to another
financial advisor and a lending institution, respectively, as part of the DMS
acquisition. These warrants are exercisable on or before December 31, 2001.

Stock Options

The Company has qualified and nonqualified stock option plans.

In August 1990, the Company adopted the 1990 Incentive Plan which provides for
the granting of Incentive Stock Options ("ISO") and a 1990 Nonstatutory Option
Plan which provides for the grantings of Nonstatutory options ("NSO")
(collectively, "the 1990 Plans"). Under the 1990 Plans, 1,450,000 shares of
Common Stock are authorized for issuance under options that may be granted to
employees. Options are exercisable at a price not less than the market value of
the shares at the date of grant in the case of ISO's, and 85% of the market
value of the shares in the case of NSO's.

The Company maintains a Nonqualified Stock Option Plan ("NSOP") which provides
for the granting of options primarily to employees, directors and others to
purchase, for a period of five years, a maximum of 65,900 common shares at
prices and terms determined by a committee appointed by the Board of Directors.
Options are granted at a price not less than 85% of the market value of the
shares at the date of the grant.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Directors' and Consultants' Stock Option Plan provides for the granting of
options to purchase up to 73,600 common shares to directors and consultants who
are neither principal stockholders, nor receive salary compensation. Prices are
determined as in the Nonqualified Stock Option Plan.

The 1992 Director Stock Plan ("1992 Plan") was amended in June 1998 to eliminate
non-discretionary annual stock awards, to provide stock awards or options as
determined by the Board and to increase the authorized shares to a total of
250,000.

In June 2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan which provides
for the granting of up to 735,000 Common Stock options, stock appreciation
rights, stock units and restricted shares to employees, outside directors and
consultants. Options are exercisable at a price not less than the market value
of the shares at the date of grant in the case of ISO's, and 85% of the market
value of the shares in the case of NSO's. Terms of other securities are
determined by a committee of the Board of Directors. No options were outstanding
under this plan at December 31, 2000.

based on the fair value of the options granted at grant date as prescribed by
SFAS No. 123, net income and diluted income per common share would have been
