ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
         --------

Business Development

Marlton Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") is engaged in the custom design,
production and sale of exhibits and environments for trade shows, museums, theme
parks, themed interiors, arenas, corporate lobbies and retail stores for clients
in industry, government, entertainment and commercial establishments. All of the
Company's operating subsidiaries do business under the name Sparks Exhibits &
Environments (collectively "Sparks"), except, DMS Store Fixtures ("DMS") which
supplies custom made fixtures and displays to national retailers, department
stores and consumer products manufacturers. Currently, all of the Company's
operating revenues are derived from Sparks and DMS.

In August 2003, the Company acquired the assets and specified liabilities of
Exhibit Crafts, Inc., a designer and builder of trade show exhibits, retail
displays and interior environments. As part of that transaction, the Company
also acquired a minority equity interest in International Expo Services, Inc., a
tradeshow freight and installation and dismantle services provider with
facilities in the Los Angeles area and in Las Vegas, which was affiliated with
Exhibit Crafts. Subsequently the Company consolidated its San Diego area Sparks
production operations into the Exhibit Crafts facility in the metropolitan Los
Angeles area.

Business Description

Products and Services

The Company's current business is the custom design, production and sale of
exhibits and environments for trade shows, museums, theme parks, themed
interiors, arenas, corporate lobbies and retail stores for clients in industry,
government, entertainment and commercial establishments. The Company manages
custom trade show projects from concept through final construction, employing
sophisticated graphics and exhibit designers and computer-aided design software
and hardware. In-house facilities provide a wide range of computerized design
and production of graphics. Electronics and audiovisual capabilities include
on-staff electronic specialists and vendor relationships which provide
multi-media equipment and programs, interactive program production and
customized applications. The Company provides full service trade show exhibit
services, including coordination, refurbishing, shipping, storage and marketing
literature distribution. Many clients are Fortune 1000 firms, who typically
contract for custom trade show exhibit projects costing in excess of $200,000.
Additionally, a majority of these clients store their trade show exhibits at a
Company facility, and the Company provides ongoing refurbishing and coordination
of clients' trade show schedules. The Company also represents domestic clients
who desire to exhibit at international trade shows. The Company designs such
exhibits, and through Sparks Europe or an international network of independent
exhibit manufacturers, arranges for the manufacture and delivery of trade show
exhibits to the desired trade show. The Company also designs and manufactures
trade show exhibits for a number of United States subsidiaries of foreign
corporations for use in domestic trade shows. In addition, the Company produces
sophisticated themed exhibits for educational and entertainment venues such as
museums and theme parks. Typically, the customer or its design firm prepares the
design which the Company fabricates using carpentry, sculpture, metal working
and scenic artist skills. The Company also supplies custom store fixtures,
showcases and point of purchase displays for retailers, having the expertise and
capability to take a design from concept to installation. Engineers and
designers work with the customers to develop the fixture design through computer
aided design equipment. Engineering drawings are then produced and provided to
third-party manufacturers with whom the Company has developed long-standing
business relationships for the production of its products. These manufacturers
work closely with an experienced Company project management team. Custom store
fixture opportunities include outfitting new retail stores and remodeling
existing stores, such as specialty apparel chains, department stores, specialty
electronics stores and outlet stores.

                                       3
<PAGE>

Marketing and Distribution

Sales by the Company to domestic customers for both domestic and international
use are solicited through internal sales and marketing groups. Purchase of
sophisticated exhibits and environments usually involves a substantial
expenditure by the customer, and significant expertise is required to properly
meet the customer's needs. Sales personnel are required to be knowledgeable with
respect to the design and manufacturing of sophisticated exhibits and
environments. Sales are typically made directly to the end user of the product
or service. In addition to sales personnel, senior officers devote substantial
attention to sales and marketing activities.

Manufacturing and Raw Materials

The Company designs and manufactures custom trade show exhibits utilizing an
in-house staff of designers, carpenters, electricians and warehouse employees.
Specialty items such as studio production are subcontracted. The Company also
subcontracts the manufacture of exhibits for foreign trade shows. The Company
coordinates shipping, exhibit set-up and removal at the customer's trade show
and, in most cases, subsequently stores the exhibit for the customer. For store
fixture and display products, the Company subcontracts the manufacture and
installation, using a network of manufacturers. Raw materials for custom and
portable exhibits, store fixtures and displays, as well as subcontractors for
specialty work, have historically been available on commercially reasonable
terms from various vendors. Portable exhibit configurations, together with
graphics, are typically designed by the Company for a client and are purchased
from portable exhibit manufacturers for resale. Graphics may be produced
internally or subcontracted. Geographic distribution rights are typically
granted by portable exhibit manufacturers based on annual sales volume levels.
The Company has obtained such distribution rights in certain geographic areas
from Abex Display Systems Inc., its primary source of portable exhibits. The
Company holds a 25% equity interest in Abex.

Seasonality of Business

Trade shows typically occur regularly throughout the year with the exception of
the third quarter when business to business trade shows are traditionally at a
low point. Trade show activities in specific industries, such as health care and
telecommunications, tend to be a function of seasonal show schedules within
those industries. The custom store fixture business tends to be slower during
the fourth and first quarters due to retailers' desires not to install or plan
new fixtures during their traditionally busy year-end season. The Company seeks
new clients and sales people with client bases in different industries to reduce
the effects of the slower sales periods. Additionally, the Company offers other
products and services, such as sales of scenic and themed exhibits,
portable/modular exhibits, and permanent exhibits which tend to be less seasonal
in nature, and in certain cases, manufacturing can be spread over longer periods
of time.

Working Capital

The Company's working capital requirements are fulfilled by funds generated
through operations and a revolving credit facility. Working capital requirements
are generally not affected by project size requirements or accelerated delivery
for major trade show exhibit, scenic and themed exhibit customers due to general
policies of progress billing on larger jobs. However, working capital
requirements are affected by the sale of custom store fixtures which are
generally produced upon receipt of purchase orders from large retailers, but are
held in inventory and are not billed to the customer until delivery.

Significant Customers

One customer, JCPenney, accounted for 15% of the Company's consolidated net
sales in 2003. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on
the Company.

Backlog

The backlog of orders at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $19
million. Generally, backlog of orders are recognized as sales during the
subsequent six month period. The current backlog relates primarily to expected
2004 sales. The Company maintains a client base from which new orders are
continually generated, including refurbishing of existing trade show exhibits
stored in the Company's facilities, large retailers opening or refurbishing
stores, and longer term museum projects.

Competition

The Company competes with numerous other companies offering similar products and
providing similar services, on the basis of price, quality, performance,
financial resources, and client-support services. The custom trade show exhibit,
scenic and themed exhibit, permanent exhibit, retail store fixture and display,
and portable exhibits sales markets include a large number of national and
regional companies, some of which have substantially greater sales and resources
than the Company. In addition to its domestic manufacturing facilities, the
Company utilizes its national and international affiliations and relationships
to meet customers needs in other locales. Due to the lack of specific public
information, the Company's competitive position is difficult to ascertain.

Environmental Protection

The Company's compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating
discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment has not had, and is not expected to have, a
material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive
position.

Employees

The total number of persons employed by the Company is approximately 236 of
which approximately 234 are full-time employees. The Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
operations have a three-year labor contract expiring June 30, 2004, and a
three-year labor contract expiring December 31, 2004, covering an aggregate of
approximately 35 production and fulfillment employees. The Santa Fe Springs,
California operation has a two-year labor contract expiring August 31, 2005,
covering approximately 40 production workers.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
         ----------

The Company currently leases four primary facilities as follows:

   El Cajon, CA                    84,000          Warehouse
</TABLE>

The Company's subsidiaries also have sales, design and project management
offices in the Orlando, Florida, and San Francisco, California, metropolitan
areas. The Company's office, showroom, warehouse and manufacturing facilities
were all in good condition and adequate for 2003, based on normal five-day
operations, and are anticipated to be adequate for operations in 2004, including
any foreseeable internal growth.

The El Cajon, California facility was vacated in August 2003 in connection with
the Company's relocation and consolidation of its West Coast operations (see
Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company currently leases
109,000 square feet from its landlord but has subleased 25,000 square feet of
this facility to an unrelated entity for the remainder of the lease term. The
Company is working with the landlord to find tenants for the remaining 84,000
square feet. Currently a new tenant is under agreement to take 38,000 square
feet of this space.

The Santa Fe Springs, California facility consists of two buildings of 91,000
and 31,000 square feet which are jointly leased with International Expo
Services, Inc. ("IES"), an installation and dismantle company in which the
Company holds a minority equity interest. The Company occupies and pays rent on
the 91,000 square foot building, and IES occupies and pays rent on the 31,000
square foot building.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
         -----------------

The Company from time to time is a defendant and counterclaimant in various
lawsuits that arise out of, and are incidental to, the conduct of its business.
The resolution of pending legal matters should not have a material adverse
effect upon the financial position of the Company.

No dividends were paid during the past two fiscal years. The Company currently
intends to employ all available funds in the business. Future dividend policy
will be determined in accordance with the financial requirements of the
business. However, the Company's loan agreement provides that the Company may
not pay dividends to its shareholders without the lender's prior written consent
and also provides restrictions on the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to
transfer funds to the Company in the form of dividends, loans or advances.

As of March 24, 2004 there were 966 holders of record of the Company's Common
Stock.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INTRODUCTION

The Company's business is the custom design, production and sale of exhibits and
environments for trade shows, museums, theme parks, themed interiors, arenas,
corporate lobbies and retail stores for clients in industry, government,
entertainment and commercial establishments.

Challenges of the past year included the relocation and consolidation of the
Company's West Coast operations and a terminated merger agreement discussed
below. In addition, on February 6, 2004 the Company replaced its credit facility
that would have expired on May 16, 2004 with a new facility expiring on February
6, 2007.

The trade show exhibit industry continues to be very competitive and several of
the Company's competitors have filed for Chapter 11. In addition, the Company's
customer base of primarily Fortune 1000 companies is expected to continue to
closely manage their trade show budgets. This budget management will put
pressure on sales and margins for trade show exhibits and related services. The
Company is negotiating better pricing and terms with its suppliers and pursuing
staff and cost reduction initiatives to mitigate the impact of this industry
trend.

</TABLE>

Total net sales of $65.6 million for 2003 decreased $5.6 million, or 8%, from
total net sales for 2002. This decrease was comprised of a $4.3 million, or 10%,
decrease in sales of trade show exhibits and related services and a $1.3
million, or 5%, decrease in sales of permanent and scenic displays. Selling
prices were relatively constant in 2003 and 2002. Lower sales of trade show
exhibits and related services were primarily due to reductions in certain
customers' trade show marketing budgets, which led to cancelled and reduced
participation in trade shows that these customers attended in the past. The
sales decrease for permanent and scenic displays was principally attributable to
lower sales of store fixtures to national retail customers.

Gross Profit
- ------------
Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, improved to 21.9% in 2003 from 19.9%
in 2002. This improvement was largely due to profit improvement initiatives
implemented in the second half of 2002, which were realized for the full year in
2003. Management continues to pursue cost reduction initiatives, including
operational improvements, supplier renegotiations and staff reductions to offset
the impact of lower sales volume.

Selling Expenses
- ----------------
Selling expenses were $8.5 million in 2003 and in 2002. As a percentage of net
sales, these expenses increased to 13% in 2003 from 11.9% in 2002. The
percentage increase was due, in large part, to the impact of lower sales volume
as compared with certain fixed selling expenses such as sales office and salary
expenses. Cost reduction initiatives implemented near the end of 2003 are
expected to reduce selling expenses in 2004.

<PAGE>

Administrative and General Expenses
- -----------------------------------
Administrative and general expenses of $6.9 million for 2003 increased 1.6% from
such expenses of $6.8 million for 2002. The Company and Redwood Acquisition
Corp. ("Redwood") entered into a merger agreement in February 2003 pursuant to
which all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (other than
the shares held by approximately eight shareholders) would be converted into the
right to receive $0.30 per share. On June 19, 2003, the Company's Board of
Directors approved a termination proposal submitted by Redwood, which terminated
the proposed merger agreement with Redwood. Costs of approximately $250,000
incurred in connection with this proposed merger agreement were charged to
administrative and general expenses in the second and third quarters of 2003.
The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to these
costs incurred in connection with this terminated merger transaction,
integration costs to consolidate the Company's West Coast operations and higher
insurance and telecommunications costs. During the fourth quarter of 2003,
management implemented executive compensation reductions, staff reductions and
further cost cutting initiatives in response to lower sales volume.

Restructuring and other Expense
- -------------------------------
On August 1, 2003, a Company subsidiary acquired the assets of Exhibit Crafts,
Inc., a Los Angeles, CA area manufacturer of trade show exhibits and a 20%
interest in International Exposition Services, Inc., (IES), a trade show
shipping and installation provider. The initial purchase price was $694,000,
including the assumption of certain liabilities totaling $310,000. In addition,
the sellers received 20% of the subsidiary's common stock. The purchase price
approximated the fair value of the net assets acquired. In addition, the asset
purchase agreement provides for contingent aggregate payments of up to $750,000
based on operating performance in 2004, 2005 and 2006. The Company relocated its
San Diego area manufacturing facility to the newly acquired Los Angeles, CA area
facility during the third quarter of 2003. Costs incurred in connection with
this relocation and consolidation were approximately $1.1 million, which
included relocation and employee termination expenses and the Company recorded a
charge for a portion of the remaining lease obligation related to the vacated
San Diego area facility.

Operating Loss
- --------------
The Company incurred an operating loss of $2.2 million in 2003 primarily due to
lower volume and the restructuring costs for the relocation and consolidation of
its West Coast operations.

Other Income (Expense)
- ---------------------
Interest expense decreased to $236,000 in 2003 from $382,000 in 2002 due in part
to lower borrowings and to lower interest rates.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded an impairment loss of
$259,000 related to the investment in its Sparks Europe affiliate.

Benefit From Income Taxes
- -------------------------
In the third quarter of 2003, the Company recognized the benefit of an income
tax refund for $0.4 million related to a change in strategy whereby a net
operating loss was carried back to a prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2002,
the Company established a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets. As
a result, the Company did not record an income tax benefit from the current
period pre-tax loss.

Backlog
- -------
The backlog of orders at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $19
million. Generally, backlog of orders are recognized as sales during the
subsequent six month period. The current backlog relates primarily to expected
2004 sales. The Company maintains a client base from which new orders are
continually generated, including refurbishing of existing trade show exhibits
stored in the Company's facilities.

                                            ======                    ======

Total net sales of $71.2 million for 2002 decreased 8% from total net sales for
2001. Sales of trade show exhibits and related services decreased 10.6%
primarily due to the loss of two trade show exhibit clients and generally weak
economic conditions. Sales of permanent and scenic displays decreased 1.9%,
which was the net result of lower store fixtures sales partially offset by
higher permanent museum display sales.

Gross Profit
- ------------
Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 19.9% in 2002 as
compared with 22.2% in 2001. This decrease was principally attributable to lower
gross profit margins for store fixtures and to shifts in sales mix to lower
margin sales categories. The DMS store fixtures business had an unfavorable
impact on the Company's gross profit in 2002.

Selling Expenses
- ----------------
Selling expenses of $8.5 million decreased to 11.9% of net sales in 2002 from
$9.8 million, or 12.7% of net sales in 2001. This decrease was largely due to
higher permanent museum exhibit sales, which are subject to lower sales
commission expense, and to lower commission expense for store fixtures sales.

Administrative and General Expenses
- -----------------------------------
Administrative and general expenses were reduced to $6.8 million in 2002 from
$7.4 million in 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the adoption of a new
accounting principle discussed below, which eliminated goodwill amortization in
2002. Goodwill amortization in 2001 was $0.8 million. In connection with the DMS
Store Fixtures acquisition, employment agreements were made with two
shareholders of the Company, which provided for guaranteed minimum annual
payments of approximately $0.5 million. These agreements were mutually
terminated in January 2001 eliminating the guaranteed minimum payments after
February 2, 2001, which reduced administrative and general expenses by
approximately $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2001.

Operating Loss
- --------------

The Company reported an operating loss of $1.1 million for 2002 as compared with
an operating loss of $0.1 million for 2001. The increase in operating loss was
principally attributable to lower sales and the lower gross profit percentage in
2002.

The Company's DMS Store Fixtures business unit generated significantly lower
operating profit (loss) in 2002 as compared with 2001. Based on these results
and projections for 2003, an impairment loss of $176,000, included as a
component of the operating loss, was recognized for the net book value of
remaining long-term assets for this business unit.

Other Income (Expense)
- ---------------------
Interest expense decreased to $0.4 million in 2002 from $1.2 million in 2001 as
a result of lower borrowings and lower interest rates.

                                       11
<PAGE>
In the first quarter of 2002, management determined that the Company's
investment in a portable tradeshow exhibit manufacturer was not recoverable,
which resulted in an impairment loss of $1.2 million from investments in
affiliates. A loss of $0.3 million was recognized in 2001 for a write-down of
the Company's investment in its Sparks Europe affiliate.

Provision for (benefit from) income taxes
- -----------------------------------------
The Company established a valuation allowance of $5.4 million for deferred
income tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2002, principally related to a
deferred income tax benefit in connection with the write off of goodwill
recorded in the first quarter of 2002.

The Company also established a valuation allowance for the income tax benefit
from the $1.2 million write down of investments in affiliates recorded in the
first quarter of 2002 because this capital loss is not expected to be offset by
capital gains within the required statutory period. The provision for income
taxes recorded in the first quarter of 2002 also included a valuation allowance
of $191,000 related to a 1999 capital loss incurred in connection with the
Company's investment in a United Kingdom affiliate.

Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
- ---------------------------------------------------
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial of Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142), which supercedes APB No. 17 "Intangible Assets".
SFAS 142 requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings, but instead
be reviewed for impairment. The Company adopted SFAS 142 effective January 1,
2002. This new accounting standard requires a two-step test for operating units
having unamortized goodwill balances. The first step requires a comparison of
the book value of the net assets to the fair value of the respective operating
unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second
step is required to determine the impairment. This second step includes
evaluation of other intangible assets, and any shortfall of the adjusted book
value below fair value determines the amount of the goodwill impairment.
Goodwill amortization expense was $0.8 million in 2001 and in 2000. The adoption
of SFAS 142 reduced goodwill by $15.9 million and net income by $12.4 million
(net of a $3.5 million income tax benefit) in the first quarter of 2002,
identified as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. This
impairment charge related to goodwill recorded in connection with the December
31, 1997 acquisition of DMS Store Fixtures, L.P. This charge differs from the
previous accounting standard method, which was based on undiscounted cash flows,
because the new method is based on fair value measurement estimates as of the
measurement date.

Backlog
- -------
The backlog of orders at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was approximately $19
million and $13 million, respectively. The backlog increase is principally
attributable to a higher level of open orders for permanent and scenic displays
and new customers. Generally, backlog of orders are recognized as sales during
the subsequent six month period. The Company maintains a client base from which
new orders are continually generated, including refurbishing of existing trade
show exhibits stored in the Company's facilities.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

On May 16, 2003, the Company amended its Revolving Credit and Security Agreement
(the "Facility") with its bank to change from and Earnings Before Interest,
Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") basis to an asset-based
arrangement. The Facility provided for borrowing of up to $8 million based on a
percentage of qualified accounts receivable and inventories. The Facility was
collateralized by all the Company's assets and had interest at rates based
primarily on the London Inter Bank Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus 3.25%. The
Facility included certain financial covenants requiring a minimum tangible net
worth and maintenance of certain financial ratios and restricted the Company's
ability to pay dividends. Borrowings under this Facility were $4.9 million at
December 31, 2003.

On February 6, 2004, the Company replaced the Facility with a new credit
facility provided by a commercial asset-based lender. The new credit facility,
which expires on February 6, 2007, provides for borrowing capacity of up to $12

                                       12
<PAGE>
million based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventories.
This new facility bears interest based on the 30-day dealer placed commercial
paper rate plus 4.50% (effective rate of 5.51% at February 6, 2004), restricts
the Company's ability to pay dividends, and includes certain financial covenants
(fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum capital expenditure amount of $1
million in 2004 and $1.25 million in 2005 and in 2006). The Company's borrowing
capacity was $7 million at March 4, 2004. Proceeds from this credit facility are
used primarily for working capital and other capital purposes.

The Company's working capital decreased to $3 million at December 31, 2003 from
$3.5 million at December 31, 2002, largely due to a $0.6 million decrease in
cash and cash equivalents. Available cash and proceeds of $0.9 million from the
Company's credit facility were used for the acquisition discussed ($0.4 million)
and for capital expenditures ($0.9).

The Company has lease commitments for certain facilities under non-cancelable
operating leases. Timing of future lease commitments as well as maturities of
long-term debt are as follows:

The Company jointly leases a 31,000 square foot facility with International Expo
Services, in which the Company holds a minority interest. The annual lease
commitment for this facility is $214,000 through September 22, 2007, which is
not included with the above future operating lease commitments.

The Company leases a facility from a partnership controlled by two shareholders
of the Company. This lease, which contains a renewal option on May 14, 2009 and
expires on May 14, 2019, requires minimum annual rent of $771,000 (included in
the table above) at a fixed rate for the first 10 years, and the Company is
responsible for taxes, insurance and other operating expenses.

OUTLOOK

The Company expects combined sales of trade show exhibits and of permanent and
scenic displays in 2004 to decrease from 2003 levels. The Company's trade show
exhibit client base of Fortune 1000 companies is expected to closely manage
their marketing budgets, which would inhibit the Company's trade show exhibit
sales and margins. The Company expects sales of store fixtures to increase in
2004 from 2003 levels. The Company continues to explore new sales opportunities
while pursuing operating efficiency improvements and cost reduction initiatives
to mitigate the impact of lower sales volume.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 146, "Accounting for Exit or
Disposal Activities" ("SFAS 146"). Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") 146 addresses significant issues regarding the recognition,
measurement, and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal
activities, including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for
pursuant to the guidance that the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") has set
forth in EITF Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." Effective in the first quarter of 2003, the
Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 146. This new accounting principle had an
impact on the timing and recognition of costs associated with the Company's
relocation and consolidation of its West Coast operations (see Note 2).

In 2003, the FASB issues FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities" ("FIN 46") and its amendment FIN 46R. This interpretation
clarifies existing accounting principles related to the preparation of

                                       13
<PAGE>
consolidated financial statements when the equity investors in an entity do not
have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or when the equity
at risk is not sufficient for the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support. FIN 46R requires a company to
evaluate all existing arrangements to identify situations where a company has a
"variable interest" in a "variable interest entity" and further determine when
such variable interests require a company to consolidate the variable interest
entities' financial statement with its own. The Company adopted the provisions
of FIN 46 in connection with the lease agreement with a related partnership and
determined that there was no impact on its financial statements as a result of
the adoption of this new accounting principle.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting For Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150").
SFAS 150 addresses the classification and measurement of certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Company
will continue to evaluate the impact of SFAS 150 on its financial statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Financial statement preparation in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities. One such estimate is possible losses
in connection with financing accounts receivable. Management estimates these
possible losses based on a review of the financial condition and payment history
of specific customers having significant accounts receivable balances, and
establishes a general reserve for the remaining accounts receivable based on
historical bad debt experience.

Revenues on trade show exhibit sales, themed interiors, custom store fixtures
and point of purchase displays are recognized using the completed contract
method. The Company's contracts are typically less than three months in
duration. As a result, the Company's revenue recognition would not differ
materially if another method were used. Progress billings are generally made
throughout the production process. Progress billings which are unpaid at the
balance sheet date are not recognized in the financial statements as accounts
receivable. Progress billings which have been collected on or before the balance
sheet date are classified as customer deposits and are included in accrued
expenses and other current liabilities.

Measurement of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment involves
assumptions and estimates by management on a quarterly basis. The adoption of
SFAS 142 requires estimates of fair values for certain operating units. These
estimates involve discounted cash flow forecasts to determine the fair value of
operating units having unamortized goodwill balances, and also considers the
Company's market capitalization.

The evaluation of deferred income tax assets also involves managements estimates
and judgment. Management considers several factors in this evaluation, including
trailing three year financial performance history and future forecasts of
operating income. A valuation allowance is established based on management's
estimates about the recoverability of deferred income tax assets.

Other significant accounting policies are also important to the understanding of
the Company's financial statements. These policies are discussed in Note 1 to
the consolidated financial statements.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains forward-looking statements. When used in this report, the
words "intends," "believes," "plans," "expects," "anticipates," "probable,"
"could" and similar words are used to identify these forward looking statements.
In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, there are certain important factors that could
cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those included in
such forward-looking statements. Some of the important factors which could cause
actual results to differ materially from those projected include, but are not
limited to: the Company's ability to continue to identify and enter new markets
and expand existing business; continued availability of financing to provide
additional sources of funding for capital expenditures, working capital and
investments; the effects of competition on products and pricing; growth and
acceptance of new product lines through the Company's sales and marketing
programs; changes in material and labor prices from suppliers; changes in
customers' financial condition; the Company's ability to attract and retain
competent employees; the Company's ability to add and retain customers; changes
in sales mix; the Company's ability to integrate and upgrade technology;
uncertainties regarding accidents or litigation which may arise; the financial
impact of facilities consolidations; uncertainties about the impact of the
threat of future terrorist attacks on business travel and related trade show

                                       14

attendance; and the effects of, and changes in the economy, monetary and fiscal
policies, laws and regulations, inflation and monetary fluctuations as well as
fluctuations in interest rates, both on a national and international basis.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
         ---------------------------------------------------------

Fluctuations in interest, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices
do not significantly affect the Company's financial position and results of
operations. The Company's revolving credit facility, bears an interest rate
based on 30-day dealer placed commercial paper rate, plus 4.5%.

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
         -------------------------------------------
The financial statements, together with the report of the Company's independent
accountants thereon, are presented under Item 15 of this report.

ITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON
         ------------------------------------------------
         ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
         -----------------------------------

On November 17, 2003, the Company dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC")
as its independent public accountants and appointed McGladrey and Pullen, LLP
("McGladrey") as its new independent public accountant. The decision to dismiss
PwC and to retain McGladrey was approved by the Company's Audit Committee and
Board of Directors on November 17, 2003.

The reports of PwC on the Company's financial statements for each of the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 did not contain an adverse opinion or
disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty,
audit scope or accounting principles.

During the Company's two most recent fiscal years and through November 17, 2003
there were no disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which
disagreements if not resolved to PwC's satisfaction, would have caused PwC to
make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its
reports.

During the Company's two most recent fiscal years and through November 17, 2003,
there have been no reportable events (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304 (a)
(1) (v)).

The Company provided PwC with a copy of this disclosure and requested that PwC
review such disclosure and provide a letter addressed to the Securities and
Exchange Commission as specified by Item 304(a) (3) of Regulation S-K. Such
letter was filed as Exhibit 16.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K
dated November 17, 2003.

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the subsequent
interim period up to November 17, 2003, the Company did not consult with
McGladrey regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified
transaction, either completed or proposed, (ii) the type of audit opinion that
might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, or (iii) any other
matters or reportable events set forth in Items 304 (a) (1) (iv) and (a) (1) (v)
of Regulation S-K.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
         -----------------------
As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's
management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Company's
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on
this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were
effective, except as discussed in the next paragraph below, in timely alerting
them to material information relating to the Company required to be included in
the Company's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

                                       15
<PAGE>
There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended) during the Company's most recently completed fiscal
quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Subsequent to
the end of the quarter, management determined that the Company's internal
controls were insufficient to prevent the Company's Chief Executive Officer from
causing the Company, through adjustments to accounting records and otherwise, to
confer unauthorized benefits upon himself or upon his behalf. A report prepared
by an independent law firm retained by the audit committee (which report noted
that the Chief Executive Officer's conduct may have been illegal,) concluded
that the amounts involved were relatively minor. The level of benefits so
obtained did not exceed $60,000. All of such benefits have been repaid by the
Chief Executive Officer. The Company has taken a number of steps to improve the
control environment including requiring additional written approvals for (i)
increases in employee compensation, (ii) authorization of travel and (iii)
adjustments to accounting entries related to employee compensation.

                         INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT


Board of Directors and Stockholders
Marlton Technologies, Inc.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Marlton
Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash
flows for the year then ended. Our audit also included the financial statement
schedule for the year ended December 31, 2003 listed in the Index at Item 15.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the December 31, 2003 financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Marlton
Technologies, Inc.and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also,
in our opinion, such financial statement schedule for the year ended December
31, 2003, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders
and Board of Directors of
Marlton Technologies, Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(1) on page 16, present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Marlton Technologies, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2002, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the two years ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 4, the Company adopted a new financial accounting standard
during 2002.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.       SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
         ------------------------------

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Marlton
Technologies, Inc., its wholly and majority owned subsidiaries and the effects
of minority investments in non-consolidated businesses (the "Company").
Investments in affiliates, representing the Company's 20% or more but less than
50% investments are accounted for using the equity method. All inter-company
accounts and transactions are eliminated.

Activity included in the consolidated statements of operations consists
primarily of the custom design, production and sale of exhibits and environments
for trade shows, museums, theme parks, themed interiors, arenas, corporate
lobbies and retail stores for clients in industry, government, entertainment and
commercial establishments.

The Company operates in one segment.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all investments with an initial maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments comprise principally
short-term government funds. At various times throughout the year, the Company
maintains cash balances at banking institutions in excess of FDIC limits.

Account Receivable

Accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made
for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a
quarterly basis. Management estimates these possible losses based on a review of
the financial condition and payment history of specific customers having
significant accounts receivable balances, and establishes a general reserve for
the remaining accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience.
Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of
accounts receivables previously written off are recorded when received. A trade
receivable is considered to be past due if any portion of the receivable balance
is outstanding for more than 90 days. Interest is not charged on trade
receivables that are considered past due.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market and
include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead costs.

Long-Lived Assets

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets,
ranging primarily from 3 to 10 years. Assets and accumulated depreciation
accounts are reduced for the sale or other disposition of property, and the
resulting gain or loss is included in income. Rental assets, which include
manufactured and purchased exhibit components, are stated at cost. Depreciation
for rental assets is recorded on a straight-line basis over seven years.

Prior to January 1, 2002 the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets
acquired (goodwill) was amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging
from 5 to 30 years. After January 1, 2002, no amortization is recorded for these
assets.

Included in other assets are loan origination fees, which are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the related debt agreement.

The Company's policy is to record an impairment loss against long-lived assets,
including investment in affiliates, property and equipment, goodwill and other

                                       27

intangibles, in the period when it is determined that the carrying amount of
such assets may not be recoverable. This determination includes evaluation of
factors such as current market value, future asset utilization, business climate
and future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the net
assets. For the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded an impairment loss
of $259,000 related to the investment in its Sparks Europe affiliate. During
2002, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $176,000 associated with the
property and equipment of its DMS subsidiary.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues on trade show exhibit sales, themed interiors, custom store fixtures
and point of purchase displays are recognized using the completed contract
method. The Company's contracts are typically less than three months in
duration. As a result, the Company's revenue recognition would not differ
materially if another method were used. Progress billings are generally made
throughout the production process. Progress billings which are unpaid at the
balance sheet date are not recognized in the financial statements as accounts
receivable. Progress billings which have been collected on or before the balance
sheet date are classified as customer deposits and are included in accrued
expenses and other current liabilities. Billings for shipping and handling are
recorded as revenue and the related costs are included in the cost of sales.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the future
tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements
or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated based on the
difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates in effect during the years in
which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is
established based on the future recoverability of deferred tax assets.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company's financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit
risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts
receivable. The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments with high
quality financial institutions. The Company's accounts receivable are primarily
with customers throughout the United States. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally requires
progress payments which mitigate its loss exposure.

One customer, JCPenney, accounted for 15%, 20% and 11% of the Company's
consolidated net sales in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The loss of this
customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Stock-Based Compensation

Compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the
quoted market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant above the amount
an employee must pay to acquire the stock granted under the option.

The Company adopted the disclosure - only provisions of SFAS 123, "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation." The Company will continue to apply the provisions
of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25 in accounting for its stock option
plans. If the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the
fair value of the options granted at grant date as prescribed by SFAS 123, net
income and diluted income per common share would have been reduced to the pro
forma amount as follows:

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt.
The recorded values of cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair value
due to the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of long-term debt
is estimated based on current interest rates offered to the Company for similar
remaining maturities. The recorded value of these financial instruments
approximate their fair value at December 31, 2003 and 2002.

Per Share Data

Basic net income per common share is calculated using the average shares of
common stock outstanding, while diluted net income per common share reflects the
potential dilution that could occur if stock options and warrants having
exercise prices below market prices were exercised.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 146, "Accounting for Exit or
Disposal Activities" ("SFAS 146"). Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") 146 addresses significant issues regarding the recognition,
measurement, and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal
activities, including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for
pursuant to the guidance that the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") has set
forth in EITF Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." Effective in the first quarter of 2003, the
Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 146. This new accounting principle had an
impact on the timing and recognition of costs associated with the Company's
relocation and consolidation of its West Coast operations (see Note 2).

In 2003, the FASB issues FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities" ("FIN 46") and its amendment FIN 46R. This interpretation

                                       29
<PAGE>

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

clarifies existing accounting principles related to the preparation of
consolidated financial statements when the equity investors in an entity do not
have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or when the equity
at risk is not sufficient for the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support. FIN 46R requires a company to
evaluate all existing arrangements to identify situations where a company has a
"variable interest" in a "variable interest entity" and further determine when
such variable interests require a company to consolidate the variable interest
entities' financial statement with its own. The Company adopted the provisions
of FIN 46 in connection with the lease agreement with a related partnership and
determined that there was no impact on its financial statements as a result of
the adoption of this new accounting principle.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting For Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150").
SFAS 150 addresses the classification and measurement of certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Company
will continue to evaluate the impact of SFAS 150 on its financial statements.

2.   ACQUISITION AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS
     -----------------------------------
On August 1, 2003, a Company subsidiary acquired the assets of Exhibit Crafts,
Inc., a Los Angeles, CA area manufacturer of trade show exhibits and a 20%
interest in International Exposition Services, Inc., (IES), a trade show
shipping and installation provider. The initial purchase price was $694,000,
including the assumption of certain liabilities totaling $310,000. In addition,
the sellers received 20% of the Company subsidiary's common stock. The purchase
price approximated the fair value of the net assets acquired. In addition, the
asset purchase agreement provides for contingent payments of up to $750,000
based on operating performance in 2004, 2005 and 2006. The Company relocated its
San Diego area manufacturing facility to the newly acquired Los Angeles, CA area
facility during the third quarter of 2003. Costs incurred in connection with
this relocation and consolidation were approximately $1.1 million, which
included relocation and employee termination expenses and the Company recorded a
charge for a portion of the remaining lease obligation related to the vacated
San Diego area facility.

3. TERMINATED MERGER AGREEMENT:
   ----------------------------
The Company and Redwood Acquisition Corp.("Redwood") entered into a merger
agreement in February 2003 pursuant to which all of the outstanding shares of
common stock of the Company (other than the shares held by approximately eight
shareholders) would be converted into the right to receive $0.30 per share. On
June 19, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors approved a termination proposal
submitted by Redwood, which terminated the proposed merger agreement with
Redwood. Costs of approximately $250,000 incurred in connection with this
proposed merger agreement were charged to administrative and general expenses in
the second and third quarters of 2003.

4.   ACCOUNTING CHANGE (ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 142)

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142), which
eliminates amortization of these assets and requires annual testing for
impairment. The Company's reporting units for purposes of applying the
provisions of SFAS 142 are the DMS Store Fixtures business ("DMS") and the
Sparks Exhibits & Environments businesses ("Sparks"). SFAS 142 requires a
comparison of the reporting unit's fair value, which is determined based on
discounted cash flows, to its carrying value to determine potential impairment.
If the fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is
recognized.

11.      DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On May 16, 2002, the Company amended its Revolving Credit and Security Agreement
(the "Facility") to change from an EBITDA basis to an asset-based arrangement.
The amended Facility provided for borrowings based on a percentage of qualified
accounts receivable and a percentage of up to $6.7 million of qualified
inventories. The Facility was collateralized by all the Company's assets and had
interest at rates based primarily on the London Inter Bank Offering Rate (LIBOR)
plus 3.25%. The Facility included certain financial covenants requiring a
minimum tangible net worth and maintenance of certain financial ratios and
restricted the Company's ability to pay dividends. Borrowings under this
Facility were $4.9 million at December 31, 2003. The Company's borrowing
capacity under the Facility was $8 million at December 31, 2003. The interest
rates charged during 2003 ranged from 4.28% to 4.63%. The Company had a letter
of credit in the amount of $160,000 outstanding at December 31, 2003, which was
collateralized by a cash escrow account on January 26, 2004 in connection with
the credit facility replacement described below.

On February 6, 2004, the Company replaced the Facility with a new credit
facility provided by a commercial asset-based lender. The new credit facility,
which expires on February 6, 2007, provides for borrowing capacity of up to $12
million based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventories.
This new facility bears interest based on the 30-day dealer placed commercial
paper rate plus 4.50% (effective rate of 5.51% at February 6, 2004), restricts
the Company's ability to pay dividends, and includes certain financial covenants
(fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum capital expenditure amount).

The Company's debt obligations at December 31, consist of the following:

granting of Incentive Stock Options ("ISO") and a 1990 Nonstatutory Option Plan
which provides for the grantings of Nonstatutory options ("NSO") (collectively,
"the 1990 Plans"). Under the 1990 Plans, 1,450,000 shares of Common Stock are
authorized for issuance under options that may be granted to employees. Options
are exercisable at a price not less than the market value of the shares at the
date of grant in the case of ISO's, and 85% of the market value of the shares in
the case of NSO's.

In 1992, the Company adopted the 1992 Directors' and Consultants' Stock Option
Plan (the "1992 Plan") which provides for the granting of options to purchase up
to 50,000 common shares to directors and consultants who are neither principal
stockholders, nor receive salary compensation. Prices are determined as in the
1990 Plan. The 1992 Plan was amended in June 1998 to eliminate non-discretionary
annual stock awards, to provide stock awards or options as determined by the
Board and to increase the authorized shares to a total of 250,000.

In 2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2000 Plan")
which provides for the granting of up to 735,000 Common Stock options, stock
appreciation rights, stock units and restricted shares to employees, outside
directors and consultants. Prices are determined as in the 1990 Plan. Terms of
other securities are determined by a committee of the Board of Directors.

In 2001, the Company adopted the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2001 Plan")
which provides for the granting of up to 2,000,000 Common Stock options and
restricted shares to employees, outside directors and consultants. Options are
exercisable at a price not less than the market value of the shares at the date
of grant in the case of ISO's. Terms of other securities are determined by a
committee of the Board of Directors.

Options have been granted to employees outside of the foregoing plans as an
incentive to accept employment with the Company, and the amount of options so
granted does not exceed of 5% of the Company's outstanding shares of Common
stock.

</TABLE>

In the fourth quarter 2002, the Company established a valuation allowance of $7
million to fully reserve for its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2002.
This allowance was based on an evaluation of several factors, including prior
years' actual operating results and projected operating results. The net change
in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was a decrease of $840,000
during 2003. The decrease relates to the utilization of prior year net operating
losses, which were carried back during 2003. The Company has available
approximately $5.6 million of net operating loss carry forwards, which begin to
expire in 2016.

                              SECOND AMENDMENT TO,
                   AND PARTIAL TERMINATION OF, LEASE AGREEMENT

         THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO, AND PARTIAL TERMINATION OF, LEASE AGREEMENT
(the "Second Amendment"), is entered into as of January 1, 2004, by and between
GILLESPIE FIELD PARTNERS, LLC, a California limited liability company
("Landlord") and SPARKS EXHIBITS, LTD., a California corporation ("Tenant"),
with reference to the following facts:

         A. Landlord and Tenant are all of the parties to that certain Lease
Agreement dated as of June 29, 1998 (the "Lease"), wherein Landlord leased to
Tenant certain real property located at 2025 Gillespie Way, El Cajon,
California, having located thereon a single industrial building (the "Building")
containing approximately 150,159 square feet of space (the "Original Premises").

         B. Subsequent to execution of the Lease, Tenant's business requirements
have changed and Tenant has requested that Landlord assist Tenant in locating
tenants to lease portions of the Original Premises. In accordance with Tenant's
request, Landlord previously identified G.T.M. Wholesale Liquidators Inc.
("GTM") as a prospective tenant to lease a portion of the Original Premises
comprising approximately 40,694 square feet (the "GTM Premises") and Landlord
and Tenant have previously entered into that certain First Amendment to Lease
Agreement and Agreement dated as of October 31, 2003 (the "First Amendment"),
whereby Landlord and Tenant have agreed to mutually cooperate and undertake to
pay for and perform certain obligations with respect to the GTM Premises.

         C. Upon the fulfillment and satisfaction of certain terms, provisions
and conditions set forth in the First Amendment, Landlord and Tenant agreed to
mutually terminate the Lease with respect only to the portion of the Original
Premises which is comprised of the GTM Premises. Subject to payment by Tenant of
remaining amounts required by the First Amendment, such terms, provisions and
conditions set forth in the First Amendment have been fulfilled and satisfied
and, accordingly, Landlord and Tenant desire to memorialize the partial
termination of the Lease with respect to the GTM Premises and to otherwise amend
certain terms and provisions of the Lease affected by such partial termination.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, agreements
and undertakings contained in this Second Amendment and the exchange of other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

         1. Definitions. Unless defined in this Second Amendment, or except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Second Amendment, capitalized terms
utilized in this Second Amendment shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms
in the Lease.

         2. Mutual Partial Termination of the Lease; Effective Date. Pursuant
to, and in accordance with, Section 4 of the First Amendment ("Section 4"),
Landlord and Tenant hereby agree and acknowledge that (i) subject to payment by
Tenant of remaining amounts required by the First Amendment, all terms,
provisions and conditions of Section 4 which were required to be fulfilled and
satisfied in order for the Lease to be partially terminated have been fulfilled
and satisfied, (ii) effective as of January 1, 2004 (the "Effective Date"), the
Lease is partially terminated with respect only to the portion of the Original
Premises which is comprised of the GTM Premises (the "Partial Termination"),
(iii) this Second Amendment is intended by Landlord and Tenant to constitute the
"mutually acceptable written instrument" referred to in Section 4 of the First
Amendment, which Section 4 contemplates is to be entered into by Landlord and
Tenant partially terminating and amending the Lease and (iii) the Lease is
amended and modified in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Second
Amendment. Notwithstanding Landlord's agreement with Tenant to partially
terminate the Lease as of the Effective Date, as aforesaid, Tenant shall remain
obligated and liable for Tenant's share of costs and expenses set forth in the
First Amendment as fully and finally determined. Landlord has previously
provided Tenant with good faith estimates of the costs and expenses described
and set forth in Section 3 of the First Amendment and Section 6 of the First
Amendment. As soon as practicable following the execution of this Second

<PAGE>

Amendment, Landlord shall use its good faith best efforts to provide Tenant with
a breakdown of the final costs and expenses required to be paid by Tenant
pursuant to the First Amendment, accompanied by reasonable supporting
documentation and the parties will discharge their respective responsibilities
with respect thereto in accordance with all terms and provisions of the First
Amendment.

         3. Specific Amendments to the Lease. Effective as of the Effective
Date, the Lease is hereby amended only in the following specific respects:

                  3.1 Definition of Premises. The definition of the "Premises",
for all purposes of the Lease, shall refer to, and be deemed to refer to, the
Original Premises reduced by the portion of the Original Premises which

depicted in the amended Exhibit A attached to this Second Amendment, which
Exhibit A amends, supersedes and replaces in its entirety, original Exhibit A to
the Lease.

                  3.2 Parking. The requirement, in Section 1.1 of the Lease,
that the Premises contain not less than 200 parking spaces is hereby amended to

to provide: "Tenant shall pay as additional rent utilities, taxes, insurance,
repairs, maintenance or other charges, as described and in the manner provided
in Article 9 and common area expenses, as described and in the manner provided
in Article 11".

                  (b) The first sentence of Section 8.1 of the Lease shall be

or which become a lien upon or become chargeable against or payable in
connection with the Property, including without limitation, charges which are
attributable to common areas; provided, however, that with respect to (i)
alterations, improvements or additions to the Premises placed in or upon the
Premises or the Property by Tenant or at Tenant's request, (ii) installation of

Lease by Tenant or at Tenant's request, and/or (iii) any other matter which, as
a result of Tenant's actions, or Tenant's request, in each of the foregoing
cases described in subclauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 10.2 , results
in an increase in real estate taxes assessed or imposed, or which become a lien
upon or become chargeable against or payable in connection with the Property,
Tenant shall bear such increase, lien or charge fully rather than Tenant's
prorata share (as provided in Section 11.2 hereof). Similarly, with respect to

or the request by a tenant(s) other than Tenant, results in an increase in real
estate taxes assessed or imposed, or which become a lien upon or become
chargeable against or payable in connection with the Property, Tenant shall have
no responsibility or obligation therefor (prorata or otherwise)."

                  (d) The second sentence of Section 11.2 of the Lease shall be

the extent, necessary to give effect to the First Amendment and this Second
Amendment, the Lease is deemed amended and modified. Except to the limited
extent amended and modified hereby, the Lease is ratified and confirmed in all

Amendment shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a waiver of any other provision,
whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. No
failure to enforce any right or provision hereunder shall preclude or affect the
later enforcement of such right or provision. No waiver shall be binding unless

                                 LEASE AGREEMENT

between Woodlands Joint Venture No. V534-3, a Georgia Partnership, hereafter
referred to as "Lessor' and Sparks Exhibits Inc. a Georgia Corporation,
hereafter referred to as "Lessee":

                                   WITNESSETH:

        1. LEASED PREMISES: In consideration of the rents, terms, provisions and
covenants to this Lease, Lessor hereby leases, lets and demises to Lessee the
following described premises (sometimes referred to as "Leased Premises") see
Exhibit "A" attached hereto and by this reference made a part hereof and
containing approximately 80,876 square feet located in that certain building
known as 8125 Troon Circle, Austell, Georgia 30001, (the "building") located on
that certain tract of land more particularly identified on exhibit "B" attached
hereto and made a part hereof (the "Property"), said Property being a part of
that certain development known as "Woodlands at Riverside" (the "Park").

        2. TERM: (a) Subject to and upon the conditions set forth below, the
term of this Lease shall commence on October 1, 1993, (sometimes referred to as
"Commencement Date") and shall terminate one hundred twenty, 120 months

        (b) Within thirty (30) days after the Commencement Date, Lessor and
Lessee will execute and deliver a Commencement Date Agreement in the form
attached as Exhibit "F" and by this reference made a part hereof, with the
blanks appearing thereon completed in accordance with the provisions of this
Lease in order to memorialize the Commencement date and expiration date of this
Lease.

        3. RENT: (a) Lessee agrees to pay Lessor the sum of $2,561,746.92 as the
total base rental for the term of this Lease. Lessee agrees to pay such total
base rental in monthly installments of (See Exhibit "D", Special Stipulations,
paragraph number one (1), which amounts shall be due and payable to Lessor in
advance, without deduction or setoff, prior notice or demand at the address
shown below on the first day of each and every month (1) following the
Commencement Date for the entire term of the Lease. One monthly installment of
base rental installments being paid in accordance with the foregoing; provided,
that if the Commencement Date should be a date other than the first day of a
calendar month, the monthly installment of base rental for such month shall be
prorated to the end of that calendar month, and thereafter, all succeeding
monthly installments of base rental shall be due and payable on of before the
first day of each succeeding calendar month during the demised term. Lessee
shall pay, as additional rental, all other sums due under this Lease as provided
for hereunder.

        (b) Intentionally omitted.

        (c) If any increase of the fire insurance premiums paid by Lessor for
the Building in which Lessee occupies space is caused by Lessee's use and
occupancy of the Leased Premises, of if Lessee vacates the Leased Premises
during the lease term and causes an increase in such premiums, then Lessee shall
pay in additional rental the entire amount of such increase to Lessor. Lessor
warrants that, as of the date of this Lease, Lessee's use of the Leased Premises
for the purposes of office, warehouse, showroom and the production and storage
of trade show products shall not cause any increase of the fire insurance
premiums paid by Lessor for the Building in which Lessee occupies space. Lessee
recognizes and agrees that said warranty is strictly limited to premium
increases which would take place as of the date of this Lease when taking into
account Lessor's Insurer's present premium calculation policies and is in no way
intended to be a warranty as to possible increases which may occur in the
future, for whatever reason, including, but not limited to, changes in the
policies or underwriting standards of Lessor's present insurer or any future
insurer.

(1) as set forth in Exhibit "D" Special Stipulations paragraph No. 1.

<PAGE>

          (d) Other remedies for nonpayment of rent notwithstanding. If the
monthly rental payment is not received by Lessor on or before the tenth day of
the month for which rent is due, or if any other payment due Lessor by Lessee is
not received by Lessor on or before the tenth day of the month next following
the month in which Lessee was invoiced, a service charge of five percent (5%) of
such past due amount shall become due and payable in addition to such amounts
owed under this Lease. (1)

          (e)  In the event the operating expenses (as defined below) of Lessor
for the Building, Property, and/or Park of which the Leased Premises are a
part shall, in any calendar year during the term of this Lease. (1a) exceed the
sum of $.15 per square foot, Lessee agrees to pay as additional rental Lessee's
pro rata share of such excess operating expenses. Lessor shall, following the
close of any calendar year for which additional rental is due under this
paragraph, invoice Lessee for the additional rental. The invoices shall include
in reasonable detail all computations of the additional rental, and Lessee
agrees to pay the additional rental within ten (2) days following receipt of the
invoice. If this Lease shall terminate on a day other than the last day of a
year, the amount of any additional rental payable by Lessee applicable to the
year in which such termination shall occur shall be prorated on the ratio that
the number of days from the commencement of such year to and including such
termination date bears to 365. If at any time during the term of this Lease,
Lessor has reason to believe the per square foot operating expenses for the
calendar year will exceed the sum set forth above, Lessor may by invoice direct
Lessee to prepay monthly one-twelfth of an amount equal to the additional rental
due for the previous year. If the invoice delivered following the close of the
calendar year in accordance with this subparagraph 3(e) shows an amount owing by
Lessee that is less than the sum of the monthly payments made by Lessee in the
previous calendar year, the invoice shall be accompanied by a credit (3) for the
excess from the Lessor to the Lessee. If such invoice shows an amount owing by
Lessee which is more than the sum of the monthly payments made by Lessee in  the
previous calendar year. Lessee shall pay such deficiency to Lessor within ten
(3) days after receipt of the invoice. During the year in which this lease
terminates, Lessor shall have the option to invoice Lessee for the Lessee's pro
rate share of the excess operating expenses based upon the previous year's
excess operating expenses: Lessor shall invoice Lessee under this option within
thirty days prior to the termination of the Lease or at any time thereafter. In
the event Lessee reasonably believes the additional rental amounts charged to it
based on its pro rate share of operating expenses are in error, Lessee shall
have the right to request additional documentation substantiating such operating
expenses. The obligation to pay such additional rental amounts shall survive the
termination of this Lease. For all purposes of this Lease, the term "Pro Rata
Share" shall refer to the ratio of the total floor area of the Leased Premises
to the total floor of the Building or Park whichever is applicable in such
instance. (4)

          (f) The term "operating expenses" as used above means all actual costs
and expenses paid or incurred by Lessor or on its behalf in connection with the
maintenance, management, operation, repair (including the items in subparagraph
7 (a) below (4a)), cleaning, security and landscaping of the common areas of the
Property and Building including, without limitation, the Property's share of
common area charges and assessments with respect to the Park. The term
"operating expenses" also includes all real property taxes and installments of
special assessments, including special assessments due to dead restrictions
and/or owners' associations, which accrue against the Building and/or Property
of which the Leased Premises are a part during the term of this Lease as well as
all insurance premiums Lessor is required to pay or deems (5) necessary to pay,
with respect to the Building and/or Property. The term "operating expenses" does
not include any capital improvement to the Building and/or Property of which the
Leased Premises are a part, not shall it include repairs, restoration or other
work occasioned by fire, windstorm or other casualty, income and franchise taxes
of Lessor, leasing commissions, expenses for the renovating of space for new
tenants, interest or principal payments on any mortgage or other indebtedness of
Lessor.

          (g) Lessor and Lessee agree that no portion of the base rental, rent
adjustments for operating expense, or additional rental paid by Lessee during
the portion of the term of this Lease occurring after the expiration of any
period during which such amounts were abated shall be allocated, for income tax
purposes, by Lessor or Lessee to such abatement period, nor are such amounts
intended by the parties to be allocable, for income tax purposes, to any
abatement period.

          4. SIGNS: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the
Lease, signage rights will be provided on the front of the building (6). The
actual sign and its respective installation cost shall be at the expense of the
Lessee and shall conform to Riverside Architectural covenants (7). Lessee shall
be responsible for any damage to the Building occasioned by the installation of
any such signs. Lessee shall place no sign upon the roof of the Leased Premises
or Building, nor any part of the roof, including the flashing or gutters of the
Leased Premises or Building. Lessee shall repair any damage to the Building

<PAGE>

caused thereby, including, but not limited to discoloration. Excepting "force
majeure", Lessee shall be required to install identification signage within
ninety (90) days of the commencement, subject to the aforementioned conditions
and limitations. The provisions hereof shall survive the termination of this
Lease.

        5. USAGE: (A) Lessee warrants and represents to Lessor that the Leased
Premises shall be used and occupied only for the purpose of office, warehouse,
showroom and the production and storage of products and no other purposes.
Outside storage, including, without limitation, trucks and other vehicles, is
prohibited without Lessor's prior written consent. Without Lessor's prior
written consent, Lessee shall not receive, store, or otherwise handle any
substance, product, material or merchandise which is explosive or highly
flammable, toxic or hazardous. Lessee shall occupy the Leased Premises, conduct
its business and control its agents, employees, invitees and visitors in such a
manner as is lawful, reputable and will not create any nuisance or otherwise
interfere with, annoy or disturb any other tenant in its normal business
operations or Lessor in its management of the Building. Lessee shall not commit,
or suffer to be committed, any waste on the Leased Premises, Lessee shall not
permit the Leased Premises to be used in any way which would render void the
fire insurance on the Leased Premises or contents of the or contents of the
Building. (8)

(1)       Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessor agrees to notify Lessee in the
          even a monthly rental payment or any other payment is past due in
          accordance with this paragraph. The Lessee has two (2) business days
          to cure such past due payment before a service charge of 5% shall
          become due.

(2)       twenty (20)
(3)       refund
(4)       Lessor represents that Lessee's estimated expense of the pro-rata

to the present value by using a discount rate equal to ten percent (10%)
annually. Upon such acceleration of such amounts, Lessee agrees to pay the same
at once, together with the total rental and other amount theretofore due, at

<PAGE>

Lessor's address as provided herein; provided, however, that such payment shall
not constitute a penalty or forfeiture but shall constitute liquidated damages
for Lessee's failure to comply with the terms and provisions of this Lease.

         Any specification herein of Lessor's remedies shall not be deemed to be
exclusive; but said remedies shall be in addition to all other remedies in its
favor, howsoever existing, and shall be accumulative. (4)

(1) after ten (10) days written notice to Lessee. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Lessee shall only be entitled to written notice of Lessor's failure to receive
any installment due, two (2) times during each lease year.
(1a) or if such default cannot be cured within said thirty (30) day period, then
such longer period as may be reasonably necessary provided Lessee diligently and
continuously pursues such cure
(2) and does not have such lien removed within
thirty (30) days after written notice of the existence of said lien by Lessor to
Lessee
(3) reasonable
(4) Notwithstanding any other language continued in this
paragraph 23 or elsewhere in this lease to the contrary, it is understood and
agreed that should an event of default occur within the initial sixty (60)
months of the term hereof and as a result Lessor elects to proceed under any of
the remedies provided for in subparagraphs 23 (a0 (b) (c) or (d) or any other
remedy provided for by law or in equity, this lease shall be deemed to be for
sixty (60) months ending September 30, 1998. Lessee's obligations with respect
to any such event of default shall be limited to only those remedies, and
damages relating to and/or rental amounts becoming due during the initial sixty
960) months of the term hereof.

         24 WAIVER OF DEFAULT OR REMEDY: Failure of Lessor to declare an event
of default immediately upon its occurrence, or delay in taking any action in
connection with an event of default, shall not constitute a waiver of the
default, but Lessor shall have the right to declare the default at any time (1)
and take such action as is lawful or authorized under this lease. Pursuit of any
one or more of the remedies set forth in paragraph 23 above shall not preclude
pursuit of any one or more of the other remedies provided elsewhere in this
Lease or provided by law, nor shall pursuit of any remedy provided constitute
forfeiture or waiver of any rent or damages accruing to Lessor by reasons of the
violation of any of the terms, provisions or covenants of this Lease. Failure by
Lessor to enforce one or more of the remedies provided upon an event of default
shall not be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of the default or of any
other violation or breach of any of the terms, provisions and covenants
contained in this Lease.

         25 ACTS OF GOD: Neither Lessor nor Lessee shall be required to perform
any covenant or obligation in this Lease, or be liable in damages to Lessee, so
long as the performance or non-performance of the covenant or obligation is
delayed, caused by or prevented by an act of God or force majoure. (2)

         26 ATTORNEY'S FEES: In the event either party employs an attorney to
enforce or defend any claim or cause of action relating to this Lease, the
prevailing party therein shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's
fees (2a) and costs from the other, and the other shall so pay.

         27 HOLDING OVER:In the event of holding over by Lessee after the
expiration or termination of this Lease, the hold over shall be as a "tenant at
sufferance" and all of the terms and all of the terms and provisions of this
Lease shall be applicable during that period, except that Lessee shall pay
Lessor as rental for the period of such hold over an amount equal to (3) of the
rent which would have been payable by Lessee had the hold over period been a
part of the original term of this Lease. Lessee agrees to vacate and deliver the
Lease Premises to Lessor upon Lessee's receipt of notice from Lessor to vacate.
The rental payable during the hold over period shall be payable to Lessor on
demand. No holding over by Lessee, whether with or without consent of Lessor,
shall operate to extend this Lease except as otherwise expressly provided.

interest under this Lease to any first mortgage or security deed lien hereafter
placed on the Leased premises, and Lessee agrees upon demand to execute
additional instruments subordinating this Leasse as Lessor may require. If the
interests of Lessor under this Lease shall be transferred by reason of
foreclosure or other proceedings for enforcement of any first mortgage or
security deed on the Leased Premises, Lessee shall be bound to the transferee

terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease for the balance of the term
remaining, and any extensions or renewals, with the same force and effect as if

any such mortgage if it be the Purchaser, as its Lessor. (4)

Premises; the Lease Premises are acceptable; the Lease is in full force and
effect; the Lease is unmodified; Lessee claims no present charge, lien, or claim
of offset against rent; the rent is paid for the current month, but is not
prepaid for more than one month and will not be prepaid for more than one month
in advance; there is no existing default by reason of some act or omission be
Lessor; and such other matters as may be reasonable required by Lessor or
Lessor's mortgagee.

         30 SUCCESSORS: This Lease shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of Lessor and Lessee and their respective heirs, personal
representatives, successors and assigns. It is hereby covenanted and agreed that
should Lessor's interest in the Leased Premises cease to exist for any reason

          environment filed and recorded August 19, 1987 in Book 572, Page 621
          of Cobb County and the Declaration of Protective Covenants and
          Restrictions for Riverside...a business environment (The Woodlands)
          filed and recorded October 20, 1989, in Book 5516, Page 0286 of Cobb
          County and any amendments to the above referenced covenants that may
          be required from time to time. Lessor warrants that such requirements
          will not materially interfere with Lessee's use of the Leased
          Premises.

3.        LESSEE'S CONCELLATION OPTION: Lessee shall have the option to
          terminate this Lease effective September 30, 1998 upon the following
          terms and conditions:

          (a) Lessee shall give Lessor at least nine (9) months prior written
              notice of Lessee's election to cancel the Lease pursuant to this
              Section 3. Any such notice, to be effective, must be received by

4.        CONSENT TO SUBLEASE TO GRAFX:  Notwithstanding the language contained
          in paragraph 20 hereof, Lessor hereby consents to the subletting by
          Lessee of a portion of the Leased Premises, not to exceed 10,000
          square feet, to Grafx, Inc. and agrees to waive its interest in the
          potential rental overages to be paid by Grafx to Lessee.  It is
          understood and agreed that Grafx inc. is a subcontractor of Lessee
          performing certain commercial graphics work for Lessee and it is of
          substantial benefit to Lessee to have Grafx Inc. located in space
          readily accessible to Lessee.  In granting its consent to this limited
          subletting, Lessor has in no way limited or waived its rights in
          relation to any additional proposed assignment or subletting of space
          and any additional subletting or assignment made by Lessee shall
          require the prior written consent of Lessor.  In addition, Lessor's
          consent to the sublease in no way reduces Lessee's obligation to pay
          the full rental, additional rental and other amounts due hereunder.
          Furthermore, Lessee shall be responsible for monitoring Grafx Inc.'s
          occupancy of the Leased Premises to ensure that Grafx inc. complies
          with each and every term and provision of this Lease.

5.        RIGHT OF FIRST OFFERING: (a) Provided that the Lessee is not in
          default under the term of this Lease Agreement and has not assigned or
          sublet all or any portion of the Leased Premises, excepting the
          sublease previously approved herein for Grafx, Lessor hereby grants to
          Lessee the right to lease approximately 10,000 square feet in the
          Building adjacent to the Leased Premises in accordance with the terms
          and conditions set forth in this section.

<PAGE>

          (b) In the event Lessor has a bonafide prospective tenant
              ("Prospect") interested in leasing all or any portion of the space
              outlined on Exhibit "G" attached hereto (the "Expansion Space"),
              Lessor shall so advise Lessee in writing of the interest of such
              Prospect (the "Lessor's Notice"). Lessee shall have ten (10)
              business days from receipt of Lessor's Notice within which to
              advise Lessor that it exercises the right to Lease the Expansion
              Space in accordance with the terms of this section ("Lessee's
              Notice"). In the event Lessee shall fail to deliver Lessee's
              Notice to Lessor within said the (10) business day period, then
              all right granted to Lessee hereunder shall terminate and be of no
              further force and effect. Upon delivery of Lessee's Notice, Lessee
              shall be entitled to lease the Expansion Space in its entirety
              under the terms of this Lease except as follows in subparagraph
              (c) below:

          (c) In the event Lessee exercises the right to lease the Expansion
              Space, the per square foot rental rate for the Expansion Space
              shall be equal to the per square foot rental rate being paid for
              the original Leased Premises at the time the Lessee leases such
              expansion space and shall continue thereafter in accordance with
              the Exhibit "D" Special Stipulation paragraph1. The Lessor shall
              construct standard warehouse heat, light, electrical and a
              warehouse demising wall in the Expansion Space and no other tenant
              improvements. The term for the Expansion Space shall be co-
              terminous with that of the original Lease Premises.

 6.  LANDLORD'S WAIVER: As an accommodation to Lessee and in order to facilitate
     the conducting of Lessee's business within the Leased premises, Lessor
     agrees to execute and deliver, at any time during the term hereof, such
     document or documents as may be reasonably required by Lessee's
     institutional lenders evidencing the waiver by Lessor of any lien rights
     which Lessor might have in and to all personalty and trade fixture items of
     Lessee which might now or hereafter be located within the Leased Premises.

         immediate and not conditional or contingent upon the pursuit of any
         remedies against Lessee or any other person or entity, and Guarantor

         obligations or Guarantor hereunder;

                                            point for each percentage point that the dilution of such Borrower's
                                            Accounts (calculated by Lender as the average dilution over the most

                                            with this Agreement, valued on a first-in, first-out basis (at the

                                            of advances outstanding at any time against all Borrowers' Eligible

This LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT is dated as of February ____, 2004, and agreed
to by and among SPARKS EXHIBITS & ENVIRONMENTS CORP., a Pennsylvania corporation
("Leading Borrower"), SPARKS EXHIBITS & ENVIRONMENTS, LTD., a California

corporation ("Third Borrower"), DMS STORE FIXTURES LLC, a Pennsylvania limited
liability company ("Fourth Borrower"; Leading Borrower, Second Borrower, Third
Borrower, and Fourth Borrower, being collectively referred to herein as
"Borrowers" and each a "Borrower"), any other Credit Party executing this
Agreement, and GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
("Lender").

Recitals

A. Borrowers desire to obtain the Loans and other financial accommodations from
Lender and Lender is willing to provide the Loans and accommodations all in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

B. Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in
Schedule A and, for purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the
rules of construction set forth in Schedule A shall govern. All Schedules,
attachments, addenda and exhibits hereto, or expressly identified to this
Agreement, are incorporated herein by reference, and taken together with this
Agreement, constitute but a single agreement.

Agreement

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants
hereinafter contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.       Amount and Terms of Credit

1.1 Loans. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, from the
Closing Date and until the Commitment Termination Date (i) Lender agrees (A) to
make available to Borrowers advances (each, a "Revolving Credit Advance") and
(B) to incur Letter of Credit Obligations, in an aggregate outstanding amount
for any Borrower not to exceed the Borrowing Availability of such Borrower, and
(ii) any Borrower may at the request of Leading Borrower as agent for such
Borrower from time to time borrow, repay and reborrow, and may cause Lender to
incur Letter of Credit Obligations, under this Section 1.1. The Revolving Credit
Loan shall be evidenced by, and be repayable in accordance with the terms of,
the Revolving Credit Note and this Agreement.

         (b) Borrower shall request each Revolving Credit Advance by written
notice to Lender substantially in the form of Exhibit A (each a "Notice of
Revolving Credit Advance") given no later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on
the Business Day of the proposed advance. Lender shall be fully protected under
this Agreement in relying upon, and shall be entitled to rely upon, (i) any
Notice of Revolving Credit Advance believed by Lender to be genuine, and (ii)
the assumption that the Persons making or executing and delivering (or purported
to be so acting) a Notice of Revolving Credit Advance were duly authorized,
unless the responsible individual acting thereon for Lender shall have actual
knowledge to the contrary. As an accommodation to Borrowers, Lender may permit
telephonic or facsimile requests or Electronic Transmissions (as defined in
Section 1.1(e) below) for a Revolving Credit Advance and Electronic Transmission
or facsimile transmittal of instructions, authorizations, agreements or reports
to Lender by any Borrower; Electronic Transmission authorization shall be
subject to Section 1.1(e) below. If Lender permits any such means of
communication by Borrowers, unless Borrowers specifically direct Lender in
writing not to accept or act upon telephonic or facsimile communications or
Electronic Transmission from any Borrower, Lender shall have no liability to any
Borrower for any loss or damage suffered by any Borrower as a result of Lender's
honoring of any requests, execution of any instructions, authorizations or
agreements or reliance on any reports communicated to it telephonically, by
facsimile or by Electronic Transmission and purporting to have been sent to
Lender by any Borrower and Lender shall have no duty to verify the origin of any
such communication or the identity or authority of the Person sending it.

         (c) In making any Loan hereunder Lender shall be entitled to rely upon
the most recent Borrowing Base Certificate delivered to Lender by such Borrower
and other information available to Lender. Lender shall be under no obligation

                                       4
<PAGE>

to make any further Revolving Credit Advance to any Borrower or incur any other
Obligation if any Borrower shall have failed to deliver a Borrowing Base
Certificate to Lender by the time specified in Section 4.1(b).

         (d) Letters of Credit. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including Schedule C, each Borrower shall have the right to request,
and Lender agrees to incur, the Letter of Credit Obligations for the account of
such Borrower in accordance with Schedule C.

         (e) Electronic Transmission. Lender may authorize Borrower to send to
Lender or receive from Lender instructions, notices, communications, requests,
authorizations, agreements and reports to be delivered to or transmitted by
Lender under this Agreement by electronic means (each, an "Electronic
Transmission"). Any documents authorized by Lender to be sent by Electronic
Transmission shall be deemed: (a) to have been transmitted by the person
indicated on or reflected by the Electronic Transmission as the sender; (b) to
have been transmitted by a person duly authorized to do so, and (c) to have been
received by the person for whom such documents were intended on the actual date
of receipt of such documents, unless such day is not a Business Day, in which
event such documents shall be deemed to have been received on the first Business
Day following actual receipt. Each party may rely upon, and assume the
authenticity of, any signatures contained in any documents Lender authorizes to
be transmitted by Electronic Transmission, and such signatures shall have the
same effect and weight as original signatures and shall be sufficient to satisfy
the requirements of the UCC or any applicable statute, rule of law, or rule of
evidence. Electronic Transmissions which are not readily capable of bearing
either a signature or a reproduction of a signature shall be deemed signed, for
purposes of the UCC and all other rules of law and evidence, if an electronic
symbol, encryption, or process (including, without limitation, the name or an
abbreviation of the name of the party sending the Electronic Transmission) has
been attached to or logically associated with the Electronic Transmission with
the intent to sign, authenticate, adopt, or accept the Electronic Transmission.
The parties agree not to contest the validity or enforceability of an Electronic
Transmission under the provisions of any applicable law relating to whether
certain agreements are to be in a writing or signed by the party to be bound
thereby. However, nothing herein shall limit a party's right to contest whether
an Electronic Transmission maintained hereunder has been altered after receipt.
On the request of the sender, the receiving party shall immediately confirm the
receipt of any Electronic Transmission. If any Electronic Transmission is
received in an unintelligible or garbled form, the receiving party shall notify
the transmitting party in a reasonable manner promptly and in any event within
one (1) Business Day after the receiving party first detects the error. Upon
receipt of such notice, the transmitting party shall retransmit the Electronic
Transmission. If the receiving party fails timely to inform the transmitting
party of an error in the received, but garbled Electronic Transmission, the
transmitting party's record of the contents of such Electronic Transmission
shall control. The sender of any documents transmitted by Electronic
Transmission shall maintain backup paper documents for such documents until at
least the third anniversary of the date of the termination of this Agreement and
shall, on request of the receiving party, furnish such backup paper documents
within two Business Days of the receipt of a request therefor; provided,
however, that the absence of any such backup documentation with respect to a
request for a Revolving Credit Advance by any Borrower shall not affect the
validity of any request for a Revolving Credit Advance transmitted to Lender,
whether by Electronic Transmission or otherwise. Each party may rely upon
documents authorized by Lender to be sent by Electronic Transmission to the same
extent as if original documents had been personally delivered.

1.2 Term and Prepayment. (a) Upon the Commitment Termination Date the obligation
of Lender to make Revolving Credit Advances and extend other credit hereunder
shall immediately terminate and Borrowers shall pay to Lender in full, in cash:
(i) all outstanding Revolving Credit Advances and all accrued but unpaid
interest thereon; (ii) an amount sufficient to enable Lender to hold cash
collateral as specified in Schedule C; and (iii) all other non-contingent
Obligations due to or incurred by Lender.

         (b) If the Revolving Credit Loan attributable to any Borrower shall at
any time exceed such Borrower's Borrowing Availability, then such Borrower
shall, within two (2) Business Days thereafter, repay the Revolving Credit Loan
in the amount of such excess; provided that any such excess outstanding shall
nevertheless constitute Obligations that are evidenced by the Revolving Credit
Notes, secured by the Collateral and entitled to all of the benefits of the Loan
Documents.

         (c) Each Borrower shall have the right, at any time upon thirty (30)
days' prior written notice to Lender to (i) terminate voluntarily Borrowers'
right to receive or benefit from, and Lender's obligation to make and to incur,

                                       5
<PAGE>

Revolving Credit Advances and Letter of Credit Obligations and (ii) prepay all
of the Obligations. The effective date of termination of the Revolving Credit
Loan specified in such notice shall be the Commitment Termination Date. If any
Borrower exercises the right of termination and prepayment, or if Lender's
obligation to make Loans is terminated for any reason prior to the Stated Expiry
Date (including as a result of the occurrence of a Default), Borrowers shall pay
to Lender the applicable Prepayment Fee.

1.3 Use of Proceeds. Borrowers shall use the proceeds of the Loans to refinance
on the Closing Date certain outstanding Indebtedness as provided in Section
2.1(b) and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

1.4 Single Loan. The Loans and all of the other Obligations of any Borrower to
Lender shall constitute one general obligation of such Borrower secured by all
of the Collateral.

1.5 Interest. (a) Each Borrower shall pay interest to Lender on the aggregate
outstanding Revolving Credit Advances attributable to such Borrower at a
floating rate equal to the Index Rate plus four and one-half percent (4.50%) per
annum (the "Revolving Credit Rate"). The Revolving Credit Rate shall be subject
to adjustment (up or down) prospectively on an annual basis as determined by the
Borrowers' consolidated financial performance, commencing with the first day of
the first calendar month that occurs more than five days after delivery to
Lender of Borrowers' annual audited Financial Statements for the Fiscal Year
ending December 31, 2004 (the "First Adjustment Date"). Adjustments to the
Revolving Credit Rate shall be in accordance with the following grid:

- ---------------------------------------- --------------------------------------
If the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for   Then the Revolving Credit Rate shall
the Immediately Preceding Fiscal Year    be:
is:
- ---------------------------------------- --------------------------------------
Less than or equal to 1.25 : 1.0         Index Rate + 4.50%
- ---------------------------------------- --------------------------------------
Greater than 1.25 : 1.0, but less than   Index Rate + 4.00%
1.50 : 1.0
- ---------------------------------------- --------------------------------------
Greater than or equal to 1.50 : 1.0      Index Rate + 3.50%
- ---------------------------------------- --------------------------------------

All adjustments in the Revolving Credit Rate after the First Adjustment Date
shall be implemented annually on a prospective basis, for each calendar month
commencing at least five days after the date of delivery to Lender of the
Borrowers' annual audited Financial Statements evidencing the need for an
adjustment. Concurrently with the delivery of such Financial Statements, each
Borrower shall deliver to Lender a certificate, signed by its chief financial
officer, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the continuance of, or
any change in, the Revolving Credit Rate. Failure to timely deliver such
Financial Statements shall result in an increase in the Revolving Credit Rate to
the highest level set forth in the foregoing grid, until the first day of the
first calendar month following the delivery of those Financial Statements
demonstrating that such an increase is not required. If an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing at the time any reduction in the Revolving Credit
Rate is to be implemented, that reduction shall be deferred until the first day
of the first calendar month following the date on which such Event of Default is
waived in writing by Lender. Additionally, if at any time any other Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Revolving Credit Rate shall
be automatically increased to the highest level set forth in the foregoing grid
until the first day of the first calendar month following the date on which such
Event of Default is waived in writing by Lender. The increase in the Revolving
Credit Rate provided for in the preceding two sentences shall be in addition to
any other remedy provided for in this Agreement (including Lender's right to
charge the Default Rate).

All computations of interest, and all calculations of the Letter of Credit Fee,
shall be made by Lender on the basis of a three hundred and sixty (360) day
year, in each case for the actual number of days occurring in the period for
which such interest or fee is payable. Each determination by Lender of an
interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error. In no event will Lender charge interest at a rate that exceeds
the highest rate of interest permissible under any law that a court of competent
jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable.

         (b) Interest shall be payable on the outstanding Revolving Credit
Advances (i) in arrears for the preceding calendar month on the first day of

                                       6
<PAGE>
each calendar month, (ii) on the Commitment Termination Date, and (iii) if any
interest accrues or remains payable after the Commitment Termination Date, upon
demand by Lender.

         (c) Effective upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and for so
long as any Event of Default shall be continuing, the Revolving Credit Rate and
the Letter of Credit Fee shall automatically be increased by three percentage
points (3.00%) per annum (such increased rate, the "Default Rate"), and all
outstanding Obligations, including unpaid interest and Letter of Credit Fees,
shall continue to accrue interest from the date of such Event of Default at the
Default Rate applicable to such Obligations.

         (d) If any interest or any other payment (including Unused Line Fees
and Collateral Monitoring Fees) to Lender under this Agreement becomes due and
payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment date shall be extended
to the next succeeding Business Day and interest thereon shall be payable at the
then applicable rate during such extension.

1.6 Cash Management System. On or prior to the Closing Date and until the
Termination Date, each Borrower will establish and maintain the cash management
system described in Schedule D. All payments in respect of the Collateral shall
be made to or deposited in the blocked or lockbox accounts described in Schedule
D in accordance with the terms thereof.

1.7      Fees.  Each Borrower agrees to pay to Lender the Fees set forth in
Schedule E.

1.8 Receipt of Payments. Each Borrower shall make each payment under this
Agreement (not otherwise made pursuant to Section 1.9) without set-off,
counterclaim or deduction and free and clear of all Taxes not later than 1:00
P.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in lawful money of the United
States of America in immediately available funds to the Collection Account. If
any Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from any payment to
Lender under any Loan Document, then the amount payable to Lender shall be
increased so that, after making all required deductions, Lender receives an
amount equal to that which it would have received had no such deductions been
made. For purposes of computing interest and Fees, all payments shall be deemed
received by Lender two (2) Business Days following receipt of immediately
available funds in the Collection Account. For purposes of determining the
Borrowing Availability, payments shall be deemed received by Lender upon receipt
of immediately available funds in the Collection Account.

1.9 Application and Allocation of Payments. Each Borrower irrevocably agrees
that Lender shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply any and all
payments against the then due and payable Obligations in such order as Lender
may deem advisable. Lender is authorized to, and at its option may (without
prior notice or precondition and at any time or times), but shall not be
obligated to, make or cause to be made Revolving Credit Advances on behalf of
any Borrower for: (a) payment of all Fees, expenses, indemnities, charges,
costs, principal, interest, or other Obligations owing by such Borrower under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, (b) the payment, performance
or satisfaction of any of such Borrower's obligations with respect to
preservation of the Collateral, or (c) any premium in whole or in part required
in respect of any of the policies of insurance required by this Agreement, even
if the making of any such Revolving Credit Advance causes the outstanding
balance of the Revolving Credit Loan attributable to any Borrower to exceed such
Borrower's Borrowing Availability, and each Borrower agrees to repay
immediately, in cash, any amount by which the Revolving Credit Loan attributable
to such Borrower exceeds its Borrowing Availability.

1.10 Accounting. Lender is authorized to record on its books and records the
date and amount of each Loan and each payment of principal thereof and such
recordation shall constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the
information so recorded. Lender shall provide Borrowers on a monthly basis a
statement and accounting of such recordations but any failure on the part of the
Lender to keep any such recordation (or any errors therein) or to send a
statement thereof to any Borrower shall not in any manner affect the obligation
of any Borrower to repay any of the Obligations. Except to the extent that any
Borrower shall, within ninety (90) days after such statement and accounting is
sent, notify Lender in writing of any objection such Borrower may have thereto
(stating with particularity the basis for such objection), such statement and
accounting shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive upon such Borrower,
absent manifest error.

1.11 Indemnity. Each Borrower and each other Credit Party executing this
Agreement jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold Lender and its

                                       7
<PAGE>
Affiliates, and their respective employees, attorneys and agents (each, an
"Indemnified Person"), harmless from and against any and all suits, actions,
proceedings, claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses of any kind or
nature whatsoever (including attorneys' fees and disbursements and other costs
of investigation or defense, including those incurred upon any appeal) that may
be instituted or asserted against or incurred by any such Indemnified Person as
the result of credit having been extended, suspended or terminated under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or with respect to the execution,
delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of, or in any other way
arising out of or relating to, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or
any other documents or transactions contemplated by or referred to herein or
therein and any actions or failures to act with respect to any of the foregoing,
including any and all product liabilities, Environmental Liabilities, Taxes and
legal costs and expenses arising out of or incurred in connection with disputes
between or among any parties to any of the Loan Documents (collectively,
"Indemnified Liabilities"), except to the extent that any such Indemnified
Liability is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted solely from such Indemnified Person's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. NO INDEMNIFIED PERSON SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO ANY CREDIT
PARTY, ANY SUCCESSOR, ASSIGNEE OR THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY OR ANY OTHER PERSON
ASSERTING CLAIMS DERIVATIVELY THROUGH SUCH PARTY, FOR ANY ACT OR FAILURE TO ACT
UNDER ANY POWER OF ATTORNEY OR FOR INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT MAY BE ALLEGED AS A RESULT OF CREDIT HAVING BEEN
EXTENDED, SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT OR AS A RESULT OF ANY OTHER TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER OR
THEREUNDER.

1.12 Borrowing Base; Reserves. The Borrowing Base of each Borrower shall be
determined by Lender (including the eligibility of Accounts and Inventory) based
on the most recent Borrowing Base Certificate delivered to Lender in accordance
with Section 4.1(b) and such other information available to Lender. The
Revolving Credit Loan shall be subject to Lender's continuing right to withhold
from any Borrower's Borrowing Availability reserves (including, without
limitation, the Special Reserve), and to increase and decrease such reserves
from time to time, if and to the extent that in Lender's good faith credit
judgment such reserves are necessary, including to protect Lender's interest in
the Collateral or to protect Lender against possible non-payment of Accounts for
any reason by Account Debtors or possible diminution of the value of any
Collateral or possible non-payment of any of the Obligations or for any Taxes or
in respect of any state of facts that could constitute a Default. Lender may, at
its option, in Lender's good faith credit judgment, implement reserves
(including, without limitation, the Special Reserve) by designating as
ineligible a sufficient amount of Accounts or Inventory that would otherwise be
Eligible Accounts or Eligible Inventory, as the case may be, so as to reduce any
Borrower's Borrowing Base by the amount of the intended reserves.

2.       Conditions Precedent

2.1 Conditions to the Initial Loans. Lender shall not be obligated to make any

Borrowing Availability; provided, further, in order for such loans to count
towards such Net Borrowing Availability, each Stockholder who makes such a loan

Borrowers, Marlton and Sparks Holding.

2.2      Further  Conditions to the Loans.  Lender shall not be obligated to
fund any Loan  (including  the initial Loans), if, as of the date thereof:

         (a) any representation or warranty by any Credit Party contained herein
or in any of the other Loan Documents shall be untrue or in any material respect
incorrect as of such date, except to the extent that any such representation or
warranty is expressly stated to relate to a specific earlier date, in which
case, such representation and warranty shall be true and in all material
respects correct as of such earlier date; or

         (b) any event or circumstance that has had or reasonably could be

Borrower, of the proceeds of any Loan, and the request by Leading Borrower, as
agent for each Borrower, for the incurrence by Lender of any Letter of Credit
Obligations, as the case may be, shall be deemed to constitute, as of the date
of such request and the date of such acceptance, (i) a representation and
warranty by each Borrower that the conditions in Section 2.2 have been satisfied
and (ii) a restatement by each Borrower of each of the representations and
warranties made by such Borrower in any Loan Document and a reaffirmation by
each Borrower of the granting and continuance of Lender's Liens pursuant to the
Loan Documents.

3. Representations, warranties and affirmative covenants

To induce Lender to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans, each
Borrower and each other Credit Party executing this Agreement represent and

                                       9
<PAGE>
warrant to Lender (each of which representations and warranties shall survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement), and promise to and agree with
Lender until the Termination Date as follows:

3.1 Corporate Existence; Compliance with Law. Each Corporate Credit Party: (a)
is, as of the Closing Date, and will continue to be (i) a corporation, limited
liability company or limited partnership, as applicable, duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization, (ii) duly qualified to do business and in good
standing in each other jurisdiction where its ownership or lease of property or
the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the
failure to be so qualified could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, and (iii) in compliance with all Requirements of Law and
Contractual Obligations, except to the extent failure to comply therewith could
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect; and (b) has and will continue to have (i) the requisite
corporate power and authority and the legal right to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under the Loan Documents, and to own, pledge, mortgage
or otherwise encumber and operate its properties, to lease the property it
operates under lease, and to conduct its business as now, heretofore or proposed
to be conducted, and (ii) all licenses, permits, franchises, rights, powers,
consents or approvals from or by all Persons or Governmental Authorities having
jurisdiction over such Corporate Credit Party that are necessary or appropriate
for the conduct of its business, except to the extent the failure to obtain such
license, permit, franchise, right, power, consent or approval could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding any other representation or warranty providing a
lesser or greater standard, there is no provision of any Corporate Credit
Party's articles or certificate of incorporation or other creating instrument or
by-laws or operating agreement limiting or contravening the Resolutions attached
as Attachment 5 to such Credit Party's Secretarial Certificate.

3.2 Executive Offices; Corporate or Other Names. (a) Each Corporate Credit
Party's name as it appears in official filings in the state of its incorporation
or organization, (b) the type of entity of each Corporate Credit Party, (c) the
organizational identification number issued by each such Credit Party's state of
incorporation or organization or a statement that no such number has been
issued, (d) each Corporate Credit Party's state of organization or
incorporation, and (e) the location of each Corporate Credit Party's chief
executive office, corporate offices, warehouses, other locations of Collateral
and locations where records with respect to Collateral are kept (including in
each case the county of such locations) are as set forth in Disclosure Schedule
(3.2) and, except as set forth in such Disclosure Schedule, such locations have
not changed during the preceding twelve months. As of the Closing Date, during
the prior five years, except as set forth in Disclosure Schedule (3.2), no
Corporate Credit Party has been known as or conducted business in any other name
(including trade names). Each Corporate Credit Party has only one state of
incorporation or organization.

3.3 Corporate Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations. The execution,
delivery and performance by each Credit Party of the Loan Documents to which it
is a party, and the creation of all Liens provided for herein and therein: (a)
are and will continue to be within such Credit Party's power and authority; (b)
have been and will continue to be duly authorized by all necessary or proper
action; (c) are not and will not be in violation of any Requirement of Law or
material Contractual Obligation of such Credit Party; (d) do not and will not
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) upon any of the Collateral; and (e) do not and will not require
the consent or approval of any Governmental Authority or any other Person. As of
the Closing Date, each Loan Document shall have been duly executed and delivered
on behalf of each Credit Party signatory thereto, and each such Loan Document
upon such execution and delivery shall be and will continue to be a legal, valid
and binding obligation of such Credit Party, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and the application of equitable principles.

3.4 Financial Statements and Projections; Books and Records. (a) The Financial
Statements delivered by Marlton and its Subsidiaries to Lender for its most
recently ended Fiscal Year and Fiscal Month, are true, correct and complete and
reflect fairly and accurately the financial condition of Marlton and its
Subsidiaries as of the date of each such Financial Statement in accordance with
GAAP (consolidated portions only). The Projections most recently delivered by
Marlton and its Subsidiaries to Lender have been prepared in good faith, with
care and diligence and use assumptions that are reasonable under the
circumstances at the time such Projections were prepared and as of the date
delivered to Lender, and all such material assumptions are disclosed in the
Projections.

                                       10
<PAGE>

         (b) Each Borrower and each other Corporate Credit Party shall keep
adequate Books and Records with respect to the Collateral and its business
activities in which proper entries, reflecting all consolidated and
consolidating financial transactions, and payments and credits received on, and
all other dealings with, the Collateral, will be made in accordance with GAAP
and all Requirements of Law and on a basis consistent with the Financial
Statements.

3.5 Material Adverse Change. Between the date of Marlton and its Subsidiaries'
(on a consolidated basis) most recently audited Financial Statements delivered
to Lender and the Closing Date: (a) no Corporate Credit Party has incurred any
obligations, contingent or non-contingent liabilities, or liabilities for
Charges, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments that are
not reflected in the Projections delivered on the Closing Date and which could,
alone or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect; (b) there has been no material deviation from such Projections; and (c)
no events have occurred that alone or in the aggregate has had or could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Requirement of Law
or Contractual Obligation of any Credit Party has or have had or could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Credit Party is in
default, and to such Credit Party's knowledge no third party is in default,
under or with respect to any of its Contractual Obligations, that alone or in
the aggregate has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

3.6 Real Estate; Property. The real estate listed in Disclosure Schedule (3.6)
constitutes all of the real property owned, leased, or used by each Corporate
Credit Party in its business, and such Credit Party will not execute any
material agreement or contract in respect of such real estate after the date of
this Agreement without giving Lender prompt prior written notice thereof. Each
Corporate Credit Party holds and will continue to hold good and marketable fee
simple title to all of its owned real estate, and good and marketable title to
all of its other properties and assets, and valid and insurable leasehold
interests in all of its leases (both as lessor and lessee, sublessee or
assignee), and none of the properties and assets of any Corporate Credit Party
are or will be subject to any Liens, except Permitted Encumbrances. With respect
to the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Austell, Georgia and Santa Fe, California
premises identified in Disclosure Schedule (3.2), on or prior to the Closing
Date a bailee, landlord or mortgagee agreement acceptable to Lender has been
obtained. The Borrowers will, before March 1, 2004, obtain and deliver to Lender
a bailee agreement acceptable to Lender with respect to the warehouse located at
12234 Florence Avenue, Los Angeles, California, unless the Borrowers have
vacated such warehouse on or before February 29, 2004.

3.7 Ventures, Subsidiaries and Affiliates; Outstanding Stock and Indebtedness.
Except as set forth in Disclosure Schedule (3.7), as of the Closing Date no
Corporate Credit Party has any Subsidiaries, is engaged in any joint venture or
partnership with any other Person, or is an Affiliate of any other Person. All
of the issued and outstanding Stock of each Corporate Credit Party (including
all rights to purchase, options, warrants or similar rights or agreements
pursuant to which any Corporate Credit Party may be required to issue, sell,
repurchase or redeem any of its Stock) as of the Closing Date is owned by each
of the Stockholders (and in the amounts) set forth in Disclosure Schedule (3.7);
provided, however, that with respect to Marlton, such Disclosure Schedule will
only list the shares owned by Jeffrey Harrow, Scott Tarte, Robert Ginsburg and
Alan Goldberg. All outstanding Indebtedness of each Corporate Credit Party as of
the Closing Date is described in Disclosure Schedule (5(b)).

3.8 Government Regulation; Margin Regulations. No Corporate Credit Party is
subject to or regulated under any Federal or state statute, rule or regulation
that restricts or limits such Person's ability to incur Indebtedness, pledge its
assets, or to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents. The making of
the Loans, the application of the proceeds and repayment thereof, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents do not and
will not violate any Requirement of Law applicable to a Corporate Credit Party.
No Corporate Credit Party is engaged, nor will it engage in the business of
extending credit for the purpose of "purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin
security" as such terms are defined in Regulation U of the Federal Reserve Board
as now and hereafter in effect (such securities being referred to herein as
"Margin Stock"). No Corporate Credit Party owns any Margin Stock, and none of
the proceeds of the Loans or other extensions of credit under this Agreement
will be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of purchasing or carrying
any Margin Stock or reducing or retiring any Indebtedness that was originally
incurred to purchase or carry any Margin Stock. No Corporate Credit Party will
take or permit to be taken any action that might cause any Loan Document to
violate any regulation of the Federal Reserve Board.

                                       11
<PAGE>

3.9 Taxes; Charges. Except as disclosed in Disclosure Schedule (3.9) all tax
returns, reports and statements required by any Governmental Authority to be
filed by Borrower or any other Credit Party have, as of the Closing Date, been
filed and will, until the Termination Date, be filed with the appropriate
Governmental Authority and no tax Lien has been filed against any Credit Party
or any Credit Party's property. Proper and accurate amounts have been and will
be withheld by Borrower and each other Credit Party from their respective
employees for all periods in compliance with all Requirements of Law and such
withholdings have and will be timely paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities. Disclosure Schedule (3.9) sets forth as of the Closing Date those
taxable years for which any Credit Party's tax returns are currently being
audited by the IRS or any other applicable Governmental Authority and any
assessments or threatened assessments in connection with such audit, or
otherwise currently outstanding. Except as described on Disclosure Schedule
(3.9), none of the Credit Parties or their respective predecessors are liable
for any Charges in excess of $10,000 in the aggregate at any time: (a) under any
agreement (including any tax sharing agreements or agreement extending the
period of assessment of any Charges) or (b) to each Credit Party's knowledge, as
a transferee. As of the Closing Date, no Credit Party has agreed or been
requested to make any adjustment under IRC Section 481(a), by reason of a change
in accounting method or otherwise, which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

3.10 Payment of Obligations. Each Credit Party will pay, discharge or otherwise
satisfy at or before maturity or before they become delinquent, as the case may
be, all of its Charges and other obligations of whatever nature, except where
the amount or validity thereof is currently being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and reserves in conformity with GAAP with respect
thereto have been provided on the books of such Credit Party or such Charges are
not in excess of $10,000 in the aggregate at any time, and none of the
Collateral is or could reasonably be expected to become subject to any Lien or
forfeiture or loss as a result of such contest.

3.11 ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that,
when taken together with all other existing ERISA Events, could reasonably be
expected to result in a liability of any Credit Party of more than the Minimum
Actionable Amount. Except as disclosed in Disclosure Schedule (3.11), the
present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of the Credit Parties under
each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent
Financial Statements reflecting such amounts, exceed the fair market value of
the assets of such Plan by more than the Minimum Actionable Amount, and the
present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans
(based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Account
Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent Financial
Statements reflecting such amounts, exceed the fair market value of the assets
of such underfunded Plans by more than the Minimum Actionable Amount. No Credit
Party or ERISA Affiliate has incurred or reasonably expects to incur any
Withdrawal Liability in excess of the Minimum Actionable Amount.

3.12 Litigation. No Litigation is pending or, to the knowledge of any Credit
Party, threatened by or against any Credit Party or against any Credit Party's
properties or revenues (a) with respect to any of the Loan Documents or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or (b) that could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Disclosure
Schedule (3.12), as of the Closing Date there is no Litigation pending or
threatened against any Credit Party that seeks damages in excess of $50,000 or
injunctive relief or alleges criminal misconduct of any Credit Party. Each
Credit Party shall notify Lender promptly in writing upon learning of the
existence, threat or commencement of any Litigation (i) that seeks damages in
excess of $50,000 or injunctive relief against any Credit Party, ERISA Affiliate
or any Plan, or (ii) that alleges any criminal misconduct against any Credit
Party.

3.13 Intellectual Property. As of the Closing Date, all material Intellectual
Property owned or used by any Corporate Credit Party is listed, together with
application or registration numbers, where applicable, in Disclosure Schedule
(3.13). Each Corporate Credit Party owns, or is licensed to use, all
Intellectual Property necessary to conduct its business as currently conducted
except for such Intellectual Property the failure of which to own or license
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each
Corporate Credit Party will maintain the patenting and registration of all
Intellectual Property with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the
United States Copyright Office, or other appropriate Governmental Authority and
each Corporate Credit Party will promptly patent or register, as the case may

3.14 Full Disclosure. No information contained in any Loan Document, the
Financial Statements or any written statement furnished by or on behalf of any
Credit Party under any Loan Document, or to induce Lender to execute the Loan
Documents, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein or therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made.

3.15 Hazardous Materials. Except as set forth in Disclosure Schedule (3.15), as
of the Closing Date, (a) each real property location owned, leased or occupied
by each Corporate Credit Party (the "Real Property") is maintained free of
contamination from any Hazardous Material, (b) no Corporate Credit Party is
subject to any Environmental Liabilities or, to any Credit Party's knowledge,
potential Environmental Liabilities, in excess of the Minimum Actionable Amount
in the aggregate, (c) no notice has been received by any Corporate Credit Party
identifying it as a "potentially responsible party" or requesting information
under CERCLA or analogous state statutes, and to the knowledge of any Credit
Party, there are no facts, circumstances or conditions that may result in any
Corporate Credit Party being identified as a "potentially responsible party"
under CERCLA or analogous state statutes; and (d) each Corporate Credit Party
has provided to Lender copies of all existing environmental reports, reviews and
audits and all written information pertaining to actual or potential
Environmental Liabilities, in each case relating to any Corporate Credit Party.
Each Corporate Credit Party: (i) shall comply in all material respects with all
applicable Environmental Laws and environmental permits; (ii) shall notify
Lender in writing within seven (7) days if and when it becomes aware of any
Release, on, at, in, under, above, to, from or about any of its Real Property;
and (iii) shall promptly forward to Lender a copy of any order, notice, permit,
application, or any communication or report received by it or any other Credit
Party in connection with any such Release.

3.16 Insurance. As of the Closing Date, Disclosure Schedule (3.16) lists all
insurance of any nature maintained for current occurrences by Borrowers and each
other Corporate Credit Party, as well as a summary of the terms of such
insurance. Each Corporate Credit Party shall deliver to Lender certified copies
and endorsements to all of its and those of its Subsidiaries (a) "All Risk" and
business interruption insurance policies naming Lender loss payee, and (b)
general liability and other liability policies naming Lender as an additional
insured. All policies of insurance on real and personal property will contain an
endorsement, in form and substance acceptable to Lender, showing loss payable to
Lender (Form 438 BFU or equivalent) and extra expense and business interruption
endorsements. Such endorsement, or an independent instrument furnished to
Lender, will provide that the insurance companies will give Lender at least
thirty (30) days prior written notice before any such policy or policies of
insurance shall be altered or canceled and that no act or default of any
Borrower or any other Person shall affect the right of Lender to recover under
such policy or policies of insurance in case of loss or damage. Each Corporate
Credit Party shall direct all present and future insurers under its "All Risk"
policies of insurance to pay all proceeds payable thereunder directly to Lender.
If any insurance proceeds are paid by check, draft or other instrument payable
to any Credit Party and Lender jointly, Lender may endorse such Credit Party's
name thereon and do such other things as Lender may deem advisable to reduce the
same to cash. Lender reserves the right at any time in its reasonable
discretion, upon review of each Credit Party's risk profile, to require
additional forms and limits of insurance. Each Corporate Credit Party shall, (i)
on each anniversary of the Closing Date and from time to time at Lender's
request, deliver to Lender copies of its insurance policies and endorsements and
certificates of insurance certified by an authorized officer of such Corporate
Credit Party, all in compliance with the provisions set forth above, and (ii) at
Lender's request, but not more frequently than annually, a report by a reputable

                                       13
<PAGE>
agreement with any Account Debtor for any extension of time for the payment of
any Account, any compromise or settlement for less than the full amount thereof,
any release of any Account Debtor from liability therefor, or any deduction
therefrom except a discount or allowance for (a) prompt or early payment allowed
by Borrowers in the ordinary course of their business consistent with historical
practice and as previously disclosed to Lender, (b) nonconforming goods or
services in the ordinary course of their business consistent with historical
practice, and (c) returned goods in the ordinary course of their business
consistent with historical practice not to exceed $250,000 in the aggregate in
any Fiscal Month and $500,000 in the aggregate in any Fiscal Year; provided,
however, that Borrowers shall disclose to Lender any such discount or allowance
at the earlier of (i) two (2) Business Days after issuance thereof, or (ii) in
the next Notice of Revolving Credit Advance delivered to Lender after issuance
thereof. Disclosure Schedule (3.18) sets forth each Contract of any Borrower
with any Account Debtor that gives such Account Debtor the right (under such
Contract, under common law or otherwise) to offset any Accounts for such
Borrower's failure to perform under such Contract and each Borrower has obtained
an offset waiver for each such contract in form and substance satisfactory to
Lender. With respect to the Accounts pledged as collateral pursuant to any Loan
Document (a) the amounts shown on all invoices, statements and reports that may
be delivered to the Lender with respect thereto are actually and absolutely
owing to the relevant Credit Party as indicated thereon and are not in any way
contingent; (b) no payments have been or shall be made thereon except payments
immediately delivered to the applicable accounts described in paragraph 1 to
Schedule D or the Lender as required hereunder; and (c) to each Borrower's
knowledge all Account Debtors have the capacity to contract. Each Borrower shall
notify Lender promptly of any event or circumstance that to such Borrower's
knowledge would cause Lender to consider any then existing Account or Inventory
as no longer constituting an Eligible Account or Eligible Inventory, as the case
may be.

3.19 Conduct of Business. Each Corporate Credit Party (a) shall conduct its
business substantially as now conducted or as otherwise permitted hereunder, and
(b) shall at all times maintain, preserve and protect all of the Collateral and
such Credit Party's other property, used or useful in the conduct of its
business and keep the same in good repair, working order and condition and make,
or cause to be made, all necessary or appropriate repairs, replacements and
improvements thereto consistent with industry practices.

3.20 Further Assurances. At any time and from time to time, upon the written
request of Lender and at the sole expense of Borrowers, Borrowers and each other
Credit Party shall promptly and duly execute and deliver any and all such
further instruments and documents and take such further action as Lender may
reasonably deem desirable (a) to obtain the full benefits of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, (b) to protect, preserve and maintain Lender's rights
in any Collateral, or (c) to enable Lender to exercise all or any of the rights
and powers herein granted.

3.21 Solvency. Each Borrower is Solvent both before and after giving effect to
(a) the Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations to be made or extended on the
Closing Date or such other date as Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations
requested hereunder are made or extended, (b) the disbursement of the proceeds
of such Loans pursuant to the instructions of the Leading Borrower, and (c) the
payment and accrual of all transaction costs in connection with the foregoing.

3.22 Stockholder Loans. In the event that the Borrowers have Net Borrowing
Availability on a combined basis of zero or less at the end of any month between
the Closing Date and March 31, 2004, the Stockholders of Marlton (or any one of
them) shall make a loan to the Borrowers (the "Additional Stockholder Loans") in
an amount equal to the amount necessary to increase Borrowers' Net Borrowing
Availability on a combined basis to at least $200,000, and such Stockholders
shall execute and deliver to Lender an Intercreditor and Subordination Agreement
in favor of Lender in the form attached hereto as Exhibit K; provided, however,
that the aggregate amount of the Closing Date Stockholders Loans and the
Additional Stockholder Loans (collectively, the "Stockholders Loans") shall not
exceed $500,000; provided, further, that the Borrowers may repay the
Stockholders Loans at the end of any Fiscal Quarter so long as and to the extent
that (a) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, or would occur as a
result of any such payment, and (b) after giving effect to any such payment,
Borrowers' Net Borrowing Availability on a combined basis is greater than
$500,000. For purposes of this Section 3.22, Net Borrowing Availability shall be
calculated on a pro forma basis, with trade payables and taxes no more than 60
days past due, and expenses and liabilities being paid in the ordinary course of
business and without acceleration of sales. The provisions of this Section 3.22
do not in any way limit the obligations of each Borrower to immediately repay an
overadvance pursuant to Section 1.2(b). Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, this Section 3.22 shall be null and void in the event
that Net Borrowing Availability for all Borrowers as of the Closing Date
(calculated in accordance with Section 2.1(e)) is greater than $700,000.

                                       14

3.23 Vendor Searches. Lender will conduct, at the sole cost and expense of
Borrowers, UCC searches against Borrowers' vendors. So long as no Event of
Default has occurred, Lender will conduct such searches not more often than
semi-annually, and will limit the scope of such searches to those vendors which
store Borrowers' Inventory consisting of finished goods with an aggregate value
(on a first-in, first-out basis at the lower of cost or market) in excess of
$350,000. After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, Lender will conduct such searches as frequently as it deems necessary,
and may search all vendors without regard to the value of finished goods stored
by such vendors. Borrowers will also use its reasonable commercial efforts to
ascertain if any vendor has added a lender or changed its existing lender, and
if it ascertains such an addition and/or change has or will occur, Borrowers
will immediately notify Lender of same.

                                       17
<PAGE>

6.1 Grant of Security Interest. (a) As collateral security for the prompt and
complete payment and performance of the Obligations, each of the Borrowers and
each other Credit Party executing this Agreement hereby grants to the Lender a
security interest in and Lien upon all of its property and assets, whether real
or personal, tangible or intangible, and whether now owned or hereafter
acquired, or in which it now has or at any time in the future may acquire any
right, title, or interest, including all of the following property in which it
now has or at any time in the future may acquire any right, title or interest:
all Accounts; all Deposit Accounts, all other bank accounts and all funds on
deposit therein; all money, cash and cash equivalents; all Investment Property;
all Stock; all Goods (including Inventory, Equipment and Fixtures); all Chattel
Paper, Documents and Instruments; all Books and Records; all General Intangibles
(including all Intellectual Property, contract rights, choses in action, Payment
Intangibles and Software); all letters of credit and Letter-of-Credit Rights;
all Supporting Obligations; and to the extent not otherwise included, all
Proceeds, tort claims, insurance claims and other rights to payment not
otherwise included in the foregoing and products of all and any of the foregoing
and all accessions to, substitutions and replacements for, and rents and profits
of, each of the foregoing, but excluding in all events Hazardous Waste (all of
the foregoing, together with any other collateral pledged to the Lender pursuant
to any other Loan Document, collectively, the "Collateral").

         (b) Each Borrower, Lender and each other Credit Party executing this
Agreement agree that this Agreement creates, and is intended to create, valid
and continuing Liens upon the Collateral in favor of Lender. Each Borrower and
each other Credit Party executing this Agreement represents, warrants and
promises to Lender that: (i) each Borrower and each other Credit Party granting
a Lien in Collateral has rights in and the power to transfer each item of the
Collateral upon which it purports to grant a Lien pursuant to the Loan
Documents, free and clear of any and all Liens or claims of others, other than
Permitted Encumbrances; (ii) the security interests granted pursuant to this
Agreement, upon completion of the filings and other actions listed on Disclosure
Schedule 6.1 (which, in the case of all filings and other documents referred to
in said Schedule, have been delivered to the Lender in duly executed or
authorized form) will constitute valid perfected security interests in all of
the Collateral in favor of the Lender as security for the prompt and complete
payment and performance of the Obligations, enforceable in accordance with the
terms hereof against any and all creditors of and purchasers from any Credit
Party (other than purchasers of Inventory in the ordinary course of business)
and such security interests are prior to all other Liens on the Collateral in
existence on the date hereof except for Permitted Encumbrances that have
priority by operation of law; and (iii) no effective security agreement,
mortgage, deed of trust, financing statement, equivalent security or Lien
instrument or continuation statement covering all or any part of the Collateral
is or will be on file or of record in any public office, except those relating
to Permitted Encumbrances. Each Borrower and each other Credit Party executing
this Agreement promise to defend the right, title and interest of Lender in and
to the Collateral against the claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever, and
each shall take such actions, including (A) all actions necessary to grant
Lender "control" of any Investment Property, Deposit Accounts, Letter-of-Credit
Rights or electronic Chattel Paper owned by such Credit Party, with any
agreements establishing control to be in form and substance satisfactory to
Lender, (B) the prompt delivery of all original Instruments, Chattel Paper and
certificated Stock owned by such Borrower and each other Credit Party granting a
Lien on Collateral to Lender, (C) notification of Lender's interest in
Collateral at Lender's request, and (D) the institution of litigation against
third parties as shall be prudent in order to protect and preserve each Credit
Party's and Lender's respective and several interests in the Collateral. Each
Borrower (and any other Credit Party granting a Lien in Collateral) shall mark
its Books and Records pertaining to the Collateral to evidence the Loan
Documents and the Liens granted under the Loan Documents. If any Credit Party
retains possession of any Chattel Paper or Instrument with Lender's consent,
such Chattel Paper and Instruments shall be marked with the following legend:
"This writing and the obligations evidenced or secured hereby are subject to the
security interest of General Electric Capital Corporation." Each Credit Party
executing this Agreement shall promptly, and in any event within two (2)
Business Days after the same is acquired by it, notify Lender of any commercial
tort claim (as defined in the Code) acquired by it and unless otherwise
consented by Lender, such Credit Party shall enter into a supplement to this
Loan Agreement granting to Lender a Lien in such commercial tort claim.

6.2 Lender's Rights. (a) Lender may, (i) at any time in Lender's own name or in
the name of any Borrower, communicate with Account Debtors, parties to
Contracts, and obligors in respect of Instruments, Chattel Paper or other
Collateral to verify to Lender's satisfaction, the existence, amount and terms
of, and any other matter relating to, Accounts, Payment Intangibles,
Instruments, Chattel Paper or other Collateral, and (ii) at any time after a

                                       18

<PAGE>

Default has occurred and is continuing and without prior notice to any Borrower
or any other Credit Party, notify Account Debtors and other Persons obligated on
any Collateral that Lender has a security interest therein and that payments
shall be made directly to Lender. Upon the request of Lender, each Borrower
shall so notify such Account Debtors and other Persons obligated on any
Collateral. Once any such notice has been given to any Account Debtor or other
Person obligated on any Collateral, the affected Credit Party shall not give any
contrary instructions to such Account Debtor or such other Person without
Lender's prior written consent. Each Borrower hereby constitutes Lender or
Lender's designee as such Borrower's attorney with power to endorse such
Borrower's name upon any notes, acceptance drafts, money orders or other
evidences of payment or Collateral. So long as no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, Lender will use reasonable efforts to notify Leading Borrower
twenty four (24) hours in advance of communicating with Accounts Debtors in
connection with clause (a)(i) above; provided, however, that Lender's failure to
provide such notice in advance or at all shall not be deemed a breach by Lender
of any obligation to any Credit Party, and no Credit Party shall have a claim,
cause of action or remedy as a result thereof.

         (b) Each Borrower shall remain liable under each Contract, Instrument
and License to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be
observed and performed by it thereunder, and Lender shall have no obligation or
liability whatsoever to any Person under any Contract, Instrument or License
(between any Borrower or any other Credit Party and any Person other than
Lender) by reason of or arising out of the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement, and Lender shall not be required or obligated in any manner (i)
to perform or fulfill any of the obligations of any Borrower, (ii) to make any
payment or inquiry, or (iii) to take any action of any kind to collect,
compromise or enforce any performance or the payment of any amounts which may
have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times
under or pursuant to any Contract, Instrument or License.

         (c) Each Borrower and each other Credit Party shall, with respect to
each owned, leased, or controlled property, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice (unless a Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, in which event no notice shall be required and Lender shall have
access at any and all times): (i) provide access to such property to Lender and
any of its officers, employees and agents, as frequently as Lender determines to
be appropriate; (ii) permit Lender and any of its officers, employees and agents
to inspect, audit and make extracts and copies (or take originals if reasonably
necessary) from all of such Borrower's and such Credit Party's Books and
Records; and (iii) permit Lender to inspect, review, evaluate and make physical
verifications and appraisals of the Inventory and other Collateral in any manner
and through any medium that Lender considers reasonably advisable, and each
Borrower and such Credit Party agree to render to Lender, at such Borrower's and
such Credit Party's cost and expense, such clerical and other assistance as may
be reasonably requested with regard thereto.

         (d) After the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default, each
Borrower at its own expense, shall cause the independent certified public
accountant then engaged by such Borrower to prepare and deliver to Lender at any
time and from time to time, promptly upon Lender's request, the following
reports: (i) a reconciliation of all Accounts; (ii) an aging of all Accounts;
(iii) trial balances; and (iv) test verifications of such Accounts as Lender may
request. Each Borrower, at its own expense, shall cause its certified
independent public accountants to deliver to Lender the results of any physical
verifications of all or any portion of the Inventory made or observed by such
accountants when and if such verification is conducted. Lender shall be
permitted to observe and consult with each Borrower's accountants in the
performance of these tasks.

6.3 Lender's Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact. On the Closing Date, each Borrower
and each other Credit Party executing this Agreement shall execute and deliver a
Power of Attorney in the form attached as Exhibit I. The power of attorney
granted pursuant to the Power of Attorney and all powers granted under any Loan
Document are powers coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable until the
Termination Date. The powers conferred on Lender under the Power of Attorney are
solely to protect Lender's interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any
duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Lender agrees not to exercise any
power or authority granted under the Power of Attorney unless an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing. Each Borrower and each other Credit
Party executing this Agreement also hereby (i) authorizes Lender to file any
financing statements, continuation statements or amendments thereto that (x)
indicate the Collateral (1) as all assets of such Credit Party (or any portion
of such Credit Party's assets) or words of similar effect, regardless of whether
any particular asset comprised in the Collateral falls within the scope of
Article 9 of the Code of such jurisdiction, or (2) as being of an equal or
lesser scope or with greater detail, and (y) contain any other information
required by Part 5 of Article 9 of the Code for the sufficiency or filing office
acceptance of any financing statement, continuation statement or amendment and
(ii) ratifies its authorization for Lender to have filed any initial financial
statements, or amendments thereto if filed prior to the date hereof. Each
Borrower and each other Credit Party executing this Agreement acknowledges that
it is not authorized to file any financing statement or amendment or termination
statement with respect to any financing statement without the prior written
consent of Lender and agrees that it will not do so without the prior written

                                     19
<PAGE>
consent of Lender, subject to such Credit Party's rights under Section
9-509(d)(2) of the Code.

6.4 Grant of License to Use Intellectual Property Collateral. Each Borrower and
each other Credit Party executing this Agreement hereby grants to Lender an
irrevocable, non-exclusive license (exercisable upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default without payment of royalty or other
compensation to any Borrower or such Credit Party) to use, transfer, license or
sublicense any Intellectual Property now owned, licensed to, or hereafter
acquired by such Borrower or such Credit Party, and wherever the same may be
located, and including in such license access to all media in which any of the
licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer and automatic
machinery software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof,
and represents, promises and agrees that any such license or sublicense is not
and will not be in conflict with the contractual or commercial rights of any
third Person; provided, that such license will terminate on the Termination
Date.

7. EVENTS OF DEFAULT: RIGHTS AND REMEDIES

7.1 Events of Default. The occurrence of any one or more of the following events
(regardless of the reason therefor) shall constitute an "Event of Default"
hereunder which shall be deemed to be continuing until waived in writing by
Lender in accordance with Section 10.3:

         (a) any Borrower shall fail to make any payment in respect of any
Obligations when due and payable or declared due and payable; or

         (b) (i) any Borrower or any other Credit Party (whether or not such
Credit Party has signed this Agreement) shall fail or neglect to perform, keep
or observe any of the covenants, promises, agreements, requirements, conditions
or other terms or provisions contained in Section 1, Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.17,
3.18, 3.19, 3.20, 3.21, 3.22, 4.2 or Section 5 of this Agreement; or (ii) any
Borrower or any other Credit Party (whether or not such Credit Party has signed
this Agreement) shall fail or neglect to perform, keep or observe any of the
covenants, promises, agreements, requirements, conditions or other terms or
provisions contained in this Agreement (other than those set forth in the
Sections referred to in clause (i) immediately above) or any of the other Loan
Documents, and such breach is not remediable or, if remediable, continues
unremedied for a period of the earlier to occur of (x) ten (10) Business Days
after the date on which such breach is known or reasonably should have become
known to any officer of such Borrower or such Credit Party and (y) five (5)
Business Days after the date on which Lender shall have notified such Borrower
or such other Credit Party of such breach; or

         (c) an event of default shall occur under any Contractual Obligation
(other than the El Cajon Lease) of any Borrower or any other Credit Party (other
than this Agreement and the other Loan Documents), and such event of default (i)
involves the failure to make any payment (whether or not such payment is blocked
pursuant to the terms of an intercreditor agreement or otherwise), whether of
principal, interest or otherwise, and whether due by scheduled maturity,
required prepayment, acceleration, demand or otherwise, in respect of any
Indebtedness (other than the Obligations) of such Person in an aggregate amount
exceeding the Minimum Actionable Amount, or (ii) causes (or permits any holder
of such Indebtedness or a trustee to cause) such Indebtedness, or a portion
thereof, in an aggregate amount exceeding the Minimum Actionable Amount to
become due prior to its stated maturity or prior to its regularly scheduled date
of payment; or

         (d) any representation or warranty in this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or in any written statement pursuant hereto or thereto, or in any
report, financial statement or certificate made or delivered to Lender by any
Borrower or any other Credit Party shall be untrue or incorrect as of the date
when made or deemed made, regardless of whether such breach involves a
representation or warranty with respect to a Credit Party that has not signed
this Agreement; or

         (e) there shall be commenced against any Borrower or any other Credit
Party any Litigation seeking issuance of a warrant of attachment, execution,
distraint or similar process against all or any substantial part of its assets
that results in the entry of an order for any such relief that remains unstayed,
unbonded or undismissed for thirty (30) consecutive days; or any Borrower or any
other Credit Party shall have concealed, removed or permitted to be concealed or
removed, any part of its property with intent to hinder, delay or defraud any of

                                     20
<PAGE>

its creditors or made or suffered a transfer of any of its property or the
incurring of an obligation that may be fraudulent under any bankruptcy,
fraudulent transfer or other similar law; or

         (f) a case or proceeding shall have been commenced involuntarily
against any Borrower or any other Credit Party in a court having competent
jurisdiction seeking a decree or order: (i) under the United States Bankruptcy
Code or any other applicable Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy or other
similar law, and seeking either (A) the appointment of a custodian, receiver,
liquidator, assignee, trustee or sequestrator (or similar official) for such
Person or of any substantial part of its properties, or (B) the reorganization
or winding up or liquidation of the affairs of any such Person, and such case or
proceeding shall remain undismissed or unstayed for sixty (60) consecutive days
or such court shall enter a decree or order granting the relief sought in such
case or proceeding; or (ii) invalidating or denying any Person's right, power,
or competence to enter into or perform any of its obligations under any Loan
Document or invalidating or denying the validity or enforceability of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or any action taken hereunder or
thereunder; or

         (g) any Borrower or any other Credit Party shall (i) commence any case,
proceeding or other action under any existing or future law of any jurisdiction,
domestic or foreign, relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
conservatorship or relief of debtors, seeking to have an order for relief
entered with respect to it or seeking appointment of a custodian, receiver,
liquidator, assignee, trustee or sequestrator (or similar official) for it or
any substantial part of its properties, (ii) make a general assignment for the
benefit of creditors, (iii) consent to or take any action in furtherance of, or,
indicating its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any of the acts set
forth in paragraphs (e) or (f) of this Section 7.1 or clauses (i) and (ii) of
this paragraph (g), or (iv) shall admit in writing its inability to, or shall be
generally unable to, pay its debts as such debts become due; or

         (h) a final judgment or judgments for the payment of money in excess of
the Minimum Actionable Amount in the aggregate shall be rendered against any
Borrower or any other Credit Party, unless (i) the excess shall be fully covered
by insurance and the issuer(s) of the applicable policies shall have
acknowledged full coverage in writing within fifteen (15) days of judgment, or
(ii) the same shall be vacated, stayed, bonded, paid or discharged within a
period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such judgment; or

         (i) any other event shall have occurred that has had or could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or

         (j) any provision of any Loan Document shall for any reason cease to be
valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms, or any Lien
granted, or intended by the Loan Documents to be granted, to Lender shall cease
to be a valid and perfected Lien having the first priority (or a lesser priority
if expressly permitted in the Loan Documents) in any of the Collateral (or any
Credit Party shall so assert any of the foregoing); or

         (k) a Change of Control shall have occurred with respect to any
Corporate Credit Party; or

         (l) an ERISA Event shall have occurred that, in the opinion of the
Lender, when taken together with all other ERISA Events that have occurred and
are then continuing, could reasonably be expected to result in liability of any
Credit Party in an aggregate amount exceeding the Minimum Actionable Amount.

7.2 Remedies. (a) If any Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then
Lender may terminate or suspend its obligation to make further Revolving Credit
Advances and to incur additional Letter of Credit Obligations. In addition, if
any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lender may, without
notice, take any one or more of the following actions: (i) declare all or any
portion of the Obligations to be forthwith due and payable, including contingent
liabilities with respect to Letter of Credit Obligations, whereupon such
Obligations shall become and be due and payable; (ii) require that all Letter of
Credit Obligations be fully cash collateralized pursuant to Schedule C; or (iii)
exercise any rights and remedies provided to Lender under the Loan Documents or
at law or equity, including all remedies provided under the Code; provided, that
upon the occurrence of any Event of Default specified in Sections 7.1 (e), (f)
or (g), the Obligations shall become immediately due and payable (and any
obligation of Lender to make further Loans, if not previously terminated, shall
immediately be terminated) without declaration, notice or demand by Lender.

                                       21
<PAGE>

         (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Borrower and
each other Credit Party executing this Agreement expressly agrees that upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default, Lender may collect, receive, assemble,
process, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and
may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give an option or options to purchase or
otherwise dispose of and deliver said Collateral (or contract to do so), or any
part thereof, in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any
exchange at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future
delivery without assumption of any credit risk. Lender shall have the right upon
any such public sale, to the extent permitted by law, to purchase for the
benefit of Lender the whole or any part of said Collateral so sold, free of any
right of equity of redemption, which right each Borrower and each other Credit
Party executing this Agreement hereby releases. Such sales may be adjourned, or
continued from time to time with or without notice. Lender shall have the right
to conduct such sales on any Credit Party's premises or elsewhere and shall have
the right to use any Credit Party's premises without rent or other charge for
such sales or other action with respect to the Collateral for such time as
Lender deems necessary or advisable.

         (c) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default and at Lender's request, each Borrower and each other Credit Party
executing this Agreement further agrees to assemble the Collateral and make it
available to Lender at places that Lender shall reasonably select, whether at
its premises or elsewhere. Until Lender is able to effect a sale, lease, or
other disposition of the Collateral, Lender shall have the right to complete,
assemble, use or operate the Collateral or any part thereof, to the extent that
Lender deems appropriate, for the purpose of preserving such Collateral or its
value or for any other purpose. Lender shall have no obligation to any Credit
Party to maintain or preserve the rights of such Credit Party as against third
parties with respect to any Collateral while such Collateral is in the
possession of Lender. Lender may, if it so elects, seek the appointment of a
receiver or keeper to take possession of any Collateral and to enforce any of
Lender's remedies with respect thereto without prior notice or hearing. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each Borrower and each other Credit
Party executing this Agreement waives all claims, damages, and demands against
Lender, its Affiliates, agents, and the officers and employees of any of them
arising out of the repossession, retention or sale of any Collateral except such
as are determined in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have arisen solely out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Person. Each Borrower and each other Credit Party executing this Agreement
agrees that ten (10) days' prior notice by Lender to such Credit Party of the
time and place of any public sale or of the time after which a private sale may
take place is reasonable notification of such matters. Each Borrower and each
other Credit Party shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any
sale or disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all amounts to
which Lender is entitled.

         (d) Lender's rights and remedies under this Agreement shall be
cumulative and nonexclusive of any other rights and remedies that Lender may
have under any Loan Document or at law or in equity. Recourse to the Collateral
shall not be required. All provisions of this Agreement are intended to be
subject to all applicable mandatory provisions of law that may be controlling
and to be limited, to the extent necessary, so that they do not render this
Agreement invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part.

7.3 Waivers by Credit Parties. Except as otherwise provided for in this
Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Borrower
and each other Credit Party executing this Agreement waives: (a) presentment,
demand and protest, and notice of presentment, dishonor, intent to accelerate,
acceleration, protest, default, nonpayment, maturity, release, compromise,
settlement, extension or renewal of any or all Loan Documents, the Notes or any
other notes, commercial paper, Accounts, Contracts, Documents, Instruments,
Chattel Paper and guaranties at any time held by Lender on which such Credit
Party may in any way be liable, and hereby ratifies and confirms whatever Lender
may do in this regard; (b) all rights to notice and a hearing prior to Lender's
taking possession or control of, or to Lender's replevy, attachment or levy
upon, any Collateral or any bond or security that might be required by any court
prior to allowing Lender to exercise any of its remedies; and (c) the benefit of
all valuation, appraisal and exemption laws. Each Borrower and each other Credit
Party executing this Agreement acknowledges that it has been advised by counsel
of its choices and decisions with respect to this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents and the transactions evidenced hereby and thereby.

7.4 Proceeds. The Proceeds of any sale, disposition or other realization upon
any Collateral shall be applied by Lender upon receipt to the Obligations in
such order as Lender may deem advisable in its sole discretion (including the
cash collateralization of any Letter of Credit Obligations), and after the

                                       22
<PAGE>
indefeasible payment and satisfaction in full in cash of all of the Obligations,
and after the payment by Lender of any other amount required by any provision of
law, including Sections 9-608(a)(1) and 9-615(a)(3) of the Code (but only after
Lender has received what Lender considers reasonable proof of a subordinate
party's security interest), the surplus, if any, shall be paid to Borrowers or
their representatives or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the
same, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

8.       Successors and Assigns

Each Loan Document shall be binding on and shall inure to the benefit of each
Borrower and each other Credit Party executing such Loan Document, Lender, and
their respective successors and assigns, except as otherwise provided herein or
therein. Neither any Borrower nor any other Credit Party may assign, transfer,
hypothecate, delegate or otherwise convey its rights, benefits, obligations or
duties under any Loan Document without the prior express written consent of
Lender. Any such purported conveyance by such Borrower or such Credit Party
without the prior express written consent of Lender shall be void. There shall
be no third party beneficiaries of any of the terms and provisions of any of the
Loan Documents. Lender reserves the right at any time to create and sell
participations in the Loans and the Loan Documents and to sell, transfer or
assign any or all of its rights in the Loans and under the Loan Documents.

9.       Guarantor Waivers by Borrowers

IF AND TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY OBLIGATION OF ANY BORROWER TO LENDER SHALL BE
CONSIDERED AN OBLIGATION OF GUARANTY OR SURETYSHIP, THEN THE FOLLOWING
PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 9 SHALL APPLY WITH RESPECT TO EACH SUCH BORROWER
SOLELY TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH BORROWER IS DEEMED TO ACT IN THE CAPACITY OF A
GUARANTOR AND SHALL NOT EFFECT A WAIVER OF RIGHTS IN SUCH PERSON'S CAPACITY AS A
BORROWER:

         (A) SUCH BORROWER EXPRESSLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE LENDER FIRST TO
PURSUE ANY OTHER PERSON, THE COLLATERAL, OR ANY OTHER SECURITY OR GUARANTY THAT
MAY BE HELD FOR THE OBLIGATIONS, OR TO APPLY ANY SUCH SECURITY OR GUARANTY TO
THE OBLIGATIONS BEFORE SEEKING FROM SUCH BORROWER PAYMENT IN FULL OF ITS
LIABILITIES TO LENDER OR PROCEEDING AGAINST SUCH BORROWER FOR SAME.

         (B) SUCH BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IF LENDER MAY, UNDER APPLICABLE
LAW, PROCEED TO REALIZE ITS BENEFITS UNDER ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS GIVING
LENDER A LIEN UPON ANY COLLATERAL, WHETHER OWNED BY ANY BORROWER OR BY ANY OTHER
PERSON, EITHER BY JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE OR BY NON-JUDICIAL SALE OR ENFORCEMENT,
LENDER MAY, AT ITS SOLE OPTION, DETERMINE WHICH OF ITS REMEDIES OR RIGHTS IT MAY
PURSUE WITHOUT AFFECTING ANY OF ITS RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. IF, IN THE EXERCISE OF
ANY OF ITS RIGHTS AND REMEDIES, LENDER SHALL FORFEIT ANY OF ITS RIGHTS OR
REMEDIES, INCLUDING ITS RIGHT TO ENTER A DEFICIENCY JUDGMENT AGAINST ANY
BORROWER OR ANY OTHER PERSON, WHETHER BECAUSE OF ANY APPLICABLE LAWS PERTAINING
TO "ELECTION OF REMEDIES" OR THE LIKE, SUCH BORROWER HEREBY CONSENTS TO SUCH
ACTION BY LENDER AND WAIVES ANY CLAIM BASED UPON SUCH ACTION, EVEN IF SUCH
ACTION BY LENDER SHALL RESULT IN A FULL OR PARTIAL LOSS OF ANY RIGHTS OF
SUBROGATION WHICH SUCH BORROWER MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE HAD BUT FOR SUCH ACTION BY
LENDER. ANY ELECTION OF REMEDIES THAT RESULTS IN THE DENIAL OR IMPAIRMENT OF THE
RIGHT OF LENDER TO SEEK A DEFICIENCY JUDGMENT AGAINST ANY BORROWER SHALL NOT
IMPAIR ANY OTHER BORROWER'S OBLIGATION TO PAY THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE
OBLIGATIONS. IN THE EVENT LENDER SHALL BID AT ANY FORECLOSURE OR TRUSTEE'S SALE
OR AT ANY PRIVATE SALE PERMITTED BY LAW OR THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, LENDER MAY BID
ALL OR LESS THAN THE AMOUNT OF THE OBLIGATIONS AND THE AMOUNT OF SUCH BID NEED
NOT BE PAID BY LENDER BUT SHALL BE CREDITED AGAINST THE OBLIGATIONS. THE AMOUNT
OF THE SUCCESSFUL BID AT ANY SUCH SALE, WHETHER LENDER OR ANY OTHER PARTY IS THE
SUCCESSFUL BIDDER, SHALL BE CONCLUSIVELY DEEMED TO BE THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF

                                       23
<PAGE>

THE COLLATERAL AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUCH BID AMOUNT AND THE REMAINING
BALANCE OF THE OBLIGATIONS SHALL BE CONCLUSIVELY DEEMED TO BE THE AMOUNT OF THE
OBLIGATIONS GUARANTEED BY SUCH BORROWER, NOTWITHSTANDING THAT ANY PRESENT OR
FUTURE LAW OR COURT DECISION OR RULING MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE
AMOUNT OF ANY DEFICIENCY CLAIM TO WHICH LENDER MIGHT OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED BUT
FOR SUCH BIDDING AT ANY SUCH SALE.

         (C) SUCH BORROWER AGREES THAT LENDER SHALL BE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO
(I) MARSHAL ANY ASSETS IN FAVOR OF SUCH BORROWER, (II) PROCEED FIRST AGAINST ANY
OTHER BORROWER OR PERSON OR ANY PROPERTY OF ANY OTHER BORROWER OR PERSON OR
AGAINST ANY COLLATERAL, (III) ENFORCE FIRST ANY OTHER GUARANTY OBLIGATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO, OR SECURITY FOR, THE OBLIGATIONS, OR (IV) PURSUE ANY OTHER REMEDY IN
LENDER'S POWER THAT SUCH BORROWER MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PURSUE ITSELF AND THAT MAY
LIGHTEN SUCH BORROWER'S BURDEN, ANY RIGHT TO WHICH SUCH BORROWER HEREBY
EXPRESSLY WAIVES.

         (D) EACH BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE FOREGOING WAIVERS ARE A
MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO LENDER'S ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT LENDER IS
RELYING UPON THE FOREGOING WAIVERS IN ITS FUTURE DEALINGS WITH SUCH BORROWER.
EACH BORROWER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT IT HAS REVIEWED THE FOREGOING WAIVERS
WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL AND HAS KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVED ITS JURY TRIAL
RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION,
THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.

10.      Miscellaneous

10.1 Complete Agreement; Modification of Agreement. This Agreement and the other
Loan Documents constitute the complete agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, supersede all prior
agreements, commitments, understandings or inducements (oral or written,
expressed or implied). No Loan Document may be modified, altered or amended
except by a written agreement signed by Lender, and each other Credit Party a
party to such Loan Document. Each Borrower and each other Credit Party executing
this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall have all duties and obligations
under this Agreement and such other Loan Document from the date of its execution
and delivery, regardless of whether the initial Loan has been funded at that
time.

10.2 Expenses. Borrowers agree to pay or reimburse Lender for all costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of all external counsel, advisors,
consultants (including environmental and management consultants) and auditors
retained in connection therewith), incurred in connection with: (a) the
preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, performance and enforcement of
the Loan Documents and the preservation of any rights thereunder; provided,
however, that Borrowers' obligation to pay or reimburse Lender for external
counsel's fees through the Closing Date is limited to 100% of external counsel's
fees through and including $37,500, and 50% of external counsel's fees above
$37,500; (b) collection, including deficiency collections; (c) the forwarding to
any Borrower or any other Person on behalf of any Borrower by Lender of the
proceeds of any Loan (including a wire transfer fee of $25 per wire transfer
(or, upon notice from Lender, such other rate as in effect from time to time));
(d) any amendment, waiver or other modification with respect to any Loan
Document or advice in connection with the administration of the Loans or the
rights thereunder; (e) any litigation, dispute, suit, proceeding or action
(whether instituted by or between any combination of Lender, any Borrower or any
other Person), and an appeal or review thereof, in any way relating to the
Collateral, any Loan Document, or any action taken or any other agreements to be
executed or delivered in connection therewith, whether as a party, witness or
otherwise; and (f) any effort (i) to monitor the Loans, (ii) to evaluate,
observe or assess any Borrower or any other Credit Party or the affairs of such
Person, and (iii) to verify, protect, evaluate, assess, appraise, collect, sell,
liquidate or otherwise dispose of the Collateral. Lender acknowledges that (A)
the initial field audit expenses are capped at $15,000, and (B) Borrowers have
deposited $82,500 with Lender in connection with payment of the fees and
expenses referenced above, in each case as set forth in the Commitment Letter.

10.3 No Waiver. Neither Lender's failure, at any time, to require strict
performance by any Borrower or any other Credit Party of any provision of any

                                     24
<PAGE>

Loan Document, nor Lender's failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising,
any right, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof or
waive, affect or diminish any right of Lender thereafter to demand strict
compliance and performance therewith. No single or partial exercise of any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or future exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Any suspension
or waiver of a Default or other provision under the Loan Documents shall not
suspend, waive or affect any other Default or other provision under any Loan
Document, and shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that Lender
would otherwise have had on any future occasion. None of the undertakings,
indemnities, agreements, warranties, covenants and representations of any
Borrower or any other Credit Party to Lender contained in any Loan Document and
no Default by any Borrower or any other Credit Party under any Loan Document
shall be deemed to have been suspended or waived by Lender, unless such waiver
or suspension is by an instrument in writing signed by an officer or other
authorized employee of Lender and directed to such Borrower specifying such
suspension or waiver (and then such waiver shall be effective only to the extent
therein expressly set forth), and Lender shall not, by any act (other than
execution of a formal written waiver), delay, omission or otherwise, be deemed
to have waived any of its rights or remedies hereunder.

10.4 Severability; Section Titles. Wherever possible, each provision of the Loan
Documents shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of any Loan Document shall be prohibited by
or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of
such provision or the remaining provisions of such Loan Document. Except as
otherwise expressly provided for in the Loan Documents, no termination or
cancellation (regardless of cause or procedure) of any financing arrangement
under the Loan Documents shall in any way affect or impair the Obligations,
duties, covenants, representations and warranties, indemnities, and liabilities
of any Borrower or any other Credit Party or the rights of Lender relating to
any unpaid Obligation (due or not due, liquidated, contingent or unliquidated),
or any transaction or event occurring prior to such termination, or any
transaction or event, the performance of which is not required until after the
Commitment Termination Date, all of which shall not terminate or expire, but
rather shall survive such termination or cancellation and shall continue in full
force and effect until the Termination Date; provided, that all indemnity
obligations of the Credit Parties under the Loan Documents shall survive the
Termination Date. The Section titles contained in any Loan Document are and
shall be without substantive meaning or content of any kind whatsoever and are
not a part of the agreement between the parties hereto.

10.5 Authorized Signature. Until Lender shall be notified in writing by any
Borrower or any other Credit Party to the contrary, the signature upon any
document or instrument delivered pursuant hereto and believed by Lender or any
of Lender's officers, agents, or employees to be that of an officer of such
Borrower or such other Credit Party shall bind such Borrower and such other
Credit Party and be deemed to be the act of such Borrower or such other Credit
Party affixed pursuant to and in accordance with resolutions duly adopted by
such Borrower's or such other Credit Party's Board of Directors, and Lender
shall be entitled to assume the authority of each signature and authority of the
person whose signature it is or appears to be unless the person acting in
reliance thereon shall have actual knowledge to the contrary.

10.6 Notices. Except as otherwise provided herein, whenever any notice, demand,
request or other communication shall or may be given to or served upon any party
by any other party, or whenever any party desires to give or serve upon any
other party any communication with respect to this Agreement, each such
communication shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been validly
served, given or delivered (a) upon the earlier of actual receipt and three (3)
days after deposit in the United States Mail, registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, with proper postage prepaid, (b) upon transmission,

10.8     Time of the Essence.  Time is of the essence for performance of the

CONFLICTS OF LAWS, provided, however, that EACH Borrower specifically consents
to the applicability of the law of the state in which such borrower has assets
(without regard to such state's conflicts of laws principles) with respect to
Lender's exercise and enforcement of the remedy of confession of judgment set
forth herein and EACH BORROWER PARTY expressly waives any defense which SUCH
Borrower may have against the enforcement by Lender of the confession of
judgment remedy, based upon any theory of law or equitable principle whatsoever,
including, without limitation, any claim by SUCH Borrower that the governing
laws of the State of New York may not permit the entry of judgment by
confession.

10.10 SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. (A) EACH BORROWER AND
EACH OTHER CREDIT PARTY EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY CONSENT AND AGREE THAT

BORROWER AND SUCH CREDIT PARTY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ANY APPEALS FROM THOSE COURTS
MAY HAVE TO BE HEARD BY A COURT LOCATED OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK; AND FURTHER
PROVIDED, THAT NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED OR OPERATE TO PRECLUDE
LENDER FROM BRINGING SUIT OR TAKING OTHER LEGAL ACTION IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION
TO COLLECT THE OBLIGATIONS, TO REALIZE ON THE COLLATERAL OR ANY OTHER SECURITY
FOR THE OBLIGATIONS, OR TO ENFORCE A JUDGMENT OR OTHER COURT ORDER IN FAVOR OF
LENDER. SUCH BORROWER AND EACH OTHER CREDIT PARTY EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT

DEEMED COMPLETED UPON THE EARLIER OF SUCH BORROWER'S OR SUCH CREDIT PARTY'S
ACTUAL RECEIPT THEREOF OR THREE (3) DAYS AFTER DEPOSIT IN THE U.S. MAILS, PROPER

BETWEEN THEM IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED
THERETO.

Agreement or the other Loan Documents without at least two (2) Business Days'

(and only to the extent that) such Credit Party or Affiliate is required to do

11.      Cross-Guaranty

                                       27
<PAGE>

11.1 Cross-Guaranty. Each Borrower hereby absolutely and unconditionally
guarantees to Lender and its successors and assigns the full and prompt payment
(whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) and performance of
all Obligations owed or hereafter owing to Lender by each other Borrower,
including that portion of the Revolving Credit Loan attributable to each other
Borrower. Each Borrower agrees that its guaranty obligation hereunder is a
continuing guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection, and that
its obligations under this Section 11 shall be absolute and unconditional,
irrespective of, and unaffected by:

         (a) the genuineness, validity, regularity, enforceability or any future
amendment of, or change in, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other
agreement, document or instrument to which any Borrower is or may become a
party;

         (b) the absence of any action to enforce this Agreement (including this
Section 11) or any other Loan Document or the waiver or consent by Lender with
respect to any of the provisions hereof or thereof;

         (c) the existence, value or condition of, or failure to perfect its
Lien against, any security for the Obligations or any action, or the absence of
any action, by Lender in respect thereof (including the release of any such
security);

         (d) the insolvency of any Credit Party; or

         (e) any other action or circumstances that might otherwise constitute a
legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, it being
agreed by each Borrower that its obligations under this Section 11 shall not be
discharged until the payment and performance, in full, of the Obligations has
occurred. Each Borrower shall be regarded, and shall be in the same position, as
principal debtor with respect to the Obligations guaranteed hereunder.

11.2 Waivers by Borrowers. Each Borrower expressly waives all rights it may have
now or in the future under any statute, or at common law, or at law or in
equity, or otherwise, to compel Lender to marshal assets or to proceed in
respect of the Obligations guaranteed hereunder against any other Credit Party,
any other party or against any security for the payment and performance of the
Obligations before proceeding against, or as a condition to proceeding against,
such Borrower. It is agreed among each Borrower and Lender that the foregoing
waivers are of the essence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and that, but for the provisions of this Section 11
and such waivers, Lender would decline to enter into this Agreement.

11.3 Benefit of Guaranty. Each Borrower agrees that the provisions of this
Section 11 are for the benefit of Lender and its successors, transferees,
endorsees and assigns, and nothing herein contained shall impair, as between any
other Borrower and Lender, the obligations of such other Borrower under the Loan
Documents.

11.4 Subordination of Subrogation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, and except as set forth in Section
11.7, each Borrower hereby expressly and irrevocably subordinates to payment of
the Obligations any and all rights at law or in equity to subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification or set off and any and
all defenses available to a surety, guarantor or accommodation co-obligor until
the Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full in cash. Each Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that this waiver is intended to benefit Lender and shall
not limit or otherwise affect such Borrower's liability hereunder or the
enforceability of this Section 11, and that Lender and its successors and
assigns are intended third party beneficiaries of the waivers and agreements set
forth in this Section 11.4.

11.5 Election of Remedies. If Lender may, under applicable law, proceed to
realize its benefits under any of the Loan Documents giving Lender a Lien upon
any Collateral, whether owned by any Borrower or by any other Person, either by
judicial foreclosure or by non-judicial sale or enforcement, Lender may, at its
sole option, determine which of its remedies or rights it may pursue without
affecting any of its rights and remedies under this Section 11. If, in the
exercise of any of its rights and remedies, Lender shall forfeit any of its
rights or remedies, including its right to enter a deficiency judgment against
any Borrower or any other Person, whether because of any applicable laws
pertaining to "election of remedies" or the like, each Borrower hereby consents
to such action by Lender and waives any claim based upon such action, even if
such action by Lender shall result in a full or partial loss of any rights of
subrogation which such Borrower might otherwise have had but for such action by
Lender. Any election of remedies that results in the denial or impairment of the
right of Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against any Borrower shall not
impair any other Borrower's obligation to pay the full amount of the

                                       28
<PAGE>

Obligations. In the event Lender shall bid at any foreclosure or trustee's sale
or at any private sale permitted by law or the Loan Documents, Lender may bid
all or less than the amount of the Obligations and the amount of such bid need
not be paid by Lender but may be credited against the Obligations. The amount of
the successful bid at any such sale, whether Lender or any other party is the
successful bidder, shall be conclusively deemed to be the fair market value of
the Collateral and the difference between such bid amount and the remaining
balance of the Obligations shall be conclusively deemed to be the amount of the
Obligations guaranteed under this Section 11, notwithstanding that any present
or future law or court decision or ruling may have the effect of reducing the
amount of any deficiency claim to which Lender might otherwise be entitled but
for such bidding at any such sale. In addition, each Borrower waives all rights
and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by Lender, even though the
election of remedies, such as a non-judicial foreclosure with respect to
security for the Obligations, has destroyed any Borrower's rights of subrogation
and reimbursement against the principal by the operation of Section 580d of the
California Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise.

11.6 Limitation. Notwithstanding any provision herein contained to the contrary,
each Borrower's liability under this Section 11 (which liability is in any event
in addition to amounts for which such Borrower is primarily liable under Section
1) shall be limited to an amount not to exceed as of any date of determination
the greater of:

         (a) the net amount of all Loans advanced to any other Borrower under
this Agreement and then re-loaned or otherwise transferred to, or for the
benefit of, such Borrower; and

         (b) the amount which could be claimed by Lender from such Borrower
under this Section 11 without rendering such claim voidable or avoidable under
Section 548 of Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or under any
applicable state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance
Act or similar statute or common law after taking into account, among other
things, such Borrower's right of contribution and indemnification from each
other Borrower under Section 11.7.

11.7 Contribution with Respect to Guaranty Obligations. (a) To the extent that
any Borrower shall make a payment under this Section 11 of all or any of the
Obligations (other than Loans made to that Borrower for which it is primarily
liable) (a "Guarantor Payment") which, taking into account all other Guarantor
Payments then previously or concurrently made by any other Borrower, exceeds the
amount which such Borrower would otherwise have paid if each Borrower had paid
the aggregate Obligations satisfied by such Guarantor Payment in the same
proportion that such Borrower's "Allocable Amount" (as defined below) (as
determined immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment) bore to the aggregate
Allocable Amounts of each of the Borrowers as determined immediately prior to
the making of such Guarantor Payment, then, following indefeasible payment in
full in cash of the Obligations and termination of the Commitments, such
Borrower shall be entitled to receive contribution and indemnification payments
from, and be reimbursed by, each other Borrower for the amount of such excess,
pro rata based upon their respective Allocable Amounts in effect immediately
prior to such Guarantor Payment.

         (b) As of any date of determination, the "Allocable Amount" of any
Borrower shall be equal to the maximum amount of the claim which could then be
recovered from such Borrower under this Section 11 without rendering such claim
voidable or avoidable under Section 548 of Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act,
Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or similar statute or common law.

         (c) This Section 11.7 is intended only to define the relative rights of
Borrowers and nothing set forth in this Section 11.7 is intended to or shall
impair the obligations of each Borrower to pay any amounts as and when the same
shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
including Section 11.1. Nothing contained in this Section 11.7 shall limit the
liability of any Borrower to pay the Loans made directly or indirectly to that
Borrower and accrued interest, Fees and expenses with respect thereto for which
such Borrower shall be primarily liable.

         (d) The parties hereto acknowledge that the rights of contribution and
indemnification hereunder shall constitute assets of Borrower to which such
contribution and indemnification is owing.

                                       29

<PAGE>

         (e) The rights of the indemnifying Borrowers against other Credit
Parties under this Section 11.7 shall be exercisable upon the full and
indefeasible payment of the Obligations and the termination of Lender's
obligation to extend any credit under this Agreement.

11.8 Liability Cumulative. The liability of Borrowers under this Section 11 is
in addition to and shall be cumulative with all liabilities of each Borrower to
Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Borrower
is a party or in respect of any Obligations or obligation of the other
Borrowers, without any limitation as to amount, unless the instrument or
agreement evidencing or creating such other liability specifically provides to
the contrary.

                                   Schedule C
                                Letters of Credit

1. Lender agrees, subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to
incur Letter of Credit Obligations in respect of the issuance of Letters of
Credit issued on the issuing bank's usual and customary terms and otherwise
reasonably acceptable to Lender and supporting obligations of each Borrower
incurred in the ordinary course of such Borrower's business, in order to support
the payment of such Borrower's inventory purchase obligations, insurance
premiums, security deposits, or utility or other operating expenses and
obligations, as Leading Borrower shall request as agent for such Borrower by
written notice to Lender that is received by Lender not less than five Business
Days prior to the requested date of issuance of any such Letter of Credit;
provided, that: (a) that the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit
Obligations in favor of the Borrowers at any one time outstanding (whether or
not then due and payable) shall not exceed $3,000,000; (b) no Letter of Credit
shall have an expiry date which is later than the Stated Expiry Date or one year
following the date of issuance thereof; and (c) Lender shall be under no
obligation to incur any Letter of Credit Obligation for the account of any
Borrower if after giving effect to the incurrence of such Letter of Credit
Obligation, the Net Borrowing Availability of such Borrower would be less than
zero. The maximum amount payable in respect of each Letter of Credit requested
by any Borrower will be guaranteed by Lender in favor of the issuing bank under
terms of a separate agreement between Lender and the issuing bank. Each Borrower
will enter into an application and agreement for such Letter of Credit with the
issuing bank selected by Lender (which may be an Affiliate of Lender). The bank
that issues any Letter of Credit pursuant to this Agreement shall be determined
by Lender in its sole discretion.

2. The notice to be provided to Lender requesting that Lender incur Letter of
Credit Obligations shall be in the form of a Letter of Credit application in the
form customarily employed by the issuing bank, together with a written request
by the applicable Borrower and the bank that Lender approve such Borrower's
application. Upon receipt of such notice Lender shall establish a reserve
against such Borrower's Borrowing Availability in the amount of 100% of the face
amount of the Letter of Credit Obligation to be incurred. Approval by Lender in
the written form agreed upon between Lender and the issuing bank (a) will
authorize the bank to issue the requested Letter of Credit, and (b) will
conclusively establish the existence of the Letter of Credit Obligation as of
the date of such approval.

3. In the event that Lender shall make any payment on or pursuant to any Letter
of Credit Obligation, Borrowers shall be unconditionally obligated to reimburse
Lender therefor, and such payment shall then be deemed to constitute a Revolving
Credit Advance in favor of such Borrower. For purposes of computing interest
under Section 1.5, a Revolving Credit Advance made in satisfaction of a Letter
of Credit Obligation shall be deemed to have been made as of the date on which
the issuer or endorser makes the related payment under the underlying Letter of
Credit.

4. In the event that any Letter of Credit Obligations, whether or not then due
or payable, shall for any reason be outstanding on the Commitment Termination
Date, the applicable Borrower will either (a) cause the underlying Letter of
Credit to be returned and canceled and each corresponding Letter of Credit
Obligation to be terminated, or (b) pay to Lender, in immediately available
funds, an amount equal to 105% of the maximum amount then available to be drawn
under all Letters of Credit in favor of such Borrower not so returned and
canceled to be held by Lender as cash collateral in an account under the
exclusive dominion and control of Lender (the "Cash Collateral Account").

5. In the event that Lender shall incur any Letter of Credit Obligations in
favor of any Borrower, such Borrower agrees to pay the Letter of Credit Fee to
Lender as compensation to Lender for incurring such Letter of Credit
Obligations. In addition, such Borrower shall reimburse Lender for all
administrative and/or processing fees and charges paid by Lender on account of
any such Letters of Credit or Letter of Credit Obligations to the issuing bank.

6. Each Borrower's Obligations to lender with respect to any Letter of Credit or
Letter of Credit Obligation shall be evidenced by Lender's records and shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall not be affected, modified or
impaired by (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the transactions
contemplated by or related to such Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit
Obligation; (b) any amendment or waiver of or consent to depart from all or any
of the terms of the transactions contemplated by or related to such Letter of
Credit or Letter of Credit Obligation; (c) the existence of any claim, set-off,
defense or other right which any Borrower or any other Credit Party may have
against Lender, the issuer or beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, or any other
Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or

connection with such Letter of Credit or any other Letter of Credit proves to
have been forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any
statement therein proves to have been untrue or incorrect in any respect.

7. In addition to any other indemnity obligations which any Borrower may have to
Lender under this Agreement and without limiting such other indemnification
provisions, each Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify Lender from and to hold
Lender harmless against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, costs and
expenses (including, attorneys' fees and expenses) which Lender may (other than
as a result of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct) incur or be
subject to as a consequence, directly or indirectly, of (a) the issuance of or
payment of or failure to pay under any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit
Obligation or (b) any suit, investigation or proceeding as to which Lender is or
may become a party as a consequence, directly or indirectly, of the issuance of
any Letter of Credit, the incurring of any Letter of Credit Obligation or any
payment of or failure to pay under any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit
Obligation. The obligations of each Borrower under this paragraph shall survive
any termination of this Agreement and the payment in full of the Obligations.

8. Each Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts, omissions or misuse of
each Letter of Credit by the beneficiary or issuer thereof and, in connection
therewith, Lender shall not be responsible (a) for the validity, sufficiency,
genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted in connection with any
drawing under any Letter of Credit even if it should in fact prove in any
respect to be invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, untrue, fraudulent or forged;
(b) for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning
or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or any rights or
benefits thereunder or any proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, even if it
should prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (c) for the failure of
any issuer or beneficiary of any Letter of Credit to comply fully with the terms
thereof, including the conditions required in order to effect or pay a drawing
thereunder; (d) for any errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in
transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, telecopy, telex or otherwise;
(e) for any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document or
draft required in order to make a drawing under any Letter of Credit; or (f) for
any consequences arising from causes beyond the direct control of Lender.

                                   Schedule D
                                 Cash Management

Borrowers agree to establish, and to maintain, until the Termination Date, the
cash management system described below:

1. No Corporate Credit Party: (i) shall (nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to) open or maintain any deposit, checking, operating or other bank
account, or similar money handling account, with any bank or other financial
institution except for those accounts identified in Attachment I hereto (to
include a petty cash account not to exceed $20,000 in the aggregate for all
Borrowers during any Fiscal Month, and a payroll account not to exceed an amount
equal to one regular payroll at any time); and (ii) shall close or permit to be
closed any of the accounts listed in Attachment I hereto, in each case without
Lender's prior written consent, and then only after such Credit Party has
implemented agreements with such bank or financial institution and Lender
acceptable to Lender.

2. Commencing on the Closing Date and until the Termination Date, each Corporate
Credit Party shall cause to be deposited directly all cash, checks, notes,
drafts or other similar items relating to or constituting proceeds of or
payments made in respect of any and all Collateral (a) prior to the occurrence
of an Event of Default, into blocked accounts (collectively, the "Blocked
Accounts") in such Credit Party's name set forth in paragraph 1 of Attachment I
hereto, and (b) after the occurrence of an Event of Default, into lock boxes in
Lender's name (collectively, the "Lock Boxes") .

3. On or before the Closing Date, each bank at which the Blocked Accounts are
held shall have entered into tri-party blocked account agreements (the "Blocked
Account Agreements") with Lender and the applicable Credit Party, in form and
substance acceptable to Lender. Each such Blocked Account Agreement shall
provide, among other things, (a) the terms and conditions under which the
applicable Credit Party and the bank shall after the occurrence of an Event of
Default enter into a lockbox agreement though which payments into the lockbox
shall be processed by the bank for deposit into the Blocked Account, (b) that
such bank executing such agreement has no rights of setoff or recoupment or any
other claim against such Block Account or Lock Box, other than for payment of
its service fees and other charges directly related to the administration of
such account, and (c) that such bank agrees to sweep on a daily basis all
amounts in the Blocked Account to the Collection Account. After the occurrence
of an Event of Default, each bank at which a Blocked Account referred to in
Section 2(a) above is established shall also execute a Lock Box Agreement with
the applicable Credit Party which will establish a Lock Box as required under
Section 2(b) above, which Lock Box shall become effective immediately upon
execution thereof. In connection therewith, the applicable Credit Party shall,
immediately upon notice from Lender, instruct all Account Debtors to remit all
cash, checks, notes, drafts or other similar items relating to or constituting
proceeds of or payments made in respect of any and all Collateral directly to
the Lock Box, as required under Section 2(b) above.

4. On the Closing Date, (a) the blocked account and springing lock box
arrangements shall immediately become operative at the banks at which the
Blocked Accounts are maintained, and (b) amounts outstanding under the Revolving
Credit Loan (for purposes of the Borrowing Availability) shall be reduced
through daily sweeps, by wire transfer, of the Blocked Accounts into the
Collection Account. Borrowers acknowledge that they shall have no right to gain
access to any of the moneys in the Blocked Accounts until after the Termination
Date.

5. Each Borrower may maintain, in its name, accounts (the "Disbursement
Accounts") at a bank or banks reasonably acceptable to Lender into which Lender
shall, from time to time, deposit proceeds of Revolving Credit Advances made
pursuant to Section 1.1 for use solely in accordance with the provisions of
Section 1.3. All of the Disbursement Accounts as of the Closing Date are listed
in paragraph 2 of Attachment I hereto.

6. Upon the request of Lender, each Corporate Credit Party shall forward to
Lender, on a daily basis, evidence of the deposit of all items of payment
received by such Credit Party into the Blocked Accounts and copies of all such
checks and other items, together with a statement showing the application of
those items relating to payments on Accounts to outstanding Accounts and a
collection report with regard thereto in form and substance satisfactory to
Lender.

                                SCHEDULE E - FEES

1. UNUSED LINE FEE: For each day from the Closing Date, and through and
including the Termination Date, an amount equal to (a) the Maximum Amount less,
provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Special
Reserve and all other reserves established by Lender, less (b) the Revolving
Credit Loan for such day multiplied by 0.25%, the product of which is then
divided by 360. The Unused Line Fee for each month (except for the month in
which the Termination Date occurs) is payable on the first day of each
subsequent calendar month following the Closing Date; the final monthly
installment of the Unused Line Fee is payable on the Termination Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any unpaid Unused Line Fee is immediately due and
payable on the Commitment Termination Date.

2. LETTER OF CREDIT FEE: For each day for which Lender maintains Letter of
Credit Obligations outstanding, an amount equal to the amount of the Letter of
Credit Obligations outstanding on such day, multiplied by 4.50%, the product of
which is then divided by 360. The Letter of Credit Fee incurred for each month
is payable at the same time each payment of the Unused Line Fee is due.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any unpaid Letter of Credit Fee is immediately
due and payable on the Commitment Termination Date.

3. CLOSING FEE; COLLATERAL MONITORING FEE: A non-refundable closing fee of
$45,000, payable and fully earned at closing (the "Closing Fee") (Lender
acknowledges that Borrowers have previously paid a commitment fee in the amount
of $45,000). A fully earned and non-refundable collateral monitoring fee of
$24,000 per annum, payable in equal monthly installments commencing on the
Closing Date and on the first day of each month thereafter; provided, however,
that any unpaid Collateral Monitoring Fee shall be immediately due and payable
on the Commitment Termination Date. The Collateral Monitoring Fee shall be
subject to adjustment (up or down) prospectively on an annual basis as
determined by the Borrowers' consolidated financial performance, commencing on
the First Adjustment Date. Adjustments to the Collateral Monitoring Fee shall be
in accordance with the following grid

- ---------------------------------------- --------------------------------------
If the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for   Then the annual Collateral
the Immediately Preceding Fiscal Year    Monitoring Fee shall be:
is:
- ---------------------------------------- --------------------------------------
Less than or equal to 1.25 : 1.0         $24,000
- ---------------------------------------- --------------------------------------
Greater than 1.25 : 1.0, but less than   $18,000
1.50 : 1.0
- ---------------------------------------- --------------------------------------
Greater than or equal to 1.50 : 1.0      $12,000
- ---------------------------------------- --------------------------------------

All adjustments in the Collateral Monitoring Fee after the First Adjustment Date
shall be implemented annually on a prospective basis, for each calendar month
commencing at least five days after the date of delivery to Lender of the
Borrowers' annual audited Financial Statements evidencing the need for an
adjustment. Concurrently with the delivery of such Financial Statements,
Borrowers shall deliver to Lender a certificate, signed by their chief financial
officer, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the continuance of, or
any change in, the Collateral Monitoring Fee. Failure to timely deliver such
Financial Statements shall result in an increase in the Collateral Monitoring
Fee to the highest level set forth in the foregoing grid, until the first day of
the first calendar month following the delivery of those Financial Statements
demonstrating that such an increase is not required. If a Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing at the time any reduction in the
Collateral Monitoring Fee is to be implemented, that reduction shall be deferred
until the first day of the first calendar month following the date on which such
Default is cured to Lender's satisfaction or Event of Default is waived in
writing by Lender. Additionally, if at any time any other Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Monitoring Fee
shall be automatically increased to the highest level set forth in the foregoing
grid until the first day of the first calendar month following the date on which
such Default is cured to Lender's satisfaction or Event of Default is waived in
writing by Lender. The increase in the Collateral Monitoring Fee provided for in
the preceding two sentences shall be in addition to any other remedy provided
for in this Agreement (including Lender's right to charge the Default Rate). Any
increase or decrease in the Collateral Monitoring Fee shall be done on a pro
rata basis.

                                       52

4. PREPAYMENT FEE: An amount equal to the Maximum Amount multiplied by:

         3.00% if Lender's obligation to make further Revolving Credit Advances
or incur additional Letter of Credit Obligations is terminated (voluntarily by
Borrowers, upon Default or otherwise) on or after the Closing Date and on or
before the first anniversary of the Closing Date, payable on the Commitment
Termination Date;

         1.50% if Lender's obligation to make further Revolving Credit Advances
or incur additional Letter of Credit Obligations is terminated (voluntarily by
Borrowers, upon Default or otherwise) after the first anniversary of the Closing
Date and on or before the second anniversary of the Closing Date, payable on the
Commitment Termination Date; or

         0.50% if Lender's obligation to make further Revolving Credit Advances
or incur additional Letter of Credit Obligations is terminated (voluntarily by
Borrowers, upon Default or otherwise) after the second anniversary of the
Closing Date and on or before the third anniversary of the Closing Date, payable
on the Commitment Termination Date.

Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (i) it would be difficult or
impractical to calculate Lender's actual damages from early termination of
Lender's obligation to make further Revolving Credit Advances and incur
additional Letter of Credit Obligations for any reason pursuant to Section
1.2(c) or Section 7.2, (ii) the Prepayment Fees provided above are intended to
be fair and reasonable approximations of such damages, and (iii) the Prepayment
Fees are not intended to be penalties.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Borrowers repay the Obligations in full as
a result of a Change of Control, the above-referenced percentages for the
Prepayment Fee shall be 2.00%, 1.00% and 0.50%, respectively.

5. AUDIT FEES: Reimburse Lender at the prevailing rate (currently $750) per
person per day, plus out of pocket expenses, for the audit reviews, field
examinations and collateral examinations conducted by Lender. Absent the
occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender shall conduct no more than five (5)
audits per Fiscal Year.

                                            MARLTON TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
                                                  CODE OF CONDUCT
                                                  March 24, 2004



I.       Scope:

         This policy applies to all directors (to the extent of their director
         related duties) and employees (collectively the "Employees") of Marlton
         Technologies, Inc. and its majority owned subsidiaries (collectively
         "Marlton"), which currently include all United States Sparks Exhibits &
         Environments and DMS Store Fixtures subsidiaries.

II.      Purpose:

         The purpose of this code is to formalize the requirement that Employees
         conducting business on Marlton's behalf act in an honest and ethical
         manner and in a manner consistent with the standards set forth below.

III.     Responsibility:

         All Employees are responsible for being aware of the (i) standards
         imposed by the code and (ii) implementation of such standards.

IV.                 Standards to be Observed:

                A.  All Marlton business is to be conducted in compliance with
                    applicable laws and regulations.

                B.  Corporate funds or other resources shall not be used for
                    gifts, favors or entertainment (collectively, the "Benefit")
                    for government officials, purchasing agents, suppliers or
                    other parties nor shall Employees accept a Benefit from
                    suppliers or those with whom Marlton does business unless
                    either (i) such action or the giving or receipt of such
                    Benefit has been approved in advance in writing by the Board
                    of Directors of Marlton or the person(s) to whom the Board
                    has delegated the responsibility to issue or grant such
                    approvals (collectively, the "Ethics Officer") or (ii) such
                    action or the giving or receipt of such Benefit:

                (i) is consistent with accepted business practices in the
                    applicable jurisdiction;

               (ii) is of sufficiently limited value so that it will not be
                    construed as a bribe or pay-off;

              (iii) is not in contravention of applicable laws or regulations
                    and generally accepted ethical standards;

               (iv) public disclosure of the facts surrounding such action will
                    not embarrass Marlton; and

                (v) is approved in advance in writing by two executive officers
                    of Marlton, if the value of such action or Benefit is in
                    excess of $500.

                C.  Generally, a conflict of interest occurs when an Employee's
                    personal and financial interest differ from the Employee's
                    responsibilities to Marlton  or from Marlton's best
                    interests. Conflicts of interest include situations in which
                    an Employee attempts to use his or her position at Marlton
                    to obtain an improper personal benefit for himself or
                    herself for his or her family members, or for any other
                    person, from any person or entity. Transactions or
                    activities involving a conflict of interest (except to the
                    extent also governed by paragraph IV.B hereof, in which case
                    paragraph IV.B shall be applicable), involving more than a
                    nominal amount (i.e. amounts in excess of $500) are
                    prohibited unless such transaction or activity is approved
                    in advance in writing by the Ethics Officer.

<PAGE>

                D.   Corporate funds or other resources shall not be used,
                    directly or indirectly, for any political activity or for
                    the reimbursement of any contribution for such purposes,
                    except as otherwise determined in advance in writing by the
                    Ethics Officer.

               E.   Complete, true and accurate accounting records will be kept
                    for all transactions. It is against Marlton's policy to make
                    entries that intentionally conceal or disguise the true
                    nature of any action.

               F.   It is Marlton's policy that the information in its public
                    communications, including Securities and Exchange Commission
                    ("SEC") filings, be full, fair, accurate, timely and
                    understandable. Employees involved in preparing public
                    communications and SEC filings are responsible for acting in
                    furtherance of this policy. In particular, these Employees
                    are required to maintain familiarity with the disclosure
                    requirements applicable to Marlton and are prohibited from
                    knowingly misrepresenting, omitting, or causing others to
                    misrepresent or omit, material facts about Marlton to
                    others, whether within or outside Marlton.

               G.   Employees should discuss questions concerning the code or
                    the standards imposed hereby, with their immediate
                    supervisor who will either assist the Employee or refer the
                    matter to the appropriate person at Marlton. If an Employee
