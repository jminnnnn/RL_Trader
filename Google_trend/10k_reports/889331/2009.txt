<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our future success will depend upon our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a manner
that is responsive to our customers&#146; needs. We will need to develop and introduce new products and
product enhancements on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging
industry standards and address increasingly sophisticated requirements of our customers. We invest
heavily in research and development without knowing that we will recover these costs. Our
competitors may develop products or technologies that will render our products non-competitive or
obsolete. If we cannot develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and
cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be

collective bargaining agreements or in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining
agreements. In addition, we may experience a shortage of supplies for various reasons, such as
financial distress, work stoppages, natural disasters or production difficulties that may affect

any reason, if protracted, could substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Certain of our major customers, such as those in the automotive industry and to a lesser extent the
electronics industry, are suffering financial hardships due to current economic conditions. The
bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could result in lower sales revenue and cause a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major U.S. auto manufacturer or significant supplier
likely could lead to substantial disruptions in the automotive supply base, resulting in lower
demand for our products, which likely would cause a decrease in sales revenue and have a
substantial adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a resource-intensive manufacturing operation, we are exposed to a variety of market and asset
risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and
interest rates. We have multiple sources of supply for the majority of our commodity requirements.
However, significant shortages that disrupt the supply of raw materials or result in price
increases could affect prices we charge our customers, our product costs, and the competitive
position of our products and services. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of
our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to
reduce the potentially adverse effects on our results. Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange
rates, commodity prices and interest rates cannot always be predicted. In addition, because of
intense price competition and our high level of fixed costs, we may not be able to address such
changes even if they are foreseeable. Substantial changes in these rates and prices could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For additional
discussion of interest rate, currency or commodity price risk, see &#147;Item&nbsp;7A. Quantitative and

earnings. Serving a global customer base and remaining competitive in the global market place may
require that we place more production in countries outside the United States, including emerging
markets, to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a cost-efficient structure. In
addition, we source a significant amount of raw materials and other components from third-party
suppliers or joint-venture operations in low-cost countries. Our international operating activities

capital on relevant compliance programs. Under these laws and regulations, we could be held
financially responsible for remedial measures if our current or former properties are contaminated
or if we send waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated, even if we did
not cause the contamination. We may be subject to additional common law claims if we release
substances that damage or harm third parties. In addition, future changes in environmental laws or
regulations may require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of
additional compliance programs. Any failure to comply with new or existing environmental laws or

facilities located on or near real property that was formerly owned and operated by others. Certain
of these properties were used in ways that involved hazardous materials. Contaminants may migrate
from, within or through these properties. These releases or migrations may give rise to claims.
Where third parties are responsible for contamination, the third parties may not have funds, or not
make funds available when needed, to pay remediation costs imposed upon us under environmental laws
and regulations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Net sales to the automotive, consumer electronics and communications industries represent a
substantial portion of our revenues. Factors negatively affecting these industries and the demand
for products also negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any
adverse occurrence, including industry slowdown, recession, political instability, costly or
constraining regulations, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions
in one or more of our customers&#146; production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in
significant decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the
business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, the automotive industry as
well as the consumer electronics market is highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in
general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates. In addition, the global
automotive industry has overall manufacturing capacity far exceeding demand. To the extent that
demand for certain of our customers&#146; products declines, the demand for our products may decline.
Reduced demand relating to general economic conditions, consumer preferences, interest rates or
industry over-capacity may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or

particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed.
We might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales.
Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

2008, the closing sale price of our common stock ranged between a low of $11.48 and a high of
$39.21, experiencing greater volatility over that time than the broader markets. The volatility of
our stock price may be related to any number of factors, such as general economic conditions,
industry conditions, analysts&#146; expectations concerning our results of operations, or the volatility
of our revenues as discussed above under &#147;Our Revenues May Vary Significantly from Period to
Period.&#148; The historic market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market
prices. We may not be able to sustain or increase the value of our common stock. Declines in the
market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to retain personnel with stock
incentives, to acquire businesses or assets in exchange for stock and/or to conduct future
financing activities with or involving our common stock.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Results of Operations &#151; 2008 Compared with 2007</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Net sales decreased slightly in the current year to $530.9&nbsp;million compared to $536.1&nbsp;million in
2007. These results reflected sales declines in the Automotive segment of $8.2&nbsp;million or 6% to
$126.9&nbsp;million, along with a decrease in sales in the Electronics segment of $6.4&nbsp;million or 2% to
$342.5&nbsp;million, largely offset by an increase in sales in the Electrical segment of $9.4&nbsp;million or
18% to $61.5&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The decrease in automotive sales was due primarily to the weakened passenger car market across all
geographies, resulting in sharp declines in global car production, particularly in the fourth
quarter of 2008, as OEMs took extended plant shutdowns. The negative impact from declines in volume were partially
offset by favorable currency effects of $5.0&nbsp;million, mainly due to the strong the euro, which
experienced a higher annual average translation rate of 1.475 in 2008 compared to 1.369 in 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The decrease in electronics sales primarily reflected weaker demand as consumers continued to lose
confidence in the economy and cut back on spending, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. In
addition, many customers in Asia, particularly contract manufacturers and original design
manufacturers, had extensive plant shutdowns, and electronics distributors reduced inventories in
response to weak demand and the uncertain outlook for 2009. The negative impact from declines in
volume were partially offset by net favorable currency effects of $1.8&nbsp;million, largely due to the
strength of the euro and to a lesser extent the yen, partially offset by the negative impact from
sales denominated in Korean won, which experienced a drop of more than 13% in the annual average
translation rate in 2008 compared to 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The increase in electrical sales was due in part to new OEM business and price increases over the
prior year and improvements in the industrial market. In addition, current year sales include $3.9
million from Startco Engineering Ltd. (&#147;Startco&#148;), acquired at the beginning of the fourth quarter
of 2008, and $1.3&nbsp;million from Shock Block Corporation (&#147;Shock Block&#148;), acquired during the first
quarter of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On a geographic basis, sales in the Americas decreased $2.5&nbsp;million or 1% in 2008 compared to 2007
due to decreased automotive sales of $8.4&nbsp;million and lower electronics sales of $3.5&nbsp;million,
partially offset by increased electrical sales of $9.4&nbsp;million. Automotive and electronics sales
declined sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008 as economic concerns led to a deterioration in
consumer confidence and reduced spending. As a result, the automotive OEMs sharply cut production
rates and shut down assembly lines for much of December and electronics distributors reduced
inventories. The electrical sales increase was due primarily to price increases over the prior year
and sales from newly-acquired companies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Europe sales remained steady in 2008 compared to 2007, reflecting a modest increase of $0.4
million. Current year results reflected favorable currency effects of $9.6&nbsp;million offset by lower
automotive sales due to a sharp decline in fourth quarter car production, which was down 22%
year-over-year, and lower electronics sales due to decreased demand from electronics distributors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Asia-Pacific sales decreased $3.1&nbsp;million or 1% in 2008 compared to the prior year mainly due to
lower electronics sales, which reflected weakness across all major end markets, from consumer
products to IT infrastructure spending for telecom equipment. This decrease was partially offset by
higher automotive sales, which reflected continued share gain in the growing Asian markets outside
of Japan. Current year results included unfavorable currency translation effects of $3.1&nbsp;million
primarily due to a sharp decline in the Korean won.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Gross profit was $143.7&nbsp;million or 27.1% of sales in 2008 compared to $171.5&nbsp;million or 32.0% of
sales in 2007. The decline in gross profit margin percentage in 2008 reflected a $5.7&nbsp;million
non-cash charge related to settlement of the Ireland pension plan, recorded in accordance with SFAS
No.&nbsp;88, &#147;Employer&#146;s Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans
for Termination Benefits.&#148; The decrease also reflected a $3.2&nbsp;million charge related to impairment
of certain manufacturing assets in China along with higher costs for transportation, materials and
utilities driven primarily by the increase in the price of oil and commodity metals for much of
2008. Higher costs related to plant transfer activities also contributed to the margin decline.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company also recorded approximately $8.8&nbsp;million of restructuring charges in cost of sales in
the current year, primarily due to the closure of the Matamoros, Mexico manufacturing facility,
along with severance and retention expense at the Irving, Texas, Des Plaines, Illinois and Swindon,
U.K. facilities, compared to $7.6&nbsp;million of restructuring charges in the prior year primarily
related to the closure of the Des Plaines, Illinois manufacturing facility, along with severance
and retention expense in Ireland and Germany.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Total operating expense was $135.2&nbsp;million or 25.5% of net sales for 2008 compared to $120.2
million or 22.4% of net sales for 2007. Fiscal year 2007 included an $8.0&nbsp;million gain on the sale
of property in Ireland. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $3.9
million to $107.2&nbsp;million in 2008 from $103.3&nbsp;million in 2007 due primarily to currency effects.
Research and development costs increased $2.4&nbsp;million to $24.1&nbsp;million in 2008 compared to $21.7
million in 2007 due to increased spending on new product development for the electronics and
automotive markets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Operating income was $8.5&nbsp;million or 1.6% of net sales in 2008 compared to $51.3&nbsp;million or 9.6% of
net sales in the prior year. The decrease in operating income in the current year was due primarily
to the special charges described above and higher costs due to transfer-related activities and
higher commodity prices.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Interest expense increased to $3.4&nbsp;million in 2008 compared to $1.6&nbsp;million for 2007 primarily due
to a $1.1&nbsp;million charge to revalue an interest rate swap transaction recorded in accordance with
SFAS No.&nbsp;157, &#147;Fair Value Measurement,&#148; as well as increased costs due to higher long-term debt
resulting from the $80&nbsp;million term loan agreement the company entered into on September&nbsp;29, 2008.
Other income, net, consisting of interest income, royalties, non-operating income and foreign
currency items, was $5.6&nbsp;million in 2008 compared to $1.5&nbsp;million in the prior year. The increase
reflected a net improvement of approximately $3.9&nbsp;million in foreign currency translation effects
(primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the Korean won, Philippine peso and
euro) and a $1.1&nbsp;million credit related to an exemption from Japanese output taxes paid in 2007
that was recovered in 2008, partially offset by a $2.8&nbsp;million non-cash charge related to marking
down the company&#146;s investment in Polytronics Technology Corporation Ltd. (&#147;Polytronics&#148;) to its
lower market value, recorded in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;115 &#147;Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities,&#148; which requires that the value of securities held for resale be marked
to market if the loss is deemed &#147;other than temporary.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $10.6&nbsp;million in 2008 compared to $51.3
million in 2007. Income tax expense was $2.6&nbsp;million in 2008 compared to $14.5&nbsp;million in the prior
year. The 2008 effective income tax rate was 24.5% compared to 28.2% in 2007. The decrease in the
2008 effective tax rate reflects the mix of income earned in lower tax jurisdictions partially
offset by a $1.1&nbsp;million unfavorable impact from marking down the company&#146;s investment in
Polytronics for which no tax benefit is available.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Results of Operations &#151; 2007 Compared with 2006</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Net sales increased slightly in 2007 to $536.1&nbsp;million compared to $534.9&nbsp;million in 2006. These
results were led by the Automotive segment, which had an increase in sales of $11.5&nbsp;million or 9%
to $135.1&nbsp;million, along with an increase in sales in the Electrical segment of $6.3&nbsp;million or 14%
to $52.1&nbsp;million, largely offset by a decrease in sales in the Electronics segment of $16.6&nbsp;million
or 5% to $348.9&nbsp;million. The increase in automotive sales was due to growth in the off-road truck
and bus product lines, new passenger vehicle products and favorable currency effects of $5.6
million, mainly due to the strengthening of the euro. Electrical sales increased primarily due to
price increases over the prior year and improvements in the industrial market. The decrease in
electronics sales reflected weaker distributor demand in the Americas and Asia-Pacific, partially
offset by favorable currency effects of $5.2&nbsp;million, largely due to the strengthening of the euro.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On a geographic basis, sales in the Americas decreased $11.7&nbsp;million or 5% in 2007 compared to
2006. Within the Americas, the electronics business declined $19.9&nbsp;million, reflecting inventory
rationalization at distributors and weaker telecom demand. Automotive sales increased $0.9&nbsp;million
due to growth in the off-road truck and bus product lines and new passenger vehicle products. The
electrical business increased $6.2&nbsp;million due to price increases over the prior year and
improvements in the industrial market.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Europe sales increased $6.6&nbsp;million or 6% in 2007
compared to 2006. The increase in European sales
was primarily due to increased automotive sales of $8.6&nbsp;million, partially offset by a $2.0&nbsp;million
decrease in electronics sales. The automotive sales increase reflected favorable
currency effects of $5.6&nbsp;million due to the strengthening euro and growth in both the passenger
vehicle and off-road truck and bus product lines. Lower electronics sales were due to decreased
demand from electronics distributors, partially offset by favorable currency effects of $4.4
million due to the strengthening euro.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Asia-Pacific sales increased $6.3&nbsp;million or 3% compared to the prior year. The increase in
Asia-Pacific sales was mainly the result of higher electronics sales due to improved demand for
digital consumer products. Automotive sales increased by $0.7&nbsp;million reflecting continued share
gain in the growing Asian markets outside of Japan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Gross profit was $171.5&nbsp;million or 32.0% of sales in 2007 compared to $161.3&nbsp;million or 30.2% of
sales in 2006. The gross profit margin percentage improvement resulted primarily from lower
restructuring charges in 2007 compared to 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $7.3&nbsp;million to $103.3&nbsp;million in 2007 from
$110.6&nbsp;million in 2006, primarily due to lower employee bonus expense in 2007 and the recognition
of $5.3&nbsp;million in higher restructuring and asset impairment charges in 2006. As a percentage of
net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 19.3% in 2007 from 20.7% in
2006. Research and development costs increased $3.0&nbsp;million to $21.7&nbsp;million due to increased
spending on new product development for the electronics and automotive markets. In 2007, a gain of
$8.0&nbsp;million was recognized on the sale of real estate in Ireland. Total operating expenses,
including the gain on Ireland property and intangible amortization, were 22.4% of net sales in
2007, compared to 24.8% of net sales in 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Operating income in 2007 increased 77.8% to $51.3&nbsp;million or 9.6% of sales compared to $28.9
million or 5.4% of sales in the prior year. The changes in operating income and operating margin
were due mainly to lower restructuring charges and decreased bonus expense in 2007 as described
above.

currency items, was $1.5&nbsp;million in 2007 compared to $2.2&nbsp;million in the prior year. The decrease
was primarily due to foreign currency effects.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $51.3&nbsp;million in 2007 compared to $29.4
million in 2006. Income tax expense was $14.5&nbsp;million in 2007 compared to $6.2&nbsp;million in the prior
year. The 2007 effective income tax rate was 28.2% compared to 21.0% in 2006. The 2006 effective
tax rate reflects certain adjustments including a $1.4&nbsp;million benefit resulting from a German tax
law change and recognition of a $1.8&nbsp;million benefit related to net operating losses from an
acquired group of companies. Income from continuing operations was $36.8&nbsp;million in 2007 compared
to $23.2&nbsp;million in 2006. In 2006, the company sold the Efen business and accounted for this
business as a discontinued operation that reported income, net of taxes, of $0.6&nbsp;million. Net
income in 2007 was $36.8&nbsp;million compared to $23.8&nbsp;million in the prior year.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company historically has financed capital expenditures through cash flows from operations.
Despite the recent adverse changes in market conditions, management expects that cash flows from
operations and available lines of credit will be sufficient to support both the company&#146;s
operations and its debt obligations for the foreseeable future.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Term Loan</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On September&nbsp;29, 2008, the company entered into a Loan Agreement with various lenders that provides
the company with a five-year term loan facility of up to $80.0&nbsp;million for the purposes of (i)
refinancing certain existing indebtedness; (ii)&nbsp;funding working capital needs; and (iii)&nbsp;funding
capital expenditures and other lawful corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The
Loan Agreement also contains an expansion feature, pursuant to which the company may from time to
time request incremental loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $40.0&nbsp;million. The
company had $80.0&nbsp;million outstanding at December&nbsp;27, 2008. Further information regarding this
arrangement is provided in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
this report.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Loan Agreement requires the company to meet certain financial tests, including a consolidated
leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The Loan Agreement also contains
additional affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, impose certain limitations
on the company&#146;s ability to merge with other companies, create liens on its property, incur
additional indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates except on an arm&#146;s length basis,
dispose of property, or issue dividends or make distributions. At December&nbsp;27, 2008, and for the
year then ended, the company was in compliance with these covenants. The new Loan Agreement does

banks that provides a $75.0&nbsp;million revolving credit facility, with a potential increase of up to
$125.0&nbsp;million upon request of the company and agreement with the lenders, which expires on July
21, 2011. At December&nbsp;27, 2008, the company had available
$75.0&nbsp;million of borrowing capacity
under the revolving credit facility at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.50% (0.97% as of December
27, 2008). The company also had $2.8&nbsp;million available in letters of credit at December&nbsp;27, 2008.

revolving line of credit was due on August&nbsp;18, 2009. The company also had a foreign fixed rate
mortgage loan outstanding totaling approximately 32.0&nbsp;million Taiwanese dollars with maturity dates
through August&nbsp;2013. The company chose to repay the outstanding balances on both debt instruments
in June&nbsp;2008, resulting in uses of cash totaling the equivalent of $1.7&nbsp;million. As a result, the
line of credit was closed on June&nbsp;28, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company started 2008 with $64.9&nbsp;million of cash. Net cash provided by operating activities in
2008 was approximately $40.6&nbsp;million in the year and included $8.0&nbsp;million in net income and $44.8
million in non-cash adjustments (primarily $32.2&nbsp;million in depreciation and amortization, $6.0
million related to impairment of assets / investments and $5.7&nbsp;million related to the Ireland
pension settlement), partially offset by $12.2&nbsp;million in changes to operating assets and
liabilities. Further information regarding the impairments is provided in Notes 5 and 11, and
information regarding the pension settlement is provided in Note 12, of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in this report.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Changes in various operating assets and liabilities (including short-term and long-term items) that
negatively impacted cash flows in 2008 consisted of decreases in accrued payroll and severance
($15.7&nbsp;million), net decreases in accrued expenses ($6.6&nbsp;million), increases in inventories ($6.6
million) and increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets ($6.4&nbsp;million), partially
offset by decreases in accounts receivable ($23.1&nbsp;million). Days sales outstanding in accounts
receivable declined to 43&nbsp;days at year-end 2008, compared to 58&nbsp;days at year-end 2007 and 60&nbsp;days
at year-end 2006. The improvement in days sales outstanding was due primarily to the decline in
sales and corresponding accounts receivable balances during the fourth quarter of 2008 along with a
reduction in past-due electronics accounts. Days inventory outstanding was 63&nbsp;days at year-end
2008, compared to 59&nbsp;days at year-end 2007 and 67&nbsp;days at year-end 2006. The increase in days
inventory outstanding in 2008 was due primarily to the decline in sales along with a temporary
planned increase of inventory balances in anticipation of plant transfers from our Des Plaines,
Illinois facility to our Piedras Negras, Mexico manufacturing facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Net cash used in investing activities in 2008 was approximately $94.3&nbsp;million and included $51.3
million in purchases of property, plant and equipment (primarily related to the company&#146;s plant
expansion and new facilities in the Asia-Pacific region, along with manufacturing process
improvements, new facilities and product introductions in Mexico) and $47.5&nbsp;million for the
acquisition of two businesses (Startco, acquired at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2008,
and Shock Block, acquired during the first quarter of 2008), partially offset by $4.5&nbsp;million in
cash receipts from the sale of two production facilities (one in Eltville, Germany related to the
Efen business, which discontinued its operations in 2006, and the other in Arcola, Illinois, which
transferred its operations to Mexico). Further information regarding the acquisitions of businesses
is provided in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 was approximately $62.0&nbsp;million, which included
$66.6&nbsp;million in net proceeds from debt and $1.9&nbsp;million in cash proceeds from the exercise of
stock options, partially offset by $6.6&nbsp;million in repurchases of the company&#146;s common stock. The
net proceeds from debt include $80.0&nbsp;million in gross proceeds under the company&#146;s term loan
discussed above. Further information regarding the company&#146;s debt is provided in Note 7 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The effect of exchange rate changes decreased cash by $2.3&nbsp;million in 2008. The net cash provided
by operating activities and financing activities, less net cash used in investing plus the effect
of exchange rate changes, resulted in a $6.0&nbsp;million increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2008.
This left the company with a cash balance of $70.9&nbsp;million at the end of 2008.

to 1 at year-end 2007 and 2.3 to 1 at year-end 2006. The change in the current ratio at the end of
the 2008 compared to the prior year reflected decreased current liabilities in 2008, primarily
related to lower accrued severance associated with the closure of the Ireland facility and reduced
short-term debt due to repayment of all outstanding balances related to the company&#146;s revolving
credit facility. The carrying amounts of total debt increased $66.7&nbsp;million in 2008, compared to a
decrease of $12.8&nbsp;million in 2007 and $2.4&nbsp;million in 2006, due to the $80&nbsp;million loan agreement
the company executed in 2008. The ratio of long-term debt to equity was 0.2 to 1 at year-end 2008,
compared to 0.0 to 1 at year-end 2007 and 0.1 to 1 at year-end 2006. Further information regarding
the company&#146;s debt is provided in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included

$59.9&nbsp;million in the year. Net cash used in investing activities was $34.8&nbsp;million and included
$40.5&nbsp;million in purchases of property, plant and equipment and $4.5&nbsp;million for the acquisition of
a business, partially offset by $8.6&nbsp;million from the sale of real estate in Ireland. Net cash used
in financing activities was $22.3&nbsp;million and included net payments of debt ($12.8&nbsp;million) and
repurchases of the company&#146;s common stock ($16.4&nbsp;million), partially offset by cash proceeds from
the exercise of stock options ($6.3&nbsp;million) and the excess tax benefit on share-based compensation
($0.6&nbsp;million). The effect of exchange rate changes increased cash by $5.4&nbsp;million. The net cash
provided by operating activities, less net cash used in financing and investing activities plus the
effect of exchange rate changes, resulted in a $8.2&nbsp;million net increase in cash. This left the
company with a cash balance of $64.9&nbsp;million at the end of 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Net operating assets (including short-term and long-term items) decreased
$5.5&nbsp;million in
2007. The major factors contributing to the change in net operating assets were decreases in
inventories, partially offset by decreases in accrued payroll and increases in prepaid expenses and
other current assets. Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable decreased to 58&nbsp;days at
year-end 2007 compared to 60&nbsp;days at year-end 2006. The improvement in days sales outstanding was
due primarily to a reduction in past-due electronics accounts. Days inventory outstanding was 59
days at year-end 2007 compared to 67&nbsp;days at year-end 2006. The improvement in days inventory
outstanding was the result of lean manufacturing and logistics initiatives and improved inventory
planning.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of December&nbsp;27, 2008, the company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined
under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Specifically, the company was not liable
for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties; the company was not directly liable for the
debt of any unconsolidated entity, and the company did not have any retained or contingent interest
in assets; and the company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with
unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured
finance or special purpose entities. In June&nbsp;2008 and October&nbsp;2008, the company entered into
derivative financial instruments, as defined by SFAS No.&nbsp;133, &#147;Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148; (&#147;SFAS 133&#148;). Further information regarding these arrangements

Value Measurements&#148; (&#147;SFAS 157&#148;). SFAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value by
providing a standard definition of fair value as it applies to assets and liabilities. SFAS 157,
which does not require any new fair value measurements, clarifies the application of other
accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS 157 must be applied
prospectively beginning January&nbsp;1, 2008. The impact of the adoption of SFAS 157 is more fully
described in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;158, &#147;Employers&#146; Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension

(&#147;SFAS 158&#148;). SFAS 158 requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a
defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or a liability in the balance sheet, with changes
in the funded status recorded through comprehensive income in the year in which those changes
occur. The company adopted SFAS 158 at December&nbsp;30, 2006. The impact of the adoption of SFAS 158 is

Financial Liabilities &#151; Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;115&#148; (&#147;SFAS 159&#148;). SFAS 159
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value at specified election dates. SFAS 159 is expected to expand the use of fair value
measurement, but does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards,
including those in SFAS 157. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15,
2007. The adoption of SFAS 159 did not have a material impact on the company&#146;s Consolidated
Financial Statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;160, &#147;Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements &#151; an amendment of ARB No.&nbsp;51&#148; (&#147;SFAS 160&#148;). SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December&nbsp;15, 2008, with earlier
adoption prohibited. SFAS 160 requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority
interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent&#146;s equity.
The amount of net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in
consolidated net income on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Income. SFAS 160 also amends
certain of ARB No.&nbsp;51&#146;s consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of SFAS
141(R) and includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its
noncontrolling interest. The company is evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 160 on its
Consolidated Financial Statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;141(R), &#147;Business Combinations&#148; (&#147;SFAS 141(R)&#148;), which
replaces SFAS No.&nbsp;141, &#147;Business Combinations&#148; (&#147;SFAS 141&#148;). SFAS 141(R) retains the underlying
concepts of SFAS 141 in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at
fair value under the acquisition method of accounting, but SFAS 141(R) changed the method of
applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects. Acquisition costs generally
will be expensed as incurred; noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the
acquisition date; in-process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an
indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a
business combination generally will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in
deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date
generally will affect income tax expense. SFAS 141(R) is effective on a prospective basis for all
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
annual period subsequent to December&nbsp;15, 2008, with the exception of the accounting for valuation
allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies. SFAS 141(R) amends SFAS 109,
&#147;Accounting for Income Taxes,&#148; such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes
and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date
of SFAS 141(R) would also apply the provisions of SFAS 141(R). Early adoption is not permitted. The
company is evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 141(R) on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Certain of the accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant
judgment by management in selecting the appropriate estimates and assumptions for calculating
amounts to record in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates and
assumptions, impacting the reported results of operations and financial position. Significant
accounting policies are more fully described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Certain accounting policies, however, are considered to
be critical in that they are most important to the depiction of the company&#146;s financial condition
and results of operations and their application requires management&#146;s subjective judgment in making
estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The company believes the
following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating
its reported financial results, as they require management&#146;s most difficult, subjective or complex
judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are
inherently uncertain. The company has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related
disclosures with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Revenue Recognition</I>: The company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the
sales process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped (FOB origin) to the
customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred,
collectibility is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable. At the end of each
period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of
ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the company adjusts
revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when
they are received by the customer. The company&#146;s distribution channels are primarily through direct
sales and independent third party distributors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Revenue &#038; Billing</I>: The company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing
contracts and written sales agreements. Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on
market factors, costs, and competition. Pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment (premium or
discount) from the company&#146;s published price lists. The customer is invoiced when the company&#146;s
products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Returns &#038; Credits</I>: Some of the terms of the company&#146;s sales agreements and normal business
conditions provide customers (distributors)&nbsp;the ability to receive price adjustments on products
previously shipped and invoiced. This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a
&#147;ship and debit&#148; program. This program allows the distributor to debit the company for the
difference between the distributors&#146; contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a
distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer. If the company approves
such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to &#147;debit&#148; its account for the difference between
the contracted price and the lower approved price. The company establishes reserves for this
program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these
debits as a reduction of revenue in accordance with the guidance of FASB&#146;s Emerging Issues Task
Force (&#147;EITF&#148;) Issue No.&nbsp;01-09, paragraph 9 &#147;Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a

to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible. The company also records allowances
for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables
are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter as
required by SFAS No.&nbsp;142, &#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#148; (&#147;SFAS 142&#148;), or if there is an
event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired. Management determined
the fair value of each of its business unit segments by using a discounted cash flow model (which
includes forecasted five-year income statement and working capital projections, a market-based
weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years) to estimate market value.
The company has defined its reportable segments as its reporting units for goodwill accounting.

no goodwill impairment existed. Specifically, the Company noted that its headroom, defined as the

point increase in its discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth rate for
each reporting unit would not have changed the company&#146;s conclusion that no goodwill impairment
existed at September&nbsp;28, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The goodwill of a reporting unit also must be tested between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below
its carrying value. As a result of the downturn in the U.S. and global economies, the Littelfuse
share price and market capitalization decreased in the fourth quarter. Throughout the fourth
quarter, management considered whether there were any indicators that the company&#146;s goodwill was
impaired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company concluded that no indicators of impairment were present and therefore an additional
impairment test during the fourth quarter was determined to not be required. The company&#146;s
conclusion was based on its review of its market capitalization throughout the fourth quarter plus
a reasonable control premium, when compared to the company&#146;s carrying value of its invested
capital. Throughout the fourth quarter, the company&#146;s fair value estimate based on its market
capitalization plus a reasonable control premium consistently exceeded its carrying value of
invested capital.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company&#146;s conclusion that no impairment indicator was present also was based on its
expectations for fiscal 2009 when compared to the forecast presented in its September&nbsp;28, 2008
goodwill impairment test. Given the company&#146;s headroom by reporting unit at its September&nbsp;28, 2008
test date, the company performed a sensitivity test on its September&nbsp;28, 2008 annual test showing
the impact of using the revised 2009 forecasts to determine if an indicator of impairment was
present in any of its reporting units. The company concluded that although the value of the entity
as a whole and each respective reporting unit had declined from its September&nbsp;28, 2008 test date,
the decline in value did not indicate that any reporting unit&#146;s fair value would have fallen below
its carrying value of invested capital.

impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
related asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. The

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Littelfuse has a number of company-sponsored defined benefit plans primarily in North America,
Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Historically these plans have been accounted for using SFAS No.
87, &#147;Employers&#146; Accounting for Pensions&#148; (&#147;SFAS 87&#148;), and the company recognized the net unfunded
status of the plan on the balance sheet. The company adopted SFAS 158 effective December&nbsp;30, 2006,
which requires the full unfunded status of the plan to be recognized. Actuarial gains and losses
and prior service costs and credits are now recognized as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. Accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and
recognizing the cost over the employee&#146;s expected period of employment with the company. Certain
assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations. These assumptions
include the discount rate, salary scales and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
The discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be
settled by purchase of an annuity contract. These assumptions are subject to change based on stock
and bond market returns and other economic factors. Actual results that differ from the company&#146;s
assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore, generally affect its
recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods. While the company believes that
its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience,
significant differences in results or significant changes in the company&#146;s assumptions may
materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense. Further information regarding
these plans is provided in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
this report.

restricted stock awards based upon the fair values of the awards. The fair value of stock option
awards is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes
assumptions for volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. Expected
volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Littelfuse stock, historical
volatility of Littelfuse stock and other factors. Historical data is used to estimate employee
termination experience and the expected term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based
on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The company has not paid any cash
dividends in its history.

stock awards granted in 2008 vest after a three-year performance period and are paid completely in
the company&#146;s common stock at the end of the performance period. The fair value of
performance-based restricted stock awards that are paid in common stock is measured at the market

performance-based restricted stock awards is based on the fair values and the company&#146;s current
estimate of the probable number of shares to be issued (based on the probable outcome at the end of
the performance period). As the company&#146;s estimate of the probable outcome changes in future
periods, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Total stock-based compensation expense was $5.1&nbsp;million and $5.0&nbsp;million in 2008 and 2007,
respectively. Further information regarding this expense is provided in Note 13 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;109 &#147;Accounting for Income
Taxes.&#148; Deferred taxes are recognized for the future effects of temporary differences between
financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences
are expected to reverse. The company recognizes deferred taxes for temporary differences, operating
loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. Federal and state income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign income that
is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In June&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No.&nbsp;48, &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes &#151; an interpretation of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109, Accounting for Income Taxes&#148; (&#147;FIN 48&#148;). FIN 48
addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax
return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, the company may recognize the
tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the
position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be
measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being
realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification,
interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased
disclosures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on December&nbsp;31, 2006 and had no adjustments to the
retained earnings balance as a result of the implementation. Further information regarding income
taxes and the company&#146;s adoption of FIN 48, including a detailed reconciliation of current year
activity, is provided in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this
report.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Outlook</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company&#146;s automotive and electronics markets weakened significantly in the fourth quarter of
2008 as a result of the sharp downturn in the global economy. The company believes this weakness
could continue through much of 2009. The electrical business, which held up well through most of
2008, has slowed recently and could be further impacted by declining non-residential construction
in 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2005 the company initiated a phased transition to consolidate its manufacturing into fewer
facilities in low-cost locations in China, the Philippines and Mexico. These manufacturing transfer
programs remain on or ahead of schedule and are expected to generate at least $20&nbsp;million in cost
savings in 2009 and significant additional savings in 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, the company recently began executing a plan which for 2009 is expected to reduce
operating expenses by approximately $15&nbsp;million and manufacturing costs by approximately $8&nbsp;million
over and above the $20&nbsp;million in transfer-related savings. These cost savings are expected to
significantly reduce the company&#146;s breakeven point by the second quarter of 2009 and are expected
to position the company for much-improved profitability when the global economy recovers.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and
commodities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Interest Rates</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company had $80&nbsp;million in debt outstanding at December&nbsp;27, 2008, in the form of a term loan,
which is described above in Item&nbsp;7 under <I>Liquidity and Capital Resources</I>. In order to reduce
interest rate risk and effectively manage its exposure to fluctuations in the adjustable interest
rate of the loan, the company entered into a one-year interest rate swap transaction with JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. on October&nbsp;29, 2008. The interest rate swap is for a notional amount of $65
million and allows the company to pay a fixed annual rate of 2.85% on the notional amount and
requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to pay a floating rate tied to the one-month U.S. dollar LIBOR. While the
remaining portion of this debt has a variable interest rate, the company&#146;s interest expense is not
materially sensitive to changes in interest rate levels since debt levels and potential interest
expense increases are insignificant relative to earnings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Foreign Exchange Rates</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The majority of the company&#146;s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign
countries. The company has manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Canada, Germany, China, Taiwan and
the Philippines. During 2008, sales to customers outside the U.S. were 62.0% of total net sales.
Substantially all sales in Europe are denominated in euros and substantially all sales in the
Asia-Pacific region are denominated in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan
and Taiwanese dollars.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company&#146;s foreign exchange exposures result primarily from sale of products in foreign
currencies, foreign currency denominated purchases, employee-related and other costs of running
operations in foreign countries and translation of balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign
currencies. The company&#146;s most significant long exposure is to the euro, with lesser long exposures
to the Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Korean won. The company&#146;s most significant short exposures
are to the Mexican peso, Philippine peso and Chinese yuan. Changes in foreign exchange rates could
affect the company&#146;s sales, costs, balance sheet values and earnings. The company uses netting and
offsetting intercompany account management techniques to reduce known foreign currency exposures
where possible and also, from time to time, utilizes derivative instruments to hedge certain
foreign currency exposures deemed to be material.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Commodities</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company uses various metals in the manufacturing of its products, including copper, zinc, tin,
gold and silver. Prices of these commodities can and do fluctuate significantly, which can impact
the company&#146;s earnings. The most significant of these exposures is to copper, where at current
prices and volumes, a 10% price change would affect pre-tax profit by approximately $0.6&nbsp;million.
During the second quarter of 2008, the company entered into a one-year swap agreement to mitigate
its exposure to fluctuations in the price of zinc. Further information regarding this commodity
contract is provided in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company purchases a particular type of silicon as a raw material for many of its semiconductor
products. Market demand for this commodity has fluctuated significantly during 2008. As a result,
there is a risk of market shortages for silicon in 2009. The company is taking actions to secure
adequate sources of supply to meet its expected future demand for this material.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The cost of oil has fluctuated dramatically during 2008. Consequently, there is a risk that a
return to high prices for oil and electricity in 2009 could have a significant impact on the
company&#146;s transportation and utility expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">While the company is exposed to significant changes in certain commodity prices and foreign
currency exchange rates, the company actively monitors these exposures and takes various actions to
mitigate any negative impacts of these exposures.

financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement

maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Nature of Operations</I>: Littelfuse, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the &#147;company&#148;) design, manufacture,
and sell circuit protection devices for use in the automotive, electronic and electrical markets
throughout the world.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Fiscal Year</I>: The company&#146;s fiscal years ended December&nbsp;27, 2008, December&nbsp;29, 2007, and December
30, 2006 and contained 52&nbsp;weeks each.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Basis of Presentation</I>: The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Littelfuse,
Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. The company&#146;s Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and include the assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses of all wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned
subsidiaries over which the company exercises control.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Use of Estimates</I>: The process
of preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial
Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the accompanying notes. The
company evaluates and updates its assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ
outside experts to assist in its evaluation, as considered necessary. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Cash Equivalents</I>: All highly liquid investments, with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Investments</I>: The company has determined that all of its investment securities are to be classified
as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized
gains and losses reported in &#147;Shareholders&#146; Equity&#148; as a component of &#147;Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss).&#148; Realized gains and losses and declines in unrealized value judged to
be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in other expense (income),
net. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest and
dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in interest income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</I>: The company&#146;s financial instruments include cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, derivative instruments and long-term debt. The
carrying values of such financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Accounts Receivable</I>: The company performs credit evaluations of customers&#146; financial condition and
generally does not require collateral. Credit losses are provided for in the financial statements
based upon specific knowledge of a customer&#146;s inability to meet its financial obligations to the
company. Historically, credit losses have consistently been within management&#146;s expectations and
have not been a material amount. A receivable is considered past due if payments have not been
received within agreed upon invoice terms. Write-offs are recorded at the time a customer
receivable is deemed uncollectible.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company also maintains allowances against accounts receivable for the settlement of rebates and
sales discounts to customers. These allowances are based upon specific customer sales and sales
discounts as well as actual historical experience.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Inventories</I>: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (first in, first out method),
which approximates current replacement cost. The company maintains excess and obsolete allowances
against inventory to reduce the carrying value to the expected net realizable value. These
allowances are based upon a combination of factors including historical sales volume, market
conditions, lower of cost or market analysis and expected realizable value of the inventory.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Property, Plant and Equipment</I>: Land, buildings, and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is
calculated using the straight-line method with useful lives of 21&nbsp;years for buildings, seven to
nine years for equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures, five years for tooling and three
years for computer equipment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Goodwill: </I>The company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of our fiscal fourth
quarter as required by SFAS No.&nbsp;142, &#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#148; (&#147;SFAS 142&#148;), or if
there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired. Management
determined the fair value of each of its business unit segments by using a discounted cash flow
model (which includes forecasted five-year income statement and working capital projections, a
market-based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years) to estimate
market value. The company has defined its reportable segments as its reporting units for goodwill
accounting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of the most recent annual test conducted on September&nbsp;28, 2008, the company concluded the fair
value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore,
no goodwill impairment existed. Specifically, the Company noted that its headroom, defined as the
excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital, was 51%, 95% and 115% for its
electronics, automotive and electrical reporting units, respectively, at September&nbsp;28, 2008.
Certain key assumptions used in the annual test included:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, the company performed a sensitivity test at September&nbsp;28, 2008 that showed a 100 basis
point increase in its discount rate or a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth rate for
each reporting unit would not have changed the company&#146;s conclusion that no goodwill impairment
existed at September&nbsp;28, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The goodwill of a reporting unit also must be tested between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below
its carrying value. As a result of the downturn in the U.S. and global economies, the Littelfuse
share price and market capitalization decreased in the fourth quarter. Throughout the fourth
quarter, management considered whether there were any indicators that the company&#146;s goodwill was
impaired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company concluded that no indicators of impairment were present and therefore an additional
impairment test during the fourth quarter was determined to not be required. The company&#146;s
conclusion was based on its review of its market capitalization throughout the fourth quarter plus
a reasonable control premium, when compared to the company&#146;s carrying value of its invested
capital. Throughout the fourth quarter, the company&#146;s fair value estimate based on its market
capitalization plus a reasonable control premium consistently exceeded its carrying value of
invested capital.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company&#146;s conclusion that no impairment indicator was present also was based on its
expectations for fiscal 2009 when compared to the forecast presented in its September&nbsp;28, 2008
goodwill impairment test. Given the company&#146;s headroom by reporting unit at its September&nbsp;28, 2008
test date, the company performed a sensitivity test on its September&nbsp;28, 2008 annual test showing
the impact of using the revised 2009 forecasts to determine if an indicator of impairment was
present in any of its reporting units. The company concluded that although the value of the entity
as a whole and each respective reporting unit had declined from its September&nbsp;28, 2008 test date,
the decline in value did not indicate that any reporting unit&#146;s fair value would have fallen below
its carrying value of invested capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test as required on an annual basis and
on an interim basis, if certain conditions exist. Factors the company considers important, which
could result in changes to its estimates, include underperformance relative to historical or
projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples. Due to the
diverse end user base and non-discretionary product demand, the company does not believe its future
operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating
results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Other Intangible Assets</I>: Trademarks and tradenames are amortized using the straight-line method
over estimated useful lives that have a range of five to 20&nbsp;years. Patents and licenses are
amortized using the straight-line method or an accelerated method over estimated useful lives that
have a range of four to 50&nbsp;years. The distribution networks are amortized on either a straight-line
or accelerated basis over estimated useful lives that have a range of four to 20&nbsp;years. Other
intangible assets are also tested for impairment when there is a significant event that may cause
the asset to be impaired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Environmental Liabilities</I>: Environmental liabilities are accrued based on engineering studies
estimating the cost of remediating sites. Expenses related to on-going maintenance of environmental
sites are expensed as incurred. If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company&#146;s
recorded liability for such claims, the company would record additional charges during the period
in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits</I>: Accounting for pensions requires estimating the future
benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee&#146;s expected period of employment with the
company. Certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations.
These assumptions include the discount rate, salary scales and the expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets. The discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit
obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract. These assumptions are subject to
change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors. Actual results that
differ from the company&#146;s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and
therefore generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods.
While the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions
and its actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in the
company&#146;s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued SFAS No.&nbsp;158,
&#147;Employers&#146; Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans &#151; an Amendment
of FASB Statements No.&nbsp;87, 88, 106, and 132(R)&#148; (&#147;SFAS 158&#148;). SFAS 158 requires the recognition of
the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or a
liability in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recorded through comprehensive
income in the year in which those changes occur. The company adopted SFAS 158 on December&nbsp;30, 2006.
The impact of the adoption of SFAS 158 is more fully described in Note 12 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Reclassifications</I>: Certain items in the 2007 and 2006 financial statements have been reclassified
to conform to the 2008 presentation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Revenue Recognition</I>: The company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the
sales process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped (FOB origin) to the
customer in accordance with the terms of the sale, the risk of loss has been transferred,
collectibility is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable. At the end of each
period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of
ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the company adjusts
revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when
they are received by the customer. The company&#146;s distribution channels are primarily through direct
sales and independent third party distributors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Revenue &#038; Billing</I>: The company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing
contracts and written sales agreements. Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on
market factors, costs, and competition. Pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment (premium or
discount) from the company&#146;s published price lists. The customer is invoiced when the company&#146;s
products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Returns &#038; Credits</I>: Some of the terms of the company&#146;s sales agreements and normal business
conditions provide customers (distributors)&nbsp;the ability to receive price adjustments on products
previously shipped and invoiced. This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a
&#147;ship and debit&#148; program. This program allows the distributor to debit the company for the
difference between the distributors&#146; contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions.
Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a
distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer. If the company approves
such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to &#147;debit&#148; its account for the difference between
the contracted price and the lower approved price. The company establishes reserves for this
program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these
debits as a reduction of revenue in accordance with the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force
(&#147;EITF&#148;) Issue No.&nbsp;01-09, paragraph 9 &#147;Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
Customer.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with prior authorization from
Littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit. The company
establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity. Sales revenue and
cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;48, &#147;Revenue
Recognition When Right of Return Exists&#148; (&#147;SFAS 48&#148;).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Volume Rebates</I>: The company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or
annual sales targets. If customers achieve their sales targets, they are entitled to rebates. The
company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a
reduction to revenue as products are sold.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Allowance for Doubtful Accounts</I>: The company evaluates the collectibility of its trade receivables
based on a combination of factors. The company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts
and, when the company becomes aware of a specific customer&#146;s inability to meet its financial
obligations, the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable
to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible. The company also records allowances
for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables
are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic
considerations and past
experience. Historically, the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts.
If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of
receivables could be further adjusted. However, due to the company&#146;s diverse customer base and lack
of credit concentration, the company does not believe its estimates would be materially impacted by
changes in its assumptions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Advertising Costs</I>: The company expenses advertising costs as incurred, which amounted to $2.3

selling, general and administrative expenses.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Restructuring Costs</I>: The company incurred severance charges and plant closure expenses as part of
the company&#146;s on-going cost reduction efforts. These charges are included in cost of sales,
selling, general and administrative expenses, or research and development expenses depending on the
personnel being included in the charge. See Note 9 for additional information on restructuring
costs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Foreign Currency Translation</I>: The company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries use the local currency or the U.S.
dollar as their functional currency, as appropriate. Assets and liabilities are translated using
exchange rates at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at weighted
average rates. The amount of foreign currency conversion gain recognized in the income statement
related to currency translation was $2.3&nbsp;million, $2.9&nbsp;million, and $2.1&nbsp;million in 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively and is included as a component of other expense (income), net. Adjustments from
the translation process are recognized in &#147;Shareholders&#146; Equity&#148; as a component of &#147;Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Stock-based Compensation</I>: In December&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R), &#147;Share-Based Payment&#148;
(&#147;SFAS 123(R)&#148;). SFAS 123(R) requires public companies to recognize compensation expense for the
cost of awards of equity compensation using a fair value method. The company adopted SFAS 123(R) on
January&nbsp;1, 2006 (i.e., the first quarter of 2006) using the modified prospective method. The
company made the one-time election to adopt the transition method described in FASB Staff Position
(&#147;FSP&#148;) No.&nbsp;FAS 123(R)-3, &#147;Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effect of
Share-Based Payment Awards.&#148; Under SFAS 123(R), benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized
compensation expense are now reported as a financing cash flow, rather than an operating cash flow
as prescribed under the prior accounting rules. Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2006, the company applied
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25, &#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees&#148; (&#147;APB 25&#148;)
to account for its stock-based compensation plans. Under APB 25, no compensation expense was
recognized for non-qualified stock option awards as long as the exercise price of the awards on the
date of grant was equal to the then current market price of the company&#146;s stock. However, the
company did recognize compensation expense in connection with the issuance of restricted stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On certain occasions, the company has granted stock options for a fixed number of shares with an
exercise price below that of the underlying stock on the date of the grant and recognizes
compensation expense accordingly. This compensation expense has not been material. See Note 13 for
additional information on stock-based compensation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Income Taxes: </I>The company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;109 &#147;Accounting for
Income Taxes.&#148; Deferred taxes are recognized for the future effects of temporary differences
between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse. The company recognizes deferred taxes for temporary
differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. Federal and state income taxes are provided on the
portion of foreign income that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on December&nbsp;31, 2006 and had no adjustments to the
retained earnings balance as a result of the implementation. Further information regarding the
company&#146;s adoption of FIN 48, including a detailed reconciliation of current year activity is
provided in Note 14.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Accounting Pronouncements</I>: In September&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;157, &#147;Fair Value
Measurements&#148; (&#147;SFAS 157&#148;). SFAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value by providing
a standard definition of fair value as it applies to assets and liabilities. SFAS 157, which does
not require any new fair value measurements, clarifies the application of other accounting
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS 157 must be applied
prospectively beginning January&nbsp;1, 2008. The impact of the adoption of SFAS 157 is more fully
described in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;159, &#147;The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities &#151; Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;115&#148; (&#147;SFAS 159&#148;). SFAS 159
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value at specified election dates. SFAS 159 is expected to expand the use of fair value
measurement, but does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards,
including those in SFAS 157. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15,
2007. The adoption of SFAS 159 did not have a material impact on the company&#146;s Consolidated
Financial Statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;160, &#147;Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements &#151; an amendment of ARB No.&nbsp;51&#148; (&#147;SFAS 160&#148;). SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December&nbsp;15, 2008, with earlier
adoption prohibited. SFAS 160 requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority
interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent&#146;s equity.
The amount of net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in
consolidated net income on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Income. SFAS 160 also amends
certain of ARB No.&nbsp;51&#146;s consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of SFAS
141(R) and includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its
noncontrolling interest. The company is evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 160 on its
Consolidated Financial Statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;141(R), &#147;Business Combinations&#148; (&#147;SFAS 141(R)&#148;), which
replaces SFAS No.&nbsp;141, &#147;Business Combinations&#148; (&#147;SFAS 141&#148;). SFAS 141(R) retains the underlying
concepts of SFAS 141 in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at
fair value under the acquisition method of accounting, but SFAS 141(R) changed the method of
applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects. Acquisition costs generally
will be expensed as incurred; noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the
acquisition date; in-process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an
indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a
business combination generally will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in
deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date
generally will affect income tax expense. SFAS 141(R) is effective on a prospective basis for all
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
annual period subsequent to December&nbsp;15, 2008, with the exception of the accounting for valuation
allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies. SFAS 141(R) amends SFAS 109 such that
adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies
associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of SFAS 141(R) would also
apply the provisions of SFAS 141(R). Early adoption is not permitted. The company is evaluating the
impact of adopting SFAS 141(R) on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In June&nbsp;2006, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets
of Song Long Electronics Co., Ltd. (&#147;Song Long&#148;). On July&nbsp;31, 2007, the company acquired the assets
of Song Long for approximately $5.5&nbsp;million and acquisition costs of approximately $0.5&nbsp;million, of
which approximately $0.8&nbsp;million was paid in 2006. From July&nbsp;31, 2007 and thereafter, the results
of operations of Song Long are included in the company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Income. The
company funded the acquisition with cash and has continued to operate Song Long&#146;s electronics
business subsequent to the acquisition. The Song Long acquisition strengthens the company&#146;s
position in the circuit protection industry, moving operations closer to customers in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the operations of
Song Long are included in the company&#146;s consolidated results from the date of the acquisition. At
the acquisition date, the purchase price allocations were based on preliminary estimates. These
estimates were subject to revision after the company completed final negotiation of working capital
adjustments to the purchase price and fair value analysis. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the
company completed the final negotiation, which resulted in an addition to the purchase price of
approximately $0.3&nbsp;million of acquisition costs, the assumption of $1.5&nbsp;million of accounts payable
and the holdback of $1.0&nbsp;million subject to the fulfillment of certain contractual obligations by
the seller. These obligations were fulfilled and payments totaling $1.0&nbsp;million were made during
the first quarter of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At June&nbsp;28, 2008, the company completed its final purchase price allocations and determined that no
material value was obtained from other identifiable intangible assets. All Song Long goodwill and
assets are recorded in the Electronics business unit segment and reflected in the Asia-Pacific
geographical area. Pro forma financial information is not presented due to amounts not being
materially different than actual results. Goodwill for the acquisition is expected to be deductible
for tax purposes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The following table sets forth the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of Song Long in
accordance with the purchase method of accounting with adjustments to record the acquired assets

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On February&nbsp;29, 2008, the company acquired Shock Block Corporation (&#147;Shock Block&#148;), a leading
manufacturer in ground fault technology located in Dallas, Texas, for $9.2&nbsp;million less a holdback
of $0.9&nbsp;million subject to the fulfillment of certain contractual obligations by the seller. From
February&nbsp;29, 2008 and thereafter, the results of operations of Shock Block are included in the
company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Income. The company primarily acquired customer lists and
intellectual property rights, including trademarks and tradenames. The customer lists were assigned
a useful life of seven years. The company funded the acquisition with cash and has continued to
operate Shock Block&#146;s electrical business subsequent to the acquisition. The Shock Block
acquisition expands the company&#146;s portfolio of protection products for commercial and industrial
applications and strengthens the company&#146;s position in the circuit protection industry.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the operations of
Shock Block are included in the company&#146;s consolidated results from the date of the acquisition.
The following table sets forth the preliminary purchase price allocations for Shock Block&#146;s assets
in accordance with the purchase method of accounting with adjustments to record the acquired assets

2008 and 2007 represent approximately 8.0% and 8.2%, respectively of total Polytronics shares

not the loss is &#147;other than temporary.&#148; Accordingly, SFAS No.&nbsp;115 &#147;Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,&#148; requires the cost basis of the security be adjusted
down to the fair value as of the measurement date with a resulting charge to earnings as a realized
loss. Consequently, the company recorded a realized loss on investment of <FONT face="'Times New Roman',times,serif">&#128;</FONT>2.0&nbsp;million

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Term Loan</I>

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On September&nbsp;29, 2008, the company entered into a Loan Agreement with various lenders that provides
the company with a five-year term loan facility of up to $80.0&nbsp;million for the purposes of (i)
refinancing certain existing indebtedness; (ii)&nbsp;funding working capital needs; and (iii)&nbsp;funding
capital expenditures and other lawful corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The
Loan Agreement also contains an expansion feature, pursuant to which the company may from time to
time request incremental loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $40.0&nbsp;million. The
company had $80&nbsp;million outstanding on the term loan at December&nbsp;27, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At the company&#146;s option, any loan under the Loan Agreement bears interest at a rate equal to the
applicable rate, as determined in accordance with the pricing grid set forth in the Loan Agreement,
plus one of the following indexes: (i)&nbsp;LIBOR or (ii)&nbsp;the Base Rate (defined as the higher of (a)
the prime rate publicly announced from time to time by the Agent under the Loan Agreement and (b)
the federal funds rate plus 0.50%). Overdue amounts bear a fee of 2.0% per annum above the
applicable rate. The actual interest rate paid on the term loan was approximately 3.2% at December
27, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Loan Agreement requires the company to meet certain financial tests, including a consolidated
leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The Loan Agreement also contains
additional affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, impose certain limitations
on the company&#146;s ability to merge with other companies, create liens on its property, incur
additional indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates except on an arm&#146;s length basis,
dispose of property, or issue dividends or make distributions. At December&nbsp;27, 2008, and for the
year then ended, the company was in compliance with these covenants. The new Loan Agreement does
not impact the existing debt covenants in the revolving credit facility described below.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Revolving Credit Facility</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company has an unsecured domestic financing arrangement consisting of a credit agreement with
banks that provides a $75.0&nbsp;million revolving credit facility, with a potential increase of up to
$125.0&nbsp;million upon request of the company and agreement with the lenders, which expires on July
21, 2011. At December&nbsp;27, 2008, the company had available
$75.0&nbsp;million of borrowing capacity
under the revolving credit facility at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.50% (0.97% as of December
27, 2008). The company also had $2.8&nbsp;million and $2.5&nbsp;million available in letters of credit at
December&nbsp;27, 2008 and December&nbsp;29, 2007, respectively. No amounts were outstanding under these
letters of credit at December&nbsp;27, 2008 and December&nbsp;29, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The domestic bank credit agreement contains covenants that, among other matters, impose limitations
on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, future mergers, sales of assets, payment of
dividends, and changes in control, as defined in the agreement. In addition, the company is
required to satisfy certain financial covenants and tests relating to, among other matters,
interest coverage, working capital, leverage and net worth. At December&nbsp;27, 2008, and for the year
then ended, the company was in compliance with these covenants.

(1.51% as of December&nbsp;27, 2008). The revolving line of credit becomes due on July&nbsp;21, 2011. The

dollar revolving credit facility at an interest rate of two-years time deposit plus 0.145%. The
revolving line of credit was due on August&nbsp;18, 2009. The company also had a foreign fixed rate
mortgage loan outstanding totaling approximately 32.0&nbsp;million Taiwanese dollars with maturity dates
through August&nbsp;2013. The company chose to repay the outstanding balances on both debt instruments
in June&nbsp;2008, resulting in uses of cash totaling the equivalent of $1.7&nbsp;million. As a result, the
line of credit was closed on June&nbsp;28, 2008. The company had the equivalent of $0.6&nbsp;million
outstanding on the Taiwanese dollar facility and the equivalent of $1.2&nbsp;million outstanding on the
foreign fixed rate mortgage loan outstanding at December&nbsp;29, 2007.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In
September&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;157, &#147;Fair Value Measurements&#148; (&#147;SFAS 157&#148;), which
provides a standard definition of fair value as it applies to assets and liabilities, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements, but it
does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS 157 clarifies the application of other
accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and sets out a fair value
hierarchy that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data obtained from independent
sources (observable inputs) and those based on an entity&#146;s own assumptions (unobservable inputs).
Under SFAS 157, fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy, with the
highest priority assigned to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(Level 1), the next priority using observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active
markets, but corroborated by market data (Level 2) and the lowest priority assigned to unobservable
inputs (Level 3). SFAS 157 must be applied prospectively beginning January&nbsp;1, 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Included in the company&#146;s investments are shares of Polytronics, a Taiwanese company whose shares
are traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, and which is designated as a Level 1 financial instrument
under SFAS 157. The fair value of this investment was $2.9&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;27, 2008 and $6.5
million at December&nbsp;29, 2007, based on the quoted market price at the close of business
corresponding to each date. Unrealized gains (losses), net of taxes related to this investment are
included in other comprehensive income. The remaining movement in the fair value of this investment
is due to the impact of changes in exchange rates, which is included as a component of the currency
translation adjustments in other comprehensive income. As of December&nbsp;27, 2008, management
evaluated the decline in market value and concluded that it is more likely than not that the loss
is other than temporary. As a result, the company recorded a realized loss on investment of
approximately $2.8&nbsp;million to other (income)&nbsp;expense, net for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;27,
2008. Further information regarding this investment is provided in Note 5.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In June&nbsp;2008, the company entered into an immaterial one-year swap agreement to manage its exposure
to fluctuations in the cost of zinc, which is used extensively in the manufacturing process of
certain products. The swap agreement is recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value
and is designated as a Level 2 financial instrument under SFAS 157. Fair value is determined based
on quoted futures prices for the underlying commodity. Furthermore, the swap agreement is
designated as a cash flow hedge in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;133, &#147;Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148; (&#147;SFAS 133&#148;), with changes in the fair value included in other
comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective. The ineffective portion of changes in
the fair value is recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Amounts included
in other comprehensive income are reclassified into cost of sales in the period in which the hedged
transaction is recognized in earnings. As of December&nbsp;27, 2008, the fair value of the swap
agreement was a $0.7&nbsp;million liability that was included in accrued expenses on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On October&nbsp;29, 2008, the company entered into a one-year interest rate swap transaction with
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the adjustable interest rate of
the Loan Agreement. The swap agreement, designated as a Level 2 financial instrument under SFAS
157, is for a notional amount of $65.0&nbsp;million and requires the company to pay a fixed annual rate
of 2.85% and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to pay a floating rate tied to the one-month U.S. dollar
LIBOR. Upon inception of the transaction, the company did not elect hedge accounting treatment as
the interest rate swap term was short-term in nature and was not deemed a material transaction. As
of December&nbsp;27, 2008, the fair value of the swap agreement was a $1.1&nbsp;million liability that was
included in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair value are
included as a component of interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year
ending December&nbsp;27, 2008.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2005, the company announced a downsizing of its Ireland operation and outsourcing of more of
its varistor manufacturing to lower cost Asian subcontractors. A liability of $4.9&nbsp;million was
recorded related to redundancy costs for the manufacturing operation associated with this
downsizing. This restructuring impacted approximately 35 associates in various production and
support related roles. These costs were paid in 2005 and 2006. In the second quarter of 2006, an
additional $17.1&nbsp;million, consisting of $20.0&nbsp;million of accrued severance less a statutory rebate
of $2.9&nbsp;million recorded as a current asset, was recorded as part of cost of sales related to the
closure of the entire facility. This restructuring is part of the company&#146;s strategy to expand
operations in Asia-Pacific in order to be closer to current and potential customers and take
advantage of lower manufacturing costs. This additional restructuring impacted approximately 131
employees. Restructuring charges are based upon each associate&#146;s current salary and length of
service with the company. These costs will be paid through 2009. The additions in 2007 and 2008
primarily relate to retention costs that were incurred during the transition period. In both
instances, all charges related to the downsizing/closure of the
Ireland facility were recorded in
&#147;Other Operating Income (Loss)&#148; for business unit segment
reporting purposes. A summary of activity of this liability is as

GmbH (formerly known as Heinrich Industries, AG) operations. Manufacturing related charges of $2.3
million were recorded as part of cost of sales and non-manufacturing related charges of $2.7
million were recorded as part of selling, general and administrative expenses. These charges were
primarily for redundancy costs to be paid through 2008. The additions in 2007 and 2008 primarily
relate to retention costs that were incurred during the transition period. All charges related to
this downsizing were recorded in &#147;Other Operating Income (Loss)&#148; for business unit segment reporting
purposes. This restructuring impacted approximately 52 associates in various technical, production,
administrative and support employees. A summary of activity of this liability is as follows:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2008, the company announced a reduction in workforce at its Des Plaines, Illinois
corporate headquarters in a phased transition from 2008 to 2009. A liability of $0.9&nbsp;million was
recorded associated with this downsizing. Manufacturing related
charges of $0.3&nbsp;million were
recorded as part of cost of sales and non-manufacturing related
charges of $0.6&nbsp;million were
recorded as part of selling, general and administrative expenses. All charges related to this
downsizing were recorded in &#147;Other Operating Income (Loss)&#148; for business unit segment reporting
purposes. The total cost expected to be incurred through 2009 is $1.4&nbsp;million. The amounts not yet
recognized primarily relate to retention costs that will be incurred over the remaining closure
period. This restructuring impacts approximately 40 associates in various production and support
related roles and the costs relating to the restructuring will be paid in 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Included in other long-term liabilities is an accrual related to a former coal mining operation at
Littelfuse GmbH (formerly known as Heinrich Industries, AG) for the amounts of <FONT face="'Times New Roman',times,serif">&#128;</FONT>3.7&nbsp;million ($5.2
million) and <FONT face="'Times New Roman',times,serif">&#128;</FONT>4.0&nbsp;million ($5.9&nbsp;million) in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The accrual, which is not
discounted, is based on an engineering study estimating the cost of remediating the dangers (such
as a shaft collapse) of abandoned coal mine shafts in Germany.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2008, the company recorded a charge of approximately $3.2&nbsp;million within cost of sales
related to asset impairments incurred primarily in China. The charge was associated mainly with the
discontinuation of equipment used to manufacture gas discharge tubes as the company has determined
to utilize a third party manufacturer for its production beginning in 2009. During 2007, the
company recorded a charge of approximately $0.8&nbsp;million within cost of sales related to asset
impairments incurred primarily in China and Germany. During 2006, the company recorded a charge of
approximately $4.4&nbsp;million for the write-down of Littelfuse GmbH (formerly known as Heinrich
Industries, AG) real estate and fixed assets. $2.7&nbsp;million of this write-down was recorded to
reduce the carrying value of property located in Witten, Germany, consisting primarily of land and
buildings used for manufacturing and administrative offices, as a result of entering into
agreements to sell the property. The sale was completed in the fourth quarter of 2006. The
remaining $1.7&nbsp;million charge related to a reduction in the carrying value of certain long-term
assets located at the same facility to record them at fair value in anticipation of their future
sale. $0.8&nbsp;million of the total charge was recorded within cost of sales and $3.6&nbsp;million within
selling, general and administrative expenses.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The
company has a company-sponsored defined benefit pension
plan covering substantially all of its North American
employees. The amount of the retirement benefit is based on years of service and final average pay.
The plan also provides post-retirement medical benefits to retirees and their spouses if the
retiree has reached age 62 and has provided at least ten years of service prior to retirement. Such
benefits generally cease once the retiree attains age 65. The company
also has company-sponsored defined benefit
pension plans covering employees in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Japan, Taiwan and the Netherlands.
The amount of the retirement benefits provided under the plans is based on years of service and
final average pay. Liabilities resulting from the plan that covers employees in the Netherlands are
settled annually through the purchase of insurance contracts. Separate from the foreign pension
data presented below, net periodic expense for the plan covering the Netherlands employees was $0.2
million, $0.1&nbsp;million, and $0.1&nbsp;million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company&#146;s contributions are made in amounts sufficient to satisfy legal requirements. The
minimum funding requirement, in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Securities Act of
1974 (&#147;ERISA&#148;) Current Liability amount, is $1.9&nbsp;million for 2009.

respectively. The increase in pension expense in 2008 was primarily due to the settlement of the
Ireland plan and the resulting settlement loss. The increase in pension expense in 2007 was largely
due to the wind down of the U.K. plan and the resulting settlement loss. Benefit plan related

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The accumulated benefit obligation for the U.S. defined benefits plans was $63.0&nbsp;million and $57.8&nbsp;million at December
27, 2008 and December&nbsp;29, 2007, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for the foreign plan was $12.9&nbsp;million
and $44.5&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;27, 2008 and December&nbsp;29, 2007, respectively. The significant change in domestic plan
assets in 2008 is due to the general economic slowdown during the latter half of 2008. The significant change in
foreign plan assets in 2008 is related to settlement of the company&#146;s Ireland pension plan.

in 2008) and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization over a three-year

&#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes &#151; an
interpretation of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109, Accounting for Income Taxes.&#148; FIN 48 addresses the
determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be
recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, the company may recognize the tax benefit from
an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured
based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized
upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest
and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December&nbsp;27, 2008 was approximately $2.8&nbsp;million. Of
this total, approximately $1.4&nbsp;million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if
recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. The company
reasonably expects an approximate $2.1&nbsp;million decrease in unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12
months due to settlements or lapse of tax statutes of limitations. None of the positions included
in unrecognized tax benefits are related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is
highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. The U.S.
federal statute of limitations remains open for 2004 onward. Foreign and U.S. state statute of
limitations generally range from three to six years. The company is currently under examination in
several foreign jurisdictions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The deferred tax asset valuation allowance is related to deferred tax assets from foreign net
operating losses. The remaining domestic and foreign net operating losses either have no expiration
date or are expected to be utilized prior to expiration. The foreign tax credit carryforwards begin
to expire in 2015. The company paid income taxes of approximately $8.8&nbsp;million, $16.7&nbsp;million and
$10.0&nbsp;million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. U.S. income taxes were not provided for on a
cumulative total of approximately $28&nbsp;million of undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S.
subsidiaries as of December&nbsp;27, 2008, and accordingly, no deferred tax liability has been
established relative to these earnings. The determination of the deferred tax liability associated
with the distribution of these earnings is not practicable. The company has two subsidiaries in
China and one subsidiary in the Philippines that are currently taxed at an income tax rate less
than the statutory income tax rate imposed in the jurisdictions. The &#147;tax holidays&#148; for these
subsidiaries are set to expire within the next four years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For the year ended December&nbsp;27, 2008, approximately 62.0% of the company&#146;s net sales were to
customers outside the United States (exports and foreign operations) including 19.4% in Hong Kong.
Sales to Arrow Pemco Group were less than 10% for 2008 and 2007, respectively, but 10.6% for 2006.
No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales during the last three years.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The company leases certain office and warehouse space as well as certain machinery and equipment
under non-cancelable operating leases. Rental expense under these leases was approximately $6.0
million in 2008, $4.4&nbsp;million in 2007, and $5.3&nbsp;million in 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases. The difference
between straight-line basis rent and the amount paid has been recorded as accrued lease
obligations. The company also has leases that have lease renewal provisions. As of December&nbsp;27,
2008, all operating leases outstanding were with third parties. The company did not have any
capital leases as of December&nbsp;27, 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2008, the company entered into an agreement to lease office space for its U.S.
headquarters, which will be located in Chicago, Illinois. The lease, with a stated commencement
date of January&nbsp;1, 2009, expires December&nbsp;31, 2024 and contains two five-year renewal options. In
addition, the lease contains leasehold improvement incentives and rent abatement for the first year
of the lease. The company expects to recognize rental expense for this lease on a straight-line
basis over the term of the lease, including base rent and all considerations received. Annual
rental expense under this lease will be approximately $1.4&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Future minimum payments for all non-cancelable operating leases with initial terms of one year or
more at December&nbsp;27, 2008, are as follows (in thousands):

even those systems determined effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation.

Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#147;COSO&#148;).
Based on this assessment, the company&#146;s management concluded that, as of December&nbsp;27, 2008, the
company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is effective.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Littelfuse&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst &#038; Young LLP, has audited the

time during normal business hours to the business and affairs of the Company and, to the
extent necessary to discharge the responsibilities assigned to the Executive hereunder, to

including any base salary which has been earned but deferred, to the Executive by the Company and
its affiliated companies in respect of the twelve-month period immediately preceding the month in
which the Effective Date occurs. During the Service Period, the Annual Base Salary shall be
reviewed no more than 12&nbsp;months after the last salary increase awarded to the Executive prior to

serve to limit or reduce any other obligation to the Executive under this Agreement. Annual Base

payment (whether cash or in-kind), including but not limited to reimbursements and Other Benefits,
would constitute a &#147;deferral of compensation&#148; under Section&nbsp;409A and a payment date that complies
with Section&nbsp;409A(a)(2) of the Code is not otherwise provided for such benefit either in this
Agreement or a Company program or policy, then such payment shall be made not later than 2 <FONT style="font-size: 70%"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>/<FONT style="font-size: 60%">2</FONT> months
after the end of the calendar year in which the payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk
of forfeiture. Any receipts or other proof of expenses (if required) shall be submitted to the
Company by the Executive no later than one month after the end of the calendar year in which the
payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, if at the time of separation from service the Executive is a
&#147;specified employee&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;409A, any cash or in-kind payments which
constitute a &#147;deferral of compensation&#148; under Section&nbsp;409A and which would otherwise become due
under this Agreement during the first 6&nbsp;months (or such longer period as required by Section&nbsp;409A)
after separation from service shall be delayed and all such delayed payments shall be paid in full
in the 7th month after the separation from service, and all subsequent payments shall be paid in
accordance with their original payment schedule. To the extent that any insurance premiums or
other benefit contributions constituting a &#147;deferral of compensation&#148; become subject to the above
delay, the Executive shall be responsible for paying such amounts directly to the insurer or other
third party and shall receive reimbursement from the Company for such amounts in the 7th month as
described above. The above specified employee delay shall not apply to any payments that are
excepted from coverage by Section&nbsp;409A, such as those payments covered by the short-term deferral
exception described in Treasury Regulations Section&nbsp;1.409A-1(b)(4).

legally binding settlement of such dispute, the Company concedes that the amount is payable, or the

determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section, except as
provided in the last sentence of this paragraph (a)) (hereinafter referred to collectively as a
&#147;<I>Payment</I>&#148;) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code or any interest
or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,

&#147;<I>Excise Tax</I>&#148;), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a &#147;<I>Gross-Up

interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any
income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed
upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the
Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Regardless of whether the Executive is subject to an Excise
Tax, in the event that the Company fails to make any payment at the time or in the form required by
Section&nbsp;6, and as a result it is subsequently determined that Executive is subject to the
additional tax and interest provided in Section&nbsp;409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code with respect to any
portion of such payment (such additional tax, together with any interest and penalties thereon, are
hereinafter collectively referred to as the &#147;<I>Section&nbsp;409A Penalty</I>&#148;) then Executive shall also be
entitled to receive an additional payment (a &#147;<I>Section&nbsp;409A Gross-Up</I>&#148;) calculated in the same manner
as a Gross-Up Payment by substituting &#147;<I>Section&nbsp;409A Penalty</I>&#148; for &#147;<I>Excise Tax</I>&#148; for all purposes of
this Section. The Section&nbsp;409A Gross-Up shall be considered a Payment for purposes of calculation

under this Section, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of
such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall
be made by Ernst &#038; Young LLP or such other independent certified public accounting firm as may be

detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of

be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to paragraph (c)
hereof and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting
Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment

Control occurs and if the Executive separates from service with the Company prior to the date on
which the Change of Control occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such
separation from service (i)&nbsp;was at the direct or indirect request of a third party who theretofore
had taken any steps intended to effect a Change of Control or (ii)&nbsp;otherwise arose in connection
with or in anticipation of a Change of Control, then for all purposes of this Agreement the
"<I>Effective Date</I>&#148; shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of such separation from service.

together with any interest and penalties thereon, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
&#147;<I>Section&nbsp;409A Penalty</I>&#148;) then Executive shall also be entitled to receive an additional payment (a
&#147;<I>Section&nbsp;409A Gross-Up</I>&#148;) calculated in the same manner as a Gross-Up Payment by substituting
&#147;<I>Section&nbsp;409A Penalty</I>&#148; for &#147;<I>Excise Tax</I>&#148; for all purposes of this Section. The Section&nbsp;409A
Gross-Up shall be considered a Payment for purposes of calculation of any Gross-Up Penalty.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)&nbsp;hereof, all determinations required to be made
under this Section, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of
such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall
be made by Ernst &#038; Young LLP or such other independent certified public accounting firm as may be
designated by the Executive (hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<I>Accounting Firm</I>&#148;) which shall provide
detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of
the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is
requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor
for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive shall appoint
another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which
accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses
of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined
pursuant to this Section, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days of the
receipt of the Accounting Firm&#146;s determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be
binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of
Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder,
it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been
made (hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<I>Underpayment</I>&#148;) consistent with the calculations required to
be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to paragraph (c)
hereof and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting
Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment
shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue
Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such
notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten business days after the
Executive is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such
claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such
claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which it gives such notice
to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to
such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of
such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:

direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or to contest the claim in any

Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not
notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the

defined in Section&nbsp;2 hereof) occurs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if a Change of Control occurs and if the Executive separates from service with the

demonstrated by the Executive that such separation from service (i)&nbsp;was at the direct or indirect

stock held by such Person, constitutes more than 40% of the total fair market value or total voting
power of the stock of the Company. For purposes of this subsection (a), the following acquisitions
shall not constitute a Change of Control: (i)&nbsp;the acquisition of additional stock by a Person who
is considered to own more than 50% of the total

provided in the last sentence of this paragraph (a)) (hereinafter referred to collectively as a
"<I>Payment</I>&#148;) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code or any interest
or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,
together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"<I>Excise Tax</I>&#148;), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a &#147;<I>Gross-Up
Payment</I>&#148;) in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any
interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any
income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed
upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the
Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Regardless of whether the Executive is subject to an Excise
Tax, in the event that the Company fails to make any payment at the time or in the form required by
Section&nbsp;6, and as a result it is subsequently determined that Executive is subject to the
additional tax and interest provided in Section&nbsp;409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code with respect to any
portion of such payment (such additional tax, together with any interest and penalties thereon, are
hereinafter collectively referred to as the &#147;<I>Section&nbsp;409A Penalty</I>&#148;) then Executive shall also be
entitled to receive an additional payment (a &#147;<I>Section&nbsp;409A Gross-Up</I>&#148;) calculated in the same manner
as a Gross-Up Payment by substituting &#147;<I>Section&nbsp;409A Penalty</I>&#148; for &#147;<I>Excise Tax</I>&#148; for all purposes of
this Section. The Section&nbsp;409A Gross-Up shall be considered a Payment for purposes of calculation
of any Gross-Up Penalty.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)&nbsp;hereof, all determinations required to be made
under this Section, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of
such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall
be made by Ernst &#038; Young LLP or such other independent certified public accounting firm as may be
designated by the Executive (hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<I>Accounting Firm</I>&#148;) which shall provide
detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of
the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is
requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor
for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive shall appoint
another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which
accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses
of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined
pursuant to this Section, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days of the
receipt of the Accounting Firm&#146;s determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be
binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of
Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder,
it is
possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been
made (hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<I>Underpayment</I>&#148;) consistent with the calculations

subject to Section 13(f) hereof, shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the
Executive may have under any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliated

this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any

have against the Executive or others. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other
employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive
under any of the provisions of this Agreement and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not
the Executive obtains other employment. To the extent that any amount due hereunder has become
subject to a bona fide dispute, payment of such amount may be delayed until no later than the end
of the first taxable year of the Executive in which the Company and the Executive enter into a
legally binding settlement of such dispute, the Company concedes that the amount is payable, or the
Company is required to make such payment pursuant to a final and nonappealable judgment or other

contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that
any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or
payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but
determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section, except as
provided in the last sentence of this paragraph (a)) (hereinafter referred to collectively as a
&#147;<I>Payment</I>&#148;) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code or any interest
or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,
together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
&#147;<I>Excise Tax</I>&#148;), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a &#147;<I>Gross-Up
Payment</I>&#148;) in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any
interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any
income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed
upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the
Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Regardless of whether the Executive is subject to an Excise
Tax, in the event that the Company fails to make any payment at the time or in the form required by
Section&nbsp;6, and as a result it is subsequently determined that Executive is subject to the
additional tax and interest provided in Section&nbsp;409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code with respect to any
portion of such payment (such additional tax, together with any interest and penalties thereon, are
hereinafter collectively referred to as the &#147;<I>Section&nbsp;409A Penalty</I>&#148;) then Executive shall also be
entitled to receive an additional payment (a &#147;<I>Section&nbsp;409A Gross-Up</I>&#148;) calculated in the same manner
as a Gross-Up Payment by substituting &#147;<I>Section&nbsp;409A Penalty</I>&#148; for &#147;<I>Excise Tax</I>&#148; for all purposes of
this Section. The Section&nbsp;409A Gross-Up shall be considered a Payment for purposes of calculation
of any Gross-Up Penalty.

under this Section, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of
such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall
be made by Ernst &#038; Young LLP or such other independent certified public accounting firm as may be
designated by the Executive (hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<I>Accounting Firm</I>&#148;) which shall provide
detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of
the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is
requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor
for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive shall appoint
another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which
accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses
of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined
pursuant to this Section, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days of the
receipt of the Accounting Firm&#146;s determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be
binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of
Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder,
it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been
made (hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<I>Underpayment</I>&#148;) consistent with the calculations
