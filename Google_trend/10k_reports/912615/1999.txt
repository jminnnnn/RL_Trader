                                     PART I

Item 1. Business

General

     Urban Outfitters, Inc. ("Urban Outfitters" or the "Company") operates two
business segments - a lifestyle-oriented general merchandise retailing segment
and a wholesale apparel business ("Wholesale"). The retailing segment operates
through retail stores and through direct response, including a catalog and a
website. The two retail concepts are Urban Outfitters ("Urban Retail") and
Anthropologie each of which sells a broad array of fashion apparel, accessories
and household and gift merchandise in an exciting and dynamic retail
environment. The Company's wholesale subsidiary ("Wholesale") designs and
markets young women's casual wear which it provides to the Company's retail
operations and sells to over 1,300 better specialty stores worldwide.

     Founded and originally operated by a predecessor partnership, the Company
opened its first store in 1970 near the University of Pennsylvania campus in
Philadelphia. The Company was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1976, and opened
its second store in Harvard Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1980. The
Company has since expanded to 34 Urban Retail stores in 25 metropolitan areas
throughout the United States, in Canada and in the British Isles. The Company
has opened 14 Anthropologie stores in 13 metropolitan areas in the United
States, most of which overlap the Urban Retail areas. The Company is in the
process of identifying new retail locations, negotiating new leases and planning
to accelerate its rate of new store openings in the coming years.

     Urban Retail: Urban Retail has established a strong reputation among urban,
style-conscious young adults aged 18 to 30. Urban Retail stores, which average
approximately 9,500 net selling square feet and carry 50,000 to 60,000 SKUs, are
typically located near large universities or other youth enclaves. A smaller
format store has been developed that averages 6,000 net selling square feet, and
carries somewhat fewer SKUs. The first store in this new format was opened in
March, 1998 in Bloomington, Indiana. The Company's lifestyle merchandise
offerings include women's and men's fashion apparel, footwear and accessories
and apartment wares and gifts. Urban Retail accounted for approximately 67.7%,
64.4% and 69.3% of the Company's net sales in Fiscal 1999, Fiscal 1998 and
Fiscal 1997, respectively.

     Anthropologie: Anthropologie, the Company's second retail format, mirrors
Urban Retail but tailors its merchandise and shopping environment to appeal to
an older, more established suburban customer, typically women aged 25 to 45. The
Company opened its first Anthropologie store in a suburb of Philadelphia in
October 1992. Anthropologie stores average approximately 8,200 net selling
square feet and carry 20,000 to 25,000 SKUs with a greater emphasis on home. The
stores are typically located in affluent suburban locations. A few very special
urban locations, such as Soho in New York City, will be part of the mix. Product
offerings include women's casual apparel

                                       3
<PAGE>

and accessories, home furnishings and an eclectic array of gifts and decorative
accessories for the home, garden, bed and bath. Anthropologie introduced a
direct response catalog in March, 1998. After evaluation of the initial test
results, the catalog mailings were expanded in the back half of the fiscal year.
The Company began accepting orders through its www.Anthropologie.com Internet
web site in December, 1998. Anthropologie accounted for approximately 22.8%,
18.0% and 12.6% of the Company's net sales in Fiscal 1999, Fiscal 1998 and
Fiscal 1997, respectively.

     Wholesale: Wholesale was established in 1984 to develop, side by side with
Urban Retail, apparel lines of young women's casual wear that could be
effectively sold in the Urban Retail stores at attractive pricing to the retail
customers. In order to provide the "attractive" prices, minimum production lots
are necessary. In order to reach these production minimums, Wholesale sells to
other retailers throughout the United States. The Wholesale design and
production staffs have expanded their involvement by designing and producing
private label merchandise categories such as apartment wares, gifts, accessories
and shoes.

     While continuing its role with Urban Retail and Anthropologie, Wholesale
also sells its products to over 1,300 better specialty stores worldwide under
three major labels: Free People, Co-Operative, and Bulldog. Wholesale accounted
for approximately 9.5%, 17.6% and 18.1% of the Company's net sales in Fiscal
1999, Fiscal 1998 and Fiscal 1997, respectively. Like Anthropologie and Urban
Retail, Wholesale has its own senior and creative management, while sharing
support services.

     The Company's home offices are in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and occupy
approximately 25,000 square feet at 1809 Walnut Street, adjacent to the retail
store at 1801 Walnut Street, and approximately 22,000 square feet at 235 South
17th Street.


Retail Strategy

     The Company's overall retailing strategy is to concentrate on its target
customers and offer a wide assortment of distinctive products in a compelling
shopping environment. By executing this strategy, the Company believes that it
has successfully captured and developed unique market niches.

                                       4
<PAGE>

Suppliers

     To serve its target customers and to recognize changes in fashion trends
and seasonality, the Company purchases merchandise from numerous vendors -
foreign and domestic. During Fiscal 1999, the Company did business with
approximately 2,500 vendors. No single vendor accounted for more than 10% of
merchandise purchases. Certain of the Company's vendors have limited financial
resources and production capabilities. The Company believes that its
relationships with its vendors are good.


Store Expansion Strategy

     The Company strategy is to open at least five new stores each year for both
retail concepts. In Fiscal 1999, Urban Retail opened six new stores, including
the Company's first store in London, while Anthropologie opened five. The Fiscal
2000 plan anticipates six Urban Retail stores and five Anthropologie store
openings.


Company Operations

     Distribution: In October 1996, the Company completed construction and
occupied its new 100,000-square-foot distribution center. The majority of
merchandise purchased by Urban Retail, Anthropologie, and Wholesale is shipped
directly to this facility. The facility is owned by the Company and is
approximately 60 miles from the home office in Philadelphia. The facility has an
advanced computerized materials handling system and will be expanded in Fiscal
2000 by 85,000 square feet in order to serve the future needs of the growing
retail network and direct response fulfillment. The 185,000-square-foot
structure is expected to provide distribution capability through the year 2002.
The Anthropologie catalog and Internet direct response orders and fulfillment
are currently handled by third party processors.

     In June 1998, the Company opened a distribution facility in Reno, Nevada
operated by a third party. The purpose of this facility is to service the west
coast stores with a faster turn around from West Coast vendors at a lower
freight cost per unit. The Company currently uses third-party distribution in
Canada. As additional stores are added in Europe, a separate third-party
distribution center may be established.

                                       5
<PAGE>

     Management Information Systems: Very early in the Company's growth,
management recognized the need for high-quality information in order to manage
the merchandise planning/buying, inventory management and control functions. The
Company invested in a retail software package that it believes continues to meet
its processing and reporting requirements. The Company utilizes Point of Sale
("POS") register and polling systems which provide for register efficiencies,
improved customer checkout and overnight polling. A discussion of the Company's
Year 2000 readiness can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis on Page
17.

     To manage its separate needs, Wholesale uses a software system for customer
service, order entry and allocations, production planning and inventory
management.

     The Company is in the process of converting its Anthropologie direct
response orders from third party call centers and fulfillment to an "in-house"
catalog management system which is scheduled to begin accepting orders with the
Fall catalog mailings.

     Inventory and Shrinkage Control: The Company's inventory management system
enables it to efficiently manage its inventory position. This system provides
management with accurate and timely information about inventory, pricing,
costing, markdowns, markups, transfers, damages, sales and perpetual inventory
levels. The system allows these items to be monitored by SKU, by location and by
day.

     The Company believes in investing to control its shrinkage levels because
many store locations are in typically higher theft areas. Merchandise shrinkage
control begins at the distribution center with the Company's information
systems, internal employee procedures, electronic article surveillance systems
and self-auditing controls. The Company educates and incentivizes store
employees to actively participate in loss prevention, and believes that its
store employees are its most effective deterrent to both internal and external
theft.


Competition

     The specialty retail and wholesale apparel businesses are highly
competitive. Retail competitive factors include store location; merchandise
breadth, quality, style, and availability; level of customer service; and price.
The Company's retail stores compete against a wide variety of smaller,
independent specialty stores as well as department stores and national specialty
chains. Wholesale competes with numerous companies, many of whose products have
wider distribution than the Company's. Certain of Urban Outfitters' retail and
wholesale competitors have greater name recognition and financial and other
resources than the Company.

                                       6
<PAGE>

Trademarks and Service Marks

     The Company is the registered owner in the United States of certain service
marks and trademarks (collectively "marks"), including without limitation,
"Urban Outfitters," "Anthropologie," "Ecote," "Co-Operative," "Urban Renewal,"
"Free People," "R.V.," "Slant," "Big Smokey," "Fink," "Lisa L.," "Lip Gloss,"
and "Shag." Each mark is renewable indefinitely, contingent upon continued use
at the time of renewal.

     In addition, the Company currently has pending registration applications
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office covering certain other marks. The
Company is also the owner of marks which have been registered in foreign
countries, including without limitation, Argentina, Australia, Benelux, Brazil,
Canada, Chile, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy,
Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the UK.
Applications for marks are pending in various foreign countries as well.

     The Company regards its marks as important to its business due to their
name recognition with the Company's customers. The Company believes that the
marks are so important that in order to protect them from infringement and to
defend against any claim of infringement, the Company established a separate
company whose primary purpose is to maintain and manage those and future marks
thereby increasing their value to the operating companies. The Company is not
aware of any claims of infringement or challenges to the Company's right to use
any of its marks in the United States; however, there can be no assurance that
the Company's marks do not or will not violate the proprietary rights of others,
that they would be upheld if challenged or that the Company would, in such an
event, not be prevented from using its marks, any of which could have an adverse
effect on the Company.

Employees

     The Company employs approximately 1,750 persons, 1,144 (65%) of whom are
full-time employees and 606 (35%) of whom are part-time employees. Of the
Company's total employees, 1,677 (96%) work at the retail segment, and 73 (4%)
work at Wholesale. The number of part-time employees fluctuates depending on
seasonal needs. None of the Company's employees are covered by collective
bargaining agreements and management believes that the Company's relations with
its employees are excellent.


Item 2. Properties

     The Company's home offices are located in Philadelphia at 1809 Walnut
Street, immediately adjacent to the retail store at 1801 Walnut Street. In March
1999, an additional near-by office facility was leased at 235 South 17th Street.

                                       7
<PAGE>

     All of the Urban Retail and Anthropologie stores are leased. The Company's
retail stores are typically leased for a term of ten years with renewal options
for an additional five to ten years. The following table shows the location of
the Company's existing retail stores. Net selling square feet can sometimes
change due to floor moves, use of staircases, cash register configuration, etc.
Total estimated net selling square feet under lease at January 31, 1999 by Urban
Retail was 304,000 and by Anthropologie was 115,000. The average store net
selling square feet is approximately 9,500 for Urban Retail and approximately
8,200 for Anthropologie. The new smaller format Urban Retail stores are expected
to average 6,000 net selling square feet. The Bloomington store contains 5,100
net selling square feet.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis
        of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

     The following discussion of the Company's historical results of operations
and of its liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with
the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements of the
Company and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

General

     The Company's fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this
discussion to fiscal years of the Company refer to the fiscal years ended on
January 31 in those years. For example, the Company's "Fiscal 1999" ended on
January 31, 1999. The comparable store net sales data presented in this
discussion are calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least
twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is
presented.

     The Company operates two business segments - a lifestyle-oriented general
merchandise retailing segment and a wholesale apparel business ("Wholesale").
The retailing segment operates through retail stores and through direct
response, including a catalog and a website. The two retail concepts are Urban
Outfitters ("Urban Retail") and Anthropologie. Urban Retail is the larger of the
two and generates most of the Company's revenues and profits. Urban Retail had
32 stores open at January 31, 1999 and 26 at January 31, 1998. The Company's
first Anthropologie store opened in October 1992. Anthropologie had 14 stores
open at January 31, 1999 and 9 at January 31, 1998. The Company has plans to
open six Urban Retail stores and five Anthropologie stores in Fiscal 2000. An
Anthropologie catalog was tested in the first half of Fiscal 1999 and, based
upon the success of the test, was launched during the second half of the year.
To support the catalog, a website was established in August 1998. In response to
customer requests, the site began accepting orders in December 1998. The direct
response operation incurred a loss for the year, and management expects the
catalog and the Company's "e-commerce" efforts to also incur a loss for Fiscal
2000.

     Fiscal 1999 and 1998 continued as profitable years for Urban Outfitters
with earnings to net sales of 7.6% and 8.0%, respectively, as well as return on
beginning shareholders' equity of 17.4% and 18.3%, respectively. The slight
contraction of earnings as a percent of sales in Fiscal 1999 and the reduction
in return on shareholders' equity in that year resulted primarily from the
start-up costs of the catalog effort and the 35% decrease in sales by Wholesale
to unrelated entities. The Wholesale company had recorded sales growth of 8% in
Fiscal 1998. The Wholesale company is anticipated to grow at a modest rate in
Fiscal 2000.

     The Company previously established a European subsidiary - Urban Outfitters
(U.K.) Ltd. - and opened its first Urban Retail store in London in June 1998. 
The success of the London store opening enabled the subsidiary to make a small
profit during Fiscal 1999.

Results of Operations

     The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage
of the Company's net sales represented by certain income statement data and the
growth of certain income statement data from period to period. The Company has
revised its manner of reporting gross profit to group certain buying,
distribution and occupancy costs with cost of goods sold in order to enhance the
comparability of its results with other specialty apparel retailers. Prior
period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's
presentation.

</TABLE>


Fiscal 1999 Compared to Fiscal 1998

     Net sales in Fiscal 1999 increased to $209.0 million from $173.1 million in
the prior fiscal year, a 20.7% increase. The $35.9 million increase was
attributable to a combination of comparable store net sales increases of $15.1
million, net sales increases of $25.6 million from stores opened during Fiscal
1998 and Fiscal 1999, and catalog and e-commerce revenues of $5.7 million,
offset in part by a decrease of $10.5 million from the Wholesale company.

                                       15
<PAGE>

     In Fiscal 1999, increases in the number of transactions in comparable
stores and an increase in average sales prices resulting from a lower proportion
of markdowns accounted for the comparable store sales dollar increase. Eleven
new stores were opened in Fiscal 1999 and three new stores were opened in Fiscal
1998. The Wholesale sales decrease reflected lower purchases by larger retail
chains, as well as customer issues regarding quality, delivery and fashion,
which have been addressed by management.

     Gross profit margins increased to 38.0% of sales in Fiscal 1999 from 35.0%
of sales in Fiscal 1998. This increase is attributable to higher initial
mark-ups and lower markdown percentages in the Urban Retail and Anthropologie
stores. Comparable store sales increases in existing stores offset the higher
occupancy costs of noncomparable and new stores. Reduced sales in the Wholesale
segment necessitated an increased proportion of merchandise to be sold in the
"off-price" sector, offsetting in part, the higher retail segment performance.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 26.0% of sales in
Fiscal 1999 from 22.3% of sales in Fiscal 1998 due to the costs incurred for the
start-up of the catalog and European operations as well as the substantial
negative leverage associated with the decline in Wholesale segment sales. The
increase in dollars in selling, general and administrative expenses is
attributable to the opening of additional stores as well as the catalog
start-up.


Fiscal 1998 Compared to Fiscal 1997

     Net sales in Fiscal 1998 increased to $173.1 million from $156.4 million in
the prior fiscal year, a 10.7% increase. The $16.7 million increase was
attributable to a combination of comparable store net sales decreases of $1.6
million, net sales increases of $16.1 million from stores opened or enlarged
during Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1998 and net sales increases of $2.2 million from
the Wholesale company.

     The decrease in comparable store sales of 1% or $1.6 million resulted
primarily from one merchandise division that did not perform to prior year
levels. Average selling prices were not a significant determinant of Fiscal 1998
sales levels. New and enlarged stores included seven stores opened in Fiscal
1997 and three opened in Fiscal 1998. The Company believes increased net sales
from the Wholesale subsidiary during Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1998 were
attributable to increased orders and order size due to the popularity of its
product lines.

     The Company's gross profit margin declined from 36.5% in Fiscal 1997 to
35.0% in Fiscal 1998 due to higher cost of goods sold and higher occupancy
costs. The primary contributor to the cost of goods sold increase was higher
markdowns in the retail segment. Markdowns were triggered by lower than planned
comparable store sales. Occupancy costs as a percentage of sales increased due
to the impact of new stores and the comparable store sales decline.

                                       16
<PAGE>

     Selling, general and administrative expenses grew to $38.5 million in
Fiscal 1998 from $35.7 million in the prior fiscal year, a 7.7% increase. As a
percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative costs decreased
from 22.8% of sales in Fiscal 1997 to 22.3% of sales in Fiscal 1998. The
increase in dollars is due to the opening of new stores during Fiscal 1997 and
Fiscal 1998. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of sales was
attributable to cost containment measures at store level.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

     During the last three years, the Company has satisfied its cash
requirements through cash flow from operations. The Company's primary uses of
cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. Most recently, the
Company invested in the Anthropologie direct response effort and in a new
European subsidiary. An investment has also been made in a direct response
company aimed at teen shoppers (see "HMB Publishing" below). In addition to cash
generated from operations, sources of cash have included the net proceeds from
the exercise of certain employee stock options in each of Fiscal 1999, 1998 and
1997. Over the next few years, the Company expects to incur capital expenditures
in support of its expansion program. Accumulated cash and future cash from
operations are expected to fund such expansion-related uses of cash, including
additional investments in the direct response operations.

     Although the Company has not borrowed short-term or long-term funds during
the last five fiscal years, it maintains a line of credit of $16.2 million, all
of which is available for cash borrowings or for the issuance of letters of
credit. The line is unsecured and any cash borrowings under the line would
accrue interest upon an as-offered basis not to exceed LIBOR plus 1/2 of 1
percent. The Company uses letters of credit primarily to purchase private label
and Wholesale merchandise from offshore suppliers. Outstanding balances of
letters of credit at January 31, 1999 and 1998 were $4.1 million and $4.7
million, respectively. There were no short-term or long-term borrowings
outstanding at January 31, 1999 or at January 31, 1998. The Company expects that
accumulated cash and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet the
Company's cash needs for at least the next three years.


Other Matters

Year 2000

     The Year 2000 problem concerns the inability of information and technology-
based operating systems to function properly after December 31, 1999. This could
result in system failures and miscalculations which may cause business
disruptions.

                                       17
<PAGE>

     The Company does not generally sell products that must be brought into Year
2000 compliance. However, the Company does rely upon many vendors and suppliers
for their products and services, as well as utilities, financial institutions
and governmental entities that provide critical services to the Company and to
its customers. The Company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer
systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the Year 2000 issue.
Based on the review, the Company's major information technology systems ("IT")
that would be adversely affected by Year 2000 dates will be upgraded or replaced
through the normal course of business prior to December 31, 1999. Internal
resources will be used in a timely manner to evaluate, modify and test the
Company's less critical systems that are not scheduled to be upgraded or
replaced through the normal course of business. The Company's core merchandising
and financial system upgrade and the store register system upgrades have been
completed; testing of these upgrades is substantially completed. In addition,
the Company is in the process of completing the inventory and assessment of its
non-information technology systems ("non-IT"), including those with embedded
processor chips -- heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, elevators,
etc.

     The Company has also reviewed and continues to monitor the implemented
changes or planned changes of its major suppliers that management believes could
be affected by Year 2000 dates. The Company is evaluating key vendor
preparedness by conducting interviews, obtaining compliance representation
letters and, if deemed necessary, conducting comprehensive tests.

     The Company expects to complete its Year 2000 compliance evaluation program
by June 30, 1999. At this time, management continues to believe that the
incremental costs associated with major system upgrades and/or replacements, as
well as internal efforts to evaluate, modify and test the Company's other
systems to ensure Year 2000 compliance, will not be material to the Company.
There can be no guarantee, however, that the Company's efforts will prevent Year
2000 issues from having a material adverse impact on its results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows. The possible consequences to the Company if
its vendors and suppliers are not fully Year 2000 compliant (including the
global banking systems, communications and other public utilities and the
transportation industry) include temporary store closings and delays in the
receipt of key merchandise. Accordingly, the Company is in the process of
developing contingency plans to mitigate the potential disruptions that may
result from the Year 2000 issue. Such plans may include earlier receipt of key
merchandise, preparing alternative merchandise delivery methodologies and
securing alternative suppliers. It is anticipated that these contingency plans
to manage identified IT and non-IT areas of high risk will be completed by June
30, 1999. There can be no guarantee, however, that any contingency plans
developed by the Company will prevent such material adverse effects.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133") which is required to be adopted in
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No.
133 effective February 1, 2000. The Company currently enters into short-term
foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures related to its
Canadian dollar denominated investments and anticipated cash flow. The amounts
of the contracts and related gains and losses have not been material. The
adoption of SFAS No. 133 is not expected to have a significant effect on the
financial position or results of operations of the Company.

Market Risks

     The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks -
fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and
services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and
changes in interest rates. Due to the Company's inventory turn and its
historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its
cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other
product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases
substantially all its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the
goods for its stores located in Canada and the United Kingdom. As explained in
the section above on "Recent Accounting Pronouncements," the market risk is
further limited by the Company's purchase of foreign currency forward exchange
contracts.

     Since the Company has not been a borrower, its exposure to interest rate
fluctuations is limited to the impact on its marketable securities portfolio.
This exposure is minimized by the limited investment maturities and "put"
options available to the Company as explained in the notes to the financial
statements appearing elsewhere in this report. The impact of a hypothetical two
percent increase or decrease in prevailing interest rates would not materially
affect the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

HMB Publishing, Inc.

     On February 5, 1998 the Company entered into an agreement with HMB
Publishing, Inc. ("HMB") for the purchase of securities convertible into a
minority interest in the company through Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
("Series B Preferred") and certain convertible debentures. The agreement called
for additional investments and ownership if HMB met certain performance
milestones. HMB is a development stage company that publishes mXg(TM), a
combination magazine and catalog and operates a website - www.mXgonline.com -
that caters to teenage girls. The original business plan contemplated
substantial losses in the first two fiscal years.

                                       19
<PAGE>

     As of January 31, 1999, the Company has invested approximately $2.0 million
in the Series B Preferred and an additional $1.75 million in the convertible
debentures. Since January 31, 1999, the Company has advanced an additional $1.1
million to fund further marketing efforts and additional development of the
website and, together with additional investors, will seek to position HMB for
more rapid expansion. The Company expects to realize a return on its investment,
and it is the Company's intent to maintain an equity interest following any
public offering by HMB.

Subsequent Event 

     In accordance with its previously announced stock buyback program, that
authorized the Company to repurchase up to 800,000 of its shares, the Company
has repurchased 279,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of $3.7 million
during the period from February 1, 1999 through March 12, 1999 in a series of
individual open market transactions.

Forward-Looking Statements

     Pursuant to the "Safe Harbor" provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, this report contains forward-looking statements
which may be identified by their use of words such as "plans," "expects,"
"will," "anticipates," "intends," "projects," "estimates" or other words of
similar meaning. Any one or all of the following factors could cause actual
financial results to differ materially from those financial results mentioned in
the forward-looking statements: industry competition factors, unavailability of
suitable retail space for expansion, difficulty in predicting and responding to
fashion trend shifts, seasonal fluctuations in gross sales, the level of returns
experienced by the business segments, the levels of margins achievable in the
marketplace, the departure of one or more key senior managers, the failure of
the Company or third parties to become Year 2000 capable and other risks
identified in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company
disclaims any intent or obligation to update forward-looking statements and
cannot guarantee that the assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be
realized.

Seasonality and Quarterly Results

     While Urban Outfitters has been profitable in each of its last 36 operating
quarters, its operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. The
Company's highest sales levels have historically occurred during the five-month
period from August 1 to December 31 of each year (the "Back-to-School" and
Holiday periods). Sales generated during these periods have traditionally had a
significant impact on the Company's results of operations. Any decreases in
sales for these periods or in the availability of working capital needed in the
months preceding these periods could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations. The Company's results of operations in any one
fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that
can be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year.

     The Company's results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to
quarter as a result of the amount and timing of expenses incurred in connection
with, and sales contributed by, new stores, store expansions and the integration
of new stores into the operations of the Company or by the size and timing of
mailings of the Company's Anthropologie catalog. Fluctuations in the bookings
and shipments of Wholesale products between quarters can also have positive or
negative effects on earnings during the quarters.

                                       21
<PAGE>

     The following tables, which are unaudited, set forth the Company's net
sales, gross profit, net income and income per share for each quarter during the
last three fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income,
respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The
Company has revised its manner of reporting gross profit to group certain
buying, distribution and occupancy costs with cost of goods sold in order to
enhance comparability of its results with other specialty apparel retailers.
Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's
presentation.

                        Report of Independent Accountants



To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Urban Outfitters, Inc.


In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed under Item 14(a)(1)
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Urban
Outfitters, Inc. and its subsidiaries at January 31, 1999 and 1998, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended January 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedules listed under Item 14(a)(2) present fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial
statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

Urban Outfitters, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(dollars in thousands, except per share data)


1. Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Urban
Outfitters, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The principal business
activity of the Company is the operation of a general consumer product retail
business through retail stores, a catalog and a website. In addition, the
Company engages in the wholesale distribution of apparel to over 1,300 better
specialty stores worldwide.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and highly liquid investments
with original maturities of less than three months. They are carried at
amortized cost, which approximates fair value because of the short maturity of
these instruments.

Marketable Securities

     The Company's debt and equity securities are classified as either
held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities represent
those securities that the Company has both the positive intent and ability to
hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Interest on these securities
as well as amortization is included in interest income. Available-for-sale
securities represent those securities that do not meet the classification of
held-to-maturity, are not actively traded and are carried at fair value.
Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are excluded from earnings and
should be reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity, net of
applicable taxes, until realized. Gross unrealized gains and losses, net of the
related deferred taxes, have not been material. When available-for-sale
securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identified and
is used to determine the realized gain or loss. These amounts have not been
material.

Concentration of Credit Risk

     Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents and
investments. The Company manages the credit risk associated with cash
equivalents and investments by investing with high-quality institutions and, by
policy, limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one institution.

Inventories

     Inventories, which consist of general consumer merchandise held for sale,
are valued at the lower of cost or market. The cost is determined on the
first-in, first-out method.

Depreciation and Amortization

     Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are computed using the straight-line method over five years for furniture and
fixtures, "life of lease" for leasehold improvements and three to ten years for
other operating equipment.

     The Company reviews long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. This determination includes evaluation of factors such as current
market value, future asset utilization and future net undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use of the assets.

Income Taxes

     The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.

Net Income Per Share

     Basic earnings per share are based upon the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are based upon the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the potential dilution
that could occur if stock options were exercised.

Accounting Estimates

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and
disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period.
Differences from those estimates, if any, are recorded in the period they become
known.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

     In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" ("SFAS No. 123"). SFAS No. 123 defines a fair value-based method
of accounting for employee stock options or other similar equity instruments.
Companies must either adopt the new method or disclose the pro forma income
statement effects in their financial statements. The Company has chosen to
disclose the pro forma income statement effects of SFAS No. 123 only.

Advertising

     The Company expenses the costs of advertising when the advertising occurs,
except for direct response advertising, which is capitalized and amortized over
its expected period of future benefit. Advertising costs reported as prepaid
expenses are not material. Advertising expense was $4,486 for the fiscal year
ended January 31, 1999. Advertising expenses incurred for the fiscal years ended
January 31, 1998 and January 31, 1997 were immaterial.

Foreign Currency Translation

     The financial statements of the Company's foreign operations are translated
into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange
rates while income and expense accounts are translated at the average rates in
effect during the year. Translation adjustments are not included in determining
net income, but are included in accumulated other comprehensive income within
shareholders' equity.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133") which is required to be adopted in
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No.
133 effective February 1, 2000. The Company currently enters into short-term
foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures related to its
Canadian dollar denominated investments and anticipated cash flow. The amounts
of these contracts and related gains and losses have not been material. The
adoption of SFAS No. 133 is not expected to have a significant effect on the
financial position or results of operations of the Company.

Reclassifications

     Certain reclassifications of prior years' data have been made to conform to
the Fiscal 1999 presentation.

     The noncurrent portion of investments held-to-maturity has contractual
maturities of one to four years. The investments available-for-sale have a
contractual maturity of greater than five years. Actual maturities may differ
from contractual maturities as a result of put and call options that enable
either the Company and/or the issuer to redeem particular securities at an
earlier date. The fair value of the securities is determined based upon market
prices.

6. Line of Credit

     The Company has available a $16,200 revolving line of credit to facilitate
letter of credit transactions and cash advances. Interest on outstanding
balances is payable monthly based on an "as offered" rate not to exceed the
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1/2%. No principal amounts were
outstanding under this line at January 31, 1999 and 1998. Outstanding letters of
credit totaled $4,096 and $4,706 as of January 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
These letters of credit, which have terms from one month to one year,
collateralize the Company's obligation to third parties for the purchase of
inventory. The fair value of these letters of credit is estimated to be the same
as the contract values.


7. Segment Reporting

     In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and related Information" ("SFAS No. 131"). The adoption of SFAS No.
131 has no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial
position or cash flows. Its effect is limited to the disclosures contained in
the financial statements.

     Urban Outfitters is a national retailer of lifestyle-oriented general
merchandise through 46 stores operating under the retail names "Urban
Outfitters" and "Anthropologie," and through a catalog and website. Sales from
this retail segment account for over 90% of total consolidated sales for the
fiscal year ended January 31, 1999. The remainder is derived from a wholesale
division that manufactures and distributes apparel to the retail segment and to
over 1,300 better specialty stores worldwide.

     The Company has aggregated its operations into these two reportable
segments based upon their unique management, customer base and economic
characteristics. Reporting in this format provides management with the financial
information necessary to evaluate the success of the segments and the overall
business. The Company evaluates the performance of the segments based on the net
sales and pre-tax income from operations (excluding intercompany royalty and
interest charges) of the segment. Corporate expenses include expenses incurred
in and directed by the corporate office that are not allocated to segments. The
principal identifiable assets for each operating segment are inventory and fixed
assets. Other assets are comprised primarily of general corporate assets, which
principally consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and
other assets. Intersegment sales were immaterial in each of the last three
fiscal years. The Company accounts for intersegment sales and transfers as if
the sales and transfers were made to third parties making similar volume
purchases.

     Both the retail and wholesale segment are highly diversified. No customer
comprises more than 10% of sales. Foreign operations are immaterial relative to
the overall Company.

         The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the
policies described above in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies". A summary
of the information about the Company's operations by segment is as follows:

     At January 31, 1999, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards for
tax purposes of approximately $750 in the United Kingdom that do not expire. At
January 31, 1999 and 1998, a deferred tax asset of $2,900 and $2,334,
respectively, is included in Other assets.

     The cumulative amount of the Company's share of undistributed earnings of
non-U.S. subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been provided was $804 as
of January 31, 1999. These earnings are deemed to be permanently reinvested to
finance growth programs.

     Certain store leases provide for predetermined escalations in future
minimum annual rentals. The pro rata portion of future minimum rent escalations,
amounting to $3,856 and $3,095, at January 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, has
been included in Other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. Subsequent to year end, the Company entered into leases for additional
locations. Commitments related to these leases are included in the above.

     The store leases provide for payment of direct operating costs including
real estate taxes. Certain store leases provide for contingent rentals when
sales exceed specified levels.

     Rent expense consisted of the following:

11. Contingencies

     The Company is party to various legal proceedings arising from normal
business activities. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not have an adverse material effect on the Company's financial
condition or results of operations.


12. Stock Option Plans

     The 1997 Stock Option Plan authorizes up to an aggregate of 1,250,000
common shares which can be granted as either incentive stock options or
nonqualified stock options. The vesting period for this Plan can range from one
to ten years. This 1997 Plan replaced the previous 1987, 1992 and 1993 Plans
which were precluded from making additional grants due either to expiration or
insufficiently available shares. Individual grants outstanding under certain of
the superseded plans, however, have expiration dates which extend into the year
2008.

     The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" ("SFAS No. 123"). Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
recognized for the stock option plans. Had compensation cost for the Company's
four stock option plans been determined based on the fair value provisions of
SFAS No. 123 at the grant date for awards during Fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, the
Company's net earnings and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro
forma amounts indicated below:

     Options to purchase 40,000 shares at $20.88 per share and 10,000 at $17.69
per share were outstanding during Fiscal 1999, but were not included in the
computation of diluted EPS because the options' exercise price was greater than
the average market price of the common shares.

     Options to purchase 40,000 shares at $20.88 per share, 10,000 shares at
$17.69 per share, 35,000 shares at $16.88 per share and 69,500 shares at $15.19
per share were outstanding during Fiscal 1998, but were not included in the
computation of diluted EPS because the options' exercise price was greater than
the average market price of the common shares.


14. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

     In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income" ("SFAS
No. 130") that the Company adopted in the first quarter of Fiscal 1999. SFAS No.
130 requires presentation of comprehensive income and its components in the
financial statements. Comprehensive income includes charges and credits to
equity that are not the result of transactions with shareholders. Comprehensive
income is comprised of two subsets - net income and other comprehensive income.
All amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) relate to foreign
currency translation adjustments. The foreign currency translation adjustments
are not adjusted for income taxes since these adjustments related to indefinite
investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries.

16. Stock Split

the form of a stock dividend for shareholders of record on June 1, 1996.


17. Investment in HMB Publishing, Inc.

     On February 5, 1998 the Company entered into an agreement with HMB
Publishing, Inc. ("HMB") for the purchase of securities convertible into a
minority interest in the company through Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
("Series B Preferred") and certain convertible debentures. The agreement called
for additional investments and ownership if HMB met certain performance
milestones. HMB is a development stage company that publishes mXg(TM), a
combination magazine and catalog and operates a website - www.mXgonline.com -
that caters to teenage girls. The original business plan contemplated
substantial losses in the first two fiscal years and a public offering as soon
as feasible.

     As of January 31, 1999, the Company has invested approximately $2,000 in
the Series B Preferred and an additional $1,750 in the convertible debentures.
Since January 31, 1999, the Company has advanced an additional $1,100 to fund
further marketing efforts and additional development of the website and,
together with additional investors, will seek to position HMB for more rapid
expansion. It is the Company's intent to maintain an equity interest following
any public offering by HMB.
