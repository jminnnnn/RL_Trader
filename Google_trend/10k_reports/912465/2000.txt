                                    PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

  Quaker City Bancorp, Inc., incorporated in Delaware, is primarily engaged in
the savings and loan business through its wholly owned subsidiary Quaker City
Bank (the "Bank"). The Company was organized on September 13, 1993, for the
purpose of acquiring all of the capital stock of the Bank issued in the
conversion of the Bank from mutual to stock form effective December 30, 1993.
The Bank was originally founded in 1920 as the Mutual Building and Loan
Association of Whittier, and in 1938 became a federally chartered mutual
savings and loan association. The Company's principal business is serving as
the holding company for the Bank. The executive offices of the Company are
located at 7021 Greenleaf Avenue, Whittier, California 90602, telephone number
(562) 907-2200.

  The Bank currently operates fifteen retail full service branches in the
southern California communities of Whittier (2), La Habra (2), Brea,
Fullerton, La Mirada, Hacienda Heights, Anaheim Hills, Rowland Heights,
Lakewood, Los Angeles, Corona, Foothill Ranch and Placentia. Four of these
branches were opened in calendar year 2000 inside Wal-Mart stores. The Bank
also has plans to open at least two additional Wal-Mart "in-store" branches in
southern California during fiscal 2001.

  The Company is a savings and loan holding company and as such is subject to
examination and regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS"). The
deposits of the Bank are insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund
("SAIF") of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"). The Bank
is regulated by the Director of the OTS and the FDIC. The Bank is a member of
the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of San Francisco, which is one of the 12
regional banks comprising the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is also
subject to certain regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board") with respect to

                                       1
<PAGE>

reserves required to be maintained against deposits and certain other matters.
See "--Regulation and Supervision--General."

  The Bank's principal business has been and continues to be attracting retail
deposits from the general public in its primary deposit market area
surrounding its offices and investing those deposits, together with funds
generated from operations and borrowings. Through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Quaker City Financial Corporation ("QCFC"), the Company also engages in the
sale of insurance and investment products on an agency basis. See "--
Subsidiary Activities." The Company originates predominantly multifamily,
commercial real estate and one-to-four family loans and emphasizes multifamily
lending in low and moderate income communities, primarily in southern
California metropolitan areas. To a lesser extent, loans are also originated
and purchased in Central and Northern California. Under certain circumstances,
one-to-four family loans are purchased on loans secured by properties outside
the state of California.

  Historically, the Company's principal business was the making of one-to-four
family and multifamily (five or more units) loans. In every year for which
data is presented in this report, i.e., 1996 through 2000, the Company's
multifamily loan portfolio has increased in total dollar amount and has
represented a significant portion of the Company's total loan portfolio. See
"--Lending Activities--Loan and MBS Portfolio Composition." Beginning
principally with the hiring announced in January 1998 of the income property
lending staff of another southern California financial institution, the
Company has increased its focus on commercial real estate lending. The Company
currently intends to continue its emphasis on multifamily and commercial real
estate lending, with their higher risk-adjusted rates of return, rather than
on lower yielding one-to-four family lending. At June 30, 2000, the Company's
gross loan portfolio (including loans held for sale) totaled $1.0 billion,
68.33% of which was secured by multifamily properties (approximately $505.4
million) and commercial real estate (approximately $196.5 million).

  Both the multifamily and the commercial real estate loan portfolios have
grown at a significant rate during fiscal 2000. From June 30, 1999 to June 30,
2000 the net increase in the Company's multifamily portfolio was $113.8
million representing a 29.07% increase in the size of the portfolio. From June
30, 1999 to June 30, 2000, the net increase in the Company's commercial real
estate loan portfolio was $56.1 million, representing a 39.92% increase in the
size of the portfolio. At June 30, 2000, however, the $505.4 million
multifamily portfolio represented 49.20% of the Company's gross loans and the
$196.5 million commercial real estate portfolio represented 19.13% of the
Company's gross loans. As a percentage of gross loans, the multifamily
portfolio increased in size by 3.27% and the commercial real estate portfolio
increased in size by 2.65% from June 30, 1999 to June 30, 2000. See "--Lending
Activities--Multifamily Lending--Commercial Real Estate Lending."

  In addition to originating loans to hold in portfolio, the Company also
originates loans for sale. The Company sold $48.9 million of loans in fiscal
2000. The Company also purchases loans for investment and for sale. During
fiscal 2000, the Company purchased $85.8 million in loans of which, $45.6
million were one-to-four family. Loans sold come from loans held in the
Company's portfolio designated as being held for sale or originated during the
most recent period and designated as held for sale. Historically, the Company
has generally retained the servicing rights on most loans sold, however, some
loans are sold servicing released. In addition, the Company invests in
securities issued by the U.S. Government and agencies thereof, mortgage-backed
securities ("MBS") and other permitted investments under applicable federal
laws and regulations. The Company's revenues are derived principally from
interest on its mortgage loans, and to a lesser extent, mortgage loan
servicing activities, and interest and dividends on its investment securities
and MBS.

  The Company's primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings from the
FHLB of San Francisco ("FHLB advances"), securities sold under agreements to
repurchase, principal and interest payments on loans and MBS and proceeds from
the sale of loans. At June 30, 2000, the

                                       2
<PAGE>

Company had deposits of approximately $808.2 million, including approximately
$183.6 million in certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more. The Company's
borrowings at June 30, 2000 included $290.3 million in FHLB advances. See "--
Sources of Funds."

  For the year ended June 30, 2000, the Company reported net earnings of $11.8
million, $2.23 per share diluted. This compares to net earnings of $9.6
million, $1.70 per share diluted, and $6.6 million, $1.14 per share diluted,
for the years ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increase in
fiscal 2000 earnings over fiscal 1999 was primarily due to an increase in net
interest income partially offset by an increase in other expenses. The
increase in fiscal 1999 earnings over fiscal 1998 was also primarily due to an
increase in net interest income partially offset by an increase in other
expenses.

  Total assets of the Company were $1.2 billion at June 30, 2000, an increase
of $188.5 million compared to June 30, 1999. The increase in assets was
primarily in loans, with commercial real estate loans increasing $56.1
million, multifamily loans increasing $113.8 million and one-to-four family
loans increasing $3.3 million. The asset growth was funded primarily by an
increase in deposits of $130.4 million and $55.6 million of FHLB advances.
Included in the increase of $130.4 million of deposits during fiscal 2000 is
$45.9 million of retail deposits purchased from another financial institution
and its branch office located in Rowland Heights, California. In addition,
while the vast majority of the Bank's deposits are retail in nature, the Bank
accepted $55 million in time deposits from a political subdivision during
fiscal 2000. The Bank considers these funds to be wholesale deposits and an
alternative borrowing source rather than a customer relationship and their
levels are determined by management's decision as to the most economic funding
source. At June 30, 2000, the Company had total deposits of $808.2 million and
total FHLB advances of $290.3 million.

  The southern California economy and real estate market in the Company's
primary lending area have continued to be strong. The Company's level of
nonperforming assets declined from June 30, 1999. The Company includes
nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructured loans and real estate acquired
through foreclosure ("REO") in determining its level of nonperforming assets.
At June 30, 2000, the Company reported $4.4 million in nonperforming assets
compared to $7.5 million and $9.8 million at June 30, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The Company recorded provisions for loan losses of $1.6 million
for the year ended June 30, 2000 compared to $1.7 million and $1.5 million for
the years ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. See "--Allowances for
Loan and Real Estate Losses" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis
("MD&A")--Results of Operations."

Lending Activities

  Loan and MBS Portfolio Composition. Historically, the Company's principal
business was the making of one-to-four family and multifamily loans. In every
year for which data is presented in this report, i.e., 1996 through 2000, the
Company's multifamily loan portfolio has increased in total dollar amount and
has represented a significant portion of the Company's total loan portfolio.
Beginning principally with the hiring announced in January 1998 of the income
property lending staff of another southern California financial institution,
the Company has increased its focus on commercial real estate lending. The
Company currently intends to continue its emphasis on multifamily and
commercial real estate lending, with their higher risk-adjusted rates of
return, rather than on lower yielding one-to-four family lending. At June 30,
2000, the Company had $1.0 billion of gross loans outstanding, 68.33% of which
was secured by either multifamily properties or commercial real estate. Gross
loans outstanding at June 30, 2000 included $505.4 million of multifamily
loans, representing 49.20% of gross loans, $196.5 million of commercial real
estate loans, representing 19.13% of gross loans, and $315.7 million of one-
to-four family loans, representing 30.73% of gross loans. The remainder of
gross loans at June 30, 2000 consisted of $1.5 million of land loans, or 0.14%
of gross loans, and other loans of $8.2 million, or 0.80% of gross loans.
Included in these amounts at June 30, 2000 were $21.2 million of loans held
for sale, comprising 2.06% of gross loans.

                                       3

  The net increase in the Company's multifamily loans during fiscal 2000 was
$113.8 million, representing an increase of 29.07% in the multifamily loan
portfolio as compared to June 30, 1999. The net increase in the Company's
commercial real estate loans during fiscal 2000 was $56.1 million,
representing an increase of 39.92% in the commercial real estate loan
portfolio as compared to June 30, 1999. The net increase in the Company's one-
to-four family loans during fiscal 2000 was $3.3 million, representing an
increase of 1.05% in the one-to-four family loan portfolio as compared to
June 30, 1999. As a percentage of gross loans, multifamily loans increased by
3.27%, commercial loans increased by 2.65% and one-to-four family loans
decreased by 5.92% from June 30, 1999 to June 30, 2000. These percentage
changes in the composition of the gross mortgage loan portfolio are a result
of the relative growth of the multifamily and commercial real estate loan
portfolios and the Company's sale of approximately 40% of the one-to-four
family loans it originated during the 2000 fiscal year. The Company currently
intends to continue to focus on multifamily and commercial real estate
lending. During fiscal 2000, the Company purchased $85.8 million in loans of
which, $46.0 million were one-to-four family. The Company anticipates that the
purchase of one-to-four family loans will remain a focus of the Company in
fiscal 2001.

  The Company invests in MBS, including securities guaranteed by the
Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA"), Federal National Mortgage
Association ("FNMA") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC"). To
a limited extent the Company also invests in privately issued MBS which
typically have received a "AA" or "AAA" credit rating from at least one
nationally recognized rating service. The Company invests in both adjustable-
rate and fixed-rate MBS. In an effort to reduce the potential interest rate
risk inherent in fixed-rate assets, the Company purchases fixed-rate MBS with
a variety of coupon rates, maturities, and prices. Furthermore, the assets are
typically purchased with fixed-rate FHLB advances of various terms to maturity
primarily ranging from one month to five years in order to mitigate the
Company's exposure to changes in interest rates. The adjustable-rate MBS in
the Company's portfolio typically have life caps that will prevent the MBS
from further upward adjustments in rate should interest rates rise above the
cap limit. Prior to purchase, management considers the Company's overall
tolerance to interest rate risk and invests accordingly. At June 30, 2000, the
Company's MBS portfolio (including MBS available for sale) totaled
$109.9 million or 9.15% of total assets. The Company's MBS are comprised of
$81.8 million of agency securities, $1.5 million issued by other financial
institutions and $26.5 million in collateralized mortgage obligations
("CMO's"). Of the $26.5 million in CMO's 65.91% or $17.4 million are agency
guaranteed. For all years presented, the CMO's represent non-equity senior
interests in mortgage pass-through certificates and were of investment grade.
At June 30, 2000, $24.4 million in MBS were classified as available for sale.

(1) ARM loans include loans that adjust monthly, semiannually, annually or
    once every five years. Five year ARM loans total $2.0 million one-to-four
    family, $43.7 million multifamily and $79.3 million commercial real
    estate.

  Origination, Purchase, Sale and Servicing of Loans. The Company's mortgage
lending activities are conducted primarily through its executive and branch
offices. The Company originates both fixed- rate and ARM loans. Its ability to
originate ARM loans as opposed to fixed-rate loans is dependent upon the
relative customer demand, which is affected by the current and expected future
level of interest rates.

  Additionally, the Company purchases or participates in loans originated by
other institutions. The determination to purchase loans is based upon the
Company's investment needs and market

                                       6

opportunities. Subject to regulatory restrictions applicable to savings
associations, the Company's current loan policies allow all loan types to be
purchased. The determination to purchase specific loans or pools of loans is
subject to the Company's underwriting policies, which require consideration of
the financial condition of the borrower and the appraised value of the
property and, with respect to multifamily and commercial real estate loans,
the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and
depreciation and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating
income to debt service), among other factors. The Company has purchased loans
from independent parties in various transactions. During the year ended
June 30, 2000, of the $352.2 million of loans generated by the Company in
fiscal 2000 through origination or purchase, $85.8 million, or 24.35%, were
purchased. Of the $85.8 million of loans purchased during fiscal 2000, $28.1
million were multifamily loans, $11.7 million were commercial real estate
loans and $46.0 million were one-to-four family loans.

  At origination or time of purchase, the Company designates loans as held for
investment or held for sale. Historically, loans held for sale have been sold
in the secondary market to FNMA, FHLMC and other investors. The Company
generally retains the servicing rights on most loans sold, however, certain
loans are sold servicing released. The determination to sell a specific loan
or pool of loans is made based upon the Company's investment needs, growth
objectives and market opportunities.

  In an attempt to further minimize interest rate risk associated with fixed-
rate loans designated as held for sale, the Company may enter into commitments
with FNMA and other investors (known as forward commitments) to sell loans at
a future date at a specified price. The Company will then simultaneously
process and close the loans, thereby attempting to protect the price of loans
in process from interest rate fluctuations that may occur from application to
sale. There is risk involved in this forward commitment activity. In a
declining interest rate environment, borrowers may choose not to close loans,
but the Company would remain obligated to fulfill its forward commitments. The
inability of the Company to originate or acquire loans to fulfill these
commitments may result in the Company being required to pay non-delivery fees.
In an increasing interest rate environment, the Company is subject to interest
rate risk in the event its commitments to make loans to borrowers exceeds its
commitments to sell loans. At June 30, 2000, the Company had no forward
commitments with respect to fixed rate loans held for sale. The Company does
not intend to enter into forward commitments on ARM loans.

  The Company sells loans and participations in loans with yield rates to the
investors based upon current market rates. Gain or loss is recognized to the
extent that the selling prices differ from the carrying value of the loans
sold based on the estimated relative fair values of the assets sold and any
retained interests, less any liabilities incurred. The assets obtained on sale
are generally loan servicing assets. Liabilities incurred in a sale may
include recourse obligations or servicing liabilities. At June 30, 2000, the
Company had originated mortgage servicing assets with a book value of $72,000.

  In addition to retaining the servicing assets for originated loans, the
Company may also purchase mortgage servicing assets related to mortgage loans
originated by other institutions. The Company's current loan policies provide
that the aggregate amount of purchased mortgage servicing shall not exceed 75%
of the total loans in the Company's portfolio that are serviced for others. At
June 30, 2000, the Company had purchased mortgage servicing assets with a book
value of $197,000.

  Multifamily Lending. During the year ended June 30, 2000, the Company
originated $167.2 million of multifamily loans. The Company originates
multifamily mortgage loans generally secured by apartment buildings located in
southern California metropolitan areas. To a lesser extent multifamily loans
are also originated and purchased in Central and Northern California. In
originating a multifamily loan, the Company considers the qualifications of
the borrower as well as the securing property. Some of the foremost factors to
be considered are the net operating income of the mortgaged property before
debt service and depreciation, the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of
net operating income to debt service) and the ratio of the loan amount to the
appraised value of the property. Pursuant to the Company's underwriting
policies, a multifamily loan generally may only be made in an amount up to 80%
of the appraised value of the underlying property. The Company also generally
requires a debt service coverage ratio of at least 110%. Properties securing a
loan are appraised by an independent appraiser and title insurance is required
on all loans. The average outstanding loan balance on multifamily loans at
June 30, 2000 was approximately $383,000, with the largest loan being
$4.8 million. The property collateralizing this loan is located in Chula
Vista, California and the loan was not classified at June 30, 2000. Declines
in the real estate values in the Company's primary lending area may result in
increases in the loan-to-value ratio on some multifamily mortgage loans
subsequent to origination.

                                       8
<PAGE>

  When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower for a multifamily loan,
the Company considers the financial resources and income level of the
borrower, the borrower's experience in owning or managing similar property,
and the Company's lending experience with the borrower. The Company's
underwriting policies require that the borrower be able to demonstrate strong
management skills and the ability to maintain the property with current rental
income. The borrower should also present evidence of the ability to repay the
mortgage and a history of making mortgage payments on a timely basis. In
assessing the creditworthiness of the borrower, the Company generally reviews
the financial statements, employment and credit history of the borrower, as
well as other related documentation.

  At June 30, 2000, the Company's multifamily loan portfolio had increased to
$505.4 million, or 49.20% of gross loans, from $391.6 million, or 45.93% of
gross loans, at June 30, 1999, an increase of $113.8 million. The multifamily
loan portfolio increased in total dollar amount during fiscal 2000 by 29.06%,
and as a percentage of gross loans by 3.27%. Of the $505.4 million multifamily
loans outstanding at June 30, 2000, 4.49% were fixed-rate loans and 95.51%
were ARM loans. Of the 95.51% of ARM loans, 9.06% or $43.7 million are tied to
a treasury bill based index that adjusts once every five years.

  Multifamily loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of
credit risk and to be more vulnerable to adverse conditions in the real estate
market and to deteriorating economic conditions, particularly changes in
interest rates than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. These loans
typically involve higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of such
loans generally depend on the income produced by the operation or sale of the
property being sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service.
Sometimes multifamily loans are made to groups of related borrowers, which
concentration could increase the Company's exposure should the circumstances
of one borrower negatively affect the ability of other related borrowers to
repay their loans in full on a timely basis. Recessionary economic conditions
tend to result in higher vacancy and reduced rental rates and net operating
incomes from multifamily residential properties. Of the Company's $139,000 of
charge-offs in fiscal 2000, none, were for multifamily loans. See "--
Allowances for Loan and Real Estate Losses."

  Commercial Real Estate Lending. During fiscal 2000, the Company originated
$72.8 million of commercial real estate loans. The Company originates
commercial real estate loans that are generally secured by properties used for
business purposes such as small office buildings, multi-tenant industrial
properties or a combination of residential and retail facilities located
primarily in southern California. To a lesser extent, commercial real estate
loans are also originated and purchased in Central and Northern California.
The Company's underwriting procedures provide that commercial real estate
loans generally may be made in amounts up to 75% of the appraised value of the
property. These loans may be made with terms up to 30 years for ARM loans. The
Company's underwriting standards and procedures are similar to those
applicable to its multifamily loans, wherein the Company considers the net
operating income of the property and the borrower's expertise, credit history
and profitability. The Company has generally required that the properties
securing commercial real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios of at
least 110%. The average outstanding loan balance on commercial real estate
loans at June 30, 2000 was approximately $695,000. The largest commercial real
estate loan in the Company's portfolio, located in Huntington Beach,
California had an outstanding principal balance at June 30, 2000 of $3.4
million and the loan was not classified.

  At June 30, 2000, the Company's commercial real estate loan portfolio had
increased to $196.5 million, or 19.13% of gross loans, from $140.4 million, or
16.48% of gross loans, at June 30, 1999, an increase of $56.1 million, or
2.65% of gross loans. This $56.1 million increase in the commercial real
estate loan portfolio during fiscal 2000 represents a 39.92% increase in the
total dollar amount of the commercial real estate portfolio. Of the $196.5
million commercial real estate loans outstanding at June 30, 2000, 19.30% were
fixed-rate loans and 80.70% were ARM loans. Of the 80.70% of ARM loans, 50.03%
or $79.3 million are tied to a treasury bill bond index that adjusts once
every five years.

  Commercial real estate loans are generally considered to involve a higher
degree of credit risk and to be more vulnerable to adverse conditions in the
real estate market and to deteriorating economic conditions, particularly
changes in interest rates than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.
These loans typically involve higher loan principal amounts and the repayment
of such loans generally depend on the income produced by the operation or sale
of the property being sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service.
Sometimes commercial real estate loans are made to groups of related
borrowers, which concentration could increase the Company's exposure should
the circumstances of one borrower negatively affect the ability of other
related borrowers to repay their loans in full on a timely basis. Recessionary
economic conditions tend to result in higher vacancy and reduced rental rates
and net operating incomes from commercial properties. In addition, commercial
real estate values tend to be cyclical. Of the Company's $139,000 of charge-
offs in fiscal 2000, none were for commercial real estate loans. The Company
has significantly increased its commercial real estate loan portfolio during
the past two fiscal years. Both because the size of the commercial real estate
loan portfolio has increased significantly and most of the loans comprising
the portfolio are unseasoned, having been originated within the last two
fiscal years, the Company's past loss experience with respect to its
commercial real estate loan portfolio may not be representative of the risk of
loss in such portfolio in the future. See "--Allowances for Loan and Real
Estate Losses."

  One-to-Four Family Lending. The Company originates both fixed-rate mortgage
loans and ARM loans secured by one-to-four family residences, including, to a
lesser extent, condominium and cooperative units with maturities up to 30
years. Originated loans are predominantly secured by property located in
southern California. Loan originations are generally obtained from existing or
past customers, members of the local communities and loan brokers. One-to-four
family loans are purchased with properties securing the loans located
throughout the state of California and in certain circumstances outside of
California. Included in one-to-four family loans are outstanding balances of
$19.3 million of adjustable rate home equity credit lines tied to the Wall
Street Prime index. These loans are generally secured by a first or second
trust deed, with maturities up to 25 years.

  During the year ended June 30, 2000, the Company originated $25.8 million of
one-to-four family loans. The Company's policy is to originate one-to-four
family loans in amounts generally up to 80% of the lower of the appraised
value or the selling price of the property securing the loan and up to 95% of
the appraised value or selling price if private mortgage insurance is
obtained. Declines in the real estate values in the Company's lending areas
may result in increases in the loan-to-value ratio on some one-to-four family
loans subsequent to origination.

  At June 30, 2000, the Company's one-to-four family loan portfolio had
increased to $315.7 million, or 30.73% of gross loans, from $312.4 million, or
36.65% of gross loans, at June 30, 1999, an increase of $3.3 million. Although
the one-to-four family loan portfolio increased in total dollar amount during
fiscal 2000 by 1.05%, it decreased as a percentage of gross loans by 5.92%.
During fiscal 2000 one-to-four family loans purchased were $46.0 million. Of
the $315.7 million one-to-four family loans outstanding at June 30, 2000,
42.64% were fixed-rate loans and 57.36% were ARM loans.

  Certain Loan Terms. Since 1982, the Company has emphasized the origination
of ARM loans for retention in its portfolio. This practice has enabled the
Company to reduce its interest rate risk exposure by concentrating its loan
portfolio in assets with either shorter terms or more frequent repricing, or
both. At June 30, 2000, approximately 97.67% of the Company's multifamily,
87.76% of its commercial real estate and 57.36% of its one-to-four family
loans were ARM loans. The Company also originates fixed-rate loans in response
to customer demand. The type of loans the Company originates is dependent upon
the relative customer demand for fixed-rate or ARM loans, which in turn is
affected by the current and expected level of interest rates. Historically,
the Company has sold fixed-rate loans in the secondary market to FNMA, FHLMC
and others. During fiscal 2000, the Company retained certain fixed-rate loans
in its portfolio.

                                      10
<PAGE>

  The interest rates for approximately 43% of the Company's ARM loans in
portfolio are indexed to the 11th District Cost of Funds Index ("COFI"). The
Company currently offers a number of ARM loan programs with interest rates
tied to Treasury bill based and COFI indices that adjust monthly, semi-
annually, annually or once every five years, some of which have payment caps.
Because of payment caps and the different times at which interest rate
adjustments and payment adjustments are made, in periods of rising interest
rates monthly payments may not be sufficient to pay the interest accruing on
some of the Company's ARM loans. The amount of any shortfall ("negative
amortization") is added to the principal balance of the loan to be repaid
through future monthly payments, which could cause increases in the amount of
principal owed to the Company over that which was originally lent. The Company
currently has approximately $531.3 million in mortgage loans that may be
subject to negative amortization. During the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999
and 1998, the negative amortization associated with these loans totaled
$109,000, $223,000 and $478,000, respectively. Significant negative
amortization can increase the associated risk of default on loans,
particularly for loans originated with relatively high loan-to-value ratios.
Based on historical experience, management does not believe that the loss
experience on the loans that are subject to negative amortization is
materially different from the loss experience on the balance of its portfolio.

  Mortgage loans originated by the Company, generally include due-on-sale
clauses which provide the Company with the contractual right to deem the loan
immediately due and payable in the event the borrower transfers ownership of
the property without the Company's consent. Due-on-sale clauses are an
important means of adjusting the rates on the Company's fixed rate multifamily
and commercial mortgage loan portfolios and the Company has generally
exercised its rights under these clauses.

  Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. The Company's Board of Directors has
a standing Loan Committee. The Loan Committee is primarily responsible for
establishing the lending policies of the Company and reviewing properties
offered as security. The Board of Directors has authorized the following
persons to approve loans up to the amounts indicated: mortgage loans in
amounts of $1.0 million and below may be approved by the respective Loan
Division Manager or his designate; mortgage loans in excess of $1.0 million
and up to $1.5 million require the approval of the President or any member of
the Loan Committee; and mortgage loans in excess of $1.5 million requires the
approval of at least two members of the Loan Committee.

  For all loans originated by the Company, upon receipt of a completed loan
application from a prospective borrower, a credit report is ordered and
certain other information is verified by an independent credit agency and, if
necessary, additional financial information is required. Appraisals of the
real estate intended to secure proposed loans over $150,000 are required,
which appraisals currently are performed by independent appraisers designated
and approved by the Company. The Company's Board annually approves the
independent appraisers used by the Company and approves the Company's
appraisal policy. The Company's policy is to obtain title and hazard insurance
on all real estate loans. If the original loan amount exceeds 80% of the
underlying property's value on a sale or refinance of a first trust deed loan,
private mortgage insurance is required and the borrower will be required to
make payments to a mortgage impound account from which the Company makes
disbursements for property taxes and mortgage insurance.

Delinquencies and Classification of Assets

  Delinquent Loans. Management performs a monthly review of all delinquent
loans and reports to the Company's Board of Directors regarding the same. The
procedures taken by the Company with respect to delinquencies vary depending
on the nature of the loan and period of delinquency.

  The Company's policies generally provide that delinquent mortgage loans be
reviewed and that written notices be mailed after the 11th and 17th day of
delinquency. The Company's policies provide that telephone contact will be
attempted to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects of
repayment. When contact is made with the borrower at any time prior to
foreclosure, the Company will attempt to obtain full payment or work out a
repayment schedule with the borrower to avoid foreclosure. See also "--
Nonperforming Assets and Restructured Loans."

  The loans in the above table have been considered in connection with the
Company's overall assessment of the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses.
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will not have to establish
additional loss provisions for these loans in the future. See "--Allowances
for Loan and Real Estate Losses" and "MD&A--Problem Assets."

  Classification of Assets. Federal regulations and the Company's
Classification of Assets Policy require that the Company utilize an internal
asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential
problem assets. The Company has incorporated the OTS internal asset
classifications as a part of its credit monitoring system. The Company
currently classifies problem and potential problem assets as "Substandard,"
"Doubtful" or "Loss" assets. An asset is considered "Substandard" if it is
inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the
obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. "Substandard" assets include
those characterized by the "distinct possibility" that the insured institution
will sustain "some loss" if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loans can be
considered "Substandard" for other reasons in addition to the paying capacity
and underlying collateral, based on the Company's Classification of Assets
Policy. Assets classified as "Doubtful" have all of the weaknesses inherent in
those classified "Substandard" with the added characteristic that the
weaknesses present make "collection or liquidation in full", on the basis of
currently existing facts, conditions, and values, "highly questionable and
improbable." See "--Regulation and Supervision--Classification of Assets." The
Company's Internal Asset Review Committee monthly reviews and classifies the
Company's assets and reports the results of its review to the Company's Board
of Directors.

  The following table sets forth information with respect to the classified
assets of the Company at June 30, 2000.

  Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan", the Company recognizes
impairment on troubled collateral dependent loans by creating a specific
valuation allowance. At June 30, 2000 and 1999, the specific valuation
allowances totaled $521,000 and $465,000, respectively. The loans for which a
specific valuation allowance was established are in the process of collection.
At such time that these loans are deemed uncollectible, the specific valuation
allowance will be charged off.

  In addition to adversely classified assets, assets which do not currently
expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification but
possess weaknesses are designated "Special Mention." According to OTS
guidelines, Special Mention assets are not adversely classified and do not
expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. At
June 30, 2000, $6.4 million of assets were graded as Special Mention, compared
to $9.3 million at June 30, 1999.

  These assets have been considered in connection with the Company's overall
assessment of the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses; however, there
can be no assurance that the Company will not establish additional loss
provisions for these assets in the future. See "--Allowances for Loan and Real
Estate Losses" and "MD&A--Problem Assets."

Nonperforming Assets and Restructured Loans

  After 60 days, the Company ceases the accrual of interest on loans and any
previously accrued interest is reversed. In addition, the Company may
restructure a loan due to the debtor's financial difficulty and grant a
concession which the Company would not have otherwise considered. REO is
recorded at fair value less estimated costs of disposition.

Impaired Loans

  A loan is considered impaired when based on current circumstances and
events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts
due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Creditors are
required to measure impairment of a loan based on any one of the following:
(i) the present value of expected future cash flows from the loan discounted
at the loan's effective interest rate, (ii) an observable market price or
(iii) the fair value of the loan's underlying collateral. The Company measures
impairment based on the fair value of the loan's underlying collateral
property. Impaired loans exclude large groups of smaller balance homogeneous
loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment. For the Company, loans
collectively reviewed for impairment include all loans with principal balances
of less than $300,000.

  Factors considered as part of the periodic loan review process to determine
whether a loan is impaired, as defined under SFAS 114, address both the amount
the Company believes is probable that it will collect and the timing of such
collection. As part of the Company's loan review process the Company considers
such factors as the ability of the borrower to continue to meet the debt
service requirements, assessments of other sources of repayment, the fair
value of any collateral and the Company's prior history in dealing with the
particular type of loan involved. In evaluating whether a loan is considered
impaired, insignificant delays (less than twelve months) in the absence of
other facts and circumstances would not alone lead to the conclusion that a
loan was impaired.

  At June 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company had a gross investment in impaired
loans of $1.7 million and $3.5 million, respectively. During the years ended
June 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company's average investment in impaired loans was
$1.7 million and $5.9 million and for the years then ended, interest income on
such loans totaled $126,000 and $531,000, respectively. Interest income on
impaired loans which are performing is generally recorded utilizing the cash-
basis method of accounting. Payments received on impaired loans which are
performing under their contractual terms are allocated to principal and
interest in accordance with the terms of the loans. At June 30, 2000 all
impaired loans were performing in accordance with their contractual terms.
Impaired loans totaling $1.7 million were not performing in accordance with
their contractual terms at June 30, 1999, and have been included in nonaccrual
loans at that date.

  The Company recognizes impairment on troubled collateral dependent loans by
creating a specific valuation allowance. The loans for which a specific
valuation allowance was established are in the process of collection. At such
time that these loans are deemed uncollectible, the specific valuation
allowance is charged-off.

  Impaired loans at June 30, 2000 include $1.7 million of loans for which
specific valuation allowances of $379,000 had been established. At June 30,
1999, the Company had $1.0 million of impaired loans for which specific
valuation allowances of $155,000 had been established and $2.5 million of such
loans for which no specific valuation allowance was considered necessary. All
such provisions for losses and related recoveries are recorded as part of the
total allowance for loan losses.

Allowances for Loan and Real Estate Losses

  The Company's allowance for loan losses is comprised of specific valuation
allowances as well as a general valuation allowance ("GVA"). As discussed
above, specific valuation allowances are generally established to recognize
impairment on troubled collateral dependent loans. The GVA is maintained in an
amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses
that are anticipated on existing loan-related assets and off-balance sheet
items.

  The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan
losses based on management's evaluation of the risks inherent in its loan
portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is

                                      15
<PAGE>

maintained at an amount management considers adequate to cover estimated
losses in loans receivable which are deemed probable and estimable. The
allowance is based upon a number of factors, including asset classifications,
economic trends, industry experience and trends, industry and geographic
concentrations, estimated collateral values, management's assessment of the
credit risk inherent in the portfolio, historical loan loss experience, the
Company's underwriting policies and the regulatory environment.

  The Company has significantly increased its commercial real estate loan
portfolio during the past fiscal year from $140.4 million at June 30, 1999 to
$196.5 million at June 30, 2000 (an increase of approximately 39.92%). Both
because the size of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased
significantly and most of the loans comprising the portfolio are unseasoned,
having been originated within the last two fiscal years, the Company's past
loss experience with respect to its commercial real estate loan portfolio may
not be representative of the risk of loss in such portfolio in the future.
Multifamily and commercial real estate loans are generally considered to
involve a higher degree of credit risk and to be more vulnerable to adverse
conditions in the real estate market and to deteriorating economic conditions,
particularly changes in interest rates than one-to-four family residential
mortgage loans. These loans typically involve higher loan principal amounts
and the repayment of such loans generally depend on the income produced by the
operation or sale of the property being sufficient to cover operating expenses
and debt service. Sometimes multifamily and commercial real estate loans are
made to groups of related borrowers, which concentration could increase the
Company's exposure should the circumstances of one borrower negatively affect
the ability of other related borrowers to repay their loans in full on a
timely basis. In addition, multifamily and commercial real estate values tend
to be more cyclical and, while the southern California real estate market
remained strong in fiscal 2000, recessionary economic conditions of the type
that prevailed in prior years in the Company's lending market area tend to
result in higher vacancy and reduced rental rates and net operating incomes
from multifamily and commercial real estate properties. See "Business--Lending
Activities--Multifamily Lending" and "--Commercial Real Estate Lending."

  The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.6 million for the
year ended June 30, 2000, compared to $1.7 million, $1.5 million, $3.0 million
and $2.1 million for the years ended June 30, 1999, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. The slight decrease in the provision for 2000 is primarily the
result of the continued decrease in nonperforming assets during the year. The
slight increase in the provision for fiscal 1999 compared to 1998 was
primarily a result of the overall growth in the loan portfolio as compared to
the prior year, specifically in commercial real estate loans. In addition,
certain one-to-four family loans purchased during fiscal 1999 were considered
by the Company to have higher risk characteristics because they were loans
outside of California, which has historically been considered the Company's
primary market area for one-to-four family loans. The decrease in the
provision for 1998 was primarily a result of decreased charge-offs and
nonaccrual loans during this period. Management believed that the increases in
the provisions for 1997 and 1996 were necessary to replenish the allowance for
loan losses to what management believed was an adequate level due to charge-
offs taken during these years. The increase in charge-offs in 1996 was
primarily a result of acquiring title to or resolving properties damaged in
the January 1994 Northridge earthquake as well as continued declines in the
southern California economy during this year.

  Although the Company believes that the allowance for loan losses at June 30,
2000 is adequate, there can be no assurance that the Company will not have to
establish additional loss provisions based upon future events. The Company
will continue to monitor and modify its allowances for loan losses as
conditions dictate. In addition, the OTS and the FDIC, as an integral part of
their examination process, periodically review the Company's valuation
allowance. These agencies may require the Company to establish additional
allowances, based on their judgments of the information available at the time
of the examination. See "Regulation and Supervision--Classification of
Assets."

  It is the policy of the Company to "charge-off" consumer loans when it is
determined that they are no longer collectible. The policy for loans secured
by real estate, which comprise the bulk of the Company's portfolio, is to
establish an allowance for loan losses in accordance with the Company's asset
classification process, based on generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP"). It has generally been the practice of the Company to "charge-off"
losses after acquiring title to a property securing the loan. Prior to
acquiring title to REO, losses are recognized through the establishment of
valuation allowances. It is the Company's general policy to obtain appraisals
on the underlying property for loans 90 days or more past due and over
$500,000. If the loan amount is under $500,000, appraisals are obtained at the
time of foreclosure. It is the policy of the Company to obtain an appraisal on
all REO upon acquisition by the Company.

  REO is initially recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, less
estimated costs of disposition. Thereafter, if there is a further
deterioration in value, the Company writes down the REO directly for the
diminution in value. Real estate held for investment is carried at the lower
of cost or net realizable value. All costs of anticipated disposition are
considered in the determination of net realizable value.

  The following table sets forth activity in the Company's total allowance for
loan losses and allowance for losses on REO.

(1) In 2000, 1999, 1998, 1997 and 1996, total specific allowances amounted to
    $521,000, $465,000, $1.7 million, $1.6 million and $2.2 million,
    respectively.

  In fiscal 1999 the Company reevaluated its allowance methodology. This
reevaluation resulted in additional allocations of the allowance to the one-
to-four family and commercial real estate portfolios at June 30, 1999 as
compared to June 30, 1998. The increase in the unallocated allowance at
June 30, 1997 as compared to June 30, 1996, is a result of a decrease in the
allocated allowance on multifamily loans as a result of a decline in
multifamily charge-offs and nonaccrual multifamily loans during the year.

Investment Activities

  Federally chartered savings associations such as the Bank have the authority
to invest in various types of liquid assets, including United States Treasury
obligations, securities of various federal agencies, certain certificates of
deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, certain bankers'
acceptances, repurchase agreements and federal funds. Subject to various
restrictions, federally chartered savings institutions may also invest their
assets in commercial paper, investment grade corporate debt securities and
mutual funds whose assets conform to the investments that a federally
chartered savings institution is otherwise authorized to make directly.
Additionally, a federally chartered savings institution such as the Bank must
maintain minimum levels of investments that qualify as liquid assets under OTS
regulations. See "--Regulation and Supervision--Required Liquidity." The Bank
currently manages liquid assets at the minimum level required under OTS
requirements in an effort to maximize overall yield on its investment
portfolio.

  The investment policy of the Company attempts to provide and maintain
liquidity, generate a favorable return on investments without incurring undue
interest rate and credit risk, and complement the Company's lending
activities. Specifically, the Company's policy generally limits investments to
government and federal agency-backed securities and other non-government
guaranteed securities, including corporate debt obligations, that are
investment-grade. The Company's policy authorizes investment in marketable
equity securities meeting the Company's guidelines. The policy requires that
all investment purchases be ratified by the Board of Directors of the Company.
At June 30, 2000, the Company had federal funds sold and other short-term
investments and investment securities in the aggregate amount of $35.3 million
with a fair value of $34.2 million.

  The following table sets forth certain information regarding the amortized
cost and fair values of the Company's federal funds sold and other short-term
investments and investment securities portfolio at the dates indicated:

Sources of Funds

  General. Deposits, FHLB advances, securities sold under agreements to
repurchase, loan repayments and prepayments, and proceeds from sales of loans
are the primary sources of the Company's funds for use in lending, investing
and for other general purposes.

  Deposits. The Company offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of
interest rates and terms. The Company's deposits consist of passbook savings,
checking accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. The flow
of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions,
changes in money market rates, prevailing interest rates and competition. The
Company's deposits are obtained predominantly from the areas in which its
branch offices are located. The Company relies primarily on customer service
and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain these
deposits; however, market interest rates and rates offered by competing
financial institutions significantly affect the Company's ability to attract
and retain deposits. Certificate of deposit accounts in excess of $100,000 are
not actively solicited by the Company nor does the Company currently use
brokers to obtain deposits. During the second quarter of fiscal 2000 the Bank
purchased a retail branch office and its $45.9 million of deposits from
another financial institution. This branch is located in Rowland Heights,
California. In addition, while the vast majority of the Bank's deposits are
retail in nature, the Bank accepted $55 million in time deposits from a
political subdivision during fiscal 2000. The Bank considers these funds to be
wholesale deposits and an alternative borrowing source rather than a customer
relationship and their levels are determined by management's decision as to
the most economic funding sources. Management continually monitors the
Company's certificate accounts and historically the Company has retained a
large portion of such accounts upon maturity. See "MD&A--Capital Resources and
Liquidity--Sources of Funds and Liquidity."

  Borrowings. From time to time the Company has obtained advances from the
FHLB and may do so in the future as an alternative to retail deposit funds.
FHLB advances may also be used to acquire certain other assets as may be
deemed appropriate for investment purposes. These advances are collateralized
by the capital stock of the FHLB held by the Company and certain of the
Company's mortgage loans. See "--Regulation and Supervision--Federal Home Loan
Bank System." Such advances are made pursuant to several different credit
programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. The
maximum amount that the FHLB will advance to member institutions, including
the Company, for purposes other than meeting withdrawals, fluctuates from time
to time in accordance with the policies of the OTS and the FHLB. During fiscal
2000, the Company periodically borrowed advances to provide needed liquidity
and to supplement retail deposit gathering activity. See "MD&A--Capital
Resources and Liquidity--Sources of Funds and Liquidity." At June 30, 2000,
the Company had $290.3 million in outstanding advances from the FHLB. During
fiscal 2000, the maximum amount of FHLB advances that the Company had
outstanding at any month-end was $312.1 million.

Subsidiary Activities

  QCFC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank, is currently engaged, on an
agency basis, in the sale of casualty insurance, mutual funds and annuity
products primarily to the Bank's customers and

                                      22
<PAGE>

members of the local community and as a trustee of the Bank's deeds of trust.
In the past, QCFC has been involved in real estate development projects. The
Bank does not currently intend to engage in any future real estate development
projects through QCFC or otherwise. As of June 30, 2000, and for the year then
ended, QCFC had $298,000 in total assets and net income of $227,000.

Competition

  Savings associations face strong competition both in attracting deposits and
making real estate loans. The Company's most direct competition for deposits
has historically come from other savings associations and from commercial
banks located in its principal market areas of Los Angeles and Orange Counties
in California, including many large financial institutions which have greater
financial and marketing resources available to them. In addition, particularly
during times of high interest rates, the Company has faced significant
competition for investors' funds from short-term money market securities and
other corporate and government securities and mutual funds which invest in
such securities. Periods of low interest rates have made the attraction and
retention of deposits difficult as savers seek higher rates of return in
alternative investments. The ability of the Company to attract and retain
savings deposits depends on its ability to generally provide a rate of return,
liquidity and risk comparable to that offered by competing investment
opportunities. Furthermore, management considers the Company's reputation for
financial strength and quality service provided through its contiguous
branching network to local customers to be a major competitive advantage in
attracting and retaining savings deposits.

  The Company experiences strong competition for real estate loans principally
from other savings associations, commercial banks and mortgage banking
companies. It competes for loans principally through the interest rates and
loan fees it charges and the efficiency and quality of services it provides
borrowers. Management considers the Company's focus in multifamily and low-
to-moderate income lending in the Los Angeles area to be a competitive
advantage also. Competition may increase as a result of the continuing
reduction in restrictions on the interstate operations of financial
institutions.

  Under legislation adopted by Congress in 1994, bank holding companies based
in any state generally are allowed to acquire banks in California and banks
based in any state generally are allowed to acquire by merger banks based in
California. Under OTS regulations, federal savings associations have been
generally able to branch nationwide as long as the association's assets
attributable to each state outside of its home state in which it operates
branches are predominantly housing-related assets. The increased authority of
bank holding companies and banks to engage in interstate banking will allow
them to compete more effectively with savings associations.

Personnel

  As of June 30, 2000, the Bank had 159 full-time employees and 47 part-time
employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit
and the Bank considers its relationship with its employees to be good.

Federal Taxation

  General. The Company reports its income for tax purposes using the accrual
method of accounting and will be subject to federal income taxation in the
same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly
the Bank's reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of
tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a
comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company.

  Tax Bad Debt Reserve. Prior to 1996, savings institutions such as the Bank
which meet certain definitional tests primarily relating to their assets and
the nature of their business ("qualifying thrifts")

                                      23
<PAGE>

were permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual
additions thereto, which additions, within specified formula limits, were
deducted in arriving at their taxable income. The Bank's deduction with
respect to "qualifying loans," generally loans secured by certain interests in
real property, was computed using the Bank's actual loss experience, or 8% of
the Bank's taxable income. Use of the percentage of taxable income method of
calculating its deductible addition to its loss reserve had the effect of
reducing the maximum marginal rate of federal tax on the Bank's income to
32.20%, exclusive of any minimum or environmental tax, as compared to the
general maximum corporate federal income tax rate of 35%.

  Pursuant to certain provisions appended to the Small Business Job Protection
Act signed into law in August 1996 (the "Act"), the above-described bad debt
deduction rules available to thrifts such as the Bank have been repealed.
Under the Act, the Bank has changed its method of accounting for bad debts
from the reserve method formerly permitted under section 593 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") to the "specific charge-off"
method. Under the specific charge-off method, which is governed by section 166
of the Code and the regulations thereunder, tax deductions may be taken for
bad debts only if loans become wholly or partially worthless. Although the Act
generally requires that qualifying thrifts recapture (i.e., include in taxable
income) over a six-year period a portion of their existing bad debt reserves
equal to their "applicable excess reserves," the Bank does not have applicable
excess reserves subject to recapture. However, the Bank's tax bad debt reserve
balance of approximately $10.9 million as of June 30, 2000 will, in future
years, be subject to recapture in whole or in part upon the occurrence of
certain events, such as a distribution to stockholders in excess of the Bank's
current and accumulated earnings and profits, a redemption of shares, or upon
a partial or complete liquidation of the Bank. The Bank does not intend to
make distributions to stockholders that would result in recapture of any
portion of its bad debt reserve. Since management intends to use the reserve
only for the purpose for which it was intended, a deferred tax liability of
approximately $3.8 million has not been recorded.

  Distributions. To the extent that the Bank makes "non-dividend
distributions" to stockholders that are considered to result in distributions
from the tax bad debt reserve for losses on qualifying real property, then an
amount based on the amount distributed will be included in the Bank's taxable
income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the
Bank's current and accumulated earnings and profits, distributions in
redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete liquidation.
However, dividends paid out of the Bank's current or accumulated earnings and
profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, will not be considered
to result in a distribution from the Bank's tax bad debt reserves. Thus, any
dividends to the Company that would reduce amounts appropriated to the Bank's
tax bad debt reserves and deducted for federal income tax purposes may create
a tax liability for the Bank.

  The amount of additional taxable income created from a distribution from the
tax bad debt reserve is an amount that when reduced by the tax attributable to
the income is equal to the amount of the distribution. The result is to tax
distributions from the tax bad debt reserve at approximately 51%. See "--
Regulation and Supervision--Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation--
Payment of Dividends and Other Capital Distributions by Association" and
"Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters"
for limits on the payment of dividends of the Bank. The Bank does not intend
to make distributions that would result in a recapture of any portion of its
tax bad debt reserve.

  The date of the Company's last complete Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax
audit was December, 1985. There is a three-year statute of limitations for
federal tax filings. Tax years 1996 through 2000 are considered open tax years
for IRS audit purposes.

  Dividends Received Deduction and Other Matters. The Company may exclude from
its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same
affiliated group of corporations.

                                      24
<PAGE>

The corporate dividends received deduction is generally 70% in the case of
dividends received from unaffiliated corporations with which the Company and
the Bank will not file a consolidated tax return, except that if the Company
and the Bank own more than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a
dividend 80% of any dividends received may be deducted.

State and Local Taxation

  State of California. The California franchise tax rate applicable to the
Company equals the franchise tax rate applicable to corporations generally
plus an "in lieu" rate approximately equal to personal property taxes and
business license taxes paid by such corporations (but not generally paid by
banks or financial corporations such as the Bank); however, the total tax rate
currently applicable to the Company cannot exceed 10.84% for the 2000 calendar
year. Under California regulations, bad debt deductions are available in
computing California franchise taxes using a three or six year weighted
average loss experience method. The Company and its California subsidiary file
California state franchise tax returns on a combined basis.

  The date of the Company's last examination by the California Franchise Tax
Board was December 1997. There is a four-year statute of limitations for state
tax filings. Tax years 1998 through 2000 are considered open for California
Franchise Tax audit purposes.

  Delaware Taxation. As a Delaware holding company not earning income in
Delaware, the Company is exempted from Delaware Corporate income tax but is
required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the
State of Delaware.

Environmental Regulation

  The Company's business and properties are subject to federal and state laws
and regulations governing environmental matters, including the regulation of
hazardous substances and wastes. For example, under the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and similar
state laws, owners and operators of contaminated properties may be liable for
the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances without regard to whether such
persons actually caused the contamination. Such laws may affect the Company as
an owner or operator of properties used in its business, and through the Bank,
as a secured lender of property that is found to contain hazardous substances
or wastes.

 Although CERCLA and similar state laws generally exempt holders of security
interests, the exemption may not be available if a secured party engages in
the management of its borrower or the securing property in a manner deemed
beyond the protection of the secured party's interest. Recent federal and
state legislation, as well as guidance issued by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency and a number of court decisions, have provided
assurance to lenders regarding the activities they may undertake and remain
within CERCLA's secured party exemption. However, these assurances are not
absolute and generally will not protect a lender or fiduciary that
participates or otherwise involves itself in the management of its borrower,
particularly in foreclosure proceedings. As a result, CERCLA and similar state
statutes may influence the Bank's decision whether to foreclose on property
that is found to be contaminated. The Bank has adopted environmental
underwriting requirements for commercial real estate loans. The Bank's general
policy is to obtain an environmental assessment prior to foreclosure on
commercial real estate. See "Business--General" and "--Lending Activities--
Loan and MBS Portfolio Composition" regarding the recent and rapid expansion
of the Association's commercial real estate loan portfolio. The existence of
hazardous substances or wastes on commercial real estate properties could
cause the Bank to elect not to foreclose on the property, thereby limiting,
and in some instances precluding, the Bank from realizing on the related loan.
Should the Bank foreclose on property containing hazardous substances or
wastes, the Bank would become subject to other environmental statutes,
regulations and common law relating to matters such as, but

                                      25
<PAGE>

not limited to, asbestos abatement, lead-based paint abatement, hazardous
substance investigation and remediation, air emissions, wastewater discharges,
hazardous waste management, and third party claims for personal injury and
property damage.

Regulation and Supervision

General

  The Bank is a federally chartered savings association, a member of the FHLB
of San Francisco, and is subject to regulation by the OTS and the FDIC. The
Bank's deposits are insured by the FDIC through the SAIF, up to applicable
limits. As a result of its ownership of the Bank, the Company is a savings and
loan holding company subject to regulation by the OTS. As described in more
detail below, statutes and regulations applicable to the Bank govern such
matters as the investments and activities in which the Bank can engage; the
amount of capital the Bank must hold; mergers and changes of control;
establishment and closing of branch offices; and dividends payable by the
Bank. Statutes and regulations applicable to the Company govern such matters
as changes of control of the Company and transactions between the Bank and the
Company.

  The Company and the Bank are subject to the examination, supervision and
reporting requirements of the OTS, their primary federal regulator, including
a requirement for the Bank of at least one full scope, on-site examination
every year. The Director of the OTS is authorized to impose assessments on the
Bank to fund OTS operations, including the cost of examinations. The Bank is
also subject to examination, when deemed necessary, and supervision by the
FDIC, and the FDIC has "back-up" authority to take enforcement action against
the Bank if the OTS fails to take such action after a recommendation by the
FDIC. The FDIC may impose assessments on the Bank to cover the cost of FDIC
examinations. The FDIC is no longer able to conduct separate examinations of
the Bank except in exigent circumstances. In addition, the Bank is subject to
regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("FRB")
with respect to certain aspects of its business.

  The descriptions set forth below and elsewhere in this document of the
statutes and regulations that are applicable to the Company do not purport to
be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects
on the Company, or to identify every statute and regulations that may apply to
the Company. The following description of statutory and regulatory provisions
and proposals is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular
statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals.

Activities Restrictions

  Qualified Thrift Lender Test. The qualified thrift lender ("QTL") test
requires that, in at least nine out of every twelve months, at least 65% of a
savings bank's "portfolio assets" must be invested in a limited list of
"qualified thrift investments," primarily investments related to housing loans
and certain other assets. If the Bank fails to satisfy the QTL test and does
not requalify as a QTL within one year, the Company must register and be
regulated as a bank holding company, and the Bank must either convert to a
commercial bank charter or become subject to restrictions on branching,
business activities and dividends as if it were a national bank. At June 30,
2000, approximately 83.50% of the Bank's portfolio assets constituted
qualified thrift investments and the Bank met the QTL test each month in
fiscal 2000.

  Investment and Loan Limits. In general, federal savings institutions such as
the Bank may not invest directly in equity securities, debt securities that
are not rated investment grade, or real estate, other than real estate used
for the institution's offices and related facilities. Indirect equity
investment in real estate through a subsidiary is permissible, but subject to
limitations based on the amount of the institution's assets, and the
institution's investment in such a subsidiary must be deducted from regulatory
capital in full.

                                      26
<PAGE>

  Loans by a savings institution to a single borrower are generally limited to
15% of the institution's "unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus," which is
similar but not identical to total capital. Aggregate loans by the Bank that
are secured by nonresidential real property are generally limited to 400% of
the institution's total capital. Commercial loans not secured by real property
may not exceed 10% of the Bank's total assets, and consumer loans may not
exceed 35% of the Bank's total assets. At June 30, 2000, the Bank was in
compliance with the above investment limitations.

  Activities of Subsidiaries. A savings institution seeking to establish a new
subsidiary, acquire control of an existing company or conduct a new activity
through an existing subsidiary must provide 30 days prior notice to the FDIC
and OTS. A subsidiary of the Bank may be able to engage in activities that are
not permissible for the Bank directly, if the OTS determines that such
activities are reasonably related to the Bank's business, but the Bank may be
required to deduct its investment in such a subsidiary from capital. The OTS
has the power to require a savings institution to divest any subsidiary or
terminate any activity conducted by a subsidiary that the OTS determines to be
a serious threat to the financial safety, soundness or stability of such
savings institution or to be otherwise inconsistent with sound banking
practices.

  Safety and Soundness Standards. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") required the OTS to prescribe for savings
associations minimum acceptable operational and managerial standards, and
standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation. The standards
cover internal control, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate
exposure, asset growth, and employee compensation. Any institution that fails
to meet the OTS regulations promulgated under the safety and soundness
requirements must submit an acceptable plan for compliance or become subject
to the ability of the OTS, in its discretion, to impose operational
restrictions similar to those that would apply to a failure to meet minimum
capital requirements as discussed below.

  Real Estate Lending Standards. The OTS and the other federal banking
agencies have adopted regulations which require institutions to adopt and at
least annually review written real estate lending policies. The lending
policies must include diversification standards, underwriting standards
(including loan-to-value limits), loan administration procedures, and
procedures for monitoring compliance with the policies. The policies must
reflect consideration of guidelines adopted by the banking agencies that
discuss certain loan-to-value and percentage of capital limits.

Deposit Insurance

  Deposit Insurance Premium Assessments. The FDIC has established a risk-based
system for setting deposit insurance assessments on deposits. Currently, all
of the Bank's deposits are SAIF-insured. Under the risk-based assessment
system, an institution's insurance assessment will vary depending on the level
of capital the institution holds and the degree to which it is the subject of
supervisory concern to the FDIC. SAIF-assessed deposits are currently subject
to insurance premiums between 0.0% and 0.27%. The Bank's assessment rate was
0.0% as of June 30, 2000.

  Also, the FDIC assesses SAIF member and BIF member institutions to fund
interest payments on certain bonds issued by the Financing Corporation ("FICO
debt"). Until December 31, 1999, BIF members were assessed at approximately
one-fifth the rate at which SAIF members were assessed. After December 31,
1999, BIF and SAIF members are being assessed at the same rate of 0.0212% on
deposits. Currently, all of the Bank's deposits are SAIF-insured. See
"Business--Federal Taxation" for a discussion of recent changes concerning bad
debt deductions historically available to qualifying thrift institutions.

Regulatory Capital Requirements

  The OTS's capital regulations include three separate minimum capital
requirements for the savings institution industry--a "tangible capital
requirement," a "leverage limit" (also referred to as the

                                      27
<PAGE>

"core capital ratio"), and a "risk-based capital requirement." These capital
standards must be no less stringent than the capital standards applicable to
national banks. In addition, institutions whose exposure to interest rate risk
is deemed to be above normal are required to deduct a portion of such exposure
in calculating their risk-based capital requirements. The OTS also has the
authority, after giving the affected institution notice and an opportunity to
respond, to establish individual minimum capital requirements ("IMCR") for a
savings institution which are higher than the industry minimum requirements,
upon a determination that an IMCR is necessary or appropriate in light of the
institution's particular circumstances. Savings institutions that do not meet
their capital requirements are subject to a number of sanctions similar to but
less restrictive than the sanctions under the Prompt Corrective Action system
described below, and to a requirement that the OTS be notified of any changes
in the institution's directors or senior executive officers.

  The three industry minimum capital requirements are as follows:

    Tangible capital of at least 1.5% of adjusted total assets. Tangible
  capital is composed of (1) an institution's common stock, perpetual non-
  cumulative preferred stock, and related earnings
  or surplus (excluding unrealized gains and losses on securities classified
  as available-for-sale), (2) certain nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged
  deposits and (3) the amount, if any, of equity investment by others in the
  institution's subsidiaries, after deducting (a) the institution's
  investments in and extensions of credit to subsidiaries engaged as
  principal in activities not permissible for national banks, net of any
  reserves established against such investments and (b) certain non-
  qualifying intangible assets. Deferred tax assets whose realization depends
  on the institution's future taxable income or on the institution's tax
  planning strategies must also be deducted from tangible capital to the
  extent that such assets exceed the lesser of (1) 10% of core capital, or
  (2) the amount of such assets that can be realized within one year, unless
  such assets were reportable as of December 31, 1992, in which case no
  deduction is required.

  In general, adjusted total assets equal the institution's consolidated total
assets, minus any assets that are deducted in calculating the amount of
capital. At June 30, 2000, the Bank's ratio of tangible capital to adjusted
total assets was 7.20%.

    Core capital of at least 4% of adjusted total assets. Core capital
  consists of tangible capital plus (1) qualifying intangibles such as
  certain mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships
  and (2) any core deposit premium in existence on March 4, 1994 whose
  inclusion in core capital is grandfathered by the OTS. At June 30, 2000,
  the Bank's core capital ratio was 7.20%.

    Total capital of at least 8% of risk-weighted assets. Total capital
  includes both core capital and "supplementary" capital items deemed less
  permanent than core capital, such as subordinated debt and general loan
  loss allowances (subject to certain limits). At least half of total capital
  must consist of core capital. Risk-weighted assets are determined by
  multiplying each category of an institution's assets, including certain
  assets sold with recourse and other off balance sheet assets, by an
  assigned risk weight based on the credit risk associated with those assets,
  and adding the resulting sums. The amount of risk-based capital, however,
  that may be required to be maintained by the institution for recourse
  assets cannot be greater than the total of the recourse liability. The four
  risk-weight categories include zero percent for cash and government
  securities, 20% for certain high-quality investments, 50% for certain
  qualifying one-to-four family and multifamily mortgage loans and 100% for
  assets (including past-due loans and real estate owned) that do not qualify
  for preferential risk-weighting. At June 30, 2000, the Bank's risk-based
  capital ratio was 12.03%, and accordingly the Bank exceeded all three of
  the industry minimum capital requirements.

  FDICIA required the OTS and the federal bank regulatory agencies to revise
their risk-based capital standards to ensure that those standards take
adequate account of interest-rate risk,

                                      28
<PAGE>

concentration of credit risk, and risks of nontraditional activities. The
regulations of the OTS and the other federal banking agencies provide that an
institution may be required to hold risk-based capital in excess of regulatory
minimums to the extent that it is determined either that (i) the institution
has a high degree of exposure to interest-rate risk, prepayment risk, credit
risk, certain risks arising from nontraditional activities or similar risks,
or a high proportion of off-balance sheet risk or (ii) the institution is not
adequately managing these risks. For this purpose, however, the agencies have
stated that, in view of the statutory requirements relating to permitted
lending and investment activities of savings institutions, the general
concentration by such institutions in real estate lending activities would
not, by itself, be deemed to constitute an exposure to concentration of credit
risk that would require greater capital levels.

Prompt Corrective Action Requirements

  FDICIA required and the OTS has established five capital categories to
implement a "prompt corrective action" system. These categories are:
"well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized,"
"significantly undercapitalized," and "critically undercapitalized."

  An institution is treated as well capitalized if its risk-based capital
ratio is at least 10.0%, its ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets
(the "Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio") is at least 6.0%, its leverage ratio
or core capital is at least 5.0%, and it is not subject to any order or
directive by the OTS to meet a specific capital level. At June 30, 2000, the
Bank had a risk-based capital ratio of 12.03%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital
ratio of 10.83%, and a core capital ratio of 7.20%, which qualified the Bank
for the well-capitalized category. The Bank's capital category under the
prompt corrective action system may not be an accurate representation of the
Bank's overall financial condition or prospects.

  An institution will be adequately capitalized if its risk-based capital
ratio is at least 8.0%, its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is at least 4.0%,
and its core capital ratio is at least 4.0% (3.0% if the institution receives
the highest rating on the OTS CAMEL financial institutions rating system). An
institution whose capital does not meet the amounts required in order to be
adequately capitalized will be treated as undercapitalized. If an
undercapitalized institution's capital ratios are less than 6.0%, 3.0%, or
3.0% respectively, it will be treated as significantly undercapitalized.
Finally, an institution will be treated as critically undercapitalized if its
ratio of "tangible equity" (core capital plus cumulative preferred stock minus
intangible assets other than supervisory goodwill and purchased mortgage
servicing rights) to adjusted total assets is equal to or less than 2.0%.

  An institution that is undercapitalized or lower must submit a capital
restoration plan to the OTS within 45 days after becoming undercapitalized,
and the plan can be accepted only if the institution's performance under the
plan is guaranteed, up to a maximum of 5% of the institution's assets, by
every company that controls the institution. An institution that is
undercapitalized is also subject to mandatory stringent limits on expansion
and on the ability to make capital distributions, and is prohibited from
accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits and certain benefit plan
deposits. In addition, an undercapitalized institution is subject to numerous
other restrictions which the OTS may impose in its discretion, including
restrictions on transactions with affiliates and interest rates, and to the
ability of the OTS to order a sale of the institution, the replacement of
directors and management, and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. A
significantly undercapitalized institution is subject to additional sanctions
and a critically undercapitalized institution generally must be placed into
conservatorship or receivership.

Enforcement

  All depository institutions, including savings associations, and
"institution affiliated parties" such as directors, officers, employees,
agents and controlling stockholders of depository institutions, including
holding companies, are subject to regulatory agency enforcement authority. An
institution or institution-affiliated party may be subject to a three-tier
penalty regime that ranges from a maximum

                                      29
<PAGE>

penalty of $5,000 per day for a simple violation to a maximum penalty of $1
million per day for certain knowing violations including the failure to
submit, or submission of incomplete, false or misleading, reports. An
institution-affiliated party may also be subject to loss of voting rights with
respect to the stock of depository institutions.

Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation

  Activities of the Company. As a savings and loan holding company, the
Company must file periodic reports with the OTS, and is subject to OTS
examination. As a savings and loan holding company that acquired control of
only one savings association prior to May 4, 1999, the Company generally is
not restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in
which it may engage, provided that the Bank continues to be a QTL. See
"Regulation--Activities Restrictions--QTL Test" for a discussion of the QTL
requirements. If the Bank ceases to be a QTL, or if the Company were to
acquire another savings association and hold such association as a subsidiary
separate from the Bank, the Company would be subject to extensive restrictions
on the types of business activities in which it could engage. Such
restrictions would limit the Company to specified finance-, real estate- and
insurance-related activities.

  The Home Owners' Loan Act ("HOLA") prohibits a savings and loan holding
company such as the Company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more
subsidiaries, from (a) acquiring control of another savings institution or
savings and loan holding company without prior written approval of the OTS;
(b) acquiring or retaining, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-
subsidiary savings institution or a non-subsidiary savings and loan holding
company; or (c) acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution
that is not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating applications by holding
companies such as the Company to acquire savings institutions, the OTS must
consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the
company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to
the insurance funds, the convenience and needs of the community and
competitive factors.

  Affiliate and Insider Transactions. The ability of the Company and its non-
depository subsidiaries to deal with the Bank is limited by the affiliate
transaction rules, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act
which also govern BIF-insured banks. With very limited exceptions, these rules
require that all transactions between the Bank and an affiliate must be on
arms' length terms. The term "affiliate" covers any company that controls or
is under common control with the Bank, but does not include individuals and
generally does not include the Bank's subsidiaries.

  Under Section 23A and section 11 of HOLA, specific restrictions apply to
transactions in which the Bank provides funding to its affiliates: the Bank
may not purchase the securities of an affiliate, make a loan to any affiliate
that is engaged in activities not permissible for a bank holding company, or
acquire from an affiliate any asset that has been classified, a nonaccrual
loan, a restructured loan, or a loan that is more than 30 days past due. As to
affiliates engaged in bank holding company-permissible activities, the
aggregate of (a) loans, guarantees, and letters of credit provided by the
savings bank for the benefit of any one affiliate, and (b) purchases of assets
by the savings bank from the affiliate, may not exceed 10% of the savings
bank's capital stock and surplus (20% for the aggregate of permissible
transactions with all affiliates). All loans to affiliates must be secured by
collateral equal to at least 100% of the amount of the loan (130% if the
collateral consists of equity securities, leases or real property).

  Loans by the Bank to its directors, executive officers, and 10% shareholders
of the Bank, the Company, or the Company's subsidiaries (collectively,
"insiders"), or to a corporation or partnership that is at least 10% owned by
an insider (a "related interest") are subject to limits separate from the
affiliate transaction rules. All loans to insiders and their related interests
must be underwritten and made on non-preferential terms; loans in excess of
$500,000 must be approved in advance by the

                                      30
<PAGE>

Bank's Board of Directors; and the Bank's total of such loans may not exceed
100% of the Bank's capital. Loans by the Bank to its executive officers are
subject to additional limits which are even more stringent.

  Limits on Change of Control. Subject to certain limited exceptions, control
of the Bank or the Company may only be obtained with the approval (or in the
case of an acquisition of control by an individual, the nondisapproval) of the
OTS, after a public comment and application review process. Under OTS
regulations defining "control," a rebuttable presumption of control arises if
an acquiring party acquires more than 10% of any class of the Bank or the
Company (or more than 25% of any class of stock, whether voting or non-voting)
and is subject to any "control factors" as defined in the regulation. Control
is conclusively deemed to exist if an acquirer holds more than 25% of any
class of voting stock of the Bank or the Company, or has the power to control
in any manner the election of a majority of directors.

  Payment of Dividends and Other Capital Distributions by Bank. The payment of
dividends, stock repurchases, and other capital distributions by the Bank to
the Company is subject to regulation by the OTS. The OTS has promulgated a
regulation that addresses a savings institution's ability to make a capital
distribution according to the institution's capital position. Effective April
1, 1999, the OTS amended its capital distributions regulation. The new rule
establishes a "safe-harbor" amounts for capital distributions that
institutions can make without OTS prior approval or notice. It also sets forth
certain conditions that specify whether a notice or an application for prior
approval of the OTS is required if the safe harbor does not apply. The OTS
retains discretion to subject institutions that meet their capital
requirements to the more stringent capital distribution rules applicable to
institutions with less capital if the OTS notifies the institution that it is
in need of more than normal supervision. The OTS retains the authority to
prohibit any capital distribution otherwise authorized under its regulations
if the OTS determines that the distribution would constitute an unsafe or
unsound practice.

  Under its regulation, an application for the prior approval of the OTS to
make a capital distribution is required if any of the following conditions are
present: the institution would not be adequately-capitalized after the
distribution, its examination ratings are not at least satisfactory or it is
considered a problem association or in troubled condition, the total amount of
all its capital distributions for the applicable calendar year (including the
proposed distribution) would exceed its net income for that year to date plus
its retained net income for the prior two years, or the distribution would
violate an applicable prohibition or OTS imposed condition on the institution.

  A 30-day advance notice is required if, as is the case with the Bank, the
institution is a subsidiary of a holding company, the institution would not be
well-capitalized after the distribution, or the distribution would reduce the
amount of or retire any part of its common or preferred stock or retire any
part of a debt instrument included in total capital (other than through a
regular payment on the instrument). If none of the above conditions are
present, an institution is not required to file an application or notice with
the OTS before making a capital distribution.

  In connection with a conversion from mutual to stock form, a savings
institution is required to establish a liquidation account in an amount equal
to the converting institution's net worth as of a practicable date prior to
the conversion. The liquidation account is maintained for the benefit of
certain eligible accountholders maintaining accounts at or prior to the date
of conversion. In the event of a complete liquidation of the converted savings
institution (and only in such event), each such accountholder is entitled to
receive a distribution from the liquidation account equal to the then current
adjusted balance of the holder's savings accounts with the savings
institution. The Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company is also
subject to restriction arising from the existence of the liquidation account
established upon the conversion of the Bank from mutual to stock form in
December 1993. The Bank is not permitted to pay dividends to the Company if
its regulatory capital would be reduced below the amount required for the
liquidation account.


                                      31
<PAGE>

  Additionally, as of June 30, 2000, the Bank had a tax bad debt reserve
balance of approximately $10.9 million. Any distribution by the Bank to the
Company that exceeds the Bank's current or accumulated earnings and profits as
calculated for federal income tax purposes would be treated as a distribution
of the bad debt reserve and would be subject to recapture taxes of up to 51%.
See "Business--Federal Taxation" regarding recently enacted changes relating
to bad debt reserve recapture. The Bank does not intend to make distributions
to stockholders that would result in recapture of any portion of its bad debt
reserve. Since management intends to use the reserve only for the purpose for
which it was intended, a deferred tax liability of approximately $3.8 million
has not been recorded.

  Enforcement. Whenever the OTS has reasonable cause to believe that the
continuation by a savings and loan holding company of any activity or of
ownership or control of any non FDIC-insured subsidiary constitutes a serious
risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of a savings and loan
holding company's subsidiary savings institution and is inconsistent with the
sound operation of the savings institution, the OTS may order the holding
company, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, to terminate such
activities or to divest such noninsured subsidiary. FIRREA also empowers the
OTS, in such a situation, to issue a directive without any notice or
opportunity for a hearing, which directive may (i) limit the payment of
dividends by the savings institution, (ii) limit transactions between the
savings institution and its holding company or its affiliates, and (iii) limit
any activity of the association that creates a serious risk that the
liabilities of the holding company and its affiliates may be imposed on the
savings institution.

  In addition, FIRREA includes savings and loan holding companies within the
category of person designated as "institution-affiliated parties." An
institution-affiliated party may be subject to significant penalties and/or
loss of voting rights in the event such party took any action for or toward
causing, bringing about, participating in, counseling, or aiding and abetting
a violation of law or unsafe or unsound practice by a savings institution.

Classification of Assets

  Savings institutions are required to classify their assets on a regular
basis, to establish appropriate allowances for losses and report the results
of such classification quarterly to the OTS. A savings institution is also
required to set aside adequate valuation allowances to the extent that an
affiliate possesses assets posing a risk to the institution, and to establish
liabilities for off-balance sheet items, such as letters of credit, when loss
becomes probable and estimable. The OTS has the authority to review the
institution's classification of its assets and to determine whether and to
what extent (a) additional assets must be classified, and (b) the
institution's valuation allowances must be increased.

  Troubled assets are classified into one of three categories as follows:

    Substandard Assets. An asset is considered "Substandard" if it is
  inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the
  obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Prudent general valuation
  allowances are required to be established for such assets.

    Doubtful Assets. Assets classified as "Doubtful" have all of the
  weaknesses inherent in those classified "Substandard" with the added
  characteristic that the weaknesses present make "collection or liquidation
  in full," on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values,
  "highly questionable and improbable." Prudent general valuation allowances
  are required to be established for such assets.

    Loss Assets. Assets classified as "Loss" are those considered
  "uncollectible" and of such little value that their continuance as bankable
  assets is not warranted.

                                      32
<PAGE>

  General valuation allowances for loan and lease losses are included within
regulatory capital for certain purposes and up to certain limits, while
specific allowances and other general allowances are not included at all.

  The OTS and the other federal banking agencies have adopted a statement of
policy regarding the appropriate levels of general valuation allowances for
loan and lease losses that institutions should maintain. Under the policy
statement, examiners will generally accept management's evaluation of adequacy
of general valuation allowances for loans and lease losses if the institution
has maintained effective systems and controls for identifying and addressing
asset quality problems, analyzed in a reasonable manner all significant
factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio, and established an
acceptable process for evaluating the adequacy of general valuation
allowances. However, the policy statement also provides that OTS examiners
will review management's analysis more closely if general valuation allowances
for loan and lease losses do not equal at least the sum of (a) 15% of assets
classified as Substandard, (b) 50% of assets classified as Doubtful, and (c)
for the portfolio of unclassified loans and leases, an estimate of credit
losses over the upcoming twelve months based on the institution's average rate
of net charge-offs over the previous two or three years on similar loans,
adjusted for current trends and conditions.

Community Reinvestment Act

  The Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") requires each savings institution, as
well as other lenders, to identify the communities served by the institution's
offices and to identify the types of credit the institution is prepared to
extend within such communities. The CRA also requires the OTS to assess the
performance of the institution in meeting the credit needs of its community
and to take such assessment into consideration in reviewing applications for
mergers, acquisitions, and other transactions. An unsatisfactory CRA rating
may be the basis for denying such an application.

  Under the CRA regulations of the OTS and the other federal banking agencies,
an institution's performance in making loans and investments and maintaining
branches and providing services in low-and moderate-income areas within the
communities that it serves is evaluated. In connection with its assessment of
CRA performance, the OTS assigns a rating of "outstanding," "satisfactory,"
"needs to improve," or "substantial noncompliance." Based on the latest
examination conducted by the OTS in 1999, the Bank was rated outstanding.

Federal Home Loan Bank System

  The Federal Home Loan Banks provide a credit facility for member
institutions. As a member of the FHLB of San Francisco, the Bank is required
to own capital stock in the FHLB of San Francisco in an amount at least equal
to the greater of 1% of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid
residential loans, residential purchase contracts and similar obligations at
the end of each calendar year, assuming for such purposes that at least 30% of
its assets were residential mortgage loans, or 5% of its advances from the
FHLB of San Francisco. At June 30, 2000 the Bank was in compliance with this
requirement. Furthermore, FHLB advances must be collateralized with certain
types of assets. Accordingly, the Bank has pledged certain loans to the FHLB
of San Francisco as collateral for its advances. See "--Financial
Modernization Legislation," below regarding legislation proposing changes in
the operation of the Federal Home Loan Bank system.

Required Liquidity

  OTS regulations require savings institutions to maintain, for each calendar
quarter, an average daily balance of liquid assets (including cash, certain
time deposits, bankers' acceptances and specified United States government,
state and federal agency obligations) equal to at least 4% of the quarter end
balance of its deposits, excluding those with maturities exceeding one year,
plus short-term borrowings.

                                      33
<PAGE>

The OTS may change this liquidity requirement from time to time to an amount
within a range of 4% to 10% of such accounts and borrowings depending upon
economic conditions and the deposit flows of member institutions, and may
exclude from the definition of liquid assets any item other than cash and the
balances maintained in satisfaction of FRB reserve requirements, described
below. The Bank's average liquidity ratio exceeded the applicable requirement
at all times during fiscal 2000.

Federal Reserve System

  The Federal Reserve Board requires savings institutions to maintain reserves
against certain of their transaction accounts (primarily deposit accounts that
may be accessed by writing unlimited checks). For the calculation period
including June 30, 2000, the Bank was not required to maintain reserves with
the Federal Reserve Board because it maintains certain levels of cash on hand
at its branches and with the requisite custodian. If balances are maintained
to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Board, they do
not earn interest but may be used to satisfy the Bank's liquidity requirements
discussed above.

  As a creditor and a financial institution, the Bank is subject to certain
regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, including, without
limitation, Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity Act), Regulation D
(Reserves), Regulation E (Electronic Funds Transfers Act), Regulation F
(limits on exposure to any one correspondent depository institution),
Regulation Z (Truth in Lending Act), Regulation CC (Expedited Funds
Availability Act), and Regulation DD (Truth in Savings Act). As creditors of
loans secured by real property and as owners of real property, financial
institutions, including the Bank, may be subject to potential liability under
various statutes and regulations applicable to property owners, including
statutes and regulations relating to the environmental condition of the
property.

Financial Modernization Legislation

  On November 12, 1999, President Clinton signed into law the Gramm-Leach-
Bliley ("G-L-B Act") which significantly reforms various aspects of the
financial services industry. The G-L-B Act authorizes affiliations between
banking, securities, and insurance firms, and authorizes bank holding
companies and national banks to engage in a variety of new financial
activities. Among the new activities that will be permitted to qualifying bank
holding companies are: insurance underwriting and brokerage, securities
underwriting, and merchant banking. Moreover, under the G-L-B Act, the Federal
Reserve Board, in consultation with the Department of Treasury, may approve
additional financial activities for these qualifying bank holding companies.

  The G-L-B Act also permits certain national banks to establish subsidiaries
to engage in similar financial activities. National bank subsidiaries,
however, are prohibited from insurance underwriting, real estate development
and, for at least five years, merchant banking. The G-L-B Act generally will
subject banks to the same securities regulation as other providers of
securities products. The G-L-B Act also prohibits future acquisitions of
existing unitary savings and loan holding companies, like the Company, by
firms which are engaged in commercial activities, and limits the permissible
activities of unitary savings and loan holding companies that were not, or had
not submitted an application to become, a unitary savings and loan holding
company by May 4, 1999.

  The G-L-B Act imposes new requirements on financial institutions with
respect to customer privacy. The G-L-B Act generally prohibits disclosure of
customer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the customer has
been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure.
Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies
to customers annually. Financial institutions, however, will be required to
comply with state law if it is more protective of customer privacy than the G-
L-B Act. On June 1, 2000, the federal banking agencies, including the OTS,
issued a joint final rule implementing the privacy provisions of the G-L-B
Act. The joint rule

                                      34
<PAGE>

becomes effective on November 13, 2000, with compliance optional until July 1,
2001. Management does not believe that complying with the new consumer privacy
provisions or regulations will have a significant impact on our business.

  The G-L-B Act contains significant revisions to the Federal Home Loan Bank
System. The G-L-B Act imposes new capital requirements on the Federal Home
Loan Banks and authorizes them to issue two classes of stock with differing
dividend rates and redemption requirements. The G-L-B Act deletes the current
requirement that the Federal Home Loan Banks annually contribute $300 million
to pay interest on certain government obligations in favor of a 20% of net
earnings formula. Accordingly, this change will result in a greater obligation
in years where Federal Home Loan Banks have high-income levels, thereby
reducing the returns on member's investments. In addition, the G-L-B Act
expands the permissible uses of Federal Home Loan Bank advances by community
financial institutions (under $500 million in assets) to include funding loans
to small businesses, small farms and small agribusinesses. If the increase in
the permissible uses for advances leads to an increase in demand, this may
increase the cost of borrowing. The G-L-B Act, however, makes membership in
the Federal Home Loan Bank voluntary for federal savings associations.

  The Company is unable to predict the impact of the G-L-B Act on its
operations at this time. Although the G-L-B Act reduces the range of companies
which may acquire control of the Company and with which the Company may
affiliate, it may facilitate affiliations with companies in the financial
services industry. Also, it is expected that while the operations of some of
our competitors may benefit from the G-L-B Act, those of others may be
impaired.

  The Company's ability to pay dividends is limited by certain restrictions
generally imposed on Delaware corporations. In general, dividends may be paid
only out of a Delaware corporation's surplus, as defined in the Delaware
General Corporation Law, or net profits for the fiscal year in which the
dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. "Surplus" is defined
for this purpose as the amount by which a corporation's net assets (total
assets minus total liabilities) exceed the amount designated by the Board of
Directors of the corporation in accordance with Delaware law as the
corporation's capital. The Company may pay dividends out of funds legally
available therefor at such times as the Board of Directors determines that
dividend payments are appropriate, after considering the Company's net income,
capital requirements, financial condition, alternate investment options,
prevailing economic conditions, industry practices and other factors deemed to
be relevant at the time. The Company has not paid cash dividends in the past
and does not presently intend to pay cash dividends.

  The Company's principal source of income in fiscal 2000 was interest from
investments. Dividends from the Bank are a potential source of income for the
Company. On May 19, 2000, the Bank declared a $1.0 million dividend payable to
the Company based on a $5.0 million total authorization by the Board of
Directors of the Bank. The payment of dividends and other capital
distributions by the Bank to the Company is subject to regulation by the OTS.
The OTS has promulgated a regulation that addresses a savings institution's
ability to make a capital distribution according to the institution's capital
position. Effective April 1, 1999, the OTS amended its capital distributions
regulation. The new rule establishes a "safe-harbor" for capital distributions
that institutions can make without OTS prior approval or notice. It also sets
forth certain conditions that specify whether a notice or an application for
prior approval of the OTS is required if the safe harbor does not apply. Under
its regulation, an application for the prior approval of the OTS to make a
capital distribution is required if any of the following conditions are
present: the institution would not be adequately-capitalized after the
distribution, its examination ratings are not at least satisfactory or it is
considered a problem association or in troubled condition, the total amount of
all its capital distributions for the applicable calendar year (including the
proposed distribution) would exceed its net income for that year to date plus
its retained net income for the prior two years, or the distribution would
violate an applicable prohibition or OTS imposed condition on the institution.
A 30-day advance notice is required if, as is the case with the Bank, the
institution is a subsidiary of a holding company, the institution would not be
well-capitalized after the distribution, or the distribution would reduce the
amount of or retire any part of its common or preferred stock or retire any
part of a debt instrument included in total capital (other than through a
regular payment on the instrument). If none of the above conditions are
present, an institution is not required to file an application or notice with
the OTS before making a capital

distribution. See "Business--Regulation and Supervision--Savings and Loan
Holding Company Regulation--Payment of Dividends and Other Capital
Distributions by Bank."

  The Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company is also subject to
restriction arising from the existence of the liquidation account established
upon the conversion of the Bank from mutual to stock form in December 1993.
The Bank is not permitted to pay dividends to the Company if its regulatory
capital would be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation
account. See "Business--Regulation and Supervision--Savings and Loan Holding
Company Regulation--Payment of Dividends and Other Capital Distributions by
Bank."

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

  At June 30, 2000 the Company had total assets of $1.2 billion, total
deposits of $808.2 million and stockholders' equity of $88.0 million compared
to total assets of $1.0 billion, total deposits of $677.8 million and
stockholders' equity of $81.3 million at June 30, 1999. These changes
represent a 18.60% increase in total assets and a 8.28% increase in
stockholders' equity during fiscal 2000.

  The southern California economy and real estate markets in the Company's
lending area have remained strong during the year. The Company's level of
nonperforming assets declined from June 30, 1999, both in total dollar amount
and as a percentage of total assets. The Company currently includes nonaccrual
loans 60 or more days past due (less any specific allowances on these loans),
troubled debt restructured loans and REO in determining its level of
nonperforming assets. At June 30, 2000, the Company reported $4.4 million in
nonperforming assets compared to $7.5 million and $9.8 million at June 30,
1999 and 1998, respectively. The Company recorded a provision for loan losses
of $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2000 compared to $1.7 million and
$1.5 million for the years ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. See
"Business--Allowances for Loan and Real Estate Losses."

Results of Operations

  General. The Company reported net earnings of $11.8 million, $2.23 per share
diluted, for the year ended June 30, 2000, compared to net earnings of $9.6
million, $1.70 per share diluted, and $6.6 million, $1.14 per share diluted,
for the years ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. This increase in
earnings for fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily attributable to
an increase in net interest income partially offset by an increase in other
expenses. Net earnings for fiscal 2000 also includes $400,000 of recaptured
accrued taxes as a result of a favorable tax audit ruling. Without this tax
recapture, net earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 would have
been $11.4 million, $2.15 per share diluted, representing a 26% increase in
earnings per share over the previous year. The increase in earnings in fiscal
1999 over 1998 was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest
income and an increase in noninterest income due primarily to the one-time
gain on sale of securities, partially offset by an increase in total other
expense.

  Interest Income. Interest income was $84.5 million, $71.9 million and $64.9
million for the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. The
$12.6 million increase in interest income in 2000 compared to 1999 resulted
from an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $168.1
million while the average yield on interest-earnings assets decreased 0.08% to
7.87%. The $7.0 million increase in interest income in 1999 compared to 1998
resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of
$83.1 million while the average yield on interest earning assets increased
0.05 to 7.95%.

  Interest Expense. Interest expense was $48.9 million, $40.3 million, and
$39.1 million for the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.
The $8.6 million increase in 2000 compared to 1999 resulted from an increase
in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $160.3 million and
an increase in the average cost on interest-bearing liabilities of 0.07% to
5.04%. The $1.2 million increase in 1999 compared to 1998 resulted from an
increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of
$70.2 million and partially offset by a decrease in the average cost on
interest-bearing liabilities of 0.32% to 4.97%.

  Net Interest Income Before Provision for Loan Losses. Net interest income
before provision for loan losses was $35.6 million, $31.6 million, and $25.8
million for the years ended June 30, 2000,

                                      42
<PAGE>

1999, and 1998, respectively. The increase in 2000 compared to 1999 was
primarily a result of the increase in interest-earning assets relative to
interest-bearing liabilities during the year partially offset by the decrease
in the yield on interest-earning assets and an increase in the cost of
interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in 1999 compared to 1998 was
primarily a result of the increase in interest-earning assets relative to
interest-bearing liabilities, as well as a decrease in the cost of interest-
bearing liabilities.

  Provision for Loan Losses. During fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998 the Company
established $1.6 million, $1.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of
provisions for losses on loans. The slight decrease in the provision for 2000
is primarily a result of the continued decrease in nonperforming assets during
the year. The slight increase in the provision for fiscal 1999 compared to
1998 was primarily a result of the overall growth in the loan portfolio as
compared to the prior year, specifically in commercial real estate. In
addition, certain one-to-four family loans purchased during fiscal 1999 were
considered by the Company to have higher risk characteristics because they are
loans outside of California, which has historically been considered the
Company's primary market area for one-to-four family loans. Management
considers the level of nonperforming assets, the regional economic conditions
and relevant real estate values and other factors when assessing the adequacy
of the allowance for loan losses. The southern California economy and real
estate markets in the Company's primary lending area continued to be strong
during fiscal 2000, and management considers the level of allowance for loan
losses at June 30, 2000 to be adequate. However, even though the local economy
and real estate markets were strong during fiscal 2000, there can be no
assurance that nonperforming assets will not increase and that the Company
will not have to establish additional loss provisions based upon future
events.

  Other Income. Other income increased slightly in 2000 to $4.7 million
compared to $4.6 million in 1999. Deposit fees increased to $1.6 million for
2000 compared to $1.1 million for 1999, a 47.84% increase as a result of a
continued program, that began in the second quarter of fiscal 1998, with
efforts to attract checking accounts as well as a larger deposit base. In
addition, other income for fiscal 1999 reflected gains on sale of securities
of $616,000 compared to none in fiscal 2000. Other income increased by $1.3
million in fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal 1998. This increase was due to
the $616,000 gain on sale of securities as well as transactional fee income
for deposits and loans increasing due to a larger deposit and loan base and
prepayment fees on loans increased due to a higher level of loans paying off
in order to refinance in the lower rate environment during that time period.

  Other Expense. Other expense increased $1.2 million, or 6.62%, from $17.5
million in fiscal 1999 to $18.7 million in fiscal 2000. This increase in other
expense is primarily due to an increase in compensation and employee benefits
and occupancy expense. These increases during fiscal 2000 are primarily a
result of three retail banking branches opened during the year and the
purchase of a branch facility and its deposits from another financial
institution. Included in compensation and employee benefits are expenses
related to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP"). Companies that
established an ESOP after 1992 are required to account for the expense of the
ESOP at the fair value of the related shares released. The expense related to
the ESOP was $1.0 million, $1.0 million, and $1.1 million for the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

  Other expense increased $1.8 million, or 11.40%, from $15.7 million in
fiscal 1998 to $17.5 million in fiscal 1999. The increase was primarily due to
the opening of additional retail banking branches during February 1998, the
relocation of an existing branch to a larger more accessible location in
August 1998 and additional staffing in the income property lending department
of the Company.

</TABLE>

  Income Taxes. Income taxes increased by $865,000 from $7.5 million in fiscal
1999 to $8.3 million in fiscal 2000. Income taxes increased by $2.2 million
from $5.3 million in fiscal 1998 to $7.5 million in fiscal 1999. The effective
tax rate was 41.48%, 43.89% and 44.49% for the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2000 as
compared to 1999 is primarily a result of a $400,000 recapture of accrued
taxes due to a favorable tax audit ruling. The decrease in the effective tax
rate for 1999 as compared to 1998 is primarily a result of ESOP expense as a
percentage of net earnings before income taxes being lower in fiscal 1999 due
to the increase in net earnings before income taxes.

  Extraordinary Item and Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting
Principle. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, the Company prepaid
approximately $8.0 million of its higher cost borrowings and replaced the
funds with less expensive borrowings and retail deposits. In association with
the debt prepayment, the Company paid a prepayment fee of $61,000, after tax.
The prepayment fee is disclosed as an extraordinary item on the statement of
earnings. The Company implemented SFAS No. 133 effective July 1, 1998. Upon
implementation, approximately $78.0 million in MBS were reclassified from held
to maturity to available for sale. The Company has accounted for the gains or
losses on the sale of any such reclassified MBS sold within 90 days of the
reclassification date as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle. Any gains or losses recorded on such reclassified securities sold
90 days or more after the reclassification date have been recorded as gain or
losses on sale of securities available for sale. In the first quarter of 1999,
the Company sold $29.6 million of these reclassified MBS for a gain after tax
of $162,000.

Financial Condition

  The Company's consolidated assets totaled $1.2 billion at June 30, 2000,
compared to $1.0 billion at June 30, 1999. Stockholders' equity totaled $88.0
million at June 30, 2000 compared to $81.3 million at June 30, 1999. The
increase in assets is primarily attributable to the implementation of the
Company's growth strategies and was primarily funded by deposit growth and
FHLB advances.

  Loans and MBS (including assets held or available for sale) increased to
$1.1 billion at June 30, 2000, from $938.1 million at June 30, 1999. Loans
originated and purchased for investment were $299.2 million for the year ended
June 30, 2000, compared to $276.4 million for the same period the previous
year. MBS purchased for investment decreased to $12.0 million at June 30,
2000, from $70.6 million for the same period the previous year.

  At June 30, 2000, the Company's multifamily loan portfolio totaled $505.4
million, or 49.20% of total loans, an increase of 29.07% as compared to $391.6
million at June 30, 1999, and its commercial loan portfolio totaled $196.5
million, or 19.13% of total loans, an increase of 39.92% as compared to $140.4
million at June 30, 1999. Of the Company's $139,000 of charge-offs in fiscal
2000, $125,000 or 81.93% were for one-to-four family loans and none were
multifamily or for commercial real estate loans. The Company's commercial loan
portfolio increased significantly during the past fiscal year,

                                      44
<PAGE>

increasing by approximately 39.92%. Both because the size of the commercial
real estate loan portfolio has increased significantly and most of the loans
comprising the portfolio are unseasoned, having been originated within the
last three fiscal years, the Company's past loss experience with respect to
its commercial loan portfolio may not be representative of the risk of loss in
such portfolio in the future. See "Business--Allowances for Loan and Real
Estate Losses." Multifamily and commercial real estate loans are generally
considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk and to be more vulnerable
to deteriorating economic conditions than one-to-four family residential
mortgage loans. These loans typically involve higher loan principal amounts
and the repayment of such loans generally depend on the income produced by the
operation or sale of the property being sufficient to cover operating expenses
and debt service. Even though the southern California real estate market was
healthy in fiscal 2000, recessionary economic conditions of the type that have
prevailed in recent years in the Company's lending market area tend to result
in higher vacancy and reduced rental rates and net operating incomes from
multifamily and commercial real estate properties. See "Business--Lending
Activities--Multifamily Lending" and "--Commercial Real Estate Lending."

  Loan sales decreased to $48.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2000,
compared to $64.0 million for the same period ended June 30, 1999. The
decrease in loan sales is primarily a result of a decrease in funding of
fixed-rate loans during a period of higher interest rates during fiscal 2000
compared to 1999. These fixed rate loans were generally held for sale during
this period. Loans serviced for others increased to $299.1 million at June 30,
2000 from $284.2 million at June 30, 1999 primarily due to a lower rate of
loan prepayments in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

 Regulatory Capital Requirements

  FIRREA and implementing OTS capital regulations require the Bank to maintain
certain minimum tangible, core and risk-based regulatory capital levels. The
minimum core capital requirement is 4% for all but the highest rated savings
associations. See "Business--Regulation and Supervision--Regulatory Capital
Requirements."

  The following table summarizes the regulatory capital requirements for the
Bank at June 30, 2000. As indicated in the table, the Bank's capital levels
exceed all three of the currently applicable minimum capital requirements.

  In addition, FDICIA required the OTS to implement a system of regulatory
sanctions against institutions that are not adequately capitalized, with the
sanctions growing more severe the lower the institution's capital. Under
FDICIA, the OTS issued regulations establishing five separate
capital categories: "well capitalized." "adequately capitalized,"
"undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized," and "critically
undercapitalized," differentiated by core capital ratio, level of core capital
to risk-weighted assets and risk-based capital ratio. See "Business--
Regulation and Supervision--Prompt Corrective Action Requirements."

  An institution is treated as "well capitalized" if its core capital ratio to
adjusted total assets is at least 5%, its ratio of core capital to risk-
weighted assets is at least 6% and its total capital to risk-

                                      45
<PAGE>

weighted assets ratio is at least 10%. The following table summarizes the
capital ratios of the "well capitalized" category and the Bank's regulatory
capital at June 30, 2000 as compared to such ratios. As indicated in the
table, the Bank's capital levels exceeded the three minimum capital ratios of
the "well capitalized" category.

  For the year ended June 30, 2000 a total of 380,500 shares had been
repurchased under previously announced plans to repurchase Company stock. Up
to 270,000 additional shares could be repurchased in the future under current
board authorization.

 Sources of Funds and Liquidity

  Sources of capital and liquidity for the Company on a stand-alone basis
include distributions from the Bank. Dividends and other capital distributions
from the Bank are subject to regulatory restrictions. See "Business--
Regulation and Supervision--Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation--
Payment of Dividends and Other Capital Distributions by Bank" and "Market for
the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters."

  The Bank's primary sources of funds in fiscal 2000 were deposits, FHLB
advances, principal and interest payments on loans and proceeds from the sale
of loans. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable
sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly
influenced by interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The Bank
also has other potential sources of liquidity, such as securities sold under
agreements to repurchase and liquidating existing short-term assets.

  The Bank has continued to maintain the required minimum levels of liquid
assets as defined by OTS regulations. This requirement, which may be varied at
the direction of the OTS depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows,
is based upon a percentage of deposits and short-term borrowings. The required
ratio is currently 4%. The Bank's average liquidity ratios were 4.33%, 4.49%,
and 4.12%, at June 30, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Management
currently attempts to maintain a liquidity ratio as close to the minimum as
possible. Liquidity levels reflect management's strategy to invest excess
liquidity in higher yielding interest-earning assets such as loans or MBS.

  The Company's cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications:
cash flows from operating activities, cash flows used by investing activities
and financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities consisted
primarily of cash flows from the sale of loans held for sale which totaled
$48.9 million, $64.0 million, and $34.3 million for fiscal 2000, 1999, and
1998, respectively. The Company originated loans for sale of $53.0 million,
$73.7 million, and $41.3 million during fiscal years 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively. Net cash used by investing activities consisted primarily of
loan originations, loan purchases and investment purchases, offset by
principal collections on loans and proceeds from principal reductions on MBS
and maturities of other investment securities. Loans originated and purchased
for investment were $299.2 million, $276.4 million, and $143.4 million for
fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Proceeds from principal repayments
on loans were

                                      46
<PAGE>

$127.3 million, $145.6 million and $91.8 million for fiscal years ended 2000,
1999, and 1998. Proceeds from maturities and principal payments of investment
securities were $2.9 million, $9.1 million, and $31.6 million for fiscal years
ended 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Net cash used by financing
activities consisting primarily of net activity in deposit accounts and
proceeds from funding and repayments of FHLB advances. The net change in
deposits was an increase of $130.4 million, $96.9 million, and $27.7 million
for fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. During the second quarter of
fiscal 2000 the Bank purchased a retail branch office and its $45.9 million of
deposits from another financial institution. This branch is located in Rowland
Heights, California. The Bank also opened three "in-store" branches in Wal-
Mart stores, the nation's largest retailer, during the second half of fiscal
2000. A fourth Wal-Mart in-store branch was opened in August 2000 with plans
to open, at least, two additional Wal-Mart "in-store" branches later in fiscal
2001. All of the Bank's existing and planned Wal-Mart "in-store" branches are
located in the southern California area. In addition, while the vast majority
of the Bank's deposits are retail in nature, the Bank accepted $55 million in
time deposits from a political subdivision during fiscal 2000. The Bank
considers these funds to be wholesale deposits and an alternative borrowing
source rather than a customer relationship and their levels are determined by
management's decision as to the most economic funding sources. The net
proceeds from FHLB advances were $55.6 million, $18.7 million, and $53.3
million for fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

  Due to the Company's growth strategies and increased competition for retail
deposits in fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, the Company's use of FHLB advances
increased. At June 30, 2000, the Company had $290.3 million (26.06% of total
liabilities) in advances outstanding from the FHLB compared to $234.7 million
(25.18% of total liabilities) at June 30, 1999. The maximum amount of advances
that the Company had outstanding at any month-end was $312.1 million.
Management anticipates increased borrowing from the FHLB again in fiscal 2001.
See "Business--Sources and Funds--Borrowings."

  The Company's most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The
levels of these assets are dependent on the Company's operating, financing,
lending and investing activities during any given period. At June 30, 2000,
cash and short-term investments totaled $14.1 million, a decrease of 57.40%
from $33.1 million at June 30, 1999.

  At June 30, 2000, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans
of $15.0 million and no commitments to purchase loans. At June 30, 2000, the
Company had $25.5 million of approved undisbursed lines of credit. The Company
anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current
loan origination and purchase commitments. Certificates of deposits which have
contractual maturities in one year or less from June 30, 2000, totaled
$511.2 million. If a significant portion of the maturing certificates are not
renewed at maturity, the Company's other sources of liquidity include FHLB
advances, principal and interest payments on loans, proceeds from loan sales
and other borrowings, such as repurchase transactions. The Company could also
choose to pay higher rates to maintain maturing deposits, which could result
in increased cost of funds. Historically, the Company has maintained a
significant portion of maturing deposits. While management anticipates that
there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the current
competitive rate environment, these are not expected to have a material impact
on the long-term liquidity position of the Company.

Asset/Liability Management

  The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the
extent to which such assets and liabilities are "interest rate sensitive" and
by monitoring an institution's interest-rate sensitivity "gap." An asset or
liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period
if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate
sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-
earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time

                                      47
<PAGE>

period and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing
within that time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of
interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive
liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate
sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets.
During a period of falling interest rates therefore, the net earnings of an
institution with a positive gap theoretically may be adversely affected due to
its interest-earning assets repricing to a greater extent than its interest-
bearing liabilities. Conversely, during a period of rising interest rates,
theoretically, the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap position
may increase as it is able to invest in higher yielding interest-earning
assets at a more rapid rate than its interest-bearing liabilities reprice. In
addition, a positive gap may not protect an institution with a large portfolio
of ARM loans from increases in interest rates for extended time periods as
such instruments generally have periodic and lifetime interest rate caps.
Additionally, the Company's ARM loans are predominantly tied to COFI, a
lagging market index, and rapid increases in interest rates could have a
negative impact on the Company's earnings. Accordingly, interest rates and the
resulting cost of funds increases in a rapidly increasing rate environment
could exceed the cap levels on these instruments and negatively impact net
interest income. Declining interest rates have, in general, benefited the
Company primarily due to the effect of the lagging market index which has
resulted in interest income declining at a slower rate than interest expense.

  At June 30, 2000, the Company's total interest-earning assets maturing or
repricing within one year exceeded its total interest-bearing liabilities
maturing or repricing in the same time by $60.6 million, representing a one
year cumulative positive gap ratio of 5.04%. This compares to $4.3 million at
June 30, 1999, which represented a positive GAP ratio of 0.42%.

This increase in the one year cumulative GAP ratio is primarily a result of
the following:

   .  a significant amount of financing activity during the fiscal year in
      adjustable rate loans.

   .  The extension of the assumed repricing period of the Company's money
      market deposit accounts. This is consistent with the Company's actual
      experience with these accounts over the past fiscal year.

The Company manages the resulting interest rate risk by extending the
maturities of various liabilities such as FHLB advances and retail
certificates of deposit.

  The Company closely monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to
its operational strategies. The Bank's Board of Directors has established an
Asset/Liability Committee, responsible for reviewing its asset/liability
policies and interest rate risk position, which generally meets weekly and
reports to the Board of Directors on interest rate risk and trends on a
quarterly basis. The Company's cumulative gap position is at a level
satisfactory to management. There can be no assurances that the Company will
be able to maintain its positive gap position or that its strategies will not
result in a negative gap position in the future. The level of the movement of
interest rates, up or down, is an uncertainty and could have a negative impact
on the earnings of the Company.

  The Company does not currently engage in the use of trading activities, high
risk derivatives and synthetic instruments or hedging activities in
controlling its interest rate risk. Such uses are permitted at the
recommendation of the Asset/Liability Committee with the approval of the Board
of Directors, however, the Company does not anticipate engaging in such
practices in the immediate future.

  The following table sets forth the amounts of interest-earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at June 30, 2000, which are
anticipated by the Company, based upon certain assumptions, to reprice or
mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, the
amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a
particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to
repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability. Specifically,
the Company assumed a prepayment rate ranging from 6% to 18% on ARM

                                      48
<PAGE>

loans, and 6% to 15% on fixed rate loans. Additionally, the Company utilized
deposit decay rate assumptions of 50% for passbook accounts, 15.8% for
checking accounts and 10% to 50% for money market deposit accounts in the one
year or less category. The range of decay rates for money market deposit
accounts is due to the market rate sensitivity of various money market
checking accounts. These decay rates are based upon the Company's historical
experience, but there is no assurance that the assumed rates will correspond
to future rates. For information regarding the contractual maturities of the
Company's loans, investments and deposits, see "Business--Lending Activities,"
"--Investment Activities" and "--Sources of Funds."

  Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the
foregoing table. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have
similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different
degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on
certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in
market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind
changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as ARM loans, have
features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and
over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest
rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate
significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Finally, the
ability of many borrowers to service their ARM loans may decrease in the event
of an interest rate increase.

Average Balance Sheet

  The following table sets forth certain information relating to the Company
for the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999, and 1998. The yields and costs are
derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or
liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown except where noted otherwise.
Average balances are derived from average month-end balances. Management does
not believe that the use of average monthly balances instead of average daily
balances has caused any material differences in the information presented. The

discontinued accruing interest. The yields and costs include fees which are
considered adjustments to yields.

  Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table presents the extent to which
changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets
and interest-bearing liabilities have affected the Company's interest income
and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in
each category with respect to (i) changes attributable to changes in volume
(changes in volume multiplied by prior rate), (ii) changes attributable to
changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume), and (iii) the
net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate
have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the
changes due to rate.

Year 2000

  Beginning in 1997, the Company developed and implemented a program to make
its systems and processes Year 2000 compliant. The Company's Year 2000 program
included the preparation of a plan and a contingency plan as required by the
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council as well as the testing and
replacement of information technology assets ("IT assets"), such as computer
hardware, software and systems, and non-IT assets.

  As of the date of this report, the Company has experienced no material
disruption in the operation of its business as a result of the transition from
1999 to 2000. However, it is possible that the full impact of Year 2000 issues
has not been fully recognized, and no assurances can be given that Year 2000
problems will not emerge.

  The total cost of the Company's Year 2000 program was approximately $1.5
million, including approximately $330,000 incurred in the year ended June 30,
2000. Program costs consisted primarily of costs for acquiring equipment and
software, which are being depreciated over their useful lives, and personnel
and consulting costs, which were expensed as incurred. The Company has funded
these Year 2000 expenditures primarily through operating cash flow.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices

  The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto presented herein
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the measurement of
financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars
without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over
time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased
cost of the Company's operations. Unlike industrial companies, nearly all of
the assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. As a result,
interest rates have a greater impact on the Company's performance than do the
effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move
in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and
services. See "Market Risk" and "--Asset/Liability Management."

Impact of New Accounting Standards

  In March 2000, the FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation. This Interpretation clarifies
certain issues relating to APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. FASB Interpretation No. 44 contains information relating to (a) the
definition of employee for purposes of applying Opinion 25, (b) the criteria
for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non-compensatory plan, (c) the
accounting consequence of various modifications to the term of a previously
fixed stock option or award, and (d) the accounting for an exchange of stock
compensation awards in a business combination. FASB Interpretation No. 44 is
effective July 1, 2000. The effects of applying this Interpretation are
recognized on a prospective basis from July 1, 2000.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

  Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and
rates. The Company's market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk
inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities. To that end, management
actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure. The Company
does not currently engage in trading activities.

                                      54
<PAGE>

  The Company's profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A
sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact the
Company's earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and
liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent, or on the
same basis. The Company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on
its net interest income using several tools. One measure of the Company's
exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and
liabilities is shown in the Company's Maturity and Rate Sensitivity Analysis
under the caption "MD&A--Asset/Liability Management." Another measure,
required to be performed by OTS-regulated institutions, is the test specified
by OTS Thrift Bulletin No. 13a, "Interest Rate Risk Management." This test
measures the impact on net interest income and on net portfolio value of an
immediate change in interest rates in 100 basis point increments. Net
portfolio value is defined as the net present value of assets, liabilities,
and off-balance sheet contracts. Following are the estimated impacts of
immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels at June 30, 2000,
calculated in compliance with Thrift Bulletin No. 13a:

(1) The percentage change in this column represents net interest income for 12
    months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest
    income in the various rate scenarios.

(2) The percentage change in this column represents net portfolio value of the
    Bank in a stable interest rate environment versus the net portfolio value
    in the various rate scenarios.

  The Company's primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to
minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the Company's net
interest income and capital, while structuring the Company's asset-liability
structure to obtain the maximum yield-cost spread on that structure. The
Company relies primarily on its asset-liability structure to control interest
rate risk.

  The Company continually evaluates interest rate risk management
opportunities, including the use of derivative financial instruments.
Management has focused its efforts on increasing the Company's yield-cost
spread through wholesale and retail growth opportunities.

are generally defined as on- and off-balance sheet derivatives and other
financial instruments.

(1) Loans are reduced for nonperforming loans but are not reduced for the
    allowance for loan losses.

(2) Total balance equals the notional amount of off-balance sheet items and
    interest rates are the weighted average interest rates of the underlying
    loans.

  Expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for prepayments of
principal. The Company uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and
expected maturities. For assets, expected maturities are based upon
contractual maturity, projected repayments and prepayments of principal. The
prepayment experience reflected herein is based on the Company's historical
experience. The Company's average Constant Prepayment Rate ("CPR") on its
total fixed-rate portfolio ranges from 6% to 15% and on its adjustable rate
portfolio from 6% to 18% for interest-earning assets (excluding investment
securities, which do not have prepayment features). For deposit liabilities,
in accordance with standard industry practice and the Company's own historical
experience, "decay factors," were used to estimate deposit runoff of 50%,
15.8%, and between 10% to 50% for passbook, checking and money market deposit
accounts, respectively. The actual maturities of these instruments could vary
substantially if future prepayments differ from the Company's historical
experience.

                         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors
Quaker City Bancorp, Inc.:

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial
condition of Quaker City Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
June 30, 2000 and 1999 and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2000. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Quaker
City Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2000 and 1999 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended June 30, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                            June 30, 2000 and 1999

(1) Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

  Quaker City Bancorp, Inc., incorporated in Delaware, is primarily engaged in
the savings and loan business through its wholly owned subsidiary, Quaker City
Bank (the Bank). At June 30, 2000, the Bank operated fourteen retail banking
offices in southern California. The Bank is subject to significant competition
from other financial institutions, and is also subject to the regulations of
various government agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those
regulatory authorities.

  The following accounting policies, together with those disclosed elsewhere
in the consolidated financial statements, represent the significant accounting
policies of the Company.

 Principles of Consolidation and Presentation

  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Quaker City
Bancorp, Inc., Quaker City Neighborhood Development, Inc., Quaker City Bank
and its wholly owned subsidiary, Quaker City Financial Corporation. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years'
consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year's
presentation.

  These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing the consolidated
financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of
the statement of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the
periods. The most significant estimate for the Company relates to the
allowance for loan losses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 Financial Instruments

  Accounting Standards require the disclosure of the fair value of financial
instruments, whether or not recognized on the statement of financial
condition, for which it is practicable to estimate the value. A significant
portion of the Company's assets and liabilities are financial instruments as
defined under applicable accounting standards. Fair values, estimates and
assumptions are set forth in note 18, Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

 Risks Associated with Financial Instruments

  The credit risk of a financial instrument is the possibility that a loss may
result from the failure of another party to perform in accordance with the
terms of the contract. The most significant credit risk associated with the
Company's financial instruments is concentrated in its loans receivable.
Additionally, the Company is subject to credit risk on certain loans sold with
recourse. The Company has established a system for monitoring the level of
credit risk in its loan portfolio and for loans sold with recourse.

  Concentrations of credit risk would exist for groups of borrowers when they
have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet
contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or
other conditions. The ability of the Company's borrowers to repay their
commitments is contingent on several factors, including the economic
conditions in the borrowers' geographic area and the individual financial
condition of the borrowers. The Company generally

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)
requires collateral or other security to support borrower commitments on loans
receivable. This collateral may take several forms. Generally, on the
Company's mortgage loans, the collateral will be the underlying mortgaged
property. The Company's lending activities are primarily concentrated in
southern California.

  Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and
rates. The Company's market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk
inherent in its lending, investing and deposit taking activities. To that end,
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure. The
Company does not currently engage in trading activities. The Company is
subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest-earning assets
reprice on a different frequency or schedule than its interest-bearing
liabilities. A majority of the Company's loans receivable and mortgage-backed
securities reprice based on the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Index (COFI).
The repricing of COFI tends to lag other interest rate indices. The Company
closely monitors the pricing sensitivity of its financial instruments.

  For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash
and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits and Federal funds sold and other
short-term investments. Generally, Federal funds sold and short-term
investments are held for one-day periods. The amounts included in cash and
cash equivalents and qualifying investment securities generally constitute the
Company's liquidity portfolio. The Company maintains liquidity to satisfy
regulatory requirements. The liquidity portfolio is managed in a manner
intended to maximize flexibility and yield, while minimizing interest rate
risk, credit risk and the cost of the capital required to be maintained for
such assets.

 Assets Held or Available for Sale

  The Company identifies those loans, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and
investment securities for which it does not have the positive intent and
ability to hold to maturity. If management has the positive intent and the
Company has the ability to hold such assets until maturity, they are
classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized historical cost.
Securities that are to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended
to be held to maturity are generally classified as available for sale and are
carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings
and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of income
tax effect. However, if a decline in fair value is determined to be other than
temporary, the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair
value as a new cost basis, and the amount of the writedown is included in
earnings. Gains and losses from the sales of MBS and investment securities
available for sale are recognized at the time of sale and are determined by
the specific-identification method. Premiums and discounts on MBS and
investment securities available for sale are amortized utilizing the interest
method over the contractual terms of the assets. Loans held for sale are
carried at the lower of amortized historical cost or fair value as determined
on an aggregate basis. Assets held for indefinite periods of time include
assets that management intends to use as part of its asset/liability
management strategy and that may be sold in response to changes in interest
rates, resultant prepayment risk and other factors.

 Assets Held to Maturity

  Loans, MBS and investment securities, excluding those held or available for
sale, are carried at amortized historical cost, adjusted for amortization of
premiums and discounts utilizing the interest method over the contractual
terms of the assets. The carrying value of these assets is not adjusted for

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)
temporary declines in fair value since the Company has the positive intent and
ability to hold them to maturity. If a decline in the fair value of securities
is determined to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the individual
security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of
the writedown is included in earnings.

 Interest Income on Loans Receivable

  Interest income on loans receivable is accrued as it is earned. The Company
defers and amortizes both loan origination fees and the incremental direct
costs relating to the origination of loans held to maturity. Loan origination
fees and incremental direct loan origination costs on loans held for sale are
deferred and included in the computation of gain or loss upon sale of the
loans. The deferred origination fees and costs on loans held to maturity are
amortized into interest income utilizing the interest method over the lives of
the related loans. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status after being
delinquent 60 days, or earlier if the ultimate collectibility of the accrual
is in doubt. Whenever the accrual of interest is stopped, previously accrued
but uncollected interest income is reversed. Thereafter, interest is
recognized only as cash is received until the loan is reinstated. Accretion of
discounts and deferred loan fees is discontinued when loans are placed on
nonaccrual status.

 Allowance for Loan Losses

  The allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount management
considers adequate to cover estimated losses on loans receivable which are
deemed probable and estimable. The allowance is based upon a number of
factors, including asset classifications, economic trends, industry experience
and trends, industry and geographic concentrations, estimated collateral
values, management's assessment of credit risk inherent in the portfolio,
historical loss experience and the Company's underwriting practices. As a
result of weaknesses in certain real estate markets, increases in the
allowance for loan losses may be required in future periods. In addition,
various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process,
periodically review the Bank's allowance for loan losses. These agencies may
require the Bank to establish additional valuation allowances, based on their
judgments of the information available at the time of the examination.

 Impaired Loans

  A loan is considered impaired when based on current circumstances and
events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts
due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Creditors are
required to measure impairment of a loan based on any one of the following:
(i) the present value of expected future cash flows from the loan discounted
at the loan's effective interest rate, (ii) an observable market price or
(iii) the fair value of the loan's underlying collateral. The Company measures
impairment based on the fair value of the loan's underlying collateral
property. Impaired loans exclude large groups of smaller balance homogeneous
loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment. For the Company, loans
collectively reviewed for impairment include all loans with principal balances
of less than $300,000.

  Factors considered as part of the periodic loan review process to determine
whether a loan is impaired address both the amount the Company believes is
probable that it will collect and the timing of such collection. As part of
the Company's loan review process, the Company will consider such factors as
the ability of the borrower to continue to meet the debt service requirements,
assessments of other sources of repayment, the fair value of any collateral
and the creditor's prior history in dealing with these types of credits. In
evaluating whether a loan is considered impaired, insignificant delays in
payment,

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)
(less than 12 months) in the absence of other facts and circumstances would
not alone lead to the conclusion that a loan was impaired.

  The Company recognizes impairment on troubled collateral dependent loans by
creating a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance is maintained while
the loans are still in process of collection. At such time that the assets are
deemed uncollectible, the loss is charged to the valuation allowance.

 Loan Sales and Servicing

  The Company sells loans and participations in loans with yield rates to the
investors based upon current market rates. Gain or loss on the sale of loans
is recognized to the extent that the selling prices differ from the carrying
value of the loans sold based on the estimated relative fair values of the
assets sold and any retained interests, less any liabilities incurred. The
assets obtained on sale are generally loan servicing assets. Liabilities
incurred in a sale may include recourse obligations or servicing liabilities.

  The Company may also purchase mortgage servicing assets related to mortgage
loans originated by other institutions. These mortgage servicing assets are
measured initially at fair value, presumptively the price paid. The servicing
asset is amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net
servicing income and is assessed for impairment or increased obligation based
on its fair value.

 Real Estate Held for Sale

  Real estate acquired through foreclosure (REO) is initially recorded at fair
value at the date of foreclosure, less costs of disposition. Fair value is
determined by an appraisal obtained at the time of foreclosure. Thereafter, if
there is a further deterioration in value, the Company writes down the REO
directly and charges operations for the diminution in value.

  Real estate held for development is carried at the lower of cost or net
realizable value. All costs of anticipated disposition are considered in the
determination of net realizable value.

  Revenue recognition on the disposition of real estate is dependent upon the
transaction meeting certain criteria relating to the nature of the property
sold and the terms of sale.

 Depreciation and Amortization

  Depreciation is computed utilizing the straight-line method over the
estimated lives of the assets. Amortization of leasehold improvements is
computed utilizing the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated
useful life of the assets or the terms of the respective leases.

 Earnings per Share

  The Company reports both basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic
earnings per share is determined by dividing net income by the average number
of shares of common stock outstanding, while diluted earnings per share is
determined by dividing net income by the average number of shares of common
stock outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock
equivalents.

 Income Taxes

  A deferred tax liability is recognized for taxable temporary differences
(differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in future
taxable amounts). A deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible
temporary differences (differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will
result in deductible amounts in future years when the financial statement
carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities are recovered and settled) and
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The likelihood of realizing the
tax benefits related to a potential deferred tax asset is evaluated and a
valuation allowance is recognized to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is
more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will
not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the
beginning and end of the year; the change in the sum of the deferred tax
asset, valuation allowance and deferred tax liability during the year
generally is recognized as deferred tax expense or benefit. The effect on
deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
for which the change becomes effective.

 Stock Option Plans

  The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees" ("APB 25"), the intrinsic value method, to account for stock based
compensation. In accordance with the SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation", the Company includes pro forma disclosures reflecting the
impact of the fair value method on net earnings and earnings per share for
stock options granted.

 Segment Information and Disclosures

  Accounting standards require the Company to report information about
operating segments in annual financial statements and requires reporting of
selected information about operating segments in interim reports to
stockholders. These standards also require disclosures about products and
services, geographic areas and major customers. The Company has concluded it
has one reportable segment.

 Derivatives

  The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." A
derivative is considered either an asset or liability in the statement of
financial position and measured at fair value. If a derivative is designated
as a hedging instrument the changes in fair value of the derivative are either
(a) recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the
offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item or (b) reported as a component of
other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when
the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For a derivative not designated
as a hedging instrument, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in
the period of change. As of June 30, 2000, the Company has no derivative
instruments.

  Upon implementation of SFAS No. 133 effective July 1, 1998, approximately
$78 million in MBS were transferred to available for sale. The Company has
accounted for the gains or losses on the sale of any such reclassified MBS
sold within 90 days of the reclassification date as the cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle. Any gains or losses recorded on such
reclassified securities sold 90 days or more after the reclassification date
have been recorded as gain or losses on sale of

securities available for sale. In the first quarter of 1999, the Company sold
$29.6 million of these reclassified MBS for a nonrecurring gain after tax of
$162,000, which is accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.
In the second quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company sold an additional $32.3
million of MBS for a pretax gain of $245,000 and an after tax gain of
$142,000. The pretax gain of $245,000 is included as a gain on sale of
securities available for sale in the accompanying consolidated statements of
earnings.

 Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements

  In March 2000, the FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation. This Interpretation clarifies
certain issues relating to APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. FASB Interpretation No. 44 contains information relating to (a) the
definition of employee for purposes of applying Opinion 25, (b) the criteria
for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non-compensatory plan, (c) the
accounting consequence of various modifications to the term of a previously
fixed stock option or award, and (d) the accounting for an exchange of stock
compensation awards in a business combination. FASB Interpretation No. 44 is
effective July 1, 2000. The effects of applying this Interpretation are
recognized on a prospective basis from July 1, 2000.

 Credit Risk and Concentration

  At June 30, 2000 and 1999, the balances of nonaccrual loans totaled $3.6
million and $5.0 million, respectively, net of specific allowances of $0 and
$68,000. The Company's nonaccrual policy requires that loans be placed on
nonaccrual status after being delinquent 60 days or earlier if warranted.
There were no accruing loans contractually past due 60 days or more at
June 30, 2000 and 1999.

  The gross amount of interest income on nonaccrual loans that would have been
recorded during the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998 if the nonaccrual
loans had been current in accordance with their original terms was $312,000,
$424,000 and $640,000, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999
and 1998, $247,000, $295,000 and $399,000, respectively, were actually earned
on nonaccrual loans and are included in interest income on loans in the
accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. Interest income earned on
nonaccrual loans is generally recorded utilizing the cash-basis method of
accounting.

  The Company's real estate loans are predominantly secured by properties
located in southern California.

million, respectively, and for the years then ended, interest income on such
loans totaled $126,000, $531,000 and $752,000, respectively. Interest income
on impaired loans which are performing is generally recorded utilizing the
cash-basis method of accounting. Payments received on impaired loans which are
performing under their contractual terms are allocated to principal and
interest in accordance with the terms of the loans. At June 30, 2000 all
impaired loans were performing in accordance with their contractual terms.
Impaired loans totaling $1.7 million were not performing in accordance with
their contractual terms at June 30, 1999 and have been included in nonaccrual
loans at that date.

  Impaired loans at June 30, 2000 included $1.7 million of loans for which
specific valuation allowances of $379,000 had been established. At June 30,
1999, the Company had $1.0 million of impaired loans for which specific
valuation allowances of $155,000 had been established and $2.5 million of such
loans for which no specific valuation allowance was considered necessary. All
such provisions for losses and any related recoveries are recorded as part of
the total allowance for loan losses.

  The Bank's tax bad debt reserve balance of approximately $10.9 million as of
June 30, 2000, will, in future years, be subject to recapture in whole or in
part upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a distribution to
stockholders in excess of the Bank's current and accumulated earnings and
profit, a redemption of shares or upon a partial or complete liquidation of
the Bank. The Bank does not intend to make distributions to stockholders that
would result in recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserve. Since
management intends to use the reserve only for the purpose for which it was
intended, a deferred tax liability of approximately $3.8 million has not been
recorded.

  The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at June 30,
2000 and 1999 are presented below:

amounts and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance
is then established to reduce that deferred tax asset to the level at which it
is "more likely than not" that the tax benefits will be realized. Realization
of tax benefits of deductible temporary differences and operating loss or tax
credit carryforwards depends on having sufficient taxable income of an
appropriate character within the carryback and carryforward periods. Sources
of taxable income that may allow for the realization of tax benefits include
(1) taxable income in the current year or prior years that is available
through carryback, (2) future taxable income, exclusive of the reversal of
existing temporary differences, that will result from the reversal of existing
taxable temporary differences and (3) future taxable income generated by
future operations. In addition, tax planning strategies may be available to
accelerate taxable income or deductions, change the character of taxable
income or deductions, or switch from tax-exempt to taxable investments so that
there will be sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character and in the
appropriate periods to allow for realization of the tax benefits. Management
believes that the above-described deferred tax assets are more likely than not
to be realized and, accordingly, has not established a valuation allowance for
the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999.

  Included in other assets are current taxes receivable of $1.4 million at
June 30, 1999.

  Included in other liabilities are current taxes payable of $282,000 and
$585,000 at June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

(11) Regulatory Capital and Earnings Per Share

     The Bank is required to maintain certain minimum levels of regulatory
capital as set forth by the OTS in capital standards applicable to all
thrifts. These capital standards include a core capital requirement, a
tangible capital requirement and a risk-based capital requirement. The Bank
exceeds all capital requirements at June 30, 2000, as shown in the following
table:

  The Federal Deposit Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 contains prompt
corrective action (PCA) provisions pursuant to which banks and savings
institutions are to be classified into one of five categories, based primarily
upon capital adequacy, and which require specific supervisory actions as
capital levels decrease. The OTS regulations implementing the PCA provisions
define the five capital categories. The following table sets forth the
definitions of the categories and the Bank's ratios as of June 30, 2000 and
1999:

  The OTS also has authority, after an opportunity for a hearing, to downgrade
an institution from well-capitalized to adequately capitalized, or to subject
an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to the supervisory
actions applicable to the next lower category, for supervisory concerns. At
June 30, 2000 and 1999, the Bank was a well-capitalized institution. There are
no conditions or events that management believes has changed the institution's
category under the capital guidelines.

 Dividends

  Savings association subsidiaries of holding companies generally are required
to provide their OTS District Director not less than 30 days' advance notice
of any proposed declaration of a dividend on the association's stock. Under
regulations adopted by the OTS, the insured institution's ability to declare
and pay a dividend to its holding company is subject to certain limitations.
The regulation establishes a three-tiered system of regulation, with the
greatest flexibility being afforded to well-capitalized associations. The Bank
is considered a well-capitalized institution for purposes of dividend
declarations. On May 19, 2000, the Bank declared a $1.0 million dividend
payable to the Company based on a $5.0 million total authorization by the
Board of Directors of the Bank. No dividends were declared or paid by the Bank
in 1999.

(12) Retirement Plans

 Defined Benefit/Cash Balance Plan

  The Bank maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (the
Plan). Employees become eligible to participate in the Plan upon attaining the
age of 21 and completing one year of service during which they have served a
minimum of 1,000 hours. Until December 31, 1999, the Plan was an income
replacement retirement plan. The benefits were based on years of service and
the three consecutive years of employment during which the participant earned
the highest compensation. Contributions were intended to provide not only for
benefits attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to be
earned in the future. Effective December 31, 1993, the Plan was frozen for
benefit service accrued, and employees hired after November 30, 1992 did not
participate in the Plan.

  Due to the December 31, 1993 freezing of participants' years of service
credited, the Board of Directors approved the conversion of the Plan into a
Cash Balance Plan effective January 1, 2000. Under the provisions of the Cash
Balance Plan, a cash balance account is established for each participant at
plan entry and increased over time with pay and interest credits. Pay credits
are equal to 5.0% of eligible pay and are credited to each participant's cash
balance account annually. Interest credits are based on ten-year Treasury Note
rates and are credited to a participant's cash balance account quarterly. At
termination of employment, a participant (if vested) becomes entitled to
receive his or her cash balance account in a single payment or have it
converted to a monthly annuity payable for life (or over a joint lifetime with
his or her beneficiary) at retirement. Employees are eligible to participate
in the Cash Balance Plan upon attaining the age of 21 and completing one year
of service during which they have served a minimum of 1,000 hours. Although
the Cash Balance Plan is intended to be an ERISA-qualified plan, the Bank has
not yet submitted the Cash Balance Plan for approval as such, due to the
recent Internal Revenue Service (IRS) moratorium on the consideration of cash
balance plans. The Bank has implemented the Cash Balance Plan, effective
January 1, 2000, on a provisional basis, and intends to apply for IRS approval
as soon as practicable.

  Plan assets, at fair value, are primarily comprised of government
obligations and short-term investments.

 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan

  The Bank has a supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan covering
specified employees. The benefits are based on employee compensation and
length of service and are offset by benefits provided by Social Security and
the Company's other qualified retirement plans.

  The following table sets forth the Plan's funded status and amounts
recognized in the Bank's consolidated statements of financial condition:

 Retirement Benefit Equalization Plan

  In conjunction with the conversion of the Bank's Defined Benefit Plan into a
Cash Balance Plan effective January 1, 2000, the SERP was converted into a
Retirement Benefit Equalization Plan (RBEP) for certain employees. The
Retirement Benefit Equalization Plan (RBEP) is a supplemental plan to the Cash
Balance Plan, 401(k) Plan, and ESOP and is intended to provide certain covered

employees with the total amount of retirement income that they would otherwise
receive under these plans if not for legislated ceilings in compliance with
certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code which limit retirement benefits
payable from qualified plans.

  Under the provisions of the RBEP, a cash balance account is established for
each participant at plan entry and increased over time with contribution and
interest credits. Contribution credits are equal to the amounts not
contributed under the qualified plans due to IRS limitations and are credited
to each participant's cash balance account annually.

  Interest credits are based on ten-year Treasury Note rates and are credited
to a participant's cash balance account quarterly.

  During 2000, the expense for this plan totaled $47,000. As this plan was
newly created, there were no expenses for this plan for 1999 or 1998.

 Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)

  The Company has established an ESOP for all employees who are age 21 or
older and have completed one year of service with the Bank during which they
have served a minimum of 1,000 hours. The ESOP is internally leveraged and
borrowed $3.1 million from the Company to purchase 10% of the outstanding
shares of the common stock of Quaker City Bancorp, Inc. issued in the original
conversion to common stock ownership. The loan will be repaid principally from
the Bank's discretionary contributions to the ESOP. In conjunction with the
conversion of the Bank's Defined Benefit Plan into a Cash Balance Plan
effective January 1, 2000, and the inclusion of all eligible employees as
participants in the Plan, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the
ESOP which allows the loan underlying the ESOP to be reamortized over a longer
period of time. ESOP participants will receive essentially the same benefit,
but the length of time by which it will be received will be extended from
September 2003 to December 2004. At June 30, 2000 and 1999, the outstanding
balance on the loan was $1.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Shares
purchased with the loan proceeds are held in a suspense account for allocation
among participants as the loan is repaid. Contributions to the ESOP and shares
released from the suspense account are allocated among participants on the
basis of compensation, as described in the plan, in the year of allocation.
Benefits generally become 100% vested after five years of vesting service.
Vesting will accelerate upon retirement, death or disability of the
participant or in the event of a change in control of the Bank or the Company.
Forfeitures will be reallocated among remaining participating employees, in
the same proportion as contributions. Benefits may be payable upon death,
retirement, early retirement, disability or separation from service. Since the
annual contributions are discretionary, the benefits payable under the ESOP
cannot be estimated. The Company accounts for its ESOP in accordance with
Statement of Position 93-6. Accordingly, the Company reports compensation
expense equal to the fair value of the shares allocated, and the allocated
shares are considered outstanding for the computation of earnings per share.
The expense related to the ESOP totaled $1.0 million, $1.0 million and $1.1
million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
At June 30, 2000 and 1999, unearned compensation related to the ESOP
approximated $1.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively, and is shown as a
reduction of stockholders' equity in the accompanying consolidated statements
of financial condition.

  The fair value of unallocated ESOP shares totaled $3.2 million and $4.5
million at June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

 401(k) Plan

  Effective July 1, 1997, the Bank implemented a 401(k) plan. Employees become
eligible to participate in the Plan upon attaining the age of 21 and
completing one year of service during which they have served a minimum of
1,000 hours. The benefits are based on employee compensation. During 2000,
1999 and 1998, the expense for this plan totaled $89,000, $57,000 and $52,000,
respectively.

(13) Incentive Plans

 Recognition and Retention Plan (RRP)

  The Bank adopted the RRP as a method of providing officers, employees and
nonemployee directors of the Bank with a proprietary interest in the Company
in a manner designed to encourage such persons to remain with the Bank. The
Bank contributed funds to the RRP to enable the trust to acquire, in the
aggregate, 4% of the shares of common stock in the conversion. Under the RRP,
awards are granted in the form of shares of common stock held by the RRP.
These shares represent deferred compensation and have been accounted for as a
reduction of stockholders' equity. Shares allocated vest over a period of
three to five years commencing on January 1, 1995 and continuing on each
anniversary date thereafter. Awards are automatically vested upon a change in
control of the Company or the Bank. In the event that before reaching normal
retirement, an officer or employee terminates service with the Company or the
Bank, that person's nonvested awards are forfeited.

  The expense related to the RRP for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1999 and
1998 was approximately $115,000 and $221,000, respectively. There was no
expense related to the RRP for fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. All shares
under the RRP were distributed as of January, 1999. Currently, there is no
intention to continue this plan.

 Stock Option and Incentive Plans

  In March of 1994 the stockholders of the Company ratified two stock option
plans, the 1993 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the Stock Plan) and the 1993
Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors (the Directors' Plan). In fiscal 1998,
the stockholders of the Company ratified the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan (the
1997 Stock Plan). All Plans provide for the grant of options at an exercise
price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. The Plans are
intended to promote stock ownership by directors and selected officers and
employees of the Company to increase their proprietary interest in the success
of the Company and to encourage them to remain in the employ of the Company or
its subsidiaries. Awards granted under the Plans may include incentive stock
options, nonstatutory options, limited rights which are exercisable only upon
a change in control of the Bank or the Company, restricted stock, stock
appreciation rights and other stock-based benefits.

  The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations for its
plans, all of which are fixed stock option plans. Accordingly, the Company did
not recognize compensation expense in connection with awards of stock options
because the exercise price and the fair market value were the same at the
dates of award. Had compensation cost for the Company Plans been recognized
based upon the fair value of the options at the grant date consistent with the
methodology specified in SFAS No. 123, the Company's net earnings and net
earnings per share at June 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998 would have been reduced to
the pro forma amounts indicated below (in thousands, except per share

  The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during
2000, 1999 and 1998 were $7.36, $6.69 and $8.42, respectively, on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted-
average assumptions were used for fiscal 2000: volatility of 25.12%, no
expected dividends, risk free interest rate of 6.33% and an expected life of 8
years. The following weighted-average assumptions were used for fiscal 1999:
volatility of 18.54%, no expected dividends, risk-free interest rate of 5.93%
and an expected life of 8 years. The following weighted-average assumptions
were used for fiscal 1998: volatility of 25.27%, no expected dividends, risk-
free interest rate of 5.66%, and an expected life of 10 years. During the
initial phase-in period, the effects of applying SFAS No. 123 for these pro
forma disclosures are not likely to be representative of the effects on
reported income for future years as options vest over several years and
additional awards may be made each year.

  The Directors' Plan authorizes the granting of stock options for a total of
161,719 shares of common stock. The Stock Plan authorizes the granting of
stock options for a total of 485,156 shares of common stock. All options
granted under both plans were granted at an exercise price of $4.80 per share.
The aggregate number of shares of common stock outstanding and available for
issuance pursuant to the 1997 Stock Plan is 560,465 shares. Options covering a
total of 100,257 shares were granted in fiscal 2000 at a weighted average
exercise price of $15.70 per share, which was the fair market value on the
grant date. Options covering a total of 110,000 shares were granted in fiscal
1999 at a weighted average exercise price of $16.13 per share, which was the
fair market value on the grant date. Options covering a total of 181,250
shares were granted in fiscal 1998 at a weighted average exercise price of
$16.50 per share, which was the fair market value on the grant date.

  All options granted under the Directors' Plan became fully exercisable
January 1, 1995. Each option granted under the Directors' Plan expires upon
the earlier of ten years following the date of grant or one year following the
date the optionee ceases to be a director. All options granted under the Stock
Plan are exercisable in three equal annual installments commencing January 1,
1995 and continuing on each anniversary date thereafter. Each option granted
under the Stock Plan expires upon the earlier of ten years following the date
of grant or three months following the date on which

the employee ceases to perform services for the Bank or the Company, except
that in the event of death, disability, retirement or upon a change in control

  At June 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company had approved commitments to originate
loans of approximately $15.0 million and $14.0 million, respectively,
substantially all of which were for adjustable rate one to four unit
residential loans and multifamily residential loans. Commitments to extend
credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation
of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed
expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a
fee. Since certain of the commitments are expected to expire without being
drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future
cash requirements. The Company minimizes its exposure to loss under these
commitments by requiring that customers meet certain conditions prior to
disbursing funds. The amount of collateral, if any, is based on a credit
evaluation of the borrower and generally involves residential real estate.

  At June 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company had $25.5 million and $21.1 million
of approved undisbursed lines of credit, respectively.

  At June 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company had commitments to sell loans of
$11.2 million and $6.0 million, respectively, for which the related loans are
included in loans held for sale. There were commitments to purchase loans of
$3.7 million at June 30, 1999 and no commitments to purchase loans at June 30,
2000. The Company had no commitments to sell investment securities or MBS at
June 30, 2000 and 1999. There were no commitments to purchase investment
securities at June 30, 2000 and 1999.

  The Company is not involved in any pending legal proceedings other than
routine legal proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business. Such
routine legal proceedings in the aggregate are believed by management to be
immaterial to the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

  The Company originates mortgage loans, which depending upon whether the
loans meet the Company's investment objectives, may be sold in the secondary
market or to other private investors. The servicing of these loans may or may
not be retained by the Company. Direct origination and servicing costs for
loan servicing and sale activities cannot be presented as these operations are
integrated with and not separable from the origination and servicing of
portfolio loans and, as a result, cannot be accurately estimated.

  In addition to retaining the servicing assets for originated loans, the
Company may also purchase mortgage servicing assets related to mortgage loans
originated by other institutions. At June 30, 2000, the Company had purchased
mortgage servicing assets with a book value of $197,000 and originated
mortgage servicing assets with a book value of $72,000.

(18) Fair Value of Financial Instruments

  Pursuant to requirements under generally accepted accounting principles, the
Company has included information about the fair values of the Company's
financial instruments, whether or not such instruments are recognized in the
accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition. In cases where
quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated based upon
discounted cash flows. Those techniques are significantly affected by the
assumptions utilized, including the assumed discount rates and estimates of
future cash flows. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be
substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could
not be realized in an immediate sale or other disposition of the instrument.
SFAS No. 107 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial
instruments from its disclosure requirements. All components of cash and cash
equivalents and accrued interest receivable and payable are presumed to have
approximately equal book and fair values because the periods over which such
amounts are realized are relatively short. As a result of the assumptions
utilized, the aggregate fair value estimates presented herein do not
necessarily represent the Company's aggregate underlying fair value.

  The fair values of investment securities and MBS are generally obtained from
market bids for similar or identical securities, or are obtained from quotes
from independent security brokers or dealers.

  Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial
characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as one to four units,
multifamily, commercial real estate and other. Each loan category is further
segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and by performing and
nonperforming categories. The fair value of performing loans is calculated by
discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using
estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk
inherent in the loan. The estimate of maturity is based on the contractual
term of the loans to maturity, adjusted for estimated prepayments. Fair value
for nonperforming loans is based on management's evaluation of fair value as
determined by specific borrower information and, if appropriate, the fair
value of the underlying collateral.

  The fair values of deposits are estimated based upon the type of deposit
product. Demand and money market deposits are presumed to have equal book and
fair values. The estimated fair values of time deposits are determined by
discounting the cash flows of segments of deposits having similar maturities
and rates, utilizing a yield curve that approximated the rates offered as of
the reporting date. No value has been estimated for the Company's long-term
relationships with depositors (commonly known as the core deposit premium)
since such intangible asset is not a financial instrument pursuant to the
definitions contained in SFAS No. 107.

  The fair values of borrowings were estimated using current market rates of
interest for similar borrowings.

  The fair values of off-balance sheet items are based on rates for similar
transactions as of the reporting date.

                   Inc. and Quaker City Bank, respectively, and Jerrold S.
                   Perisho as of May 22, 2000.



                       FORM OF QUAKER CITY BANCORP, INC.
                          CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT


     This AGREEMENT is made effective as of May 22, 2000, by and between Quaker
City Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company"), a corporation organized under the laws of
the State of Delaware, with its office at 7021 Greenleaf Avenue, Whittier,
California, and Jerrold S. Perisho ("Executive").  The term "Bank" refers to
Quaker City Bank, the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or any successor
thereto.

     WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the substantial contribution Executive has
made to the Company and wishes to protect his position therewith for the period
provided in this Agreement; and

     WHEREAS, Executive has been elected to, and has agreed to serve in the
employ of the Company or an affiliate thereof;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the contribution and responsibilities
of Executive, and upon the other terms and conditions hereinafter provided, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

1.  TERM OF AGREEMENT.
    -----------------

     The term of this Agreement shall be deemed to have commenced as of the date
first above written and shall continue for twenty-four (24) full calendar
months.  Commencing on the date of execution of this Agreement, the term of this
Agreement shall be extended for one day each day until such time as the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Board") or Executive elects not to extend the
term of the Agreement by giving written notice to the other party in accordance
with Section 4 of this Agreement, in which case the term of this Agreement shall
be fixed and shall end on the second anniversary of the date of such written
notice.

2.  PAYMENTS TO EXECUTIVE UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL.
    --------------------------------------------

     (a)  Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company (as herein
defined) followed at any time during the term of this Agreement by the voluntary
or involuntary termination of Executive's employment, other than for Cause, as
defined in Section 2(c) hereof, the provisions of Section 3 shall apply. Upon
the occurrence of a Change in Control, Executive shall have the right to elect
to voluntarily terminate his employment at any time during the term of this
Agreement following any demotion, loss of title, office or significant
authority, reduction in his annual compensation or benefits, or relocation of
his principal place of employment by more than 30 miles from its location
immediately prior to the Change in Control.
<PAGE>

     (b) For purposes of this Plan, a "Change in Control" of the Association or
Company shall mean an event of a nature that:  (i) would be required to be
reported in response to Item 1(a) of the current report on Form 8-K, as in
effect on the date hereof, pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"); or (ii) results in a Change in
Control of the Bank or the Company within the meaning of the Home Owners' Loan
Act of 1933 and the Rules and Regulations promulgated by the Office of Thrift
Supervision (or its predecessor agency), as in effect on the date hereof
(provided, that in applying the definition of change in control as set forth
under the rules and regulations of the OTS, the Board shall substitute its
judgment for that of the OTS); or (iii) without limitation such a Change in
Control shall be deemed to have occurred at such time as (A) any "person" (as
the term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes
the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act),
directly or indirectly, of securities of the Bank or the Company representing
20% or more of the Bank's or the Company's outstanding securities except for any
securities of the Bank purchased by the Company in connection with the
conversion of the Bank to the stock form and any securities purchased by any
employee benefit plan of the Bank or the Company, or (B) individuals who
constitute the Board on the date hereof (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any
reason to constitute at least a majority thereof, provided that any person
becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election was approved by
a vote of at least three-quarters of the directors comprising the Incumbent
Board, or whose nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was
approved by the same Nominating Committee serving under an Incumbent Board,
shall be, for purposes of this clause (B), considered as though he were a member
of the Incumbent Board, or (C) a plan of reorganization, merger, consolidation,
sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Bank or the Company or
similar transaction occurs in which the Bank or Company is not the resulting
entity, or (D) a proxy statement shall be distributed soliciting proxies from
stockholders of the Company, by someone other than the current management of the
Company, seeking stockholder approval of a plan of reorganization, merger or
consolidation of the Company or Bank with one or more corporations as a result
of which the outstanding shares of the class of securities then subject to such
plan or transaction are exchanged for or converted into cash or property or
securities not issued by the Bank or the Company shall be distributed, or (E) a
tender offer is made for 20% or more of the voting securities of the Bank or
Company then outstanding.

     (c) Executive shall not have the right to receive termination benefits
pursuant to Section 3 hereof upon Termination for Cause.  The term "Termination
for Cause" shall mean termination because of a material loss to the Company or
one of its affiliates caused by the Executive's intentional failure to perform
stated duties, personal dishonesty, incompetence, willful violation of any law,
rule, regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or final
cease and desist order, or any material breach of this Agreement.  For purposes
of this Section, no act, or the failure to act, on Executive's part shall be
"willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, not in good faith and without
reasonable belief that the action or omission was in the best interest of the
Company or its affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall not be
deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been
delivered to him a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of
not less than three-fourths of the members of the Board at a meeting of the
Board called and held for that purpose (after reasonable notice to Executive and
an opportunity for him, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board),
finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board, Executive was guilty of
conduct justifying Termination for Cause and specifying the particulars thereof
in detail.  The Executive shall not have the right to receive compensation or
other benefits for any period after Termination for Cause.
<PAGE>

3.  TERMINATION BENEFITS.
    --------------------

     (a)  Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, followed at any time
during the term of this Agreement by the voluntary or involuntary termination of
Executive's employment due to (1) Executive's dismissal or (2) Executive's
voluntary termination pursuant to Section 2(a), unless such termination is due
to Termination for Cause, the Company shall be obligated to pay Executive, or in
the event of his subsequent death, his beneficiary or beneficiaries, or his
estate, as the case may be, as severance pay or liquidated damages, or both, a
sum equal to two (2) times Executive's average annual compensation for the two
most recent taxable years that Executive has been employed by the Bank or such
lesser number of years in the event that Executive shall have been employed by
the Bank for less than two years, such average annual compensation shall include
any bonuses or other cash compensation paid or to be paid to the Executive in
any such year, any director or committee fees paid or to be paid in any such
year, any benefits paid or accrued to the Executive pursuant to any employee
benefit plan maintained by the Company or Bank in any such year and any
contributions made on behalf of the Executive to any employee benefit plan
maintained by the Company or Bank in any such year; provided however, that if
                                                    ----------------
the Bank is not in compliance with its minimum capital requirements or if such
payments would cause the Bank's capital to be reduced below its minimum
regulatory capital requirements, such payments shall be deferred until such time
as the Bank or successor thereto is in capital compliance.  At the election of
the Executive such payment may be made in a lump sum or paid in equal monthly
installments during the twenty-four (24) months following the Executive's
termination.  In the event that no election is made, payment to the Executive
will be made on a monthly basis during the remaining term of this Agreement.

     (b)  Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Bank or the Company
followed at any time during the term of this Agreement by the Executive's
voluntary or involuntary termination of employment, other than for Termination
for Cause, the Company shall cause to be continued life, medical, dental and
disability coverage substantially identical to the coverage maintained by the
Bank or Company for the Executive prior to his severance, except to the extent
such coverage may be changed in its application to all Bank or Company
employees.  Such coverage and payments shall cease upon expiration of twenty-
four (24) full calendar months following the Date of Termination.

     (c)  Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, Executive will be entitled
to receive benefits due to him under or contributed by the Bank or Company on
his behalf pursuant to any retirement, incentive, profit sharing, bonus,
performance, disability or other employee benefit plan maintained by the Bank or
Company on Executive's behalf.


     (d)  As of the effective date of this Agreement, and annually as of the
first business day of January or soon thereafter, Executive shall make the
election referred to in Section 3(a) hereof with respect to whether the amounts
payable under said Section 3(a) shall be paid in a lump sum or on a monthly
basis.  Such election shall be irrevocable for the year for which such election
is made and shall continue in effect until the Executive has made his next
annual election.

     (e)  Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this Section 3, in no
event shall the aggregate payments or benefits to be made or afforded to
Executive under said paragraphs (the "Termination Benefits") constitute an
"excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code or any successor
<PAGE>

thereto, and in order to avoid such a result Termination Benefits will be
reduced, if necessary, to an amount (the "Non-Triggering Amount"), the value of
which is one dollar ($1.00) less than an amount equal to three (3) times
Executive's "base amount", as determined in accordance with said Section 280G.
The allocation of the reduction required hereby among the Termination Benefits
provided by the preceding paragraphs of this Section 3 shall be determined by
the Executive.

4.  NOTICE OF TERMINATION.
    ---------------------

     (a) Any purported termination by the Company, or by the Executive shall be
communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto.  For purposes
of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a written notice which
shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon
and shall set forth in detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a
basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so
indicated.

     (b) "Date of Termination" shall mean the date specified in the Notice of
Termination (which, in the instance of Termination for Cause, shall not be less
than thirty (30) days from the date such Notice of Termination is given).

     (c) If, within thirty (30) days after any Notice of Termination is given,
the party receiving such Notice of Termination notifies the other party that a
dispute exists concerning the termination, the Date of Termination shall be the
date on which the dispute is finally determined, either by mutual written
agreement of the parties, by a binding arbitration award, or by a final
judgment, order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction (the time for
appeal therefrom having expired and no appeal having been perfected) and
provided further that the Date of Termination shall be extended by a notice of
dispute only if such notice is given in good faith and the party giving such
notice pursues the resolution of such dispute with reasonable diligence.
Notwithstanding the pendency of any such dispute, the Bank will continue to pay
Executive his full compensation in effect when the notice giving rise to the
dispute was given (including, but not limited to his annual salary) and continue
him as a participant in all compensation, benefit and insurance plans in which
he was participating when the notice of dispute was given, until the dispute is
finally resolved in accordance with this Agreement.

5. SOURCE OF PAYMENTS.
   ------------------

     It is intended by the parties hereto that all payments provided in this
Agreement shall be paid in cash or check from the general funds of the Bank.
The Company, however, guarantees payment and provision of all amounts and
benefits due hereunder to the Executive and, if such amount and benefits due
from the Bank are not timely paid or provided by the Bank, such amounts and
benefits shall be paid and provided by the Company.

6. EFFECT ON PRIOR AGREEMENTS AND EXISTING BENEFIT PLANS.
   -----------------------------------------------------

     This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the parties hereto
and supersedes any prior agreement between the Company and Executive, except
that this Agreement shall not affect or operate to reduce any benefit or
compensation inuring to Executive of a kind elsewhere provided. No provision of
this Agreement shall be interpreted to mean that Executive is subject to
receiving fewer benefits than those available to him without reference to this
Agreement.
<PAGE>

     Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon the Executive the right to
continue in the employ of the Company or shall impose on the Company any
obligation to employ or retain the Executive in its employ for any period.

7. NO ATTACHMENT.
   -------------

     (a)  Except as required by law, no right to receive payments under this
Agreement shall be subject to anticipation, commutation, alienation, sale,
assignment, encumbrance, charge, pledge, or hypothecation, or to execution,
attachment, levy, or similar process or assignment by operation of law, and any
attempt, voluntary or involuntary, to affect any such action shall be null,
void, and of no effect.

     (b)  This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of,
Executive, the Company and their respective successors and assigns.

8. MODIFICATION AND WAIVER.
   -----------------------

     (a)  This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by an instrument
in writing signed by the parties hereto.

     (b)  No term or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been
waived, nor shall there be any estoppel against the enforcement of any provision
of this Agreement, except by written instrument of the party charged with such
waiver or estoppel.  No such written waiver shall be deemed a continuing waiver
unless specifically stated therein, and each such waiver shall operate only as
to the specific term or condition waived and shall not constitute a waiver of
such term or condition for the future or as to any act other than that
specifically waived.


9.   REINSTATEMENT OF BENEFITS UNDER BANK AGREEMENT.
     ----------------------------------------------

     In the event Executive is suspended and/or temporarily prohibited from
participating in the conduct of the Bank's affairs by a notice described in
Section 9(b) of the Change-in-Control Agreement between Executive and the Bank
dated January 1, 1994 (the "Bank Agreement") during the term of this Agreement
and a Change in Control, as defined herein, occurs the Company will assume its
obligation to pay and the Executive will be entitled to receive all of the
termination benefits provided for under Section 3 of the Bank Agreement upon the
notification of the Company of the Bank's receipt of a dismissal of charges in
the Notice.

10.  EFFECT OF ACTION UNDER BANK AGREEMENT.
     --------------------------------------

     Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, to the extent that
payments and benefits are paid to or received by Executive under the Bank
Agreement between Executive and Bank, the amount of such payments and benefits
paid by the Bank will be subtracted from any amount due simultaneously to
Executive under similar provisions of this Agreement.
<PAGE>

11.  SEVERABILITY.
     -------------

     If, for any reason, any provision of this Agreement, or any part of any
provision, is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect any other provision
of this Agreement or any part of such provision not held so invalid, and each
such other provision and part thereof shall to the full extent consistent with
law continue in full force and effect.

12. HEADINGS FOR REFERENCE ONLY.
    ---------------------------

     The headings of sections and paragraphs herein are included solely for
convenience of reference and shall not control the meaning or interpretation of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

13. GOVERNING LAW.
    -------------

     The validity, interpretation, performance, and enforcement of this
Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.

14.  ARBITRATION.
     -----------

     Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this
Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration, conducted before a panel
of three arbitrators sitting in a location selected by the Executive within
fifty (50) miles from the location of the Company, in accordance with the rules
of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.  Judgment may be entered
on the arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction; provided, however,
that Executive shall be entitled to seek specific performance of his right to be
paid until the Date of Termination during the pendency of any dispute or
controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement.


15. PAYMENT OF LEGAL FEES.
    ---------------------

     All reasonable legal fees paid or incurred by Executive pursuant to any
dispute or question of interpretation relating to this Agreement shall be paid
or reimbursed by the Company if Executive is successful pursuant to a legal
judgment, arbitration or settlement.

16.  INDEMNIFICATION.
     ---------------

     The Company shall provide the Executive (including his heirs, executors and
administrators) with coverage under a standard directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy at its expense, or in lieu thereof, shall indemnify
the Executive (and his heirs, executors and administrators) to the fullest
extent permitted under Delaware law and as provided in the Company's certificate
of incorporation against all expenses and liabilities reasonably incurred by him
in connection with or arising out of any action, suit or proceeding in which he
may be involved by reason of his having been a director or officer of the
Company (whether or not he continues to be a director or officer at the time of

substantially all the business or assets of the Bank or the Company, expressly
and unconditionally to assume and agree to perform the Company's obligations
under this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company
would be required to perform if no such succession or assignment had taken
place.

                          CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT


     This AGREEMENT is made effective as of May 22, 2000 by and between Quaker
City Bank (the "Bank"), a federally chartered savings institution, with its
principal administrative office at 7021 Greenleaf Avenue, Whittier, California,
and Jerrold S. Perisho (the "Executive") and Quaker City Bancorp, Inc. (the
"Company"), a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware
which is the holding company of the Bank.

     WHEREAS, the Bank recognizes the substantial contribution Executive has
made to the Bank and wishes to protect Executive's position therewith for the
period provided in this Agreement; and

     WHEREAS, Executive has agreed to serve in the employ of the Bank.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the contribution and responsibilities
of Executive, and upon the other terms and conditions hereinafter provided, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

1.  TERM OF AGREEMENT.
    -----------------

     The term of this Agreement shall be deemed to have commenced as of the date
first above written and shall continue for an initial period of six (6) full
weeks.  Commencing on July 1, 2000, this agreement shall be renewed for twenty-
four (24) full calendar months, and continuing at each anniversary date
thereafter, the Board of Directors of the Bank ("Board") may extend this
Agreement for an additional year.  The Board will review the Agreement and the
Executive's performance annually for purposes of determining whether to extend
the Agreement, and the results thereof shall be included in the minutes of the
Board's meeting.

2.  PAYMENTS TO EXECUTIVE UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL.
    --------------------------------------------

    (a)  Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Bank or the Company
(as herein defined) followed at any time during the term of this Agreement by
the voluntary or involuntary termination of Executive's employment, other than
for Cause, as defined in Section 2(c) hereof, the provisions of Section 3 shall
apply. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, Executive shall have the
right to elect to voluntarily terminate his employment at any time during the
term of this Agreement following any demotion, loss of title, office or
significant authority, reduction in his annual compensation or benefits, or
relocation of his principal place of employment by more than 30 miles from its
location immediately prior to the Change in Control.

    (b)  For purposes of this Plan, a "Change in Control" of the Bank or Company
shall mean an event of a nature that:  (i) would be required to be reported in
response to Item 1(a) of the current report on Form 8-K, as in effect on the
date hereof, pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the "Exchange Act"); or (ii) results in a Change in Control of the Bank or
the
<PAGE>

Company within the meaning of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 and the
Rules and Regulations promulgated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (or its
predecessor agency), as in effect on the date hereof (provided, that in applying
the definition of change in control as set forth under the rules and regulations
of the OTS, the Board shall substitute its judgment for that of the OTS); or
(iii) without limitation such a Change in Control shall be deemed to have
occurred at such time as (A) any "person" (as the term is used in Sections 13(d)
and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined
in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of
the Bank or the Company representing 20% or more of the Bank's or the Company's
outstanding securities except for any securities of the Bank purchased by the
Company in connection with the conversion of the Bank to the stock form and any
securities purchased by any employee benefit plan of the Bank, or (B)
individuals who constitute the Board on the date hereof (the "Incumbent Board")
cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof, provided that
any person becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election was
approved by a vote of at least three-quarters of the directors comprising the
Incumbent Board, or whose nomination for election by the Company's stockholders
was approved by the same Nominating Committee serving under an Incumbent Board,
shall be, for purposes of this clause (B), considered as though he were a member
of the Incumbent Board, or (C) a plan of reorganization, merger, consolidation,
sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Bank or the Company or
similar transaction occurs in which the Bank or Company is not the resulting
entity.

    (c)  Executive shall not have the right to receive termination benefits
pursuant to Section 3 hereof upon Termination for Cause.  The term "Termination
for Cause" shall mean termination because of the Executive's personal
dishonesty, incompetence, willful misconduct, any breach of fiduciary duty
involving personal profit, intentional failure to perform stated duties, willful
violation of any law, rule, or regulation (other than traffic violations or
similar offenses) or final cease-and-desist order, or material breach of any
material provision of this Agreement.  In determining incompetence, the acts or
omissions shall be measured against standards generally prevailing in the
savings institutions industry.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall
not be deemed to have been Terminated for Cause unless and until there shall
have been delivered to him a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the
affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the Board of Directors of the
Bank at a meeting of the Board called and held for that purpose (after
reasonable notice to the Executive and an opportunity for him, together with
counsel, to be heard before the Board at such meeting and which such meeting
shall be held not more than 30 days from the date of notice during which period
Executive may be suspended with pay), finding that in the good faith opinion of
the Board, the Executive was guilty of conduct justifying Termination for Cause
and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.  The Executive shall not have
the right to receive compensation or other benefits for any period after
Termination for Cause.  Any stock options or limited rights granted to Executive
under any stock option plan of the Bank, the Company or any subsidiary or
affiliate thereof, shall become null and void effective upon Executive's receipt
of Notice of Termination for Cause and shall not be exercisable by Executive at
any time subsequent to such Termination for Cause.

3.  TERMINATION BENEFITS.
    --------------------

    (a)  Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, followed at any time during
the term of this Agreement by the termination of the Executive's employment due
to (1) Executive's dismissal or (2) Executive's voluntary termination pursuant
to Section 2(a), unless such termination is due to
<PAGE>

Termination for Cause, the Bank and the Company shall pay the Executive, or in
the event of his subsequent death, his beneficiary or beneficiaries, or his
estate, as the case may be, as severance pay or liquidated damages, or both, a
sum equal to two times Executive's average annual compensation for the five
preceding taxable years, such annual compensation shall include any bonuses and
any other cash compensation paid or to be paid to Executive in any such year,
the amount of benefits paid or accrued to Executive pursuant to any employee
benefit plan maintained by the Bank or Company in any such year and the amount
of any contributions made or to be made on behalf of Executive pursuant to any
employee benefit plan maintained by the Bank or the Company in any such year. At
the election of the Executive such payment may be made in a lump sum or paid in
equal monthly installments during the twenty-four (24) months following the
Executive's termination. In the event that no election is made, payment to the
Executive will be made on a monthly basis during the remaining term of this
Agreement.

    (b)  Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Bank or the Company
followed at any time during the term of this Agreement by the Executive's
voluntary or involuntary termination of employment, other than for Termination
for Cause, the Bank shall cause to be continued life, medical, dental and
disability coverage substantially identical to the coverage maintained by the
Bank or Company for the Executive prior to his severance, except to the extent
such coverage may be changed in its application to all Bank or Company
employees.  Such coverage and payments shall cease upon the expiration of
twenty-four full calendar months from the Date of Termination.

    (c)  Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, Executive will be entitled
to receive benefits due to him under or contributed by the Bank or Company on
his behalf pursuant to any retirement, incentive, profit sharing, bonus,
performance, disability or other employee benefit plan maintained by the Bank or
Company on Executive's behalf.

    (d)  As of the effective date of this Agreement, and annually as of the
first business day of January or soon thereafter, Executive shall make the
election referred to in Section 3(a) hereof with respect to whether the amounts
payable under said Section 3(a) shall be paid in a lump sum or on a monthly
basis.  Such election shall be irrevocable for the year for which such election
is made and shall continue in effect until the executive has made his next
annual election.

    (e)  Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this Section 3, in no event
shall the aggregate payments or benefits to be made or afforded to Executive
under said paragraphs (the "Termination Benefits") constitute an "excess
parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code or any successor thereto, and
in order to avoid such a result Termination Benefits will be reduced, if
necessary, to an amount (the "Non-Triggering Amount"), the value of which is one
dollar ($1.00) less than an amount equal to three (3) times Executive's "base
amount", as determined in accordance with said Section 280G.  The allocation of
the reduction required hereby among the Termination Benefits provided by the
preceding paragraphs of this Section 3 shall be determined by the Executive.

4.  NOTICE OF TERMINATION.
    ---------------------

    (a) Any purported termination by the Bank or by Executive shall be
communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto.  For purposes
of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a written notice which
shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement
<PAGE>

relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
claimed to provide a basis for termination of Executive's employment under the
provision so indicated.

    (b) "Date of Termination" shall mean the date specified in the Notice of
Termination (which, in the instance of Termination for Cause, shall not be less
than thirty (30) days from the date such Notice of Termination is given).

    (c)  If, within thirty (30) days after any Notice of Termination is given,
the party receiving such Notice of Termination notifies the other party that a
dispute exists concerning the termination, the Date of Termination shall be the
date on which the dispute is finally determined, either by mutual written
agreement of the parties, by a binding arbitration award, or by a final
judgment, order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction (the time for
appeal therefrom having expired and no appeal having been perfected) and
provided further that the Date of Termination shall be extended by a notice of
dispute only if such notice is given in good faith and the party giving such
notice pursues the resolution of such dispute with reasonable diligence.
Notwithstanding the pendency of any such dispute, the Bank will continue to pay
Executive his full compensation in effect when the notice giving rise to the
dispute was given (including, but not limited to his annual salary) and continue
him as a participant in all compensation, benefit and insurance plans in which
he was participating when the notice of dispute was given, until the dispute is
finally resolved in accordance with this Agreement.

5.  SOURCE OF PAYMENTS.
    ------------------

      It is intended by the parties hereto that all payments provided in this
Agreement shall be paid in cash or check from the general funds of the Bank.
The Company, however, guarantees payment and provision of all amounts and
benefits due hereunder to the Executive and, if such amounts and benefits due
from the Bank are not timely paid or provided by the Bank, such amounts and
benefits shall be paid or provided by the Company.

6.  EFFECT ON PRIOR AGREEMENTS AND EXISTING BENEFIT PLANS.
    -----------------------------------------------------

      This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the parties
hereto and supersedes any prior agreement between the Bank and the Executive,
except that this Agreement shall not affect or operate to reduce any benefit or
compensation inuring to the Executive of a kind elsewhere provided. No provision
of this Agreement shall be interpreted to mean that the Executive is subject to
receiving fewer benefits than those available to him without reference to this
Agreement.

      Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon the Executive the right to
continue in the employ of Bank or shall impose on the Bank any obligation to
employ or retain the Executive in its employ for any period.

7.  NO ATTACHMENT.
    -------------

    (a)  Except as required by law, no right to receive payments under this
Agreement shall be subject to anticipation, commutation, alienation, sale,
assignment, encumbrance, charge, pledge, or hypothecation, or to execution,
attachment, levy, or similar process or assignment by operation of law, and any
attempt, voluntary or involuntary, to affect any such action shall be null,
void, and of no effect.
<PAGE>

    (b)  This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the
Executive, the Bank and their respective successors and assigns.

8.  MODIFICATION AND WAIVER.
    -----------------------

    (a)  This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by an instrument
in writing signed by the parties hereto.

    (b)  No term or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been
waived, nor shall there be any estoppel against the enforcement of any provision
of this Agreement, except by written instrument of the party charged with such
waiver or estoppel.  No such written waiver shall be deemed a continuing waiver
unless specifically stated therein, and each such waiver shall operate only as
to the specific term or condition waived and shall not constitute a waiver of
such term or condition for the future or as to any act other than that
specifically waived.

9.  REQUIRED REGULATORY PROVISIONS.
    ------------------------------

    (a)  The Board of Directors may terminate the Executive's employment at any
time, but any termination by the Board of Directors, other than Termination for
Cause, shall not prejudice the Executive's right to compensation or other
benefits under this Agreement.  The Executive shall not have the right to
receive compensation or other benefits for any period after Termination for
Cause as defined in Section 2 hereinabove.

    (b)  If the Executive is suspended from office and/or temporarily prohibited
from participating in the conduct of the Bank's affairs by a notice served under
Section 8(e)(3) or 8(g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C.
(S)1818(c)(3) or (g)(1)), the Bank's obligations under this contract shall be
suspended as of the date of service, unless stayed by appropriate proceedings.
If the charges in the notice are dismissed, the Bank may in its discretion (i)
pay the Executive all or part of the compensation withheld while their contract
obligations were suspended and (ii) reinstate (in whole or in part) any of the
obligations which were suspended.

    (c)  If the Executive is removed and/or permanently prohibited from
participating in the conduct of the Bank's affairs by an order issued under
Section 8(e)(4) or 8(g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C.
(S)1818(e)(4) or (g)(1)), all obligations of the Bank under this contract shall
terminate as of the effective date of the order, but vested rights of the
contracting parties shall not be affected.

    (d)  If the Bank is in default as defined in Section 3(x)(1) of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act, all obligations of the Bank under this contract shall
terminate as of the date of default, but this paragraph shall not affect any
vested rights of the contracting parties.

    (e)  All obligations under this contract shall be terminated, except to the
extent determined that continuation of the contract is necessary for the
continued operation of the institution:  (i) by the Director of the Office of
Thrift Supervision (or his or her designee) at the time the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or the Resolution Trust Corporation enters into an
agreement to provide assistance to or on behalf of the Bank under the authority
contained in Section 13(c) of the Federal
<PAGE>

Deposit Insurance Act; or (ii) by the Director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision (or his or her designee) at the time the Director (or his or her
designee) approves a supervisory merger to resolve problems related to operation
of the Bank or when the Bank is determined by the Director to be in an unsafe or
unsound condition. Any rights of the parties that have already vested, however,
shall not be affected by such action.

    (f)  Any payments made to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement, or
otherwise, are subject to and conditioned upon compliance with 12 U.S.C.
(S)1828(k) and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

10.  REINSTATEMENT OF BENEFITS UNDER SECTION 9(b).
     --------------------------------------------

      In the event the Executive is suspended and/or temporarily prohibited from
participating in the conduct of the Bank's affairs by a notice described in
Section 9(b) hereof (the "Notice") during the term of this Agreement and a
Change in Control, as defined herein, occurs, the Bank will assume its
obligation to pay and the Executive will be entitled to receive all of the
termination benefits provided for under Section 3 of this Agreement upon the
Bank's receipt of a dismissal of charges in the Notice.

11.  SEVERABILITY.
     -------------

      If, for any reason, any provision of this Agreement, or any part of any
provision, is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect any other provision
of this Agreement or any part of such provision not held so invalid, and each
such other provision and part thereof shall to the full extent consistent with
law continue in full force and effect.

12.  HEADINGS FOR REFERENCE ONLY.
     ---------------------------

      The headings of sections and paragraphs herein are included solely for
convenience of reference and shall not control the meaning or interpretation of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

13.  GOVERNING LAW.
     -------------

      The validity, interpretation, performance, and enforcement of this
Agreement shall be governed by California law but only to the extent not
preempted by Federal law.

14.  ARBITRATION.
     -----------

      Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this
Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration, conducted before a panel
of three arbitrators sitting in a location selected by the Executive within
fifty (50) miles from the location of the Bank's main office, in accordance with
the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment may
be entered on the arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction; provided,
however, that the Executive shall be entitled to seek specific performance of
his right to be paid until the Date of Termination during the pendency of any
dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement.
<PAGE>

15.  PAYMENT OF COSTS AND LEGAL FEES.
     -------------------------------

      All reasonable costs and legal fees paid or incurred by the Executive
pursuant to any dispute or question of interpretation relating to this Agreement
shall be paid or reimbursed by the Bank (which payments are guaranteed by the
Company pursuant to Section 5 hereof) if Executive is successful on the merits
pursuant to a legal judgment, arbitration or settlement.

16.  INDEMNIFICATION.
     ---------------

      The Bank shall provide Executive (including his or her legal
representatives, successors and assigns) with coverage under a standard
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy at its expense, or in lieu
thereof, shall indemnify Executive (including his or her legal representatives,
successors and assigns) for reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Executive
in defending or settling any judicial or administrative proceeding, or
threatened proceeding, whether civil, criminal or otherwise, including any
appeal or other proceeding for review.

      Indemnification by the Bank shall be made only upon the final judgment on
the merits in the favor of the Executive, in case of settlement, in case of
final judgment against Executive or in the case of final judgment in favor of
Executive other than on the merits, if a majority of the disinterested directors
of the Bank determine Executive was acting in good faith within the scope of
Executive's employment or authority in accordance with 12 C.F.R. section
545.121(c)(iii).

      Any such indemnification of Executive must conform with the notice
provisions of 12 C.F.R. part 545.121(c)(iii) to indemnify Executive to the
fullest for such expenses and liabilities to include, but not be limited to,
judgments, court costs and attorneys' fees and the cost of reasonable
settlements, such settlements to be approved by the Board of Directors of the
Bank, if such action is brought against Executive in his or her capacity as a
officer or director of the Bank, however, shall not extend to matters as to
which Executive is finally adjudged to be liable for willful misconduct in the
performance of his or her duties.

17.  SUCCESSOR TO THE BANK.
     ---------------------

      The Bank shall require any successor or assignee, whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, to all or
substantially all the business or assets of the Bank, expressly and
unconditionally to assume and agree to perform the Bank's obligations under this
Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Bank would be
required to perform if no such succession or assignment had taken place.

     1.   The Bank feels the need to continue to assist its Employees in meeting
          the burdens of retirement and to reward its Employees for their long

     NOW, THEREFORE, except as to specific effective dates for legislative

5.11  Optional Retirement Benefit
      ---------------------------

     (a)  In lieu of his Vested, Early, Normal or Late Retirement Benefit, a
          Participant may elect, with Spousal Consent, to receive an Optional
          Retirement Benefit. A Participant must make such an election in
          writing in accordance with the Rules of the Plan and deliver it to the
          Administrator (or its delegate) within the timeframe specified by the
          Administrator but in any event prior to his Early, Normal or Late
          Retirement Date (or, in the case of a lump sum distribution under
          paragraph (iv), the Annuity Starting Date of such distribution), as
          the case may be.  Subject to Section 5.16, the Optional Retirement
          Benefit of a Participant shall be one of

          (i)    a monthly Benefit, reduced as provided in subsection (b),
                 payable during each month of the period of his Early, Normal or
                 Late Retirement with the provision that if he dies, his Benefit
                 will end in the calendar month in which his death occurs.

          (ii)   a monthly Benefit, reduced as provided in subsection (b),
                 payable during each month of the period of his Early, Normal or
                 Late Retirement with the provision that if he dies after his
                 Annuity Starting Date, and if his properly designated
                 Contingent Annuitant survives him, such Contingent Annuitant
                 shall receive a monthly payment beginning on the first day of
                 the calendar month next following the Participant's death and
                 ending with the calendar month in which the Contingent
                 Annuitant's death occurs, in the same amount (or in 50% or 66-
                 2/3%) of that amount as the Participant may elect); provided,
                 however, that his election shall not take effect if the
                 Contingent Annuitant does not survive until the Participant's
                 Annuity Starting Date,

          (iii)  a monthly Benefit, reduced as provided in subsection (b),
                 payable during each month of the period of his Early, Normal or
                 Late Retirement with the provision that if he dies after his
                 Annuity Starting Date and before

                                       33
<PAGE>

               receiving 60, 120, 180, 240 payments, as the Participant may
               elect, his Beneficiaries as designated for this purpose under
               Section 5.17 will receive the remainder of such monthly payments;
               provided, however, that this election shall not take effect if
               the Participant's Beneficiary does not survive until the
               Participant's Annuity Starting Date,

          (iv) a lump sum payment, payable after his Separation from Service on
               the Annuity Starting Date elected by such Participant or Former
               Participant in writing in accordance with Code Section 417(e) and
               the Rules of the Plan; provided, that such Annuity Starting Date
               shall be on the first day of any calendar month following the
               date his Separation from Service occurs if his Separation from
               Service is on account of his Early, Normal, Late or Disability
               Retirement; and, provided, further, that such Annuity Starting
               Date shall be on the first day of the third calendar month next
               following the calendar quarter in which his Separation from
               Service occurs (or on the first day of any subsequent calendar
               month) if his Separation from Service occurs prior to his Early,
               Normal, Late or Disability Retirement.

     (b)  A Participant's Optional Retirement Benefit (other than a lump sum
          distribution under paragraph (a)(iv)) shall be the Actuarial
          Equivalent (as determined under Section 1.2, as applicable) of his
          Vested, Early, Normal or Late Retirement Benefit, said Actuarial
          Equivalent being computed as of his Early, Normal or Late Retirement
          Date, whichever is applicable. A Participant's Optional Retirement
          Benefit paid in the form of a lump sum distribution under paragraph
          (a)(iv) shall be the amount of the balance in such Participant's Cash
          Balance Account as of the Annuity Starting Date of such distribution;
          provided, however, that a Participant's lump sum distribution under
          paragraph (a)(iv) shall not be less than the Actuarial Equivalent (as
          determined under Section 1.2) of his Normal or Late Retirement
          Benefit, whichever is applicable, determined as of December 31, 1999,
          under the terms of the Plan in effect as of December 31, 1999, said
          Actuarial Equivalent being computed as of the Annuity Starting Date of
          such distribution. If the Participant was an Active Participant on
          December 31, 1999 and continued to be an Active Participant on January
          1, 2000, the Participant's Normal or Late Retirement Benefit
          determined as of December 31, 1999 will be modified by Appendix A.

     (c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no Optional
          Retirement Benefit shall be provided under which any Beneficiary or
          Contingent Annuitant (other than the Participant's or Former
          Participant's spouse or incompetent child) can receive a Benefit
          having an Actuarial Equivalent (as determined under Section 1.2) on
          the date such Benefits commence greater than the then present
          Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant's Benefit under said election.

     (d)  Notwithstanding subsection (a) and Section 5.10(g), if a Participant
          or Former Participant elects to receive any one of the Optional
          Retirement Benefits specified

                                       34
<PAGE>

          in paragraph (a)(ii) and his Contingent Annuitant is his Spouse,
          Spousal Consent shall not be required.

     (e)  Notwithstanding subsection (b), a Participant's Optional Retirement
          Benefit under paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) shall not be less than the
          Actuarial Equivalent (as determined under the Plan as in effect as of
          December 31, 1999) of such Participant's Normal or Late Retirement
          Benefit, whichever is applicable, determined as of December 31, 1999,
          under the terms of the Plan in effect as of December 31, 1999, said
          Actuarial Equivalent being computed as of his Early, Normal or Late
          Retirement Date, whichever is applicable.

5.12  Preretirement Survivor Annuity
      ------------------------------

     (a)  If a Participant or Former Participant dies after becoming entitled to
          a Vested Retirement Benefit, but before his Annuity Starting Date, his
          Surviving Spouse or, if there is no Surviving Spouse or the Surviving
          Spouse waives the Survivor Annuity, his Beneficiary, shall receive a
          Survivor Annuity as provided in subsections (b) and (c).

     (b)  The Surviving Annuity payable to a Surviving Spouse shall be a Benefit
          to the Surviving Spouse consisting of a monthly payment commencing on
          the first day of the calendar month following the later of

          (i)  the month in which the Participant or Former Participant dies,

          (ii) such date as the Surviving Spouse shall elect under the Rules of
               the Plan,

          and ending on the first day of the calendar month in which the
          Surviving Spouse dies. The Benefit payable under such Survivor Annuity
          shall be an amount equal to the Actuarial Equivalent (as determined
          under Section 1.2 of the balance in such Participant's or Former
          Participant's Cash Balance Account as of the date of commencement of
          the Survivor Annuity. Such Surviving Annuity shall commence not later
          than the first day of the calendar month coincident with or
          immediately following the date on which such Participant or Former
          Participant would have attained age 65.

     (c)  The Survivor Annuity payable to a Beneficiary shall be a Benefit to
          the Beneficiary consisting of a monthly payment commencing on the
          first day of the calendar month following the later of

          (i)  the month in which the Participant or Former Participant dies, or

          (ii) such date as the Beneficiary shall elect under the Rules of the
               Plan that is no later than the last day of the calendar year in

               Participant's death occurs,

<PAGE>

          and ending on the first day of the calendar month in which the
          Beneficiary dies. The Benefit payable under such Survivor Annuity
          shall be an amount equal to the Actuarial Equivalent (as determined
          under Section 1.2 of the balance of such Participant's or Former
          Participant's Cash Balance Account as of the date of commencement of
          the Survivor Annuity.

     (d)  For purposes of this Section, a Participant's or Former Participant's
          Cash Balance Account shall be credited with Interest Credits on the
          last day of each calendar quarter ending after such Participant's or
          Former Participant's death and before the commencement of such
          Survivor Annuity.

     (e)  If the balance in the Cash Balance Account of such Participant or
          Former Participant as of the date of distribution does not exceed
          $5,000, or if Spousal Consent is obtained (in the case of the Survivor
          Annuity described in subsection (b)) or the consent of the Beneficiary
          is obtained (in the case of the Survivor Annuity described in
          subsection (c)), said balance shall be promptly distributed to the
          Surviving Spouse or the Beneficiary in cash in a lump sum in lieu of

          distribution not later than 60 days prior to the first day of the
          calendar month coincident with or immediately following the date the
          Participant or Former Participant would have attained age 65. In the
          case of the Survivor Annuity described in subsection (c), the
          Beneficiary shall elect such lump sum distributions not later than 60
          days prior to the last day of the calendar year in which the first

5.13 Election
     --------

     Any Participant (including a former Participant with a vested interest) may
     make a Qualified Election to have the Benefit payable to him paid in an
     optional form described in Section 5.11 hereof, provided that a married
     Participant, pursuant to Code Section 401(a)(11), shall receive his or her
     benefit in the form stated in Section 5.10 unless the Participant with the
     consent of his or her Eligible Spouse elects not to receive a distribution
     in accordance with such method.

(a)  In the case of a Joint and Survivor Annuity, the Committee shall, no less
     than thirty (30) days and no more than ninety (90) days prior to the
     Annuity Starting Date, provide each Participant a written explanation of:

     (i)   The terms and conditions of the Joint and Survivor Annuity;

    (ii)   The Participant's right to make, and the effect of, an election to
           waive the Joint and Survivor Annuity form of Benefit;

                                       36
<PAGE>

    (iii) The rights of a Participant's Eligible Spouse; and

    (iv)  The right to make, and the effect of , a revocation of a previous
          election to waive the Joint and Survivor Annuity.

(b)  Each Participant who has an Eligible Spouse shall be covered for a
     Preretirement Survivor Annuity described in Section 5.12 unless the
     Surviving Spouse waives the Survivor Annuity.  The Committee shall provide
     each Participant within the applicable period, written explanation of the
     Preretirement Survivor Annuity in such terms and in such manner as would be
     comparable to the explanation provided for meeting the requirements of
     paragraph (a) applicable to a Joint and Survivor Annuity.  The applicable
     period for a Participant is whichever of the following periods ends last:

     (i)  The period beginning with the first day of the Plan Year in which the
          Participant attains age thirty-two (32), and ending with the close of
          the Plan Year preceding the Plan Year in which the Participant attains
          age thirty-five (35);

    (ii)  A reasonable period ending after the individual becomes a Participant;

   (iii)  A reasonable period ending after paragraph (c) below ceases to apply
          to the Participant;

    (iv)  A reasonable period ending after this Section 5.13 first applies to
          the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice must be
          provided within a reasonable period, ending after Separation from
          Service in the case of a Participant who separates from Service before
          attaining age thirty-five (35).

     For purposes of applying the preceding paragraph, a reasonable period
     ending after the enumerated events described in (ii), (iii), and (iv) is
     the end of the two (2)-year period beginning one (1) year prior to the date
     the applicable event occurs, and ending (1) year after that date. In the
     case of a Participant who separates from Service before the Plan Year in
     which age thirty-five (35) is attained, notice shall be provided within the
     two (2)-year period beginning one (1) year prior to separation and ending
     one (1) year after separation. If such a Participant thereafter returns to
     employment with the Employer, the applicable period for such Participant
     shall be redetermined.

(c)  For the purposes of this Section 5.13:

     (i)  "Pre-age thirty-five (35) waivers" shall mean, in the case of a
          Participant who will not yet attain age thirty-five (35) as of the end
          of any current Plan Year, a special Qualified Election to waive the
          preretirement

                                       37

               Survivor Annuity for the period beginning on the date of such
               election, and ending on the first day of the Plan Year in which
               the Participant will attain age thirty-five (35). Such election
               shall not be valid unless the Participant receives a written
               explanation of the preretirement Survivor Annuity in such terms
               as are comparable to the explanation required under paragraph
               (a). Preretirement Survivor Annuity coverage will be
               automatically reinstated as of the first day of the Plan Year in
               which the Participant attains age thirty-five (35). Any new
               waiver on or after such date shall be subject to the full
               requirements of this Section.

          (ii) "Qualified Election" shall mean a waiver of a Joint and Survivor
               Annuity or a preretirement Survivor Annuity. Any waiver of a
               Joint and Survivor Annuity or a preretirement Survivor Annuity
               shall not be effective unless:

               a.   The Participant's Eligible Spouse consents in writing to the
                    election;

               b.   The election designates a specific Beneficiary, including
                    any class of Beneficiaries or any contingent Beneficiaries,
                    which may not be changed without spousal consent (or the
                    Eligible Spouse expressly permits designations by the
                    Participant without any further spousal consent);

               c.   The Eligible Spouse's consent acknowledges effect of the
                    election; and

               d.   The Eligible Spouse's consent is witnessed by a Plan
                    representative or notary public. Additionally, a
                    Participant's waiver of the Joint and Survivor Annuity shall
                    not be effective unless the election designates a form of
                    Benefit payment which may not be changed without spousal
                    consent (or the Eligible Spouse expressly permits
                    designations by the Participant without any further spousal
                    consent).

               If it is established to the satisfaction of a Plan representative
               that there is no Eligible Spouse or that the Eligible Spouse
               cannot be located, a waiver will be deemed a qualified election.

5.14  Reemployment of Former Participants
      -----------------------------------

     (a)  Except in the case of a Former Participant described in subsection
          (b),

          (i)  If a Former Participant who had a Separation from Service before
               his Benefit became Vested under Section 5.9, subsequently becomes
               a Participant before his completion of five consecutive Break in
               Service

                                       38

               Years, his Benefit shall be immediately restored. Upon such
               restoration, such Participant's Cash Balance Account shall be
               credited with the amount previously debited from such Cash
               Balance Account under Section 2.3(a), and the Interest Credits
               that would have been credited to such Account from the date of
               such Participant's Separation from Service to the date of
               restoration, determined assuming that the amount previously
               debited under Section 2.3(a) had not been so debited.

          (ii) If a Former Participant who had a Separation from Service after
               his Benefit became Vested under Section 5.9, and who commenced
               the distribution of his Benefit in an annuity in accordance with
               Section 5.10 or 5.1l(a)(i), (ii) or (iii), subsequently becomes a
               Participant, his Benefit shall continue to be distributed in the
               form of such annuity. Such Participant shall accrue a new Benefit
               in addition to such prior Benefit in accordance with Articles 4
               and 5 as if he were a new Employee.  His prior Benefit shall be
               determined  as if he had not been reemployed, i.e., without
               regard to the amount previously debited from his Cash Balance
               Account under Section 4.5(a) and the Interest Credits that would
               have been credited to such Cash Balance Account from the Annuity
               Starting Date to the date on which such Former Participant became
               a Participant. Such additional Benefit shall be paid or
               distributed in accordance with Article 5.

     (b)  In the case of a Former Participant who was a Former Participant on
          December 31, 1999, and who becomes a Participant on or after January
          1, 2000,

          (i)  If the Former Participant had a Separation from Service before
               his Benefit became Vested, and subsequently becomes a Participant
               before his completion of five consecutive Break in Service Years,
               his Benefit shall be immediately restored. If such Participant is
               an Active Participant, upon such restoration, such Participant's
               Cash Balance Account shall be credited with an amount equal to
               the Actuarial Equivalent (as determined under Section 1.2) of his
               Normal Retirement Benefit, determined as of the date of
               restoration. If such Participant is an Inactive Participant, such
               Participant's Benefit shall be determined in accordance with
               Section 4.7.

          (ii)  If the Former Participant had a Separation from Service after
               his Benefit became Vested and, prior to commencement of
               distribution of his Benefit, subsequently becomes an Active
               Participant, such Participant's Cash Balance Account shall be
               credited with an amount equal to the Actuarial Equivalent (as
               determined under Section 1.2) of his Normal Retirement Benefit,
               determined as of the date such Former Participant becomes an
               Active Participant. If the Former Participant had a Separation
               from Service after his Benefit became Vested, and prior to
               commencement of distribution of his Benefit, subsequently becomes
               an Inactive Participant, such Participant's Benefit shall be
               determined in accordance with Section 4.7.

                                       39
<PAGE>

         (iii) If the Former Participant had a Separation from Service after
               his Benefit became Vested, commenced the distribution of his
               Benefit in an annuity form, and subsequently becomes a
               Participant, his Benefit shall continue to be distributed in the
               form of such annuity in accordance with the terms of the Plan in
               effect as of December 31, 1999. Such Participant shall accrue a
               Benefit in addition to such Benefit in accordance with Articles 4
               and 5. Such additional Benefit shall be paid or distributed in
               accordance with Article 5.

     (c)  If a Former Participant who was a Former Participant on December 31,
          1999, and who becomes an Active Participant on or after January 1,
          2000, has a Separation from Service after becoming an Active
          Participant on or after January 1, 2000 and subsequently again becomes
          a Participant, subsection (a) shall apply to such Participant and
          subsection (b) shall not apply.

          Benefit payable to a Participant or Former Participant under this Plan
          shall not exceed an amount which is the Actuarial Equivalent (as
          determined under Section 1.2) of a straight life annuity (except that
          portion of the survivor benefit payable to a Spouse provided under
          Section 5.10 or 5.11(a)(i) or the survivor benefit payable under
          Section 5.12 shall not be taken into account) in an annual amount of
          the least of

          (i)  $90,000, adjusted, in the case of benefit payments beginning
               prior or subsequent to the applicable Social Security Retirement
               Age, in the manner prescribed by Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) and
               (D), (or beginning January 1, 1988, such other amount which is in
               effect on the last day of the calendar year as is prescribed in
               regulations promulgated by the Secretary under Code Section
               415(d)),

          (ii) the Participant's or Former Participant's average annual
               Statutory Compensation for the three consecutive calendar years
               during which he was a Participant and had his greatest aggregate
               Statutory Compensation from the Bank (or, in the case of a
               Participant who has had a Separation from Service, such other
               amount as is to be taken into account under Code Section
               415(b)(1)(B) as is prescribed in regulations promulgated by the
               Secretary under Code Section 415(b)), or

         (iii) the maximum allowed under Code Section 415 (utilizing the
               adjustments to the "defined contribution fraction" allowed by
               Section 1106(i)(4) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and Code Section
               415(e)).  Beginning January 1, 2000, this section is hereby
               repealed and no longer applicable.

     (b)  Notwithstanding subsection (a), the Benefit of a person who is a
          Participant or a Former Participant as of the calendar year which
          begins in 1987 shall not be less than the Actuarial Equivalent of his
          annual Benefit determined as of the last day of the calendar year
          which began in 1986 under the Plan as in effect on May 5, 1986 to the
          extent that such maximum permissible benefit did not exceed the
          maximum benefit permitted under Code Section 415, as then in effect.

     (c)  If the annual Benefit of a Participant under this Plan and all other
          defined benefit plans of the Bank is not in excess of $10,000 for the
          calendar year in question or any prior calendar year, and the Bank has
          not at any time maintained a defined contribution plan in which such
          Participant participated, the provisions of paragraphs (a)(i) and
          (a)(ii) shall not apply.

     (d)  (i)  For any Participant with less than ten years of participation in
               the Plan, within

               the meaning of Code Section 415(b)(5)(A), the limitation referred
               to in paragraph (a)(i) shall be multiplied by a fraction, the
               numerator of which is the number of years (or a portion thereof)
               of participation, and the denominator of which is ten.

          (ii) For any Participant with less than ten years of service, within
               the meaning of Code Section 415(b)(5)(B), the limitations
               referred to in paragraph (a)(ii) and subsection (c) shall be
               multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
               years (or portion thereof) of service, and the denominator of
               which is ten.

         (iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (ii), the limitations
               referred to in paragraphs (a)(i) and (a)(ii) and subsection (c)
               shall not be reduced to less than one tenth of the amount of such
               limitation, determined without regard to this subsection.

     (e)  The Administrator (or its delegate) may elect to compute the
          denominator of a Participant's defined contribution plan fraction for
          all calendar years ending before January 1, 1983 by multiplying such
          denominator for the calendar year ending in 1982 by the "transition
          fraction." The transition fraction shall have a numerator, which is
          the lesser of $51,875, or 1.4 multiplied by 25% of the Participant's
          Statutory Compensation for the calendar year ending in 1981. The
          denominator shall be the lesser of $41,500 or 25% of the Participant's
          Statutory Compensation for the calendar year ending in 1981.

     (f)  Any excess Benefit, which any Benefit formula of this Plan provides,
          but which cannot be paid under the Plan by reason of this Section,
          shall not be funded.

5.16  Involuntary Cash-Outs
      ---------------------

      Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, upon a
      Participant's Separation from Service, the Administrator (or its delegate)
      shall cause payment to him, or on his account, of the balance in his Cash
      Balance Account if it is not more than $5,000 (and did not exceed such
      amount at the time of a prior distribution) in a lump sum. Payment shall
      be made in accordance with the Rules of the Plan; provided, however, that
      the Annuity Starting Date of such payment shall be on the first day of a
      calendar month following his Separation from Service.

5.17  Designation of Beneficiaries and Contingent Annuitants; Substitute Rights
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------
      of Spouse or Heirs At Law
      -------------------------

     (a)  For the purposes of Section 5.11, each Participant and Former
          Participant shall have the right to designate a Contingent Annuitant
          or to designate, revoke and redesignate one or more Beneficiaries
          hereunder and to direct payment of the Benefits provided therein to
          his Contingent Annuitant and/or Beneficiaries who survive him and
          comply with the Rules of the Plan. Designation, revocation or
          redesignation must be made in writing on a form provided by the
          Administrator (or its delegate) and becomes effective upon delivery to
          the Administrator (or its delegate). If a Participant or Former
          Participant dies having failed to designate any Beneficiary or if no
          such Beneficiary complies with the Rules of the Plan, the amount
          otherwise payable under Section 5.11 shall be paid in the manner
          herein provided to the Surviving Spouse of the Participant or Former
          Participant, if any, and otherwise to the Participant's or Former
          Participant's heirs at law, if any, as determined in the reasonable
          judgment of the Administrator under the laws of the state in which the
          Participant or Former Participant resided on the day he died governing
          succession to personal property. If no Beneficiary survives the
          Participant or Former Participant, or survives to the date of any
          payment in question under Section 5.11, the amount otherwise payable
          to such Beneficiary shall be paid in the manner herein provided to his
          surviving spouse, if any, and otherwise to his heirs at law, if any,
          as determined in the reasonable judgment of the Administrator under
          the laws of the state in which he resided on the day he died governing
          succession to personal property. A married Participant or Former
          Participant who elects, in accordance with Section 5.10(f), not to
          receive a Joint and Survivor Annuity may not designate a Beneficiary
          other than his Spouse without obtaining Spousal Consent thereto.

     (b)  For the purposes of Section 5.12, each Participant and Former
          Participant shall have the right to designate, revoke and redesignate
          a Beneficiary hereunder and to direct payment of the Survivor Annuity
          provided therein to his Beneficiary who

                                       42
<PAGE>

          survives him and comply with the Rules of the Plan. Designation,
          revocation or redesignation must be made in writing on a form provided
          by the Administrator (or its delegate) and becomes effective upon the
          delivery to the Administrator (or its delegate). If there is no
          Surviving Spouse when a Participant or Former Participant dies, and
          such Participant or Former Participant dies having failed to designate
          any Beneficiary or if no such Beneficiary complies with the Rules of
          the Plan or survives the Participant or Former Participant, or
          survives to the date of any payment in question under Section 5.12,
          the Participant's or Former Participant's Cash Balance Account shall
          be paid in a lump sum payment to the Participant's or Former
          Participant's heirs at law, if any, as determined in the reasonable
          judgment of the Administrator under the laws of the state in which the
          Participant or Former Participant resided on the day he died governing
          succession to personal property.

               b. He attained age 70 1/2 before January 1, 2001.

         (iii) Such Participant's Benefit shall equal the Late Retirement
               Benefit, determined in accordance with Section 5.7, that such
               Participant would have received if such Participant had retired
               on such date. Such Benefit shall consist of a monthly payment on
               the first day of each calendar month commencing on such date and
               ending on the calendar month in which such Participant's death
               occurs, unless a Joint and Survivor Annuity is required under

               Account shall be debited with the balance of such Account as of
               the Annuity Starting Date of the Benefit and reduced to zero in
               accordance with Section 4.5(a).

               and 5. Such Benefit accruals shall be determined based on such
               Participant's Compensation following the Annuity Starting Date of
               the Benefit distributed under paragraph (i). Unless such
               additional Benefit is paid or distributed upon such Participant's
               Late Retirement Date in accordance with Section 5.7, payment or
               distribution of such additional Benefit shall commence on the

               Participant shall continue to accrue additional Benefit each
               calendar year until such Participant retires.

     (b)  (i)  If a Participant is not described in (a)(ii) above, the
               Participants benefits must commence (or be paid) no later than

                    Active Participant

          (ii) Such Participant's Benefit shall equal the Late Retirement
               Benefit, determined in accordance with Section 5.7. Such Benefit
               shall consist of a monthly payment on the first day of each
               calendar month commencing on such date and ending on the calendar
               month in which such Participant's death occurs, unless a Joint
               and survivor Annuity is required under Section 5.10, or such
               Participant has elected an Optional Retirement Benefit under

               Participant's Cash Balance Account is not more than $5,000 (and
               did not exceed such amount at the time of a prior distribution),
               such Benefit shall be paid in a lump sum payment in accordance
               with the Rules of the Plan. Upon payment or commencement of such

               according with an election permitted under Section 242(b)(2) of
               the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982.

               the incidental death benefit provisions (including the minimum
               distribution incidental benefit requirement) of Code Section
               401(a)(9)(G), Treas. Reg. Section l.401-l(b)(l) and Prop. Reg.

          for review.

          authority to make findings of fact and to construe the terms of the
          Plan and, to the full extent permitted by law, the determination of
          the claims official (if no review is properly requested or the
          decision of the review official on review, if review has been properly
          requested) shall be final and binding on all parties unless held by a
          court of competent jurisdiction to constitute an abuse of discretion.

     promptly paid in the manner specified in such order; provided, however,
     that no such distribution shall be made prior to the Participant's

          (ii) "Determination Date" shall mean, with respect to any Plan Year,

                    or exceeds the amount in effect under Code Section
                    415(c)(1)(A); provided, however, if two Controlled Group
                    Employees have the same interest in the Bank or a Bank
                    Affiliate, the Controlled Group Employee with the greater

               is not a Key Employee.

          (vi) The Plan shall be Top-Heavy if, as of any Determination Date, the
               sum of the Actuarial Equivalents of the accrued Benefits for Key
               Employees under all plans in the Aggregation Group (or under this
               Plan and such other plans as the Bank or a Bank Affiliate elects
               to take into account under Code Section 416(g)(2)(A)(ii)) exceeds
               60% of the sum of the Actuarial Equivalents of accrued Benefits
               for all Key Employees and Non-Key Employees. In making this
               calculation as of a Determination Date,

               a.   the Actuarial Equivalent of an accrued Benefit shall be
                    determined as of the most recent valuation date (which for
                    purposes hereof shall be the same date as is used for
                    computing Plan costs for minimum funding) occurring within

                    Controlled Group Employee or former Controlled Group

                    Date with respect to such Controlled Group Employee or
                    former Controlled Group Employee,

               c.   the Actuarial Equivalents of the accrued Benefit of

                    1.   any Non-Key Employee who was a Key Employee for any
                         prior Plan Year, and

                    2.   any former Controlled Group Employee who performed no
                         services for the employer maintaining the Plan during
                         the five-year period ending on the Determination Date
                         shall be ignored.

               d.   If the Actuarial Equivalent of any accrued Benefit under the
                    Plan includes any amount attributable to any rollovers to or
                    from the Plan, such value shall be adjusted, as required by
                    Code Section 416(g)(4)(A).

               Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Plan shall be Top-Heavy if,
               as of any Determination Date, it is required by Code Section
               416(g) to be included in an Aggregation Group which is determined
               to be a Top-Heavy Group.

        (vii)  "Top-Heavy Group" shall mean any Aggregation Group if, as of
               the Determination Date, the sum of

               a.   the present value of the cumulative accrued benefits for all
                    Key Employees under all defined benefit plans in such
                    Aggregation Group, and

               b.   the aggregate of the accounts of all Key Employees under all
                    defined contribution plans in such Aggregation Group

               exceeds 60% of a similar sum determined for all Key Employees and
               Non-Key Employees.

7.2  Minimum Benefits
     ----------------

     (a)  For any Plan Year in which the Plan is Top-Heavy, a Non-Key Employee
          shall accrue a Benefit expressed as a life annuity (with no ancillary
          benefits) commencing at his Normal Retirement Date in an amount which
          is not less than the product of

          (i)  2%,

         (ii)  the number of Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 1984
               during which the Plan was Top-Heavy and with respect to which the
               Participant accrued a Year of Vesting Service, and

         (iii) the Participant's average Statutory Compensation for the
               period of five consecutive Plan Years in each of which the
               Participant was an Active Participant and for which the
               Participant's aggregate Statutory Compensation was the greatest.
               If the Participant did not receive Compensation in five such Plan
               Years, his Statutory Compensation shall

                                       53
<PAGE>

               be averaged over his longest continuous period of participation.
               In making the computations under this subparagraph, Statutory
               Compensation for Plan Years which are not included in the Plan
               Years taken into account under subparagraph (ii) shall be
               ignored.

     (b)  A Participant's minimum Benefit payable under this Section shall not
          exceed 20% of the amount described in subparagraph (a)(iii).

     (c)  If, for any Plan Year, a Participant accrues a minimum Benefit in
          accordance with subsection (a) and participates in a defined
          contribution plan of the Bank, his minimum benefit provided in
          subsection (a) shall be offset by any Bank contribution provided under
          the defined contribution plan in accordance with Treasury Regulations
          interpreting Code Section 416(f).

7.3  Vesting
     -------

     (a)  For any Plan Year in which the Plan is Top-Heavy, the Vested
          percentage of a Participant's accrued Benefit shall be the percentage
          shown on the following table:

                    Years of Vesting       Vested
                       Service            Percentage

                      ARTICLE 8 - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS


8.1  Termination of Plan
     -------------- ----

     While the Plan is intended as a permanent program, the Bank shall have the
     right at any time to declare the Plan terminated completely as to the Bank,
     or as to any division, facility or other operational unit thereof, or to
     discontinue contributions to the Plan. Discharge or layoff of Employees of
     the Bank or any unit thereof without such a declaration shall not result in
     a termination or partial termination of the Plan except to the extent
     required by law. In the event of such termination, partial termination or
     discontinuance, Benefits accrued to the date of such termination or partial
     termination for the Participants, Former Participants, Beneficiaries and
     Contingent Annuitants affected by such termination or partial termination
     to the extent then funded shall thereupon become nonforfeitable and the
     Administrator (or its delegate) shall direct the Trustee to make a prompt
     determination of the fair market value of the Trust Fund and proportionate
     amounts shall then be allocated so as to provide (to the extent not already
     provided) Benefits attributable thereto for such Participants, Former
     Participants, Beneficiaries and Contingent Annuitants in the order of
     priority set forth below, satisfying the requirements of each class in full
     before proceeding to the next class. Benefits for affected Participants
     shall be computed on the basis of Benefit accrued to the date of such
     termination and Compensation received prior to date of such termination but
     recognizing such termination or discontinuance and the funds then available
     and proportionately reducing Benefits within the class as to which funds
     are inadequate to provide Benefits in full, and such amounts when
     determined shall remain fixed regardless of any person's employment status
     thereafter. Such allocation shall be as follows:

     (a)  To so provide all Benefits payable as monthly payments

          (i)  which were in pay status as of the beginning of the three-year
               period ending on the date of such termination or discontinuance
               as designated by the Administrator (or its delegate) in a manner
               not inconsistent with applicable law and regulations, based on
               the provisions of the Plan (as in effect during the five-year
               period ending on such date), under which such Benefit would be
               the least, with the lowest Benefit in pay status during such
               period considered the Benefit in pay status, and

          (ii) which would have been in pay status as of the beginning of such
               three-year period if the Participant had retired prior to the
               beginning of the three-year period and if his Benefits had
               commenced as a Normal Retirement Benefit under Section 5.2 as of
               the beginning of such period, to each such Benefit based on the
               provisions of the Plan (as in effect during the five-year period
               ending on such date) under which such Benefit would be the least.

                                       56
<PAGE>

     (b)  To so provide

          (i)  all other Benefits (if any) of individuals under the Plan
               guaranteed under Title IV of ERISA (determined without regard to
               Section 4022(b)(5) of such Act), and

          (ii) the additional Benefits (if any) which would be determined under
               clause (i) if Section 4022(b)(6) of such Act did not apply.

     (c)  To so provide all other Benefits under the Plan to the extent vested
          without regard to this Section.

     (d)  To so provide all other Benefits under the Plan.

     (e)  In the event of the termination of the Plan, the Benefit of a
          Participant, Former Participant, Beneficiary and Contingent Annuitant
          who is a "missing participant" (as defined in ERISA Section
          4050(b)(1)) shall be distributed by transferring the "designated
          benefit" (as defined in ERISA Section 4050(b)(2)) of such Participant,
          Former Participant, Beneficiary or Contingent Annuitant to the Pension
          Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or by purchasing irrevocable commitments
          from an insurer with respect to such "designated benefit" in
          accordance with ERISA Section 4041(b)(3)(A)(i). Any such transfer and
          purchase of an irrevocable commitment shall be in accordance with
          regulations promulgated by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
          The Administrator shall provide to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
          Corporation such information and certifications regarding the
          "designated benefits" or irrevocable commitments with respect to such
          Participants, Former Participants, Beneficiaries and Contingent
          Annuitants as are required under ERISA Section 4050 and the
          regulations thereunder. This subsection shall be effective with
          respect to distributions that occur in Plan Years commencing after
          final regulations implementing ERISA Section 4050 are promulgated by
          the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

8.2  Suspension of Contributions
     ---------------------------

     The Bank shall have the right to suspend its contributions to the Plan at
     any time for a fixed period of time, and such period may be extended by
     subsequent action of the Bank. Such suspension shall automatically become a
     discontinuance of contributions as under Section 8.1 at any time at which,
     in the opinion of the Enrolled Actuary, such suspension affects the
     Benefits to be paid or made available under the Plan. No such suspension
     shall be allowed to create an "accumulated funding deficiency" under Code
     Section 412(a) unless the Plan is then terminated under Section 8.1;
     provided that, in the event of an unintentional creation of an accumulated
     funding deficiency, the Bank retains the right for 90 days alter such a
     deficiency is finally determined to correct it without such termination. In
     the event of such suspension, the Plan shall otherwise remain in full force
     and effect.

          laws governing fiduciaries. Any person may act in more than one
          fiduciary capacity.

8.9  Allocation of Fiduciary Responsibilities
     ----------------------------------------

     (a)  Fiduciary responsibilities under the Plan are allocated as follows:

          (i)  The sole power and discretion to manage and control the Plan's
               assets including, but not limited to, the power to acquire and
               dispose of Plan assets, is allocated to the Trustee, except to
               the extent that another fiduciary is appointed in accordance with
               the Plan with the power to control or manage (including the power
               to acquire and dispose of) assets of the Plan.

          (ii) The sole duties, responsibilities and powers allocated to the
               Board shall be those expressly retained under this Plan.

                                       60
<PAGE>

          (iv) All fiduciary responsibilities not allocated to the Trustee, the

               in accordance with Section 6.1(a)(viii).

     (b)  Fiduciary responsibilities under the Plan (other than the power to
          manage or control the Plan's assets) may be reallocated among those
          fiduciaries identified as named fiduciaries in Section 8.8 by amending
          the Plan in the manner prescribed in Section 8.5, followed by such
          fiduciaries' acceptance of, or operation under, such amended Plan.

      Copies of the Plan and any other documents and records which a Participant

      reasonable business hour at the principal office of the Bank, any Bank

      Employee. Except as otherwise required by law, nothing contained in the
      Plan shall give any Employee the right to be retained in the service of
      the Bank or to interfere with or restrict the right of the Bank, which is
      hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or retire any Employee at any
      time, without notice and with or without cause. Except as otherwise
      required by law, inclusion under the Plan will not give any Employee any
      right or claim to any benefit hereunder except to the extent such right
      has specifically become fixed under the terms of the Plan and there are
      funds available therefor in the hands of the Trustee or he is entitled to
      benefit payments from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The
      doctrine of substantial performance shall have no application to Employees
      or Participants. Each condition and provision, including numerical items,
      has been carefully considered and constitutes the minimum limit on
      performance which will give rise to the applicable right.

          and Contingent Annuitants shall, upon termination of the Plan, revert
          to the Bank;

      of federal law.

8.14  Errors and Misstatements
      ------------------------

      In the event of any misstatement, error or omission of fact by a
      Participant to the Administrator (or its delegate) resulting in payment of
      Benefits in an incorrect amount, the Administrator (or its delegate) shall
      promptly cause the amount of future payments to be corrected upon
      discovery of the facts and shall cause the Trustee to pay the Participant,

      Administrator may choose to correct such error or breach in accordance

      policies, procedures and programs and any such correction shall be binding
      on all plan Participants and beneficiaries.

      Association, as the Administrator (or its delegate) shall elect in its

      None of the Benefits, payments, proceeds or claims of any Participant,
      former Participant, or Beneficiary shall be subject to any claim of any
      creditor and, in particular, the same shall not be subject in any manner
      to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,
      encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either
      voluntary or involuntary. Any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell,
      transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, garnish, levy or otherwise dispose of
      or execute upon any right or benefit payable hereunder shall be void. The
      Fund shall not in any manner be liable or subject to the debts, contracts,
      liabilities, engagements or costs of any Participant entitled to benefits
      hereunder, and such benefits shall not be considered an asset of the
      Participant in the event of his insolvency or bankruptcy. This provision
      shall not prevent the Plan from complying with the terms of a "qualified
      domestic relations order" as defined in Code Sections 401(a)(13) and
      414(p) or any domestic relations order entered into before January 1,
      1985.

     For each Plan Year, the Bank shall make a contribution on behalf of each
     Participant equal to (a) minus (b) where:

     (a)  equals the product of (1) and (2) where

          (1)  equals the Plan Participant's Compensation for the Plan Year not
               limited by Code Section 401(a)(17), and

          (2)  equals the rate (expressed as a percentage of Compensation) at
               which the Bank matching contributions would be made on the
               Participant's behalf for the Plan Year under the Quaker 401(k)
               Plan, except for the limits imposed on the Quaker 401(k) Plan
               under Code Sections 401(a)(17), 401(k), 401(m), 402(g) and 415;
               and

     (b)  equals the Bank matching contribution actually made to the Quaker
          401(k) Plan on behalf of the Participant for the Plan Year.

3.2  Bank ESOP Contribution
     ----------------------

     The Bank shall make a contribution on behalf of each Participant equal to
     (a) minus (b) where:

     (a)  equals the product of (1) and (2) where

          (1)  equals the Plan Participant's Compensation, not limited by Code
               Section 401(a)(17), and

          (2)  equals the fair market value of allocations, pursuant to Sections
               4.1 and 4.2 of the Quaker ESOP, on behalf of any Quaker ESOP
               participant affected neither by the limitations of Code Section
               401(a)(17) nor by the limitations of Code Section 415, divided by

               ESOP); and

     (b)  equals the fair market value of Bank contributions actually made on

3.4  Special Contribution Credit
     ---------------------------

     Effective as of January 1, 2000, in lieu of receiving any benefit under the
     Quaker SERP, former Quaker SERP Participants may sign a written agreement
     with the Bank to receive a Special Contribution Credit to this Plan. Such
     Special Contribution Credit will be approved by the Compensation Committee
     and listed in Appendix A of the Plan. In order to
<PAGE>

     receive this Special Contribution Credit, a Participant must sign a written
     agreement waiving any right to a benefit under the former Quaker SERP.

3.5  Earnings on Plan Benefits
     -------------------------

     (a)  Each Participant's account shall be adjusted as of each Valuation
          Date. The adjustments made shall be those adjustments reflecting
          income, gains and losses that would have been made to the
          Participant's account had the dollar value of the account been
          invested in the investments selected by the Participant pursuant to
          the provisions of Section 3.5(b).

     (b)  For purposes of determining the adjustments for investment experience
          set forth in Section 3.5(a) above, the dollar value of each
          Participant's account shall be deemed to be invested in accordance
          with the Participant's investment designation in one or more
          investments established by the Committee pursuant to rules established
          by the Committee. The Committee may, at its discretion, establish
          alternative investments or eliminate any previously established
          investments at any time and from time to time. In accordance with
          rules established by the Committee, each Participant may elect the
          investments in which his or her account is deemed invested.

     (c)  In the event that the Committee elects not to permit deemed investment
          elections pursuant to section 3.5(b), a Participant's benefits under
          this Plan shall be credited with interest at a rate equal to the
          interest crediting rate under Section 4.4 of the Retirement Plan or
          such other rate as selected by the Compensation Committee.

3.6  Valuation of Accounts
     ---------------------

     A Participant's account under the Plan shall be valued by the Committee as
     of each Valuation Date. A Participant's account shall be calculated by
     starting with the balance of the account as of the prior Valuation Date
     (assuming a $0 balance for the initial Valuation Date) and by (a) adding to
     the Participant's account those amounts of Bank contributions, if any,
     credited to the account of such Participant since the last Valuation date,
     (b) making the adjustments to such Participant's account set forth in
     Section 3.5(a) above since the last Valuation Date, and (c) subtracting the
     aggregate amount of distributions or withdrawals made since the last
     Valuation Date to or with respect to such Participant.  Notwithstanding the
     foregoing, Bank contributions made pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3,
     shall be credited to a Participant's account as of each December 31.

3.7  Rules Regarding Reductions
     --------------------------

     For purposes of calculating the amounts under this Article, the following
     rules shall apply:

     (a)  Any portion of the Participant's benefits under the Retirement Plan,
          Quaker 401(k) Plan and/or the Quaker ESOP which is payable (or has
          been paid) to another person pursuant to a court order shall be
          treated as payable to the Participant.

     (b)  The Participant's benefit under this Plan shall be determined without
          regard to whether or not benefits under the Retirement Plan, Quaker
          401(k) Plan or Quaker ESOP (collectively the "Bank's Other Plans")
          have commenced, whether or not
<PAGE>

          such benefits under the Bank's Other Plan's have been paid in full and
          without regard to the actual form of payment elected by the
          Participant under the Bank's Other Plans.

3.8  Forms of Payment Options
     ------------------------

     A Participant may elect to receive payment of his benefit under this Plan
     as

     (a)  a single lump sum payment; or

     (b)  installment payments no more frequently than monthly over a period of
          from 1 to 10 years.

Benefits distributed pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall either be paid or
commence to be paid as soon as administratively practicable following a
Participant's termination from service or as soon as administratively
practicable in the next calendar year following a Participant's termination from
service.

3.9  Election of Form of Payment Option
     ----------------------------------

     A Participant may elect the form of payment as described in Section 3.8 by
     executing a valid payment election form.  A Participant may change his
     election at any time, but such a change in election must be made at least
     12 months prior to termination of employment to constitute a valid
     election. A Participant's election shall be valid even if not made at least
     12 months prior to termination of employment if it is made within 30 days
     of first entering the Plan.

     In the event that a Participant's election or change of election is not
     valid, the next preceding valid election form (made at least 12 months
     prior to termination of employment or within 30 days of first entering the
     Plan) shall determine the Participant's payment form.

     In the event a Participant does not have a valid election form or if no
     election has been made, then payment of a Participant's benefits under this
     Plan shall be made in the form of a single lump sum payment as soon as
     administratively practicable following the Participant's termination from
     service.
<PAGE>

                    ARTICLE 4 - RIGHT TO BANK CONTRIBUTIONS


4.1  Vesting in Bank Contributions
     -----------------------------

     A Participant shall have a nonforfeitable right to all Bank Contributions
     made to his or her account under this Plan upon being credited with five
     Years of Service.

     Additionally, upon a Change-in-Control as defined in Section 2.3, a
     Participant shall be fully vested regardless of the number of Years of

                     ARTICLE 5 - AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION


5.1  Amendment
     ---------

     The Bank reserves the right in its discretion to amend this Plan at any
     time in whole or in part, by a formally approved resolution at a regularly
     scheduled meeting provided, however, that no amendment shall result in the
     forfeiture of any Participant's benefits accrued (vested or not vested)
     prior to the date the Bank adopts the amendment. In the alternative, the
     Bank may, by a formally approved resolution, delegate to one or more
     officers of the Bank the authority to amend the Plan, in which case the
     signature of the authorized officer(s) on the Plan amendment shall be
     sufficient to effectuate the amendment. The Bank or its designee shall
     notify Participants of any amendments which affect the amount or timing of
     benefits within 90 days of the effective date of such amendments.

5.2  Termination
     -----------

     The Bank may terminate this Plan at any time by a formally approved
     resolution at a regularly scheduled meeting. In the alternative, the Bank
     may, by a formally approved resolution, delegate to one or more officers of
     the Bank the authority to terminate the Plan in which the signature of the
     authorized officer(s) on the document terminating the Plan shall be
     sufficient to effectuate the termination. Termination shall not result in
     the forfeiture of any Participant's benefits earned prior to the date the
     Bank adopts a resolution terminating the Plan. The Bank or its designee
     shall notify Participants of the termination of the Plan within 90 days of
     the effective date of such termination. In the event that this Plan is
     terminated, each Participant shall become fully vested in his benefit.

5.3  Amendment of Plan Following a Change in Control.

     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1 of the Plan for a period of
     60 months following the date of a Change of Control, no amendment to the
     Plan shall be effective unless such amendment is consented to in writing by
     a majority of Plan Participants.

                          ARTICLE 6 - ADMINISTRATION


6.1  This Plan shall be adopted by the Board of Directors of the Bank and shall
     be administered by the Compensation Committee.

6.2  The Compensation Committee shall have the sole authority, in its
     discretion, to adopt, amend and rescind such rules and regulations as it
     deems advisable in the administration of the Plan, to construe and
     interpret the Plan, and the rules and regulations, and to make all other
     determinations and interpretations of the Plan. All decisions,
     determinations, and interpretations of the Compensation Committee shall be
     final and binding on all persons, except as otherwise provided by law.
     Compensation Committee members who are Participants shall abstain from
     voting on any Plan matters that would cause them to be in constructive
     receipt of benefits under the Plan. The Compensation Committee may delegate
     its responsibilities as it deems necessary.

6.3  If a Participant believes benefits have been incorrectly calculated or
     denied, such person may file a claim with the Compensation Committee.  The
     Compensation Committee shall follow the claims procedures set forth in the
     Retirement Plan.

6.4  All Plan administrative expenses shall be paid by the Bank.

6.5  The Bank shall indemnify the Compensation Committee and each Compensation
     Committee member against any and all claims, losses, damages, expenses
     (including reasonable counsel fees), and liability arising from any action,
     failure to act, or other conduct in the member's official capacity, except
     when due to the individual's own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

6.6  In the event that the Committee determines that a Participant's employment
     performance is no longer at a level which merits continued active
     participation in the Plan, the Committee may terminate such Participant's
     active participation in the Plan (without necessarily terminating such
     Participant's employment) as of the date specified by the Committee. After
     the effective date of a Participant's termination of active participation
     in the Plan, such Participant shall not accrue any additional benefits
     under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4 hereof; nevertheless, such a
     Participant shall be entitled to interest on plan benefits as provided in
     Section 3.5 hereof.
<PAGE>

                        ARTICLE 7 - GENERAL PROVISIONS


7.1  No Funding Obligation
     ---------------------

     The amounts accrued by a Participant hereunder are not held in a trust or
     escrow account and are not secured by any specific assets of the Bank or in
     which the Bank has an interest. This Plan shall not be construed to require
     the Bank to fund any of the benefits provided hereunder nor to establish a
     trust for such purpose. The Bank may make such arrangements as it desires
     to provide for the payment of benefits including the use of a trust meeting
     the requirements of IRS Revenue Procedure 92-64. Neither the Participant,
     the Spouse nor any other person shall have any rights against the Bank with
     respect to any portion of the Participant's benefits except as a general
     unsecured creditor of the Bank. No Participant has an interest in his
     benefits until the Participant actually receives payment.

     Upon a Change-in-Control, as defined in Section 2.3, all Participants shall
     immediately become 100% vested as provided in Section 4.1. Notwithstanding
     anything to the contrary in this Section 7.1, within 30 days following a
     Change-in-Control as defined in Section 2.3, the Bank will be required to
     contribute an amount equal to the total vested account balances of all
     Participants as of the date of the Change in Control to an independent
     trustee pursuant to the terms of an irrevocable rabbi trust which the Bank
     shall establish for the benefit of such Participants. Such rabbi trust
     shall be in substantially the same form as that attached hereto as Exhibit
     "A".


7.2  Non-Alienation of Benefits
     --------------------------

     No benefit under this Plan may be sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed,
     hypothecated, encumbered, anticipated, or otherwise disposed of, and any
     attempt to do so shall be void. No such benefit shall, prior to receipt
     thereof by a Participant or Spouse, be in any manner subject to the debts,
     contracts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of such Participant.

7.3  Limitation of Rights
     --------------------

     Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to limit in any way the right of
     the Bank to terminate a Participant's employment at any time, for any
     reason whatsoever, with or without cause; nor shall be evidence of any
     agreement or understanding, express or implied, that the Bank (a) will
     employ a Participant in any particular position, (b) will ensure
     participation in any incentive programs, or (c) will grant any awards from
     such programs.

7.4  Applicable Laws
     ---------------

     This Plan shall be construed and its provisions enforced and administered
     in accordance with the laws of the State of California except as otherwise
     provided in ERISA.

7.5  Gender and Number
     -----------------
<PAGE>

     Except when otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine terminology
     shall also include the feminine and the definition of any term in the
     singular shall also include the plural.

7.6  Assumption of Plan.  The Bank expressly agrees that it shall not merge or
     ------------------
     consolidate into or with another corporation, or sell substantially all of
     its assets to another corporation, firm or person until such corporation,
     firm or person expressly agrees in writing to assume and discharge the
     duties and obligations of the Bank under this Plan. The powers, duties,
     rights and obligations of the Bank under this Plan may be assigned (i) to
     any company into which the Bank may be merged, or with which it may be
     consolidated, or (ii) to any company resulting from any merger,
     reorganization or consolidation to which the Bank is a party, or (iii) to
     any company to which the business of the Bank may be transferred, to the
     extent affected Participants transfer their employment to such Bank. If
     such an assignment occurs, the successor-in-interest to the Bank shall
     assume the powers, duties, rights and obligations of the Bank in writing.

7.7  Binding Effect.  The provisions of this Plan shall be binding upon the
     --------------
     Bank, the Participants, all affiliated companies employing any
     Participants, and any successor-in-interest, beneficiary, heir or personal
     representative to the Bank, any Participant or any affiliated bank
     ("Affiliated Bank").

7.8  Notices.  All notices, requests, or other communications (hereinafter
     -------
     collectively referred to as "Notices") required or permitted to be given
     hereunder or which are given with respect to this Plan shall be in writing
     and may be personally delivered, or may be sent by United States registered
     mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested and addressed as follows:

     To the Bank,
     and any Affiliated Bank
     or the Committee at:              Quaker City Bank
                                       7021 Greenleaf Avenue
                                       Whittier, CA 90602-1300


     To Participant at:                The Participant's residential
                                       mailing address as reflected
                                       in the Bank's or Affiliated
                                       Bank's employment
                                       records

     A Notice which is delivered personally shall be deemed given as of the date
     of personal delivery, and a Notice mailed as provided herein shall be
     deemed given on the date received. Any Participant may change his or her
     address for purposes of Notices hereunder pursuant to a Notice to the
     Committee, given as provided herein, advising the Committee of such change.
     The Bank, any Affiliated Bank and/or the Committee may at any time change
     its address for purposes of Notices hereunder pursuant to a Notice to all
     affected Participants, given as provided herein, advising such Participants
     of such change.
<PAGE>

7.9   Severability.  In the event that any provision of this Plan is found to be
      ------------
      invalid or otherwise unenforceable by a court or other tribunal of
      competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforcability shall not be
      construed as rendering any other provision contained herein invalid or
      unenforceable, and all such other provisions shall be given full force and
      effect to the same extent as though the invalid and unenforceable
      provision was not contained herein.

7.10  Tax Effect of Plan.  Neither the Bank nor any Affiliated Bank warrants any
      ------------------
      tax benefit or any financial benefit under this Plan. Without limiting the
      foregoing, the Bank and each Affiliated Bank and their directors,
      officers, employees and agents shall be held harmless by the Participant
      from, and shall not be subject to any liability on account of, any Federal
      or State tax consequences or any consequences under ERISA of any
      determination as to the amount of plan benefits to be paid, the method by
      which plan benefits are paid, the persons to whom plan benefits are paid,
      or the commencement or termination of the payment of plan benefits.



This Plan is hereby adopted by the Bank on this 21st day of September, 2000.
