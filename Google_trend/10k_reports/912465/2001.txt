                                    PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

  Quaker City Bancorp, Inc., incorporated in Delaware, is primarily engaged in
the savings and loan business through its wholly owned subsidiary Quaker City
Bank (the "Bank"). The Company was organized on September 13, 1993, for the
purpose of acquiring all of the capital stock of the Bank issued in the
conversion of the Bank from mutual to stock form effective December 30, 1993.
The Bank was originally founded in 1920 as the Mutual Building and Loan
Association of Whittier, and in 1938 became a federally chartered mutual
savings and loan association. The Company's principal business is serving as
the holding company for the Bank. The executive offices of the Company are
located at 7021 Greenleaf Avenue, Whittier, California 90602, telephone number
(562) 907-2200.

  The Bank currently operates seventeen retail full service branches in the
southern California communities of Whittier (2), La Habra (2), Brea,
Fullerton, Placentia, La Mirada, Hacienda Heights, Anaheim Hills, Rowland
Heights, Lakewood, Northridge, Corona (2), Foothill Ranch and Murrieta. Six of
these branches are inside Wal-Mart stores. Four were opened during calendar
year 2000 and two were opened in the first half of calendar 2001. The Bank
also plans to open additional Wal-Mart "in-store" branches in southern
California during fiscal 2002.

  The Company is a savings and loan holding company and as such is subject to
examination and regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS"). The
deposits of the Bank are insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund
("SAIF") of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"). The Bank
is regulated by the Director of the OTS and the FDIC. The Bank is a member of
the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of San Francisco, which is one of the 12
regional banks comprising the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is also
subject to certain regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the "FRB") with respect to reserves required to be maintained
against deposits and certain other matters. See "--Regulation and
Supervision--General."

                                       1
<PAGE>

  The Bank's principal business has been and continues to be attracting retail
deposits from the general public in its primary deposit market area
surrounding its offices and investing those deposits, together with funds
generated from operations and borrowings. Through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Quaker City Financial Corporation ("QCFC"), the Company also engages in the
sale of insurance and investment products on an agency basis. The Company
originates predominantly multifamily, commercial real estate and one-to-four
family loans and emphasizes multifamily lending in low and moderate income
communities, primarily in southern California metropolitan areas. To a lesser
extent, loans are also originated and purchased in central and northern
California. Under certain circumstances, one-to-four family and multi-family
loans are purchased on loans secured by properties outside the state of
California.

  Historically, the Company's principal business was the making of one-to-four
family and multifamily (five or more units) loans. In every year for which
data is presented in this report, i.e., 1997 through 2001, the Company's
multifamily loan portfolio has increased in total dollar amount and has
represented a significant portion of the Company's total loan portfolio. See
"--Lending Activities--Loan and MBS Portfolio Composition." At June 30, 2001,
the Company's gross loan portfolio (including loans held for sale) totaled
$1.1 billion, 71.02% of which was secured by multifamily properties
(approximately $550.9 million) and commercial real estate (approximately
$240.0 million).

  Both the multifamily and the commercial real estate loan portfolios have
grown during fiscal 2001. From June 30, 2000 to June 30, 2001, the net
increase in the Company's multifamily portfolio was $45.5 million representing
a 9.00% increase in the size of the portfolio. From June 30, 2000 to June 30,
2001, the net increase in the Company's commercial real estate loan portfolio
was $43.5 million, representing a 22.12% increase in the size of the
portfolio. At June 30, 2001, the $550.9 million multifamily portfolio
represented 49.47% of the Company's gross loans and the $240.0 million
commercial real estate portfolio represented 21.55% of the Company's gross
loans. As a percentage of gross loans, the multifamily portfolio increased in
size by 0.27% and the commercial real estate portfolio increased in size by
2.42% from June 30, 2000 to June 30, 2001. See "--Lending Activities--
Multifamily Lending--Commercial Real Estate Lending."

  In addition to originating loans to hold in portfolio, the Company also
originates loans for sale. The Company sold $53.3 million of loans in fiscal
2001. The Company also purchases loans for investment and for sale. During
fiscal 2001, the Company purchased $105.6 million in loans of which $48.4
million were one-to-four family. Loans sold come from loans held in the
Company's portfolio designated as being held for sale or originated during the
most recent period and designated as held for sale. Historically, the Company
has generally retained the servicing rights on most loans sold, however, some
loans are sold servicing released. In addition, the Company invests in
securities issued by the U.S. Government and agencies thereof, mortgage-backed
securities ("MBS") and other permitted investments under applicable federal
laws and regulations. The Company's revenues are derived principally from
interest on its mortgage loans, and to a lesser extent, mortgage loan
servicing activities, and interest and dividends on its investment securities
and MBS.

  The Company's primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings from the
FHLB of San Francisco ("FHLB advances"), securities sold under agreements to
repurchase, principal and interest payments on loans and MBS and proceeds from
the sale of loans. At June 30, 2001, the Company had deposits of approximately
$916.3 million, including approximately $227.6 million in certificates of
deposit of $100,000 or more. The Company's borrowings at June 30, 2001
included $276.2 million in FHLB advances. See "--Sources of Funds."

  For the year ended June 30, 2001, the Company reported net earnings of $15.1
million, $2.90 per share diluted. This compares to net earnings of $11.8
million, $2.23 per share diluted, and $9.6 million, $1.70 per share diluted,
for the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The

                                       2
<PAGE>

increase in fiscal 2001 earnings over fiscal 2000 was primarily due to an
increase in net interest income partially offset by an increase in other
expenses. The increase in fiscal 2000 earnings over fiscal 1999 was also
primarily due to an increase in net interest income partially offset by an
increase in other expenses.

  Total assets of the Company were $1.3 billion at June 30, 2001, an increase
of $111.7 million compared to June 30, 2000. The increase in assets was
primarily in loans, with commercial real estate loans increasing $43.5
million, multifamily loans increasing $45.5 million and one-to-four family
loans decreasing $3.8 million. The asset growth was funded primarily by an
increase in deposits of $108.1 million partially offset by a decrease in FHLB
advances of $14.1 million. Included in the increase of $108.1 million of
deposits during fiscal 2001 is $49.1 million of deposits attributable to the
Bank's Wal-Mart "In-Store" branch expansion. In addition, while the vast
majority of the Bank's deposits are retail in nature, the Bank accepted $55
million in time deposits from a political subdivision during fiscal 2000.
During fiscal 2001, the Bank added an additional $10.0 million in time
deposits from this political subdivision. The Bank considers these funds to be
wholesale deposits and an alternative borrowing source rather than a customer
relationship and their levels are determined by management's decision as to
the most economic funding source. At June 30, 2001, the Company had total
deposits of $916.3 million and total FHLB advances of $276.2 million.

  The southern California real estate market in the Company's primary lending
area continued to be strong during the year. However, according to recent data
released in the UCLA Anderson Forecast, the overall economy is showing some
signs of weakness. The Company's level of nonperforming assets declined during
fiscal 2001. The Company includes nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructured
loans and real estate acquired through foreclosure ("REO") in determining its
level of nonperforming assets. At June 30, 2001, the Company reported $3.2
million in nonperforming assets compared to $4.4 million and $7.5 million at
June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company recorded provisions for loan
losses of $800,000 for the year ended June 30, 2001 compared to $1.6 million
and $1.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. See
"--Allowances for Loan and Real Estate Losses" and "Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" ("MD&A").

Lending Activities

  Loan and MBS Portfolio Composition. Historically, the Company's principal
business was the making of one-to-four family and multifamily loans. In every
year for which data is presented in this report, i.e., 1997 through 2001, the
Company's multifamily loan portfolio has increased in total dollar amount and
has represented a significant portion of the Company's total loan portfolio.
Beginning principally with the hiring announced in January 1998 of the income
property lending staff of another southern California financial institution,
the Company has increased its focus on commercial real estate lending. The
Company currently intends to continue its emphasis on multifamily and
commercial real estate lending, with their higher risk-adjusted rates of
return, rather than on lower yielding one-to-four family lending. At June 30,
2001, the Company had $1.1 billion of gross loans outstanding, 71.02% of which
was secured by either multifamily properties or commercial real estate. Gross
loans outstanding at June 30, 2001 included $550.9 million of multifamily
loans, representing 49.47% of gross loans, $240.0 million of commercial real
estate loans, representing 21.55% of gross loans, and $311.9 million of one-
to-four family loans, representing 28.01% of gross loans. The remainder of
gross loans at June 30, 2001 consisted of $1.7 million of land loans, or 0.16%
of gross loans, and other loans of $9.0 million, or 0.81% of gross loans.
Included in these amounts at June 30, 2001 were $4.6 million of loans held for
sale, comprising 0.41% of gross loans.

  The net increase in the Company's multifamily loans during fiscal 2001 was
$45.5 million, representing an increase of 9.00% in the multifamily loan
portfolio as compared to June 30, 2000. The

                                       3
<PAGE>

net increase in the Company's commercial real estate loans during fiscal 2001
was $43.5 million, representing an increase of 22.12% in the commercial real
estate loan portfolio as compared to June 30, 2000. The net decrease in the
Company's one-to-four family loans during fiscal 2001 was $3.8 million,
representing a decrease of 1.20% in the one-to-four family loan portfolio as
compared to June 30, 2000. As a percentage of gross loans, multifamily loans
increased by 0.27%, commercial loans increased by 2.42% and one-to-four family
loans decreased by 2.72% from June 30, 2000 to June 30, 2001. These percentage
changes in the composition of the gross mortgage loan portfolio are a result
of the relative growth of the multifamily and commercial real estate loan
portfolios and the Company's sale of approximately 33% of the one-to-four
family loans it originated during the 2001 fiscal year. The Company currently
intends to continue to focus on multifamily and commercial real estate
lending. During fiscal 2001, the Company purchased $105.6 million in loans of
which $48.4 million were one-to-four family. The Company anticipates that the
purchase of one-to-four family loans will remain a focus of the Company in
fiscal 2002.

  The Company invests in MBS, including securities guaranteed by the
Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA"), Federal National Mortgage
Association ("FNMA") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC"). To
a limited extent the Company also invests in privately issued MBS which
typically have received a "AA" or "AAA" credit rating from at least one
nationally recognized rating service. The Company invests in both adjustable-
rate and fixed-rate MBS. In an effort to reduce the potential interest rate
risk inherent in fixed-rate assets, the Company purchases fixed-rate MBS with
a variety of coupon rates, maturities, and prices. Furthermore, the assets are
typically purchased with fixed-rate FHLB advances of various terms to maturity
primarily ranging from one month to five years in order to mitigate the
Company's exposure to changes in interest rates. The adjustable-rate MBS in
the Company's portfolio typically have life caps that will prevent the MBS
from further upward adjustments in rate should interest rates rise above the
cap limit. Prior to purchase, management considers the Company's overall
tolerance to interest rate risk and invests accordingly. At June 30, 2001, the
Company's MBS portfolio (including MBS available for sale) totaled
$125.6 million or 9.56% of total assets. The Company's MBS are comprised of
$88.7 million of agency securities, $9.1 million issued by other financial
institutions and $27.8 million in collateralized mortgage obligations
("CMO's"). Of the $27.8 million in CMO's, 49.39% or $13.7 million are agency
guaranteed. For all years presented, the CMO's represent non-equity senior
interests in mortgage pass-through certificates and were of investment grade.
At June 30, 2001, $25.2 million in MBS were classified as available for sale.

(1) ARM loans include loans that adjust monthly, semiannually, annually or
    once every five years. Five year ARM loans total $1.6 million one-to-four
    family, $50.6 million multifamily and $113.4 million commercial real
    estate.

  Origination, Purchase, Sale and Servicing of Loans. The Company's mortgage
lending activities are conducted primarily through its executive and branch
offices. The Company originates both fixed-rate and ARM loans. Its ability to
originate ARM loans as opposed to fixed-rate loans is dependent upon the
relative customer demand, which is affected by the current and expected future
level of interest rates.

  Additionally, the Company purchases or participates in loans originated by
other institutions. The determination to purchase loans is based upon the
Company's investment needs and market opportunities. Subject to regulatory
restrictions applicable to savings associations, the Company's current loan
policies allow all loan types to be purchased. The determination to purchase
specific loans or pools of loans is subject to the Company's underwriting
policies, which require consideration of the financial condition of the
borrower and the appraised value of the property and, with respect to
multifamily and commercial real estate loans, the net operating income of the
mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation and the

                                       6
<PAGE>

debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt
service), among other factors. The Company has purchased loans from
independent parties in various transactions. During the year ended June 30,
2001, of the $329.5 million of loans generated by the Company in fiscal 2001
through origination or purchase, $105.6 million, or 32.04%, were purchased. Of
the $105.6 million of loans purchased during fiscal 2001, $12.9 million were
multifamily loans, $44.3 million were commercial real estate loans and $48.4
million were one-to-four family loans.

  At origination or time of purchase, the Company designates loans as held for
investment or held for sale. Historically, loans held for sale have been sold
in the secondary market to FNMA, FHLMC and other investors. The Company
generally retains the servicing rights on most loans sold, however, certain
loans are sold servicing released. The determination to sell a specific loan
or pool of loans is made based upon the Company's investment needs, growth
objectives and market opportunities.

  In an attempt to further minimize interest rate risk associated with fixed-
rate loans designated as held for sale, the Company may enter into commitments
with FNMA and other investors (known as forward commitments) to sell loans at
a future date at a specified price. The Company will then simultaneously
process and close the loans, thereby attempting to protect the price of loans
in process from interest rate fluctuations that may occur from application to
sale. There is risk involved in this forward commitment activity. In a
declining interest rate environment, borrowers may choose not to close loans,
but the Company would remain obligated to fulfill its forward commitments. The
inability of the Company to originate or acquire loans to fulfill these
commitments may result in the Company being required to pay non-delivery fees.
In an increasing interest rate environment, the Company is subject to interest
rate risk in the event its commitments to make loans to borrowers exceeds its
commitments to sell loans. At June 30, 2001, the Company had $1.0 million in
forward commitments with respect to fixed rate loans held for sale. At June
30, 2000, the Company had no forward commitments with respect to fixed rate
loans held for sale.

  The Company sells loans and participations in loans with yield rates to the
investors based upon current market rates. Gain or loss is recognized to the
extent that the selling prices differ from the carrying value of the loans
sold based on the estimated relative fair values of the assets sold and any
retained interests, less any liabilities incurred. The assets obtained on sale
are generally loan servicing assets. Liabilities incurred in a sale may
include recourse obligations or servicing liabilities. At June 30, 2001, the
Company had mortgage servicing assets related to loans sold, servicing
retained with a book value of $133,000.

  In addition to retaining the servicing assets for originated loans, the
Company may also purchase mortgage servicing assets related to mortgage loans
originated by other institutions. The Company's current loan policies provide
that the aggregate amount of purchased mortgage servicing shall not exceed 75%
of the total loans in the Company's portfolio that are serviced for others. At
June 30, 2001, the Company had purchased mortgage servicing assets with a book
value of $304,000.

  Multifamily Lending. During the year ended June 30, 2001, the Company
originated $137.9 million of multifamily loans. The Company originates
multifamily mortgage loans generally secured by apartment buildings located in
southern California metropolitan areas. To a lesser extent, multifamily loans
are also originated and purchased in central and northern California. In
originating a multifamily loan, the Company considers the qualifications of
the borrower as well as the securing property. Some of the foremost factors to
be considered are the net operating income of the mortgaged property before
debt service and depreciation, the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of
net operating income to debt service) and the ratio of the loan amount to the
appraised value of the property. Pursuant to the Company's underwriting
policies, a multifamily loan generally may only be made in an amount up to 80%
of the appraised value of the underlying property. The Company also generally
requires a debt service coverage ratio of at least 110%. Properties securing a
loan are appraised by an independent appraiser and title insurance is required
on all loans. The average outstanding loan balance on multifamily loans at
June 30, 2001 was approximately $379,000, with the largest loan being
$3.2 million. The property collateralizing this loan is located in Santa Ana,
California and the loan was not classified at June 30, 2001. Declines in the
real estate values in the Company's primary lending area may result in
increases in the loan-to-value ratio on some multifamily mortgage loans
subsequent to origination.

                                       8
<PAGE>

  When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower for a multifamily loan,
the Company considers the financial resources and income level of the
borrower, the borrower's experience in owning or managing similar property,
and the Company's lending experience with the borrower. The Company's
underwriting policies require that the borrower be able to demonstrate strong
management skills and the ability to maintain the property with current rental
income. The borrower should also present evidence of the ability to repay the
mortgage and a history of making mortgage payments on a timely basis. In
assessing the creditworthiness of the borrower, the Company generally reviews
the financial statements, employment and credit history of the borrower, as
well as other related documentation.

  At June 30, 2001, the Company's multifamily loan portfolio had increased to
$550.9 million, or 49.47% of gross loans, from $505.4 million, or 49.20% of
gross loans, at June 30, 2000, an increase of $45.5 million. The multifamily
loan portfolio increased in total dollar amount during fiscal 2001 by 9.00%,
and as a percentage of gross loans by 0.27%. Of the $550.9 million multifamily
loans outstanding at June 30, 2001, 3.86% were fixed-rate loans and 96.14%
were ARM loans. Of the 96.14% of ARM loans, 9.55% or $50.6 million are tied to
a treasury bill based index that adjusts once every five years.

  Multifamily loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of
credit risk and to be more vulnerable to adverse conditions in the real estate
market and to deteriorating economic conditions, particularly changes in
interest rates than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. These loans
typically involve higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of such
loans generally depends on the income produced by the operation or sale of the
property being sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service.
Sometimes multifamily loans are made to groups of related borrowers, which
concentration could increase the Company's exposure should the circumstances
of one borrower negatively affect the ability of other related borrowers to
repay their loans in full on a timely basis. Recessionary economic conditions
tend to result in higher vacancy and reduced rental rates and net operating
incomes from multifamily residential properties. Of the Company's $18,000 of
charge-offs in fiscal 2001, none were for multifamily loans. See "--Allowances
for Loan and Real Estate Losses."

  Commercial Real Estate Lending. During fiscal 2001, the Company originated
$51.6 million of commercial real estate loans. The Company originates
commercial real estate loans that are generally secured by properties used for
business purposes such as small office buildings, multi-tenant industrial
properties or a combination of residential and retail facilities located
primarily in southern California. To a lesser extent, commercial real estate
loans are also originated and purchased in central and northern California.
The Company's underwriting procedures provide that commercial real estate
loans generally may be made in amounts up to 75% of the appraised value of the
property. These loans may be made with terms up to 30 years for ARM loans. The
Company's underwriting standards and procedures are similar to those
applicable to its multifamily loans, wherein the Company considers the net
operating income of the property and the borrower's expertise, credit history
and profitability. The Company has generally required that the properties
securing commercial real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios of at
least 110%. The average outstanding loan balance on commercial real estate
loans at June 30, 2001 was approximately $608,000. The largest commercial real
estate loan in the Company's portfolio, located in Huntington Beach,
California had an outstanding principal balance at June 30, 2001 of $3.4
million and the loan was not classified.

  At June 30, 2001, the Company's commercial real estate loan portfolio had
increased to $240.0 million, or 21.55% of gross loans, from $196.5 million, or
19.13% of gross loans, at June 30, 2000, an increase of $43.5 million, or
2.42% of gross loans. This $43.5 million increase in the commercial real
estate loan portfolio during fiscal 2001 represents a 22.12% increase in the
total dollar amount of the commercial real estate portfolio. Of the $240.0
million commercial real estate loans outstanding at June 30, 2001, 10.10% were
fixed-rate loans and 89.90% were ARM loans. Of the 89.90% of ARM loans, 52.57%
or $113.4 million are tied to a treasury bill bond index that adjusts once
every five years.

  Commercial real estate loans are generally considered to involve a higher
degree of credit risk and to be more vulnerable to adverse conditions in the
real estate market and to deteriorating economic conditions, particularly
changes in interest rates than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.
These loans typically involve higher loan principal amounts and the repayment
of such loans generally depends on the income produced by the operation or
sale of the property being sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt
service. Sometimes commercial real estate loans are made to groups of related
borrowers, which concentration could increase the Company's exposure should
the circumstances of one borrower negatively affect the ability of other
related borrowers to repay their loans in full on a timely basis. Recessionary
economic conditions tend to result in higher vacancy and reduced rental rates
and net operating incomes from commercial properties. In addition, commercial
real estate values tend to be cyclical. Of the Company's $18,000 of charge-
offs in fiscal 2001, none were for commercial real estate loans. The Company
has significantly increased its commercial real estate loan portfolio during
the past three fiscal years. Both because the size of the commercial real
estate loan portfolio has increased significantly and most of the loans
comprising the portfolio are unseasoned, having been originated within the
last three fiscal years, the Company's past loss experience with respect to
its commercial real estate loan portfolio may not be representative of the
risk of loss in such portfolio in the future. See "--Allowances for Loan and
Real Estate Losses."

  One-to-Four Family Lending. The Company originates both fixed-rate mortgage
loans and ARM loans secured by one-to-four family residences, including, to a
lesser extent, condominium and cooperative units with maturities up to 30
years. Originated loans are predominantly secured by property located in
southern California. Loan originations are generally obtained from existing or
past customers, residents of the local communities and loan brokers. One-to-
four family loans are purchased with properties securing the loans located
throughout the state of California and in certain circumstances outside of
California. Included in one-to-four family loans are outstanding balances of
$19.6 million of adjustable rate home equity credit lines tied to the Wall
Street Prime index. These loans are generally secured by a first or second
trust deed, with maturities up to 25 years.

  During the year ended June 30, 2001, the Company originated $34.1 million of
one-to-four family loans. The Company's policy is to originate one-to-four
family loans in amounts generally up to 80% of the lower of the appraised
value or the selling price of the property securing the loan and up to 95% of
the appraised value or selling price if private mortgage insurance is
obtained. Declines in the real estate values in the Company's lending areas
may result in increases in the loan-to-value ratio on some one-to-four family
loans subsequent to origination.

  At June 30, 2001, the Company's one-to-four family loan portfolio had
decreased to $311.9 million, or 28.01% of gross loans, from $315.7 million, or
30.73% of gross loans, at June 30, 2000, a decrease of $3.8 million. The one-
to-four family loan portfolio decreased in total dollar amount during fiscal
2001 by 1.20%, and decreased as a percentage of gross loans by 2.72%. During
fiscal 2001, one-to-four family loans purchased were $48.4 million. Of the
$311.9 million one-to-four family loans outstanding at June 30, 2001, 35.18%
were fixed-rate loans and 64.82% were ARM loans.

  Certain Loan Terms. Since 1982, the Company has emphasized the origination
of ARM loans for retention in its portfolio. This practice has enabled the
Company to reduce its interest rate risk exposure by concentrating its loan
portfolio in assets with either shorter terms or more frequent repricing, or
both. At June 30, 2001, approximately 96.14% of the Company's multifamily,
89.90% of its commercial real estate and 64.82% of its one-to-four family
loans were ARM loans. The Company also originates fixed-rate loans in response
to customer demand. The type of loans the Company originates is dependent upon
the relative customer demand for fixed-rate or ARM loans, which in turn is
affected by the current and expected level of interest rates. Historically,
the Company has sold fixed-rate loans in the secondary market to FNMA, FHLMC
and others. During fiscal 2001, the Company retained certain fixed-rate loans
in its portfolio.

                                      10
<PAGE>

  The interest rates for approximately 40% of the Company's ARM loans in
portfolio are indexed to the 11th District Cost of Funds Index ("COFI"). The
Company currently offers a number of ARM loan programs with interest rates
tied to Treasury bill based and COFI indices that adjust monthly, semi-
annually, annually or once every five years, some of which have payment caps.
Because of payment caps and the different times at which interest rate
adjustments and payment adjustments are made, in periods of rising interest
rates monthly payments may not be sufficient to pay the interest accruing on
some of the Company's ARM loans. The amount of any shortfall ("negative
amortization") is added to the principal balance of the loan to be repaid
through future monthly payments, which could cause increases in the amount of
principal owed to the Company over that which was originally lent. The Company
currently has approximately $579.7 million in mortgage loans that may be
subject to negative amortization. During the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000
and 1999, the negative amortization associated with these loans totaled
$288,000, $109,000, and $223,000, respectively. Significant negative
amortization can increase the associated risk of default on loans,
particularly for loans originated with relatively high loan-to-value ratios.
Based on historical experience, management does not believe that the loss
experience on the loans that are subject to negative amortization is
materially different from the loss experience on the balance of its portfolio.

  Mortgage loans originated by the Company generally include due-on-sale
clauses which provide the Company with the contractual right to deem the loan
immediately due and payable in the event the borrower transfers ownership of
the property without the Company's consent. Due-on-sale clauses are an
important means of adjusting the rates on the Company's fixed rate multifamily
and commercial mortgage loan portfolios and the Company has generally
exercised its rights under these clauses.

  Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. The Company's Board of Directors has
a standing Loan Committee. The Loan Committee is primarily responsible for
establishing the lending policies of the Company, review of large loans, and
insuring adherence to policies and procedures. The Board of Directors has
authorized the following persons to approve loans up to the amounts indicated:
mortgage loans in amounts of $1.0 million and below may be approved by the
respective Loan Division Manager or his designate; mortgage loans in excess of
$1.0 million and up to $1.5 million require the approval of the President or
any member of the Loan Committee; and mortgage loans in excess of $1.5 million
require the approval of at least two members of the Loan Committee.

  For all loans originated by the Company, upon receipt of a completed loan
application from a prospective borrower, a credit report is ordered and
certain other information is verified by an independent credit agency and, if
necessary, additional financial information is required. Appraisals of the
real estate intended to secure proposed loans over $150,000 are required,
which appraisals currently are performed by independent appraisers designated
and approved by the Company. The Company's Board annually approves the
independent appraisers used by the Company and approves the Company's
appraisal policy. The Company's policy is to obtain title and hazard insurance
on all real estate loans. If the original loan amount exceeds 80% of the
underlying property's value on a sale or refinance of a first trust deed loan,
private mortgage insurance is required and the borrower will be required to
make payments to a mortgage impound account from which the Company makes
disbursements for property taxes and mortgage insurance.

Delinquencies and Classification of Assets

  Delinquent Loans. Management performs a monthly review of all delinquent
loans and reports to the Company's Board of Directors regarding the same. The
procedures taken by the Company with respect to delinquencies vary depending
on the nature of the loan and period of delinquency.

  The Company's policies generally provide that delinquent mortgage loans be
reviewed and that written notices be mailed after the 11th and 17th day of
delinquency. The Company's policies provide that telephone contact will be
attempted to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects of

                                      11
<PAGE>

repayment. When contact is made with the borrower at any time prior to
foreclosure, the Company will attempt to obtain full payment or work out a
repayment schedule with the borrower to avoid foreclosure. See also "--
Nonperforming Assets and Restructured Loans."

  At June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, delinquencies in the Company's loan
portfolio were as follows:

  The loans in the above table have been considered in connection with the
Company's overall assessment of the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses.
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will not have to establish
additional loss provisions for these loans in the future. See "--Allowances
for Loan and Real Estate Losses."

  Classification of Assets. Federal regulations and the Company's
Classification of Assets Policy require that the Company utilize an internal
asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential
problem assets. The Company has incorporated the OTS internal asset
classifications as a part of its credit monitoring system. The Company
currently classifies problem and potential problem assets as "Substandard,"
"Doubtful" or "Loss" assets. An asset is considered "Substandard" if it is
inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the
obligor or of the collateral pledged. "Substandard" assets include those
characterized by the "distinct possibility" that the insured institution will
sustain "some loss" if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loans can be
considered "Substandard" for other reasons in addition to the paying capacity
and underlying collateral, based on the Company's Classification of Assets
Policy. Assets classified as "Doubtful" have all of the weaknesses inherent in
those classified "Substandard" with the added characteristic that the
weaknesses present make "collection or liquidation in full", on the basis of
currently existing facts, conditions, and values, "highly questionable and
improbable." See "--Regulation and Supervision--Classification of Assets." The
Company's Internal Asset Review Committee monthly reviews and classifies the
Company's assets and reports the results of its review to the Company's Board
of Directors.

  The following table sets forth information with respect to the classified
assets of the Company at June 30, 2001 and 2000.

  Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan", and as amended by SFAS No.
118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan--Income Recognition and
Disclosures," the Company recognizes impairment on troubled collateral
dependent loans by creating a specific valuation allowance. At June 30, 2001
and 2000, the specific valuation allowances totaled $172,000 and $521,000,
respectively. The loans for which a specific valuation allowance was
established are in the process of collection. At such time that these loans
are deemed uncollectible, the specific valuation allowance will be charged
off.

  In addition to adversely classified assets, assets which do not currently
expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification but
possess weaknesses are designated "Special Mention." According to OTS
guidelines, Special Mention assets are not adversely classified and do not
expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. At
June 30, 2001, $8.2 million of assets were graded as Special Mention, compared
to $6.4 million at June 30, 2000.

  These assets have been considered in connection with the Company's overall
assessment of the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses; however, there
can be no assurance that the Company will not establish additional loss
provisions for these assets in the future. See "--Allowances for Loan and Real
Estate Losses."

Nonperforming Assets and Restructured Loans

  After 60 days, the Company ceases the accrual of interest on loans and any
previously accrued interest is reversed. In addition, the Company may
restructure a loan due to the debtor's financial difficulty and grant a
concession which the Company would not have otherwise considered. REO is
recorded at fair value less estimated costs of disposition.

  The gross amount of interest income on nonaccrual loans that would have been
recorded during the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000, and 1999 if the
nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms was
$264,000, $312,000 and $424,000, respectively. For the years ended June 30,
2001, 2000 and 1999, $152,000, $247,000 and $295,000, respectively, was
actually earned on nonaccrual loans and is included in interest income on
loans in the consolidated statements of operations for such years included in
this report. Interest income earned on nonaccrual loans is generally recorded
utilizing the cash-basis method of accounting. See "Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data."

Impaired Loans

  A loan is considered impaired when based on current circumstances and
events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts
due according to the contractual terms of the loan

                                      14
<PAGE>

agreement. Creditors are required to measure impairment of a loan based on any
one of the following: (i) the present value of expected future cash flows from
the loan discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, (ii) an observable
market price or (iii) the fair value of the loan's underlying collateral. The
Company measures impairment based on the fair value of the loan's underlying
collateral property. Impaired loans exclude large groups of smaller balance
homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment. For the
Company, loans collectively reviewed for impairment include one-to- four
family loans with principal balances of less than $300,000, commercial
properties with balances of less than $500,000 and multifamily loans with
balances of less than $750,000.

  Factors considered as part of the periodic loan review process to determine
whether a loan is impaired, as defined under SFAS 114 and as amended by SFAS
118, address both the amount the Company believes is probable that it will
collect and the timing of such collection. As part of the Company's loan
review process the Company considers such factors as the ability of the
borrower to continue to meet the debt service requirements, assessments of
other sources of repayment, the fair value of any collateral and the Company's
prior history in dealing with the particular type of loan involved. In
evaluating whether a loan is considered impaired, insignificant delays (less
than twelve months) in the absence of other facts and circumstances would not
alone lead to the conclusion that a loan was impaired.

  At June 30, 2001 and 2000, the Company had a gross investment in impaired
loans of $874,000 and $1.7 million, respectively. During the years ended June
30, 2001 and 2000, the Company's average investment in impaired loans was $1.3
million and $1.7 million respectively, and for the years then ended, interest
income on such loans totaled $104,000 and $126,000, respectively. Interest
income on impaired loans which are performing is generally recorded in
accordance with the policy for non-accrual loans. Payments received on
impaired loans which are performing under their contractual terms are
allocated to principal and interest in accordance with the terms of the loans.
At June 30, 2001 and 2000, all impaired loans were performing in accordance
with their contractual terms.

  The Company recognizes impairment on troubled collateral dependent loans by
creating a specific valuation allowance. The loans for which a specific
valuation allowance was established are in the process of collection. At such
time that these loans are deemed uncollectible, the specific valuation
allowance is charged-off.

  Impaired loans at June 30, 2001 include $874,000 of loans for which specific
valuation allowances of $172,000 had been established. At June 30, 2000, the
Company had $1.7 million of impaired loans for which specific valuation
allowances of $379,000 had been established. All such provisions for losses
and related recoveries are recorded as part of the total allowance for loan
losses.

Allowances for Loan and Real Estate Losses

  The Company maintains valuation allowances for losses on loans and real
estate that the Company's management believes to be inherent in those
portfolios. The Company's management evaluates the adequacy of the level of
the loss allowance quarterly as a function of its internal asset review
process.

  The Company's Internal Asset Review Committee meets monthly to review and
determine asset classifications and to recommend any changes to the asset
valuation allowance. This committee is comprised of the Senior Loan Servicing
Officer (Chairperson), Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer,
Senior Income Property Lending Officer, Chief Single Family Lending Officer,
Assistant Treasurer, Controller, and Internal Auditors of the Company. The
Chairperson of the Internal Asset Review Committee reports to the Board of
Director's Loan Committee regarding asset quality and the adequacy of
valuation allowances.

                                      15
<PAGE>

  The Company's management considers various factors when assessing the
adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, including risk characteristics
inherent in the collateral types, asset classifications, estimated collateral
values, local and national economic conditions, historical loan loss
experience, and the Company's underwriting policies.

  The Company's internal asset review system and loss allowance methodology
are designed to provide for timely identification of problem assets and
recognition of losses. The current asset monitoring process includes the use
of asset classification to segregate the assets, primarily real estate loans,
into types of loans. Currently loan type classifications are one-to-four
family loans, multifamily loans, commercial and land loans, and other loans.

  The allowance for loan losses consists of three elements: (i) specific
valuation allowances, (ii) general valuations allowances based on historical
loan loss experience and current trends, and (iii) allowance adjustments based
on general economic conditions and other risk factors in the Company's
individual markets.

  Specific Valuation Allowances. A specific valuation allowance for losses on
a loan is established when management determines the loan to be impaired and
the loss can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the Company's loans are
collateral dependent, therefore, specific reserves would be established based
upon the value of the underlying collateral. To comply with this policy,
management has established a monitoring system that requires an annual review
of real estate loans on commercial properties with balances in excess of
$500,000 and for multifamily loans in excess of $750,000. In addition, all
assets considered to be adversely classified or criticized are reviewed
monthly for impairment. The annual review process requires an analysis of
current operating statements, an evaluation of the property's current and past
performance, an evaluation of the borrower's ability to repay, and an
evaluation of the overall condition of the collateral. Based upon the results
of the review, a new appraisal may be required.

  General Valuation Allowances. These allowances relate to assets with no
well-defined deficiencies or weaknesses (i.e., assets are not impaired) and
take into consideration losses that are inherent within the portfolio but have
not yet been realized. General valuation allowances are determined by applying
factors that include the mix of loan products within the portfolio, any change
in underwriting standards, past loss experience and general economic
conditions and other risk factors. Past loss experience within homogeneous
loan categories is analyzed annually. The Company may revise general valuation
allowance factors whenever necessary in order to address improving or
deteriorating credit quality trends or specific risks associated with a given
loan category.

  General Economic Conditions and other risk factors. The Company considers
general economic conditions and other risk factors when setting valuation
allowances. These factors are based on local marketplace conditions and/or
events that could affect loan repayment. The assessment of general economic
conditions inherently involves a higher degree of uncertainty as it requires
management to anticipate the impact that economic trends, legislative actions
or other unique market and/or portfolio issues have on estimated credit
losses. For example, in assessing economic risks in the marketplace,
management considers local unemployment trends, real estate absorption rates,
expansion and contraction plans of major employers, and other similar
indicators. Consideration of other risk factors typically includes recent loss
experience in specific portfolio segments, trends in loan quality,
concentrations of credit risk together with any internal administrative risk
factors. These risk factors are carefully reviewed by management and are
revised as conditions indicate.

  The Company has significantly increased its commercial and industrial real
estate loan portfolio in recent years to a level of 21.55% of total gross
loans at June 30, 2001, compared to 19.13%, and 16.48% at June 30, 2000 and
1999, respectively. Both because the size of the commercial real estate loan
portfolio has increased significantly and most of the loans comprising the
portfolio are

                                      16
<PAGE>

unseasoned, having been originated within the last four fiscal years, the
Company's past loss experience with respect to its commercial real estate loan
portfolio may not be representative of the risk of loss in such portfolio in
the future. Multifamily and commercial real estate are generally considered to
involve a higher degree of credit risk and to be more vulnerable to adverse
conditions in the real estate market and to deteriorating economic conditions,
particularly changes in interest rates, than one-to-four family residential
mortgage loans. As a result of the potentially higher risk of these loans, a
higher level of general allowance for loan losses have been allocated to the
multifamily and commercial real estate portfolios. These loans typically
involve higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of such loans
generally depend on the income produced by the operation or sale of the
property being sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. In
addition, multifamily and commercial real estate values tend to be more
cyclical and, while the southern California real estate market remained strong
in 2001, recessionary economic conditions of the type that prevailed in prior
years in the Company's lending market area tend to result in higher vacancy
and reduced rental rates and net operating incomes from multifamily and
commercial real estate properties. According to recent data released in The
UCLA Anderson Forecast, the overall economy is showing some signs of weakness.
See "Business--Lending Activities--Multifamily Lending" and "--Commercial Real
Estate Lending."

  The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $800,000 for the year
ended June 30, 2001, compared to $1.6 million, $1.7 million, $1.5 million and
$3.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999, 1998, and 1997,
respectively. The decrease in the provision for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal
2000 is primarily the result of lower loan growth than in prior years,
however, the amount provided was deemed necessary due to the increase in the
loan portfolio during fiscal 2001. The provision in fiscal 2000 and fiscal
1999 was comparable due to similar loan growth compared to prior years. The
decrease in the provision for fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1997 was
primarily a result of decreased charge-offs and nonaccrual loans during this
period.

  Although the Company believes that the allowance for loan losses at June 30,
2001 is adequate, there can be no assurance that the Company will not have to
establish additional loss provisions based upon future events. The Company
will continue to monitor and modify its allowances for loan losses as
conditions dictate. In addition, the OTS and the FDIC, as an integral part of
their examination process, periodically review the Company's valuation
allowance. These agencies may require the Company to establish additional
allowances, based on their judgments of the information available at the time
of the examination. See "Regulation and Supervision--Classification of
Assets."

  The policy for loans secured by real estate, which comprise the bulk of the
Company's portfolio, is to establish an allowance for loan losses in
accordance with the Company's asset classification process, based on generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). It has generally been the practice of
the Company to "charge-off" losses after acquiring title to a property
securing the loan. Prior to acquiring title to REO, losses are recognized
through the establishment of valuation allowances. It is the Company's general
policy to obtain appraisals on the underlying property for loans over $500,000
that are 90 days or more past due. If the loan amount is under $500,000,
appraisals are obtained at the time of foreclosure. It is the policy of the
Company to obtain an appraisal on all REO upon acquisition by the Company.

  REO is initially recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, less
estimated costs of disposition. Thereafter, if there is a further
deterioration in value, the Company writes down the REO directly for the
diminution in value. Real estate held for investment is carried at the lower
of cost or net realizable value. All costs of anticipated disposition are
considered in the determination of net realizable value.

(1) In 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998, and 1997, total specific allowances amounted to
    $172,000, $521,000, $465,000, $1.7 million, and $1.6 million, respectively.

                                       19

  In fiscal 1999, the Company began purchasing one-to-four family loans
outside the state of California. The Company increased the allocation of the
general allowance element for this category of loans as compared to fiscal
1998 as a result of purchasing loans outside of it's primary geographic
lending area which are serviced by others. The allocation of this element
related to one-to-four family loans remained consistent from fiscal 1999 to
fiscal 2000 as loan growth in the one-to-four family loan category was
comparable. The Company re-evaluated it's allocation of general allowance
within this category in fiscal 2001. The allocation of this element was
reduced from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 as the Company experienced continued
seasoning of the one-to-four family loan portfolio with minor new production
during fiscal 2001, continued paydowns and no charge-offs in the two years
subsequent to the fiscal 1999 purchase of the loan portfolio and an overall
increase in single family real estate prices during fiscal 2001.

  The allocation of the general allowance element increased for the multi-
family and commercial loan categories from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. The
increase in this element was due to loan growth experienced by the Company in
fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. The allocation of the general
allowance element from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000 for these two loan
categories remained comparable due to consistent loan growth year over year.

Investment Activities

  Federally chartered savings associations such as the Bank have the authority
to invest in various types of liquid assets, including United States Treasury
obligations, securities of various federal agencies, certain certificates of
deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, certain bankers'
acceptances, repurchase agreements and federal funds. Subject to various
restrictions, federally chartered savings institutions may also invest their
assets in commercial paper, investment grade corporate debt securities and
mutual funds whose assets conform to the investments that a federally
chartered savings institution is otherwise authorized to make directly.
Additionally, a federally chartered savings institution such as the Bank must
maintain minimum levels of investments that qualify as liquid assets under OTS
regulations. See "--Regulation and Supervision--Required Liquidity." The Bank
currently manages liquid assets at the minimum level required under OTS
requirements in an effort to maximize overall yield on its investment
portfolio.

  The investment policy of the Company attempts to provide and maintain
liquidity, generate a favorable return on investments without incurring undue
interest rate and credit risk, and complement the Company's lending
activities. Specifically, the Company's policy generally limits investments to
government and federal agency-backed securities and other non-government
guaranteed securities, including corporate debt obligations, that are
investment-grade. The Company's policy authorizes investment in marketable
equity securities meeting the Company's guidelines. The policy requires that
all investment purchases be ratified by the Board of Directors of the Company.
At June 30, 2001, the Company had federal funds sold and other short-term
investments and investment securities in the aggregate amount of $39.7 million
with a fair value of $39.8 million.

Sources of Funds

  General. Deposits, FHLB advances, securities sold under agreements to
repurchase, loan repayments and prepayments, and proceeds from sales of loans
are the primary sources of the Company's funds for use in lending, investing
and for other general purposes.

  Deposits. The Company offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of
interest rates and terms. The Company's deposits consist of passbook savings,
checking accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. The flow
of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions,
changes in money market rates, prevailing interest rates and competition. The
Company's deposits are obtained predominantly from the areas in which its
branch offices are located.

                                      21
<PAGE>

The Company relies primarily on customer service and long-standing
relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits; however,
market interest rates and rates offered by competing financial institutions
significantly affect the Company's ability to attract and retain deposits.
Certificate of deposit accounts in excess of $100,000 are not actively
solicited by the Company nor does the Company currently use brokers to obtain
deposits. The bank opened four "in-store" Wal-Mart branches in calendar year
2000 and an additional two "in-store" branches in the first six months of
calendar year 2001. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, the Wal-Mart "in-
store" branch growth of $49.1 million represents 45.42% of the total deposit
growth for the fiscal year. In addition, while the vast majority of the Bank's
deposits are retail in nature, the Bank accepted $55.0 million in time
deposits from a political subdivision during fiscal 2000. An additional $10.0
million was accepted from this political subdivision in fiscal 2001. The Bank
considers these funds to be wholesale deposits and an alternative borrowing
source rather than a customer relationship and their levels are determined by
management's decision as to the most economic funding sources. Management
continually monitors the Company's certificate accounts and historically the
Company has retained a large portion of such accounts upon maturity. See
"MD&A--Capital Resources and Liquidity--Sources of Funds and Liquidity."

  Borrowings. From time to time the Company has obtained advances from the
FHLB and may do so in the future as an alternative to retail deposit funds.
FHLB advances may also be used to acquire certain other assets as may be
deemed appropriate for investment purposes. These advances are collateralized
by the capital stock of the FHLB held by the Company and certain of the
Company's mortgage loans. See "--Regulation and Supervision--Federal Home Loan
Bank System." Such advances are made pursuant to several different credit
programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. The
maximum amount that the FHLB will advance to member institutions, including
the Company, for purposes other than meeting withdrawals, fluctuates from time
to time in accordance with the policies of the OTS and the FHLB. During fiscal
2001, the Company periodically borrowed advances to provide needed liquidity
and to supplement retail deposit gathering activity. See "MD&A--Capital
Resources and Liquidity--Sources of

Subsidiary Activities

  QCFC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank, is currently engaged, on an
agency basis, in the sale of mutual funds and annuity products primarily to
the Bank's customers and members of the local community, and as a trustee of
the Bank's deeds of trust. In the past, QCFC has been involved in real estate
development projects. The Bank does not currently anticipate engaging in any
real estate development projects through QCFC or otherwise in the immediate
future. As of June 30, 2001, and for the year then ended, QCFC had $419,000 in
total assets and net income of $136,000.

Competition

  Savings associations face strong competition both in attracting deposits and
making real estate loans. The Company's most direct competition for deposits
has historically come from other savings associations and from commercial
banks located in its principal market areas of Los Angeles and Orange Counties
in California, including many large financial institutions which have greater
financial and marketing resources available to them. In addition, particularly
during times of high interest rates, the Company has faced significant
competition for investors' funds from short-term money market securities and
other corporate and government securities and mutual funds which invest in
such securities. Periods of low interest rates have made the attraction and
retention of deposits difficult as savers seek higher rates of return in
alternative investments. The ability of the Company to attract and retain
savings deposits depends on its ability to generally provide a rate of return,
liquidity and risk comparable to that offered by competing investment
opportunities. Management considers the Company's reputation for financial
strength and quality service provided through its contiguous branching network
to local customers to be a major competitive advantage in attracting and
retaining savings deposits.

  The Company experiences strong competition for real estate loans principally
from other savings associations, commercial banks and mortgage banking
companies. It competes for loans principally through the interest rates and
loan fees it charges and the efficiency and quality of services it provides
borrowers. Management considers the Company's focus in multifamily and low-to-
moderate income lending in the Los Angeles area to be a competitive advantage
also. Competition may increase as a result of the continuing reduction in
restrictions on the interstate operations of financial institutions.

                                      24
<PAGE>

  Under legislation adopted by Congress in 1994, bank holding companies based
in any state generally are allowed to acquire banks in California and banks
based in any state generally are allowed to acquire by merger banks based in
California. Under OTS regulations, federal savings associations have been
generally able to branch nationwide as long as the association's assets
attributable to each state outside of its home state in which it operates
branches are predominantly housing-related assets. The increased authority of
bank holding companies and banks to engage in interstate banking will allow
them to compete more effectively with savings associations.

Personnel

  As of June 30, 2001, the Bank had 177 full-time employees and 53 part-time
employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit
and the Bank considers its relationship with its employees to be good.

Federal Taxation

  General. The Company reports its income for tax purposes using the accrual
method of accounting and will be subject to federal income taxation in the
same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly
the Bank's reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of
tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a
comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company.

  Tax Bad Debt Reserve. Prior to 1996, savings institutions such as the Bank
which meet certain definitional tests primarily relating to their assets and
the nature of their business ("qualifying thrifts") were permitted to
establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions thereto, which
additions, within specified formula limits, were deducted in arriving at their
taxable income. The Bank's deduction with respect to "qualifying loans,"
generally loans secured by certain interests in real property, was computed
using the Bank's actual loss experience, or 8% of the Bank's taxable income.
Use of the percentage of taxable income method of calculating its deductible
addition to its loss reserve had the effect of reducing the maximum marginal
rate of federal tax on the Bank's income to 32.20%, exclusive of any minimum
or environmental tax, as compared to the general maximum corporate federal
income tax rate of 35%.

  Pursuant to certain provisions appended to the Small Business Job Protection
Act signed into law in August 1996 (the "Act"), the above-described bad debt
deduction rules available to thrifts such as the Bank have been repealed.
Under the Act, the Bank has changed its method of accounting for bad debts
from the reserve method formerly permitted under section 593 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") to the "specific charge-off"
method. Under the specific charge-off method, which is governed by section 166
of the Code and the regulations thereunder, tax deductions may be taken for
bad debts only if loans become wholly or partially worthless. Although the Act
generally requires that qualifying thrifts recapture (i.e., include in taxable
income) over a six-year period a portion of their existing bad debt reserves
equal to their "applicable excess reserves," the Bank does not have applicable
excess reserves subject to recapture. However, the Bank's tax bad debt reserve
balance of approximately $10.9 million as of June 30, 2001 will, in future
years, be subject to recapture in whole or in part upon the occurrence of
certain events, such as a distribution to stockholders in excess of the Bank's
current and accumulated earnings and profits, a redemption of shares, or upon
a partial or complete liquidation of the Bank. The Bank does not intend to
make distributions to stockholders that would result in recapture of any
portion of its bad debt reserve. Since management intends to use the reserve
only for the purpose for which it was intended, a deferred tax liability of
approximately $3.8 million has not been recorded.

  Distributions. To the extent that the Bank makes "non-dividend
distributions" to stockholders that are considered to result in distributions
from the tax bad debt reserve for losses on qualifying real

                                      25
<PAGE>

property, then an amount based on the amount distributed will be included in
the Bank's taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in
excess of the Bank's current and accumulated earnings and profits,
distributions in redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete
liquidation. However, dividends paid out of the Bank's current or accumulated
earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, will not
be considered to result in a distribution from the Bank's tax bad debt
reserves. Thus, any dividends to the Company that would reduce amounts
appropriated to the Bank's tax bad debt reserves and deducted for federal
income tax purposes may create a tax liability for the Bank.

  The amount of additional taxable income created from a distribution from the
tax bad debt reserve is an amount that when reduced by the tax attributable to
the income is equal to the amount of the distribution. The result is to tax
distributions from the tax bad debt reserve at approximately 51%. See "--
Regulation and Supervision--Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation--
Payment of Dividends and Other Capital Distributions by Association" and
"Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters"
for limits on the payment of dividends of the Bank. The Bank does not intend
to make distributions that would result in a recapture of any portion of its
tax bad debt reserve.

  The date of the Company's last complete Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") tax
audit was December, 1985. There is a three-year statute of limitations for
federal tax filings. Tax years 1997 through 2001 are considered open tax years
for IRS audit purposes.

  Dividends Received Deduction and Other Matters. The Company may exclude from
its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same
affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends received deduction
is generally 70% in the case of dividends received from unaffiliated
corporations with which the Company and the Bank will not file a consolidated
tax return, except that if the Company and the Bank own more than 20% of the
stock of a corporation distributing a dividend 80% of any dividends received
may be deducted.

State and Local Taxation

  State of California. The California franchise tax rate applicable to the
Company equals the franchise tax rate applicable to corporations generally
plus an "in lieu" rate approximately equal to personal property taxes and
business license taxes paid by such corporations (but not generally paid by
banks or financial corporations such as the Bank); however, the total tax rate
currently applicable to the Company cannot exceed 10.84% for the 2001 calendar
year. Under California regulations, bad debt deductions are available in
computing California franchise taxes using a three or six year weighted
average loss experience method. The Company and its California subsidiary file
California state franchise tax returns on a combined basis.

  The date of the Company's last examination by the California Franchise Tax
Board was December 1997. There is a four-year statute of limitations for state
tax filings. Tax years 1998 through 2001 are considered open for California
Franchise Tax audit purposes.

  Delaware Taxation. As a Delaware holding company not earning income in
Delaware, the Company is exempted from Delaware Corporate income tax but is
required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the
State of Delaware.

Environmental Regulation

  The Company's business and properties are subject to federal and state laws
and regulations governing environmental matters, including the regulation of
hazardous substances and wastes. For example, under the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act

                                      26
<PAGE>

("CERCLA") and similar state laws, owners and operators of contaminated
properties may be liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances
without regard to whether such persons actually caused the contamination. Such
laws may affect the Company as an owner or operator of properties used in its
business, and through the Bank, as a secured lender of property that is found
to contain hazardous substances or wastes.

  Although CERCLA and similar state laws generally exempt holders of security
interests, the exemption may not be available if a secured party engages in
the management of its borrower or the securing property in a manner deemed
beyond the protection of the secured party's interest. Recent federal and
state legislation, as well as guidance issued by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency and a number of court decisions, have provided
assurance to lenders regarding the activities they may undertake and remain
within CERCLA's secured party exemption. However, these assurances are not
absolute and generally will not protect a lender or fiduciary that
participates or otherwise involves itself in the management of its borrower,
particularly in foreclosure proceedings. As a result, CERCLA and similar state
statutes may influence the Bank's decision whether to foreclose on property
that is found to be contaminated. The Bank has adopted environmental
underwriting requirements for commercial real estate loans. The Bank's general
policy is to obtain an environmental assessment prior to foreclosure on
commercial real estate. See "Business--General" and "--Lending Activities--
Loan and MBS Portfolio Composition" regarding the recent and rapid expansion
of the Association's commercial real estate loan portfolio. The existence of
hazardous substances or wastes on commercial real estate properties could
cause the Bank to elect not to foreclose on the property, thereby limiting,
and in some instances precluding, the Bank from realizing on the related loan.
Should the Bank foreclose on property containing hazardous substances or
wastes, the Bank would become subject to other environmental statutes,
regulations and common law relating to matters such as, but not limited to,
asbestos abatement, lead-based paint abatement, hazardous substance
investigation and remediation, air emissions, wastewater discharges, hazardous
waste management, and third party claims for personal injury and property
damage.

Regulation and Supervision

General

  The Bank is a federally chartered savings association, a member of the FHLB
of San Francisco, and is subject to regulation by the OTS and the FDIC. The
Bank's deposits are insured by the FDIC through the SAIF, up to applicable
limits. As a result of its ownership of the Bank, the Company is a savings and
loan holding company subject to regulation by the OTS. As described in more
detail below, statutes and regulations applicable to the Bank govern such
matters as the investments and activities in which the Bank can engage; the
amount of capital the Bank must hold; mergers and changes of control;
establishment and closing of branch offices; and dividends payable by the
Bank. Statutes and regulations applicable to the Company govern such matters
as changes of control of the Company and transactions between the Bank and the
Company.

  The Company and the Bank are subject to the examination, supervision and
reporting requirements of the OTS, their primary federal regulator, including
a requirement for the Bank of at least one full scope, on-site examination
every year. The Director of the OTS is authorized to impose assessments on the
Bank to fund OTS operations, including the cost of examinations. The Bank is
also subject to examination, when deemed necessary, and supervision by the
FDIC, and the FDIC has "back-up" authority to take enforcement action against
the Bank if the OTS fails to take such action after a recommendation by the
FDIC. The FDIC may impose assessments on the Bank to cover the cost of FDIC
examinations. The FDIC is no longer able to conduct separate examinations of
the Bank except in exigent circumstances. In addition, the Bank is subject to
regulation by the FRB with respect to certain aspects of its business.

                                      27
<PAGE>

  The descriptions set forth below and elsewhere in this document of the
statutes and regulations that are applicable to the Company do not purport to
be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects
on the Company, or to identify every statute and regulations that may apply to
the Company. The following description of statutory and regulatory provisions
and proposals is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular
statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals.

Activities Restrictions

  Qualified Thrift Lender Test. The qualified thrift lender ("QTL") test
requires that, in at least nine out of every twelve months, at least 65% of a
savings bank's "portfolio assets" must be invested in a limited list of
"qualified thrift investments," primarily investments related to housing loans
and certain other assets. If the Bank fails to satisfy the QTL test and does
not requalify as a QTL within one year, the Company must register and be
regulated as a bank holding company, and the Bank must either convert to a
commercial bank charter or become subject to restrictions on branching,
business activities and dividends as if it were a national bank. At June 30,
2001, approximately 81.37% of the Bank's portfolio assets constituted
qualified thrift investments and the Bank met the QTL test each month in
fiscal 2001.

  Investment and Loan Limits. In general, federal savings institutions such as
the Bank may not invest directly in equity securities, debt securities that
are not rated investment grade, or real estate, other than real estate used
for the institution's offices and related facilities. Direct equity investment
in FNMA and FHLMC preferred stocks is allowed under Section 5 of the Home
Owners' Loan Act ("HOLA"). Indirect equity investment in real estate through a
subsidiary is permissible, but subject to limitations based on the amount of
the institution's assets, and the institution's investment in such a
subsidiary must be deducted from regulatory capital in full.

  Loans by a savings institution to a single borrower are generally limited to
15% of the institution's "unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus," which is
similar but not identical to total capital. Aggregate loans by the Bank that
are secured by nonresidential real property are generally limited to 400% of
the institution's total capital. Commercial loans not secured by real property
may not exceed 20% of the Bank's total assets, provided, however, that amounts
in excess of 10% of the Bank's total assets are used only for small business
loans. Consumer loans may not exceed 35% of the Bank's total assets. At June
30, 2001, the Bank was in compliance with the above investment limitations.

  Activities of Subsidiaries. A savings institution seeking to establish a new
subsidiary, acquire control of an existing company or conduct a new activity
through an existing subsidiary must provide 30 days prior notice to the FDIC
and OTS. A subsidiary of the Bank may be able to engage in activities that are
not permissible for the Bank directly, if the OTS determines that such
activities are reasonably related to the Bank's business, but the Bank may be
required to deduct its investment in such a subsidiary from capital. The OTS
has the power to require a savings institution to divest any subsidiary or
terminate any activity conducted by a subsidiary that the OTS determines to be
a serious threat to the financial safety, soundness or stability of such
savings institution or to be otherwise inconsistent with sound banking
practices.

  Safety and Soundness Standards. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") required the OTS to prescribe for savings
associations minimum acceptable operational and managerial standards, and
standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation. The standards
cover internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan
documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and
quality, earnings, and compensation, fees and benefits. Any institution that
fails to meet the OTS regulations promulgated under the safety and soundness
requirements must submit an acceptable plan for compliance or become subject
to the ability of the OTS, in its discretion, to impose operational
restrictions similar to those that would apply to a failure to meet minimum
capital requirements as discussed below.

                                      28
<PAGE>

  Real Estate Lending Standards. The OTS and the other federal banking
agencies have adopted regulations which require institutions to adopt and at
least annually review written real estate lending policies. The lending
policies must include diversification standards, underwriting standards
(including loan-to-value limits), loan administration procedures, and
procedures for monitoring compliance with the policies. The policies must
reflect consideration of guidelines adopted by the banking agencies that
discuss certain loan-to-value and percentage of capital limits.

Deposit Insurance

  Deposit Insurance Premium Assessments. The FDIC has established a risk-based
system for setting deposit insurance assessments on deposits. Currently, all
of the Bank's deposits are SAIF-insured. Under the risk-based assessment
system, an institution's insurance assessment will vary depending on the level
of capital the institution holds and the degree to which it is the subject of
supervisory concern to the FDIC. SAIF-assessed deposits are currently subject
to insurance premiums between 0.0% and 0.27%. The Bank's assessment rate was
0.0% as of June 30, 2001.

  Also, the FDIC assesses SAIF member and BIF member institutions to fund
interest payments on certain bonds issued by the Financing Corporation ("FICO
debt"). Until December 31, 1999, BIF members were assessed at approximately
one-fifth the rate at which SAIF members were assessed. After December 31,
1999, BIF and SAIF members are being assessed at the same rate of 0.0188% on
deposits. Currently, all of the Bank's deposits are SAIF-insured. See
"Business--Federal Taxation" for a discussion of recent changes concerning bad
debt deductions historically available to qualifying thrift institutions.

Regulatory Capital Requirements

  The OTS's capital regulations include three separate minimum capital
requirements for the savings institution industry--a "tangible capital
requirement," a "leverage limit" (also referred to as the "core capital
ratio"), and a "risk-based capital requirement." These capital standards must
be no less stringent than the capital standards applicable to national banks.
In addition, the regulation, as written, requires institutions whose exposure
to interest rate risk is deemed to be above normal to deduct a portion of such
exposure in calculating their risk-based capital requirements. OTS, however,
delayed the implementation of this requirement in 1995 and, as noted below,
has proposed eliminating it from the regulations. The OTS also has the
authority, after giving the affected institution notice and an opportunity to
respond, to establish individual minimum capital requirements ("IMCR") for a
savings institution which are higher than the industry minimum requirements,
upon a determination that an IMCR is necessary or appropriate in light of the
institution's particular circumstances. Savings institutions that do not meet
their capital requirements are subject to a number of sanctions similar to but
less restrictive than the sanctions under the Prompt Corrective Action system
described below, and to a requirement that the OTS be notified of any changes
in the institution's directors or senior executive officers.

  The three industry minimum capital requirements are as follows:

  Tangible capital of at least 1.5% of adjusted total assets. Tangible capital
is composed of (1) an institution's common stock, perpetual non-cumulative
preferred stock and related earnings or surplus (excluding unrealized gains
and losses on securities classified as available-for-sale), (2) certain
nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits and (3) the amount, if any, of
equity investment by others in the institution's subsidiaries, after deducting
(a) the institution's investments in, and extensions of credit to,
subsidiaries engaged as principal in activities not permissible for national
banks, net of any reserves established against such investments and (b)
certain non-qualifying intangible assets. Deferred tax assets whose
realization depends on the institution's future taxable income or on the
institution's tax planning strategies must also be deducted from tangible
capital to

                                      29
<PAGE>

the extent that such assets exceed the lesser of (1) 10% of core capital, or
(2) the amount of such assets that can be realized within one year, unless
such assets were reportable as of December 31, 1992, in which case no
deduction is required.

  In general, adjusted total assets equal the institution's consolidated total
assets, minus any assets that are deducted in calculating the amount of
capital. At June 30, 2001, the Bank's ratio of tangible capital to adjusted
total assets was 7.81%.

  Core capital of at least 4% of adjusted total assets. Core capital consists
of tangible capital plus (1) qualifying intangibles such as certain mortgage
servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships and (2) any core
deposit premium in existence on March 4, 1994 whose inclusion in core capital
is grandfathered by the OTS. At June 30, 2001, the Bank's core capital ratio
was 7.81%.

  Total capital of at least 8% of risk-weighted assets. Total capital includes
both core capital and "supplementary" capital items deemed less permanent than
core capital, such as subordinated debt and general loan loss allowances
(subject to certain limits). At least half of total capital must consist of
core capital. Risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying each category
of an institution's assets, including certain assets sold with recourse and
other off balance sheet assets, by an assigned risk weight based on the credit
risk associated with those assets, and adding the resulting sums. The amount
of risk-based capital, however, that may be required to be maintained by the
institution for recourse assets cannot be greater than the total of the
recourse liability. Generally, the four risk-weight categories include zero
percent for cash and government securities, 20% for certain high-quality
investments, 50% for certain qualifying one-to-four family and multifamily
mortgage loans and 100% for assets (including past-due loans and real estate
owned) that do not qualify for preferential risk-weighting. At June 30, 2001,
the Bank's risk-based capital ratio was 12.96%, and accordingly the Bank
exceeded all three of the industry minimum capital requirements.

  FDICIA required the OTS and the federal bank regulatory agencies to revise
their risk-based capital standards to ensure that those standards take
adequate account of interest-rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and
risks of nontraditional activities. The regulations of the OTS and the other
federal banking agencies provide that an institution may be required to hold
risk-based capital in excess of regulatory minimums to the extent that it is
determined either that (i) the institution has a high degree of exposure to
interest-rate risk, prepayment risk, credit risk, certain risks arising from
nontraditional activities or similar risks, or a high proportion of off-
balance sheet risk or (ii) the institution is not adequately managing these
risks. For this purpose, however, the agencies have stated that, in view of
the statutory requirements relating to permitted lending and investment
activities of savings institutions, the general concentration by such
institutions in real estate lending activities would not, by itself, be deemed
to constitute an exposure to concentration of credit risk that would require
greater capital levels.

  OTS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on March 15, 2001, soliciting
comments on whether it should make a number of changes to its capital
regulations. If adopted, the proposed rule will do the following: (1) change
the risk weighting requirements for one-to-four family homes; (2) eliminate
the requirement that a thrift must deduct from total capital certain portions
of a land loan or a nonresidential construction loan; (3) eliminate the
interest rate risk component of the risk-based capital regulations; (4)
increase the risk weight for high quality, stripped mortgage-related
securities from 20 percent to 100 percent; (5) change certain definitions; and
(6) make certain other technical changes designed to conform OTS's treatment
of reserves for loan and lease losses to that of the other banking agencies.
At this time, it is impossible to tell what any final OTS regulations amending
its Capital requirements may include, and what impact, if any, this proposed
rulemaking will have on the Bank.

Prompt Corrective Action Requirements

  FDICIA required, and the OTS has established, five capital categories to
implement a "prompt corrective action" system. These categories are: "well
capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly
undercapitalized," and "critically undercapitalized."

  An institution is treated as well capitalized if its risk-based capital
ratio is at least 10.0%, its ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets
(the "Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio") is at least 6.0%, its leverage ratio
or core capital is at least 5.0%, and it is not subject to any order or
directive by the OTS to meet a specific capital level. At June 30, 2001, the
Bank had a risk-based capital ratio of 12.96%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital
ratio of 11.72%, and a core capital ratio of 7.81%, which qualified the Bank
for the well-capitalized category. The Bank's capital category under the
prompt corrective action system may not be an accurate representation of the
Bank's overall financial condition or prospects.

  An institution will be adequately capitalized if its risk-based capital
ratio is at least 8.0%, its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is at least 4.0%,
and its core capital ratio is at least 4.0% (3.0% if the institution receives
the highest rating on the OTS CAMEL financial institution's rating system). An
institution whose capital does not meet the amounts required in order to be
adequately capitalized will be treated as undercapitalized. If an
undercapitalized institution's capital ratios are less than 6.0%, 3.0%, or
3.0% respectively, it will be treated as significantly undercapitalized.
Finally, an institution will be treated as critically undercapitalized if its
ratio of "tangible equity" (core capital plus cumulative preferred stock minus
intangible assets other than supervisory goodwill and purchased mortgage
servicing rights) to adjusted total assets is equal to or less than 2.0%.

  An institution that is undercapitalized or lower must submit a capital
restoration plan to the OTS within 45 days after becoming undercapitalized,
and the plan can be accepted only if the institution's performance under the
plan is guaranteed, up to a maximum of 5% of the institution's assets, by
every company that controls the institution. An institution that is
undercapitalized is also subject to mandatory stringent limits on expansion
and on the ability to make capital distributions, and is prohibited from
accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits and certain benefit plan
deposits. In addition, an undercapitalized institution is subject to numerous
other restrictions which the OTS may impose in its discretion, including
restrictions on transactions with affiliates and interest rates, and to the
ability of the OTS to order a sale of the institution, the replacement of
directors and management, and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. A
significantly undercapitalized institution is subject to additional sanctions
and a critically undercapitalized institution generally must be placed into
conservatorship or receivership.

  Subprime Lending. The federal banking regulatory agencies have issued joint
interagency guidelines on "subprime lending." Subprime lending refers to
programs that target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically
characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, or
bankruptcies. Such programs may also target borrowers with questionable
repayment capacity evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios.

  In January of 2001, the OTS, along with the other federal banking agencies,
issued further guidelines to regulated financial entities that engage in
subprime lending. These guidelines apply to institutions that have subprime
lending programs equal to or exceeding 25% of their Tier 1 capital, or have
subprime portfolios experiencing rapid growth or poor performance, are
administered by inexperienced management, or have inadequate control
mechanisms. At this time, the Bank does not engage in any subprime lending.
This guidance, however, may limit the Bank's ability to engage in subprime
lending in the future.

Enforcement

  All depository institutions, including savings associations, and
"institution affiliated parties" such as directors, officers, employees,
agents and controlling stockholders of depository institutions, including
holding companies, are subject to regulatory agency enforcement authority. An
institution or institution-affiliated party may be subject to a three-tier
penalty regime that ranges from a maximum penalty of $5,000 per day for a
simple violation to a maximum penalty of $1 million per day for certain
knowing violations including the failure to submit, or submission of
incomplete, false or misleading, reports. An institution-affiliated party may
also be subject to loss of voting rights with respect to the stock of
depository institutions.

Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation

  Activities of the Company. As a savings and loan holding company, the
Company must file periodic reports with the OTS, and is subject to OTS
examination. As a savings and loan holding company that acquired control of
only one savings association prior to May 4, 1999, the Company generally is
not restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in
which it may engage, provided that the Bank continues to be a QTL. See
"Regulation--Activities Restrictions--QTL Test" for a discussion of the QTL
requirements. If the Bank ceases to be a QTL, or if the Company were to
acquire another savings association and hold such association as a subsidiary
separate from the Bank, the Company would be subject to extensive restrictions
on the types of business activities in which it could engage. Such
restrictions would limit the Company to specified finance-, real estate- and
insurance-related activities.

  HOLA prohibits a savings and loan holding company such as the Company,
directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from (a)
acquiring control of another savings institution or savings and loan holding
company without prior written approval of the OTS; (b) acquiring or retaining,
with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary savings institution
or a non-subsidiary savings and loan holding company; or (c) acquiring or
retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the FDIC.
In evaluating applications by holding companies such as the Company to acquire
savings institutions, the OTS must consider the financial and managerial
resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the
effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds, the convenience
and needs of the community and competitive factors.

  On October 27, 2000, the OTS issued notice of a proposed rulemaking that, if
adopted, will require some savings and loan holding companies to notify the
OTS at least 30 days prior to undertaking certain significant business
transactions. As it is proposed, the rule requires savings and loan holding
companies to give OTS advance notice of: (1) the incurrence of debt, when
combined with all other transactions by the company and its subsidiaries other
than the thrift during the pervious 12 months, increases nonthrift liabilities
by 5 percent or more, and nonthrift liabilities after the debt transaction
equal 50 percent or more of the company's consolidated core capital; (2) any
asset acquisition or series of asset acquisitions by the holding company or
its subsidiaries during the previous 12 months that involve assets other than
cash, cash equivalents and securities or other obligations guaranteed by the
U.S. government and exceeds 15 percent of the holding company's consolidated
assets; and (3) any transaction, that when combined with all transactions
during the previous 12 months, reduces the company's capital by 10 percent or
more. These notice requirements do not, however, apply to any holding company
with consolidated subsidiary thrift assets equal to less than 20 percent of
the company's total assets or with consolidated holding company capital of at
least 10 percent.

  The proposed regulation would also formalize OTS's practices for reviewing
the capital adequacy of savings and loan holding companies. Under this
proposal, when considering the appropriate level of capital for a holding
company, the OTS will consider: (1) the overall risk of the thrift and the
consolidated entity; (2) their tangible and equity capital; (3) the holding
company's debt to capital ratio;

                                      32
<PAGE>

(4) the investments and activities funded by debt; (5) cash flows and earnings
volatility; (6) reliance on dividends from subsidiaries to service debt; and
(7) the thrift's position in the holding company's corporate structure.

  The comment period for these proposed regulations expired on February 9,
2001. At this time, it is impossible to determine the provisions of any
regulations the OTS may ultimately publish, or the impact of such regulations
on the Company or the Bank. Because of the large number of comments received
by the OTS regarding this proposal, the agency will issue another notice of
proposed rulemaking on holding company supervision for further comment.

  Affiliate and Insider Transactions. The ability of the Company and its non-
depository subsidiaries to deal with the Bank is limited by the affiliate
transaction rules, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act
which also govern BIF-insured banks. With very limited exceptions, these rules
require that all transactions between the Bank and an affiliate must be on
arms' length terms. The term "affiliate" covers any company that controls or
is under common control with the Bank, but does not include individuals and
generally does not include the Bank's subsidiaries.

  Under Section 23A and Section 11 of HOLA, specific restrictions apply to
transactions in which the Bank provides funding to its affiliates: the Bank
may not purchase the securities of an affiliate; make a loan to any affiliate
that is engaged in activities not permissible for a bank holding company; or
acquire from an affiliate any asset that has been classified, a nonaccrual
loan, a restructured loan, or a loan that is more than 30 days past due. As to
affiliates engaged in bank holding company-permissible activities, the
aggregate of (a) loans, guarantees, and letters of credit provided by the
savings bank for the benefit of any one affiliate, and (b) purchases of assets
by the savings bank from the affiliate, may not exceed 10% of the savings
bank's capital stock and surplus (20% for the aggregate of permissible
transactions with all affiliates). All loans to affiliates must be secured by
collateral equal to at least 100% of the amount of the loan (130% if the
collateral consists of equity securities, leases or real property).

  The Federal Reserve Board recently published a notice of proposed rulemaking
to promulgate regulations governing transactions with affiliates designed to
implement Sections 23A and 23B. Although entities like the Bank that are
regulated by OTS are not subject to these proposed rules, it is possible that
the OTS may initiate a parallel rulemaking or may otherwise implement Sections
23A and 23B, as applied to federal savings associations in a parallel manner.
The likelihood of any such OTS rulemaking or other action, or the impact on
the Bank, is uncertain.

  Loans by the Bank to its directors, executive officers, and 10% shareholders
of the Bank, the Company, or the Company's subsidiaries (collectively,
"insiders"), or to a corporation or partnership that is at least 10% owned by
an insider (a "related interest") are subject to limits separate from the
affiliate transaction rules. All loans to insiders and their related interests
must be underwritten and made on non-preferential terms; loans in excess of
$500,000 must be approved in advance by the Bank's Board of Directors; and the
Bank's total of such loans may not exceed 100% of the Bank's capital. Loans by
the Bank to its executive officers are subject to additional limits which are
even more stringent.

  Limits on Change of Control. Subject to certain limited exceptions, control
of the Bank or the Company may only be obtained with the approval (or in the
case of an acquisition of control by an individual, the nondisapproval) of the
OTS, after a public comment and application review process. Under OTS
regulations defining "control," a rebuttable presumption of control arises if
an acquiring party acquires more than 10% of any class of the Bank or the
Company (or more than 25% of any class of stock, whether voting or non-voting)
and is subject to any "control factors" as defined in the regulation. Control
is conclusively deemed to exist if an acquirer holds more than 25% of any
class of voting stock of the Bank or the Company, or has the power to control
in any manner the election of a majority of directors.

                                      33

  Payment of Dividends and Other Capital Distributions by Bank. The payment of
dividends, stock repurchases, and other capital distributions by the Bank to
the Company is subject to regulation by the OTS. The OTS has promulgated a
regulation that addresses a savings institution's ability to make a capital
distribution according to the institution's capital position. Effective April
1, 1999, the OTS amended its capital distributions regulation. The new rule
establishes a "safe-harbor" amounts for capital distributions that
institutions can make without OTS prior approval or notice. It also sets forth
certain conditions that specify whether a notice or an application for prior
approval of the OTS is required if the safe harbor does not apply. The OTS
retains discretion to subject institutions that meet their capital
requirements to the more stringent capital distribution rules applicable to
institutions with less capital if the OTS notifies the institution that it is
in need of more than normal supervision. The OTS retains the authority to
prohibit any capital distribution otherwise authorized under its regulations
if the OTS determines that the distribution would constitute an unsafe or
unsound practice.

  Under its regulation, an application for the prior approval of the OTS to
make a capital distribution is required if any of the following conditions are
present: the institution would not be adequately-capitalized after the
distribution, its examination ratings are not at least satisfactory or it is
considered a problem association or in troubled condition, the total amount of
all its capital distributions for the applicable calendar year (including the
proposed distribution) would exceed its net income for that year to date plus
its retained net income for the prior two years, or the distribution would
violate an applicable prohibition or OTS imposed condition on the institution.

  A 30-day advance notice is required if, as is the case with the Bank, the
institution is a subsidiary of a holding company, the institution would not be
well-capitalized after the distribution, or the distribution would reduce the
amount of or retire any part of its common or preferred stock or retire any
part of a debt instrument included in total capital (other than through a
regular payment on the instrument). If none of the above conditions are
present, an institution is not required to file an application or notice with
the OTS before making a capital distribution.

  In connection with a conversion from mutual to stock form, a savings
institution is required to establish a liquidation account in an amount equal
to the converting institution's net worth as of a practicable date prior to
the conversion. The liquidation account is maintained for the benefit of
certain eligible accountholders maintaining accounts at or prior to the date
of conversion. In the event of a complete liquidation of the converted savings
institution (and only in such event), each such accountholder is entitled to
receive a distribution from the liquidation account equal to the then current
adjusted balance of the holder's savings accounts with the savings
institution. The Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company is also
subject to restriction arising from the existence of the liquidation account
established upon the conversion of the Bank from mutual to stock form in
December 1993. The Bank is not permitted to pay dividends to the Company if
its regulatory capital would be reduced below the amount required for the
liquidation account.

  Additionally, as of June 30, 2001, the Bank had a tax bad debt reserve
balance of approximately $10.9 million. Any distribution by the Bank to the
Company that exceeds the Bank's current or accumulated earnings and profits as
calculated for federal income tax purposes would be treated as a distribution
of the bad debt reserve and would be subject to recapture taxes of up to 51%.
See "Business--Federal Taxation" regarding recently enacted changes relating
to bad debt reserve recapture. The Bank does not intend to make distributions
to stockholders that would result in recapture of any portion of its bad debt
reserve. Since management intends to use the reserve only for the purpose for
which it was intended, a deferred tax liability of approximately $3.8 million
has not been recorded.

  Enforcement. Whenever the OTS has reasonable cause to believe that the
continuation by a savings and loan holding company of any activity or of
ownership or control of any non FDIC-insured subsidiary constitutes a serious
risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of a savings and loan

                                      34
<PAGE>

holding company's subsidiary savings institution and is inconsistent with the
sound operation of the savings institution, the OTS may order the holding
company, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, to terminate such
activities or to divest such noninsured subsidiary. FIRREA also empowers the
OTS, in such a situation, to issue a directive without any notice or
opportunity for a hearing, which directive may (i) limit the payment of
dividends by the savings institution, (ii) limit transactions between the
savings institution and its holding company or its affiliates, and (iii) limit
any activity of the association that creates a serious risk that the
liabilities of the holding company and its affiliates may be imposed on the
savings institution.

  In addition, FIRREA includes savings and loan holding companies within the
category of person designated as "institution-affiliated parties." An
institution-affiliated party may be subject to significant penalties and/or
loss of voting rights in the event such party took any action for or toward
causing, bringing about, participating in, counseling, or aiding and abetting
a violation of law or unsafe or unsound practice by a savings institution.

Classification of Assets

  Savings institutions are required to classify their assets on a regular
basis, to establish appropriate allowances for losses and report the results
of such classification quarterly to the OTS. A savings institution is also
required to set aside adequate valuation allowances to the extent that an
affiliate possesses assets posing a risk to the institution, and to establish
liabilities for off-balance sheet items, such as letters of credit, when loss
becomes probable and estimable. The OTS has the authority to review the
institution's classification of its assets and to determine whether and to
what extent (a) additional assets must be classified, and (b) the
institution's valuation allowances must be increased.

  Troubled assets are classified into one of three categories as follows:

    Substandard Assets. An asset is considered "Substandard" if it is
  inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the
  obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Prudent general valuation
  allowances are required to be established for such assets.

    Doubtful Assets. Assets classified as "Doubtful" have all of the
  weaknesses inherent in those classified "Substandard" with the added
  characteristic that the weaknesses present make "collection or liquidation
  in full," on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values,
  "highly questionable and improbable." Prudent general valuation allowances
  are required to be established for such assets.

    Loss Assets. Assets classified as "Loss" are those considered
  "uncollectible" and of such little value that their continuance as bankable
  assets is not warranted.

  General valuation allowances for loan and lease losses are included within
regulatory capital for certain purposes and up to certain limits, while
specific allowances and other general allowances are not included at all.

  The OTS and the other federal banking agencies have adopted a statement of
policy regarding the appropriate levels of general valuation allowances for
loan and lease losses that institutions should maintain. Under the policy
statement, examiners will generally accept management's evaluation of adequacy
of general valuation allowances for loans and lease losses if the institution
has maintained effective systems and controls for identifying and addressing
asset quality problems, analyzed in a reasonable manner all significant
factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio, and established an
acceptable process for evaluating the adequacy of general valuation
allowances. However, the policy statement also provides that OTS examiners
will review management's analysis more closely if general valuation allowances
for loan and lease losses do not equal at least the sum of (a) 15% of assets

                                      35
<PAGE>

classified as Substandard, (b) 50% of assets classified as Doubtful, and (c)
for the portfolio of unclassified loans and leases, an estimate of credit
losses over the upcoming twelve months based on the institution's average rate
of net charge-offs over the previous two or three years on similar loans,
adjusted for current trends and conditions.

Community Reinvestment Act

  The Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") requires each savings institution, as
well as other lenders, to identify the communities served by the institution's
offices and to identify the types of credit the institution is prepared to
extend within such communities. The CRA also requires the OTS to assess the
performance of the institution in meeting the credit needs of its community
and to take such assessment into consideration in reviewing applications for
mergers, acquisitions, and other transactions. An unsatisfactory CRA rating
may be the basis for denying such an application.

  Under the CRA regulations of the OTS and the other federal banking agencies,
an institution's performance in making loans and investments and maintaining
branches and providing services in low-and moderate-income areas within the
communities that it serves is evaluated. In connection with its assessment of
CRA performance, the OTS assigns a rating of "outstanding," "satisfactory,"
"needs to improve," or "substantial noncompliance." Based on the latest
examination conducted by the OTS in 2001, the Bank was rated outstanding.

Federal Home Loan Bank System

  The Federal Home Loan Banks provide a credit facility for member
institutions. As a member of the FHLB of San Francisco, the Bank is required
to own capital stock in the FHLB of San Francisco in an amount at least equal
to the greater of 1% of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid
residential loans, residential purchase contracts and similar obligations at
the end of each calendar year, assuming for such purposes that at least 30% of
its assets were residential mortgage loans, or 5% of its advances from the
FHLB of San Francisco. At June 30, 2001, the Bank was in compliance with this
requirement. Furthermore, FHLB advances must be collateralized with certain
types of assets. Accordingly, the Bank has pledged certain loans to the FHLB
of San Francisco as collateral for its advances. See "--Financial
Modernization Legislation," below regarding legislation proposing changes in
the operation of the Federal Home Loan Bank system.

  On July 9, 2001, the federal banking regulatory agencies issued an advanced
notice of proposed rulemaking indicating that these agencies were going to
undertake a review of their CRA regulations. The agencies committed to this
evaluation upon promulgation of the current CRA regulations in 1995. This
rulemaking is designed to evaluate the regulations' effectiveness in achieving
the goals of the CRA, and comments are sought to determine whether changes to
the CRA regulations are needed. The comment period expires on October 17,
2001. At this time, it is impossible to determine the provisions of any
regulations the OTS may ultimately publish, or the impact of such regulations
on the Company or the Bank.

Required Liquidity

  The Financial Regulatory Relief and Economic Efficiency Act of 2000 repealed
the statutory liquidity requirement for savings associations, citing the
requirement as unnecessary. In light of this action, the OTS repealed its
liquidity regulations, with the following exceptions. Savings associations
must continue to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound
operation; the appropriate level of liquidity will vary depending on the
activities in which the savings association engages. The Bank's average
liquidity ratio in fiscal year 2001 equaled 4.25%; the Bank believes that this
level of liquidity is consistent with its safe and sound operation.

                                      36
<PAGE>

  The repeal of the OTS' liquidity regulations was effected as an interim rule
with request for comments. The comment period expired May 14, 2001 and the OTS
adopted the interim rule as a final rule on July 18, 2001. The Bank does not
believe this rule change will have any adverse impact on the Bank's
operations.

Federal Reserve System

  The Federal Reserve Board requires savings institutions to maintain reserves
against certain of their transaction accounts (primarily deposit accounts that
may be accessed by writing unlimited checks). For the calculation period
including June 30, 2001, the Bank was not required to maintain reserves with
the Federal Reserve Board because it maintains certain levels of cash on hand
at its branches and with the requisite custodian. If balances are maintained
to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Board, they do
not earn interest but may be used to satisfy the Bank's liquidity requirements
discussed above.

  As a creditor and a financial institution, the Bank is subject to certain
regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, including, without
limitation, Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity Act), Regulation D
(Reserves), Regulation E (Electronic Funds Transfers Act), Regulation F
(limits on exposure to any one correspondent depository institution),
Regulation Z (Truth in Lending Act), Regulation CC (Expedited Funds
Availability Act), and Regulation DD (Truth in Savings Act). As creditors of
loans secured by real property and as owners of real property, financial
institutions, including the Bank, may be subject to potential liability under
various statutes and regulations applicable to property owners, including
statutes and regulations relating to the environmental condition of the
property.

Financial Modernization Legislation

  On November 12, 1999, President Clinton signed into law the Gramm-Leach-
Bliley ("G-L-B Act") which significantly reforms various aspects of the
financial services industry. The G-L-B Act authorizes affiliations between
banking, securities, and insurance firms, and authorizes bank holding
companies and national banks to engage in a variety of new financial
activities. Among the new activities that will be permitted to qualifying bank
holding companies are: insurance underwriting and brokerage, securities
underwriting, and merchant banking. Moreover, under the G-L-B Act, the Federal
Reserve Board, in consultation with the Department of Treasury, may approve
additional financial activities for these qualifying bank holding companies.

  The G-L-B Act also permits certain national banks to establish subsidiaries
to engage in similar financial activities. National bank subsidiaries,
however, are prohibited from insurance underwriting, real estate development
and, for at least five years, merchant banking. The G-L-B Act generally will
subject banks to the same securities regulation as other providers of
securities products. The G-L-B Act also prohibits future acquisitions of
existing unitary savings and loan holding companies, like the Company, by
firms which are engaged in commercial activities, and limits the permissible
activities of unitary savings and loan holding companies that were not, or had
not submitted an application to become, a unitary savings and loan holding
company by May 4, 1999.

  The G-L-B Act imposes new requirements on financial institutions with
respect to customer privacy. The G-L-B Act generally prohibits disclosure of
customer information to non-affiliated third parties, except under certain
conditions permissible or mandated by law, unless the customer has been given
the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial
institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to
customers annually. Financial institutions, however, will be required to
comply with state law if it is more protective of customer privacy than the G-
L-B Act. On June 1, 2000, the federal banking agencies, including the OTS,
issued a joint final rule implementing the privacy provisions of the G-L-B
Act. The joint rule became effective on November 13,

                                      37
<PAGE>

2000, with compliance optional until July 1, 2001. Management does not believe
that complying with the new consumer privacy provisions or regulations will
have a significant impact on our business.

  The G-L-B Act contains significant revisions to the Federal Home Loan Bank
System. The G-L-B Act imposes new capital requirements on the Federal Home
Loan Banks and authorizes them to issue two classes of stock with differing
dividend rates and redemption requirements. The G-L-B Act deletes the current
requirement that the Federal Home Loan Banks annually contribute $300 million
to pay interest on certain government obligations in favor of a 20% of net
earnings formula. Accordingly, this change will result in a greater obligation
in years where Federal Home Loan Banks have high-income levels, thereby
reducing the returns on member's investments. In addition, the G-L-B Act
expands the permissible uses of Federal Home Loan Bank advances by community
financial institutions (under $500 million in assets) to include funding loans
to small businesses, small farms and small agribusinesses. If the increase in
the permissible uses for advances leads to an increase in demand, this may
increase the cost of borrowing. The G-L-B Act, further, makes membership in
the Federal Home Loan Bank voluntary for federal savings associations.

  The Company is unable to predict the impact of the G-L-B Act on its
operations at this time. Although the G-L-B Act reduces the range of companies
which may acquire control of the Company and with which the Company may
affiliate, it may facilitate affiliations with companies in the financial
services industry. Also, it is expected that while the operations of some of
our competitors may benefit from the G-L-B Act, those of others may be
impaired.

Online Banking Regulatory Review

  Pursuant to section 729 of the G-L-B Act, the OTS announced on June 11, 2001
that it would undertake a study to report findings and conclusions to
Congress, together with recommendations for appropriate legislative or
regulatory actions to adapt existing legal requirements to online banking and
lending. In connection with this study, the OTS solicited comments on the
following: (1) how may OTS facilitate the use of technology in financial
operations consistent with safety and soundness; and (2) how may OTS enhance
the electronic operational flexibility of savings associations, consistent
with safety and soundness. The comment period expired on August 10, 2001. At
this time, it is impossible to determine the provisions of any rules the OTS
may ultimately publish or the nature of any recommendations that the OTS may
make to Congress, or the impact of such rules or recommendations on the
Company or the Bank.

Consumer Protection Regulations

  Pursuant to the Section 47 of the G-L-B Act, in December 2000, the federal
banking regulatory agencies adopted consumer protection rules governing the
sale of insurance products by depository institutions. These rules, which
became effective on April 1, 2001, apply to any depository institution or any
person selling, soliciting, advertising or offering insurance products or
annuities to a consumer at an office of the financial institution or on its
behalf. Generally, these regulations require that, if insurance products are
sold on a depository institution's premises, the depository institution must,
to the extent practicable, keep the area where it conducts transactions
involving insurance products or annuities physically segregated from areas
where retail deposits are routinely accepted from the general public (i.e.,
teller windows and teller lines). In addition, the regulations require the
selling institution to disclose certain information to the consumer, and
provide that the depository institution may not condition the extension of
credit on the purchase of an insurance product from that financial institution
or an affiliated entity, or an agreement not to purchase an insurance product
from an unaffiliated entity.

  Through its wholly owned subsidiary, QCFC, the Company sells insurance to
the Bank's customers and other members of the local community. The G-L-B Act
imposed consumer protection

                                      38
<PAGE>

provisions apply to the Company's sale of insurance, and may limit the
Company's ability to sell insurance products through the Bank and to the
Bank's customers.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

  At June 30, 2001, the Company conducted its business through its
administrative office and seventeen retail full service branch offices. The
administrative office is located at 7021 Greenleaf Avenue, Whittier,
California 90602. The branches are located in Los Angeles, Orange and
Riverside Counties in California.

  The Company owns the building and land occupied by its administrative office
and four of its branches. The remaining thirteen branches are operated
pursuant to leases or licenses expiring at various dates through December
2012. The company does not anticipate difficulties in renewing those leases
that expire within the next several years or in obtaining other lease
arrangements, if necessary.

  As of June 30, 2001, the net book value of the owned facilities totaled $2.1
million, the net book value of the leasehold improvements was $1.5 million,
and furniture, fixtures and equipment had a net book value of $1.4 million.

  The Company continuously evaluates the suitability and adequacy of its
offices to maintain efficient and attractive facilities. The Company believes
that its current facilities are adequate to meet its present and immediately
foreseeable needs.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

  The Company is not involved in any pending legal proceedings other than
routine legal proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business. Such
routine legal proceedings in the aggregate are believed by management to be
immaterial to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

  No items were submitted to a vote of stockholders during the quarter ended
June 30, 2001.

  The Company's ability to pay dividends is limited by certain restrictions
generally imposed on Delaware corporations. In general, dividends may be paid
only out of a Delaware corporation's surplus, as defined in the Delaware
General Corporation Law, or net profits for the fiscal year in which the
dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. "Surplus" is defined
for this purpose as the amount by which a corporation's net assets (total
assets minus total liabilities) exceed the amount designated by the Board of
Directors of the corporation in accordance with Delaware law as the
corporation's capital. The Company may pay dividends out of funds legally
available therefor at such times as the Board of Directors determines that
dividend payments are appropriate, after considering the Company's net income,
capital requirements, financial condition, alternate investment options,
prevailing economic conditions, industry practices and other factors deemed to
be relevant at the time. The Company has not paid cash dividends in the past
and does not presently intend to pay cash dividends.

  The Company's principal source of income in fiscal 2001 was interest from
investments. Dividends from the Bank are a potential source of income for the
Company. On May 19, 2000, the Bank declared a $1.0 million dividend payable to
the Company based on an authorization by the Board of Directors of the Bank.
The payment of dividends and other capital distributions by the Bank to the
Company is subject to regulation by the OTS. The OTS has promulgated a
regulation that addresses a savings institution's ability to make a capital
distribution according to the institution's capital position. Effective April
1, 1999, the OTS amended its capital distributions regulation. The new rule
establishes a "safe-harbor" for capital distributions that institutions can
make without OTS prior approval or notice. It also sets forth certain
conditions that specify whether a notice or an application for prior approval
of the OTS is required if the safe harbor does not apply. Under its
regulation, an application for the prior approval of the OTS to make a capital
distribution is required if any of the following conditions are present: the
institution would not be adequately-capitalized after the distribution, its
examination ratings are not at least satisfactory or it is considered a
problem association or in troubled condition, the total amount of all its
capital distributions for the applicable calendar year (including the proposed
distribution) would exceed its net income for that year to date plus its
retained net income for the prior two years, or the distribution would violate
an applicable prohibition or OTS imposed condition on the institution. A 30-
day advance notice is required if, as is the case with the Bank, the
institution is a subsidiary of a holding company, the institution would not be
well-capitalized after the distribution, or the distribution would reduce the
amount of or retire any part of its common or preferred stock or retire any
part of a debt instrument included in total capital (other than through a
regular payment on the instrument). If none of the above conditions are
present, an institution is not required to file an

                                      41
<PAGE>

application or notice with the OTS before making a capital distribution. See
"Business--Regulation and Supervision--Savings and Loan Holding Company
Regulation--Payment of Dividends and Other Capital Distributions by Bank."

  The Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company is also subject to
restriction arising from the existence of the liquidation account established
upon the conversion of the Bank from mutual to stock form in December 1993.
The Bank is not permitted to pay dividends to the Company if its regulatory
capital would be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation
account. See "Business-- Regulation and Supervision--Savings and Loan Holding
Company Regulation--Payment of Dividends and Other Capital Distributions by
Bank."

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

  At June 30, 2001 the Company had total assets of $1.3 billion, total
deposits of $916.3 million and stockholders' equity of $104.8 million compared
to total assets of $1.2 billion, total deposits of $808.2 million and
stockholders' equity of $88.0 million at June 30, 2000. These changes
represent a 9.29% increase in total assets and a 19.05% increase in
stockholders' equity during fiscal 2001.

  The southern California real estate market in the Company's lending area
continued to be strong during the fiscal year. However, according to recent
data released in The UCLA Anderson Forecast, the overall economy is showing
some signs of weakness. The Company's level of nonperforming assets declined
from June 30, 2000, both in total dollar amount and as a percentage of total
assets. The Company currently includes nonaccrual loans 60 or more days past
due (less any specific allowances on these loans), troubled debt restructured
loans and REO in determining its level of nonperforming assets. At June 30,
2001, the Company reported $3.2 million in nonperforming assets compared to
$4.4 million and $7.5 million at June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The
Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $800,000 for the year ended
June 30, 2001 compared to $1.6 million and $1.7 million for the years ended
June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. See "Business--Allowances for Loan and
Real Estate Losses."

Results of Operations

  General. The Company reported net earnings of $15.1 million, $2.90 per
diluted share, for the year ended June 30, 2001, compared to net earnings of
$11.8 million, $2.23 per diluted share, and $9.6 million, $1.70 per diluted
share, for the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. This increase
in earnings for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily attributable
to an increase in net interest income partially offset by an increase in other
expenses. Net earnings for fiscal 2000 also includes $400,000 of recaptured
accrued taxes as a result of a favorable tax audit ruling. Without this tax
recapture, net earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 would have
been $11.4 million, $2.15 per diluted share, representing a 26% increase in
earnings per share over the previous year. The increase in net earnings for
fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily a result of an increase in
net income partially offset by an increase in other expenses.

  Interest Income. Interest income was $103.8 million, $84.5 million and $71.9
million for the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. The
$19.3 million increase in interest income in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal
2000 was primarily due to an increase in real estate loans receivable of
$146.5 million and a corresponding increase in the average yield on these
assets to 8.63% in fiscal 2001 compared to 8.10% in fiscal 2000. The $12.6
million increase in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 resulted from an
increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $168.1 million
while the average yield on interest-earnings assets decreased 0.08% to 7.87%.

  Interest Expense. Interest expense was $61.0 million, $48.9 million, and
$40.3 million for the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.
The $12.1 million increase in interest expense in fiscal 2001 compared to
fiscal 2000 was due to an increase in interest-bearing liabilities of
$160.1 million and an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing
liabilities of 0.36% to 5.40%. The $8.6 million increase in fiscal 2000
compared to fiscal 1999 resulted from an increase in the average balance of
interest-bearing liabilities of $160.3 million and an increase in the average
cost on interest-bearing liabilities of 0.07% to 5.04%.

  Net Interest Income Before Provision for Loan Losses. Net interest income
before provision for loan losses was $42.8 million, $35.6 million, and $31.6
million for the years ended June 30, 2001,

                                      45
<PAGE>

2000, and 1999, respectively. The increase in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily
resulted from the average yield on interest-earning assets increasing more
than the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities and a substantial
reduction of the cost of interest-bearing liabilities during the last quarter
of the fiscal year. The increase in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was
primarily a result of the increase in interest-earning assets relative to
interest-bearing liabilities during the year partially offset by the decrease
in the yield on interest-earning assets and an increase in the cost of
interest-bearing liabilities.

  Provision for Loan Losses. During fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, the Company
established $800,000, $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of
provisions for losses on loans. $800,000 of loan loss provision was
established during 2001 as a result of the increase in the real estate
portfolio of the Company during the year. The decrease in the provision for
fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 is primarily the result of lower loan
growth than in prior years. The provision in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 was
comparable due to similar loan growth compared to prior years. Management
considers the level of nonperforming assets, the regional economic conditions
and relevant real estate values and other factors when assessing the adequacy
of the allowance for loan losses. The southern California real estate market
in the Company's primary lending area continued to be strong during fiscal
2001. However, according to recent data released in The UCLA Anderson
Forecast, the overall economy is showing some signs of weakness. Management
considers the level of allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2001 to be
adequate. However, even though the local real estate market was strong during
fiscal 2001, there can be no assurance that nonperforming assets will not
increase and that the Company will not have to establish additional loss
provisions based upon future events.

  Other Income. Other income increased in fiscal 2001 to $5.8 million compared
to $4.7 million in fiscal 2000. Deposit fees increased to $2.5 million for
fiscal 2001 compared to $1.6 million for fiscal 2000, a 53.73% increase as a
result of a continued program, that began in the second quarter of fiscal
1998, with efforts to attract checking accounts as well as a larger deposit
base. Other income increased slightly in fiscal 2000 to $4.7 million compared
to $4.6 million in fiscal 1999. Deposit fees increased to $1.6 million for
fiscal 2000 compared to $1.1 million in fiscal 1999, a 47.84% increase. In
addition, other income for fiscal 1999 reflected gains on sale of securities
of $616,000 compared to none in fiscal 2000.

  Other Expense. Other expense increased $2.7 million during fiscal 2001
compared to fiscal 2000 primarily due to increases in compensation and
employee benefits, occupancy, and advertising expense. These increases in
other expense year over year were the result of the opening of three
additional retail branch offices in fiscal 2001. Other expense increased $1.1
million, or 6.25%, from $17.6 million in fiscal 1999 to $18.7 million in
fiscal 2000. This increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase
in compensation and employee benefits and occupancy expense. These increases
during fiscal 2000 were primarily a result of three retail banking branches
opened during the year and the purchase of a branch facility and its deposits
from another financial institution. Included in compensation and employee
benefits were expenses related to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP").
Companies that established an ESOP after 1992 are required to account for the
expense of the ESOP at the fair value of the related shares released. The
expense related to the ESOP was $1.0 million for each of the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2001, 2000, and 1999.

</TABLE>

  Income Taxes. Income taxes increased by $3.0 million from $8.3 million in
fiscal 2000 to $11.3 million in fiscal 2001. Income taxes increased by
$865,000 from $7.5 million in fiscal 1999 to $8.3 million in fiscal 2000. The
effective tax rate was 42.72%, 41.48% and 44.05% for the years ended June 30,
2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for
fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 is primarily a result of a $400,000
recapture of accrued taxes due to a favorable tax audit ruling.

  Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle. The Company implemented
SFAS No. 133 effective July 1, 1998. Upon implementation, approximately $78.0
million in MBS were reclassified from held to maturity to available for sale.
The Company has accounted for the gains or losses on the sale of any such
reclassified MBS sold within 90 days of the reclassification date as the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Any gains or losses
recorded on such reclassified securities sold 90 days or more after the
reclassification date have been recorded as gain or losses on sale of
securities available for sale. In the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the
Company sold $29.6 million of these reclassified MBS for a gain after tax of
$162,000.

Financial Condition

  The Company's consolidated assets totaled $1.3 billion at June 30, 2001,
compared to $1.2 billion at June 30, 2000. Stockholders' equity totaled $104.8
million at June 30, 2001 compared to $88.0 million at June 30, 2000.

  Loans and MBS (including assets held or available for sale) increased to
$1.2 billion at June 30, 2001, from $1.1 billion at June 30, 2000. Loans
originated and purchased for investment were $292.9 million for the year ended
June 30, 2001, compared to $299.2 million for the same period the previous
year. MBS purchased for investment increased to $42.3 million at June 30,
2001, from $12.0 million for the same period the previous year.

  At June 30, 2001, the Company's multifamily loan portfolio totaled $550.9
million, or 49.47% of gross loans, an increase of 9.0% as compared to $505.4
million at June 30, 2000, and its commercial loan portfolio totaled $240.0
million, or 21.55% of gross loans, an increase of 22.12% as compared to $196.5
million at June 30, 2000. Of the Company's $18,000 of charge-offs in fiscal
2001, all were non-mortgage loans. The Company's commercial loan portfolio
increased during the past fiscal year, increasing by approximately 22.12%.
Both because the size of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has
increased significantly and most of the loans comprising the portfolio are
unseasoned, having been originated within the last four fiscal years, the
Company's past loss experience with respect to its commercial loan portfolio
may not be representative of the risk of loss in such portfolio in the future.
See "Business--Allowances for Loan and Real Estate Losses." Multifamily and
commercial real estate loans are generally considered to involve a higher
degree of credit risk and to be more vulnerable to deteriorating economic
conditions than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. These loans

                                      47
<PAGE>

typically involve higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of such
loans generally depend on the income produced by the operation or sale of the
property being sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. Even
though the southern California real estate market was strong in fiscal 2001,
recessionary economic conditions of the type that have prevailed in past years
in the Company's lending market area tend to result in higher vacancy and
reduced rental rates and net operating incomes from multifamily and commercial
real estate properties. However, according to recent data released in The UCLA
Anderson Forecast, the overall economy is showing some signs of weakness. See
"Business--Lending Activities--Multifamily Lending" and "--Commercial Real
Estate Lending."

  Loan sales increased to $53.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2001,
compared to $48.9 million for the same period ended June 30, 2000. The
increase in loan sales is primarily a result of the sale of participation
interests in certain loan purchases during the year. Loan pools purchased in
fiscal 2001 included larger balance loans in the commercial and industrial
loan category. Loans serviced for others increased to $312.0 million at June
30, 2001 from $299.1 million at June 30, 2000.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

 Regulatory Capital Requirements

  The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989
("FIRREA"), and implementing OTS capital regulations require the Bank to
maintain certain minimum tangible, core and risk-based regulatory capital
levels. The minimum core capital requirement is 4% for all but the highest
rated savings associations. See "Business--Regulation and Supervision--
Regulatory Capital Requirements."

  The following table summarizes the regulatory capital requirements for the
Bank at June 30, 2001. As indicated in the table, the Bank's capital levels
exceed all three of the currently applicable minimum capital requirements.

</TABLE>

  In addition, FDICIA required the OTS to implement a system of regulatory
sanctions against institutions that are not adequately capitalized, with the
sanctions growing more severe the lower the institution's capital. Under
FDICIA, the OTS issued regulations establishing five separate capital
categories: "well capitalized." "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized,"
"significantly undercapitalized," and "critically undercapitalized,"
differentiated by core capital ratio, level of core capital to risk-weighted
assets and risk-based capital ratio. See "Business--Regulation and
Supervision--Prompt Corrective Action Requirements."

  An institution is treated as "well capitalized" if its core capital ratio to
adjusted total assets is at least 5%, its ratio of core capital to risk-
weighted assets is at least 6% and its total capital to risk-weighted assets
ratio is at least 10%.

  For the year ended June 30, 2001, a total of 20,000 shares had been
repurchased under previously announced plans to repurchase Company stock. Up
to 250,000 additional shares could be repurchased in the future under the
current authorization of the Board of Directors.

 Sources of Funds and Liquidity

  Sources of capital and liquidity for the Company on a stand-alone basis
include distributions from the Bank. Dividends and other capital distributions
from the Bank are subject to regulatory restrictions. See "Business--
Regulation and Supervision--Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation--
Payment of Dividends and Other Capital Distributions by Bank" and "Market for
the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters."

  The Bank's primary sources of funds in fiscal 2001 were deposits, FHLB
advances, principal and interest payments on loans and proceeds from the sale
of loans. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable
sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly
influenced by interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The Bank
also has other potential sources of liquidity, such as securities sold under
agreements to repurchase and liquidating existing short-term assets.

  The Company's cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications:
cash flows from operating activities, cash flows used by investing activities
and cash flows provided by financing activities. Cash flows from operating
activities consisted primarily of cash flows from earnings and the sale of
loans held for sale which totaled $53.3 million, $48.9 million, and $64.0
million for fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. The Company originated
loans for sale of $36.6 million, $53.0 million, and $73.7 million during
fiscal years 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Net cash used by investing
activities consisted primarily of loan originations, loan purchases and
investment purchases, offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds
from principal reductions on MBS and maturities of other investment
securities. Loans originated and purchased for investment were $292.9 million,
$299.2 million, and $276.4 million for fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively. Proceeds from principal repayments on loans were $189.9 million,
$127.3 million and $145.6 million for fiscal years ended 2001, 2000, and 1999.
Proceeds from maturities and principal payments of investment securities were
$14.7 million, $2.9 million, and $9.1 million for fiscal years ended 2001,
2000, and 1999, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities
consisting primarily of net activity in deposit accounts and proceeds from
funding and repayments of FHLB advances. The net change in deposits was an
increase of $108.1 million, $130.4 million, and $96.9 million for fiscal 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. The Bank opened three "in-store" branches in Wal-
Mart stores, the nation's largest retailer, during fiscal 2001. During the
second quarter of fiscal 2000, the Bank purchased a retail branch office and
$45.9 million of deposits from another financial institution. This branch is
located in

                                      49
<PAGE>

Rowland Heights, California. The Bank also opened three "in-store" branches in
Wal-Mart stores during the second half of fiscal 2000. All of the Bank's
existing and planned Wal-Mart "in-store" branches are located in the southern
California area. In addition, while the vast majority of the Bank's deposits
are retail in nature, the Bank accepted $55.0 million in time deposits from a
political subdivision during fiscal 2000 and an additional $10.0 million in
fiscal 2001. The Bank considers these funds to be wholesale deposits and an
alternative borrowing source rather than a customer relationship and their
levels are determined by management's decision as to the most economic funding
sources. The net repayments of FHLB advances totaled $14.1 million for fiscal
2001. The net proceeds from FHLB advances were $55.6 million and $18.7 million
for fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively.

  At June 30, 2001, the Company had $276.2 million (22.85% of total
liabilities) in advances outstanding from the FHLB compared to $290.3 million
(26.06% of total liabilities) at June 30, 2000. This reduction was primarily a
result of an increase in loan prepayments during the year due to a lower
interest rate environment and an increase in retail bank deposits. The maximum
amount of advances that the Company had outstanding at any month-end was
$318.2 million. Management anticipates that it may increase its level of
borrowings from the FHLB in fiscal 2002. See "Business--Sources and Funds--
Borrowings."

  The Company's most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The
levels of these assets are dependent on the Company's operating, financing,
lending and investing activities during any given period. At June 30, 2001,
cash and short-term investments totaled $16.8 million, an increase of 19.15%
from $14.1 million at June 30, 2000.

  At June 30, 2001, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans
of $24.1 million and $9.9 million to purchase loans. At June 30, 2001, the
Company had $25.0 million of approved undisbursed lines of credit. The Company
anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current
loan origination and purchase commitments. Certificates of deposits which have
contractual maturities in one year or less from June 30, 2001, totaled $613.9
million. If a significant portion of the maturing certificates are not renewed
at maturity, the Company's other sources of liquidity include FHLB advances,
principal and interest payments on loans, proceeds from loan sales and other
borrowings, such as repurchase transactions. The Company could also choose to
pay higher rates to maintain maturing deposits, which could result in
increased cost of funds. Historically, the Company has maintained a
significant portion of maturing deposits. While management anticipates that
there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the current
competitive rate environment, these are not expected to have a material impact
on the long-term liquidity position of the Company.

Asset/Liability Management

  The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the
extent to which such assets and liabilities are "interest rate sensitive" and
by monitoring an institution's interest-rate sensitivity "gap." An asset or
liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period
if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate
sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-
earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the
amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time
period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate
sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities. A
gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive
liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets. During a
period of falling interest rates therefore, the net earnings of an institution
with a positive gap theoretically may be adversely affected due to its
interest-earning assets repricing to a greater extent than its interest-
bearing liabilities. Conversely, during a period of rising interest rates,
theoretically, the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap position
may increase as it is able to invest in higher yielding interest-earning
assets at a more rapid rate than its interest-bearing liabilities reprice. In
addition, a positive gap may not protect an institution with a large portfolio
of ARM loans from increases in interest rates for extended time

                                      50
<PAGE>

periods as such instruments generally have periodic and lifetime interest rate
caps. Additionally, the Company's ARM loans are predominantly tied to lagging
market indicies, and rapid increases in interest rates could have a negative
impact on the Company's earnings. Accordingly, interest rates and the
resulting cost of funds increases in a rapidly increasing rate environment
could exceed the cap levels on these instruments and negatively impact net
interest income. Declining interest rates have, in general, benefitted the
Company primarily due to the effect of the lagging market indicies which has
resulted in interest income declining at a slower rate than interest expense.

  At June 30, 2001, the Company's total interest-earning assets maturing or
repricing within one year exceeded its total interest-bearing liabilities
maturing or repricing in the same time by $107.1 million, representing a one
year cumulative positive gap ratio of 8.16%. This compares to $60.6 million at
June 30, 2000, which represented a positive gap ratio of 5.04%.

  This increase in the one year cumulative gap ratio is primarily a result of
the increased prepayment speeds applied to the Company's loan portfolio in
future periods. These increased speeds are assumed because recent decreases in
market interest rates will likely result in customers refinancing and seeking
lower interest rate loans. The Company's actual experience over recent months
also support this assumption.

  The Company manages the resulting interest rate risk by extending the
maturities of various liabilities such as FHLB advances and retail
certificates of deposit.

  The Company closely monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to
its operational strategies. Management has established an Asset/Liability
Committee, responsible for reviewing its asset/liability policies and interest
rate risk position, which generally meets weekly and reports to the Board of
Directors on interest rate risk and trends on a quarterly basis. The Company's
cumulative gap position is at a level satisfactory to management. There can be
no assurances that the Company will be able to maintain its positive gap
position or that its strategies will not result in a negative gap position in
the future. The level of the movement of interest rates, up or down, is an
uncertainty and could have a negative impact on the earnings of the Company.

  The Company does not currently engage in the use of trading activities, high
risk derivatives and synthetic instruments or hedging activities in
controlling its interest rate risk. Such uses are permitted at the
recommendation of the Asset/Liability Committee with the approval of the Board
of Directors, however, the Company does not anticipate engaging in such
practices in the immediate future.

  The following table sets forth the amounts of interest-earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at June 30, 2001, which are
anticipated by the Company, based upon certain assumptions, to reprice or
mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, the
amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a
particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to
repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability. Specifically,
the Company assumed a prepayment rate ranging from 12% to 25% on ARM loans,
and 8% to 32% on fixed rate loans. Additionally, the Company utilized deposit
decay rate assumptions of 50% for passbook accounts, 15% for checking accounts
and 10% to 50% for money market deposit accounts in the one year or less
category. The range of decay rates for money market deposit accounts is due to
the market rate sensitivity of various money market checking accounts. These
decay rates are based upon the Company's historical experience, but there is
no assurance that the assumed rates will correspond to future rates. For
information regarding the contractual maturities of the Company's loans,
investments and deposits, see "Business--Lending Activities," "--Investment
Activities" and "--Sources of Funds."

  Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the
foregoing table. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have
similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different
degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on
certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in
market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind
changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as ARM loans, have
features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and
over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest
rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate
significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Finally, the
ability of many borrowers to service their ARM loans may decrease in the event
of an interest rate increase.

Average Balance Sheet

  The following table sets forth certain information relating to the Company
for the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000, and 1999. The yields and costs are
derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or
liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown except where noted otherwise.
Average balances are derived from month-end balances. Management does not
believe that the use of average monthly balances instead of average daily
balances has caused any material differences in the information presented. The
average balance of loans receivable includes loans on which the Company has
discontinued accruing interest. The yields and costs include fees which are
considered adjustments to yields.

  Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table presents the extent to which
changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets
and interest-bearing liabilities have affected the Company's interest income
and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in
each category with respect to (i) changes attributable to changes in volume
(changes in volume multiplied by prior rate), (ii) changes attributable to
changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume), and (iii) the
net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate
have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the
changes due to rate.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices

  The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto presented herein
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States of America,
which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in
terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative
purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation
is reflected in the increased cost of the Company's operations. Unlike
industrial companies, nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the Company
are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on
the Company's performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation.
Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same
extent as the price of goods and services. See "Market Risk" and "--
Asset/Liability Management."

Impact of New Accounting Standards

  In September 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities," ("SFAS
No. 140") as a replacement of SFAS No. 125 effective for disclosures in
financial statements issued subsequent to December 15, 2000 and for
transactions entered after March 31, 2001. The adoption of this statement did
not materially impact the Company.

                                      55
<PAGE>

  In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that the
purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 141 also specifies the criteria that intangible
assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be
recognized and reported apart from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 will require that
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be
amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 142 will also require that
intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their
respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and
reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.

  The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 141 immediately
and SFAS No. 142 effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2002. As of June
30, 2001 the Company has no assets classified as goodwill under the new
pronouncements. However, the Company does have core deposit premiums. Under
the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the Company expects to continue amortizing
these intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. The impact of the
adoption of SFAS No. 141 and 142 is expected to be immaterial to the Company.

  In June 2001 the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations, SFAS No. 143 applies to all entities and addresses financial
accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It
applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived
assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or the
normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of
lessees. This statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an
asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is
incurred. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the
carrying amount of the long-lived asset. SFAS No. 143 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002.
Management is currently assessing the impact of this statement.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

  Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and
rates. The Company's market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk
inherent in its lending, investing and deposit taking activities. To that end,
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure. The
Company does not currently engage in trading activities.

                                      56
<PAGE>

  The Company's profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A
sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact the
Company's earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and
liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent, or on the
same basis. The Company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on
its net interest income using several tools. One measure of the Company's
exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and
liabilities is shown in the Company's Maturity and Rate Sensitivity Analysis
under the caption "MD&A--Asset/Liability Management." Another measure,
required to be performed by OTS-regulated institutions, is the test specified
by OTS Thrift Bulletin No. 13a, "Interest Rate Risk Management." This test
measures the impact on net interest income and on net portfolio value of an
immediate change in interest rates in 100 basis point increments. Net
portfolio value is defined as the net present value of assets, liabilities,
and off-balance sheet contracts. Following are the estimated impacts of
immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels at June 30, 2001,
calculated in compliance with Thrift Bulletin No. 13a:

    months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest
    income in the various rate scenarios.
(2) The percentage change in this column represents net portfolio value of the
    Bank in a stable interest rate environment versus the net portfolio value
    in the various rate scenarios.

  The Company's primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to
minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the Company's net
interest income and capital, while structuring the Company's asset-liability
structure to obtain the maximum yield-cost spread on that structure. The
Company relies primarily on its asset-liability structure to control interest
rate risk.

  The Company continually evaluates interest rate risk management
opportunities, including the use of derivative financial instruments.
Management has focused its efforts on increasing the Company's yield-cost
spread through wholesale and retail growth opportunities.

(1) Loans are reduced for nonperforming loans but are not reduced for the
    allowance for loan losses.
(2) Total balance equals the notional amount of off-balance sheet items and
    interest rates are the weighted average interest rates of the underlying
    loans.

  Expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for prepayments of
principal. The Company uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and
expected maturities. For assets, expected maturities are based upon
contractual maturity, projected repayments and prepayments of principal. The
prepayment experience reflected herein is based on the Company's historical
experience. The Company's average Constant Prepayment Rate ("CPR") on its
total fixed-rate portfolio ranges from 8% to 32% and on its adjustable rate
portfolio from 12% to 25% for interest-earning assets (excluding investment
securities, which do not have prepayment features). For deposit liabilities,
in accordance with standard industry practice and the Company's own historical
experience, "decay factors," were used to estimate deposit runoff of 50%, 15%,
and between 10% to 50% for passbook, checking and money market deposit
accounts, respectively. The actual maturities of these instruments could vary
substantially if future prepayments differ from the Company's historical
experience.

                         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors
Quaker City Bancorp, Inc.:

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial
condition of Quaker City Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2001
and 2000 and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive
income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended June 30, 2001. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Quaker
City Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2001 and 2000 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended June 30, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

                  QUAKER CITY BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                            June 30, 2001 and 2000

(1) Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

  Quaker City Bancorp, Inc., incorporated in Delaware, is primarily engaged in
the savings and loan business through its wholly owned subsidiary, Quaker City
Bank (the Bank). At June 30, 2001, the Bank operated seventeen retail banking
offices in southern California. The Bank is subject to significant competition
from other financial institutions, and is also subject to the regulations of
various government agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those
regulatory authorities.

  The following accounting policies, together with those disclosed elsewhere
in the consolidated financial statements, represent the significant accounting
policies of the Company.

 Principles of Consolidation and Presentation

  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Quaker City
Bancorp, Inc., Quaker City Neighborhood Development, Inc., Quaker City Bank
and its wholly owned subsidiary, Quaker City Financial Corporation. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years'
consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year's
presentation.

  These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities as of the date of the statement of financial condition, and
revenues and expenses for the periods. The most significant estimate for the
Company relates to the allowance for loan losses. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

 Financial Instruments

  Accounting Standards require the disclosure of the fair value of financial
instruments, whether or not recognized on the statement of financial
condition, for which it is practicable to estimate the value. A significant
portion of the Company's assets and liabilities are financial instruments as
defined under applicable accounting standards. Fair values, estimates and
assumptions are set forth in note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

 Risks Associated with Financial Instruments

  The credit risk of a financial instrument is the possibility that a loss may
result from the failure of another party to perform in accordance with the
terms of the contract. The most significant credit risk associated with the
Company's financial instruments is concentrated in its loans receivable.
Additionally, the Company is subject to credit risk on certain loans sold with
recourse. The Company has established a system for monitoring the level of
credit risk in its loan portfolio and for loans sold with recourse.

  Concentrations of credit risk would exist for groups of borrowers when they
have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet
contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or
other conditions. The ability of the Company's borrowers to repay their
commitments is contingent on several factors, including the economic
conditions in the borrowers' geographic area and the individual financial
condition of the borrowers. The Company generally

                  QUAKER CITY BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

requires collateral or other security to support borrower commitments on loans
receivable. This collateral may take several forms. Generally, on the
Company's mortgage loans, the collateral will be the underlying mortgaged
property. The Company's lending activities are primarily concentrated in
southern California.

  Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and
rates. The Company's market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk
inherent in its lending, investing and deposit taking activities. To that end,
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure. The
Company does not currently engage in trading activities. The Company is
subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest-earning assets
reprice on a different frequency or schedule than its interest-bearing
liabilities. A majority of the Company's loans receivable and mortgage-backed
securities reprice based on the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Index (COFI).
The repricing of COFI tends to lag other interest rate indices. The Company
closely monitors the pricing sensitivity of its financial instruments.

 Cash and Cash Equivalents

  For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash
and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits and Federal funds sold and other
short-term investments. Generally, Federal funds sold and short-term
investments are held for one-day periods. The amounts included in cash and
cash equivalents and qualifying investment securities generally constitute the
Company's liquidity portfolio. The Company maintains liquidity to satisfy
regulatory requirements. The liquidity portfolio is managed in a manner
intended to maximize flexibility and yield, while minimizing interest rate
risk, credit risk and the cost of the capital required to be maintained for
such assets.

 Assets Held or Available for Sale

  The Company identifies those loans, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and
investment securities for which it does not have the positive intent and
ability to hold to maturity. If management has the positive intent and the
Company has the ability to hold such assets until maturity, they are
classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized historical cost.
Securities that are to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended
to be held to maturity are generally classified as available for sale and are
carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings
and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of income
tax effect. However, if a decline in fair value is determined to be other than
temporary, the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair
value as a new cost basis, and the amount of the writedown is included in
earnings. Gains and losses from the sales of MBS and investment securities
available for sale are recognized at the time of sale and are determined by
the specific-identification method. Premiums and discounts on MBS and
investment securities available for sale are amortized utilizing the interest
method over the contractual terms of the assets. Loans held for sale are
carried at the lower of amortized historical cost or fair value as determined
on an aggregate basis. Assets held for indefinite periods of time include
assets that management intends to use as part of its asset/liability
management strategy and that may be sold in response to changes in interest
rates, resultant prepayment risk and other factors.

 Assets Held to Maturity

  Loans, MBS and investment securities, excluding those held or available for
sale, are carried at amortized historical cost, adjusted for amortization of
premiums and discounts utilizing the interest

                                      F-9

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

method over the contractual terms of the assets. The carrying value of these
assets is not adjusted for temporary declines in fair value since the Company
has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. If a decline in
the fair value of securities is determined to be other than temporary, the
cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value as a new
cost basis and the amount of the writedown is included in earnings.

 Interest Income on Loans Receivable

  Interest income on loans receivable is accrued as it is earned. The Company
defers and amortizes both loan origination fees and the incremental direct
costs relating to the origination of loans held to maturity. Loan origination
fees and incremental direct loan origination costs on loans held for sale are
deferred and included in the computation of gain or loss upon sale of the
loans.

  The deferred origination fees and costs on loans held to maturity are
amortized into interest income utilizing the interest method over the lives of
the related loans. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status after being
delinquent 60 days, or earlier if the ultimate collectibility of the accrual
is in doubt. Whenever the accrual of interest is stopped, previously accrued
but uncollected interest income is reversed. Thereafter, interest is
recognized only as cash is received until the loan is reinstated. Accretion of
discounts and deferred loan fees is discontinued when loans are placed on
nonaccrual status.

 Allowance for Loan Losses

  The allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount management
considers adequate to cover estimated losses on loans receivable which are
deemed probable and estimable. The allowance is based upon a number of
factors, including asset classifications, economic trends, industry experience
and trends, industry and geographic concentrations, estimated collateral
values, management's assessment of credit risk inherent in the portfolio,
historical loss experience and the Company's underwriting practices. As a
result of weaknesses in certain real estate markets, increases in the
allowance for loan losses may be required in future periods. In addition,
various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process,
periodically review the Bank's allowance for loan losses. These agencies may
require the Bank to establish additional valuation allowances, based on their
judgments of the information available at the time of the examination.

 Impaired Loans

  A loan is considered impaired when based on current circumstances and
events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts
due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Creditors are
required to measure impairment of a loan based on any one of the following:
(i) the present value of expected future cash flows from the loan discounted
at the loan's effective interest rate, (ii) an observable market price or
(iii) the fair value of the loan's underlying collateral. The Company measures
impairment based on the fair value of the loan's underlying collateral
property. Impaired loans exclude large groups of smaller balance homogeneous
loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment. For the Company, loans
collectively reviewed for impairment include all one-to-four family loans with
principal balances of less than $300,000, commercial properties with balances
of less than $500,000 and multi-family loans with balances of less than
$750,000.

  Factors considered as part of the periodic loan review process to determine
whether a loan is impaired address both the amount the Company believes is
probable that it will collect and the timing of such collection. As part of
the Company's loan review process, the Company will consider such factors as
the ability of the borrower to continue to meet the debt service requirements,
assessments of other sources of repayment, the fair value of any collateral
and the creditor's prior history in dealing

                                     F-10

                  QUAKER CITY BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

with these types of credits. In evaluating whether a loan is considered
impaired, insignificant delays in payment, (less than 12 months) in the
absence of other facts and circumstances would not alone lead to the
conclusion that a loan was impaired.

  The Company recognizes impairment on troubled collateral dependent loans by
creating a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance is maintained while
the loans are still in process of collection. At such time that the assets are
deemed uncollectible, the loss is charged to the valuation allowance.

 Loan Sales and Servicing

  The Company sells loans and participations in loans with yield rates to the
investors based upon current market rates. Gain or loss on the sale of loans
is recognized to the extent that the selling prices differ from the carrying
value of the loans sold based on the estimated relative fair values of the
assets sold and any retained interests, less any liabilities incurred. The
assets obtained on sale are generally loan servicing assets. Liabilities
incurred in a sale may include recourse obligations or servicing liabilities.

  The Company may also purchase mortgage servicing assets related to mortgage
loans originated by other institutions. These mortgage servicing assets are
measured initially at fair value, presumptively the price paid. The servicing
asset is amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net
servicing income and is assessed for impairment or increased obligation based
on its fair value.

 Real Estate Held for Sale

  Real estate acquired through foreclosure (REO) is initially recorded at fair
value at the date of foreclosure, less costs of disposition. Fair value is
determined by an appraisal obtained at the time of foreclosure. Thereafter, if
there is a further deterioration in value, the Company writes down the REO
directly and charges operations for the diminution in value. Costs relating to
holding property, net of rental and other income, are expensed in the current
period. Gains on the sale of real estate are recognized at the time of sale.
Losses realized and expenses incurred in connection with the disposition of
foreclosed real estate are charged to current earnings.

  Real estate held for development is carried at the lower of cost or net
realizable value. All costs of anticipated disposition are considered in the
determination of net realizable value. Costs of holding real estate in process
of development or improvement are capitalized, whereas costs relating to
holding completed property are expensed. An allowance for losses is
established by a charge to operations if the carrying value of a property
exceeds its fair value, including the consideration of disposition costs.
Income from the sale of real estate is recognized principally when title to
the property has passed to the buyer, minimum down payment requirements are
met and the terms of any notes received by the Company satisfy continuing
investment requirements.

 Core Deposit Premium

  The Company has acquired customer deposit accounts from financial
institutions in its market area. The core deposit premium amounting to
$611,000 and $726,000, respectively, at June 30, 2001 and 2000 relates to the
value of the depositor relationship and is included in other assets which is
amortized over a seven year period using the straight-line method.

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

  The Company reviews long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets
to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an
asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the
fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower
of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

 Advertising and Promotional Costs

  Advertising and promotional costs are expensed as incurred.

 Depreciation and Amortization

  Depreciation is computed utilizing the straight-line method over the
estimated lives of the assets. Amortization of leasehold improvements is
computed utilizing the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated
useful life of the assets or the terms of the respective leases.

 Earnings per Share

  The Company reports both basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic
earnings per share is determined by dividing net income by the average number
of shares of common stock outstanding, while diluted earnings per share is
determined by dividing net income by the average number of shares of common
stock outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock
equivalents.

 Income Taxes

  A deferred tax liability is recognized for taxable temporary differences
(differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in future
taxable amounts). A deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible
temporary differences (differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will
result in deductible amounts in future years when the financial statement
carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities are recovered and settled) and
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The likelihood of realizing the
tax benefits related to a potential deferred tax asset is evaluated and a
valuation allowance is recognized to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is
more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will
not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the
beginning and end of the year; the change in the sum of the deferred tax
asset, valuation allowance and deferred tax liability during the year
generally is recognized as deferred tax expense or benefit. The effect on
deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
for which the change becomes effective.

 Stock Option Plans

  The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees" ("APB 25"), the intrinsic value method, to account for stock based
compensation. In accordance with the SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation", the Company includes pro forma disclosures reflecting the
impact of the fair value method on net earnings and earnings per share for
stock options granted.

 Segment Information and Disclosures

  Accounting standards require the Company to report information about
operating segments in annual financial statements and requires reporting of
selected information about operating segments in interim reports to
stockholders. These standards also require disclosures about products and
services, geographic areas and major customers. The Company views its business
as consisting of one business segment--banking. The principal business
activities of this segment are attracting funds from the general public and
originating and investing in loans, primarily real estate mortgage loans,
mortgage-backed securities and investments securities.

  The primary sources of revenue are interest earned on mortgage loans and
mortgage-backed securities, income from investment securities, gains on sales
of loans and mortgage-backed securities, fees earned in connection with loans
and deposits and income earned on its portfolio of loans and mortgage-backed
securities serviced for investors.

  The principal expenses are interest incurred on interest-bearing
liabilities, including deposits and borrowings, and general and administrative
costs.

 Derivatives

  The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." A
derivative is considered either an asset or liability in the statement of
financial condition and measured at fair value. If a derivative is designated
as a hedging instrument the changes in fair value of the derivative are either
(a) recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the
offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item or (b) reported as a component of
other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when
the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For a derivative not designated
as a hedging instrument, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in
the period of change. As of June 30, 2001, the Company has approximately $3.6
million of commitments to originate loans which will be held for sale and
approximately $3.7 million of loan sale commitments that qualify as
derivatives under SFAS No. 133. The fair value of such commitments approximate
zero at June 30, 2001.

  Upon implementation of SFAS No. 133 effective July 1, 1998, approximately
$78 million in MBS were transferred to available for sale. The Company has
accounted for the gains or losses on the sale of any such reclassified MBS
sold within 90 days of the reclassification date as the cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle. Any gains or losses recorded on such
reclassified securities sold 90 days or more after the reclassification date
have been recorded as gain or losses on sale of securities available for sale.

  In the first quarter of 1999, the Company sold $29.6 million of these
reclassified MBS for a nonrecurring gain after tax of $162,000, which is
accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in
the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. In the second quarter of
fiscal 1999, the Company sold an additional $32.3 million of MBS for a pretax
gain of $245,000 and an after tax gain of $142,000. The pretax gain of
$245,000 is included as a gain on sale of securities available for sale in the
accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.

 Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements

  In September 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities," (SFAS
No. 140) as a replacement of SFAS No. 125 effective for disclosures in
financial statements issued subsequent to December 15, 2000 and for
transactions entered after March 31, 2001. The adoption of this statement did
not materially impact the Company.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


  In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that the
purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 141 also specifies the criteria that intangible
assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be
recognized and reported apart from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 will require that
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be
amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 142 will also require that
intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their
respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and
reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.

  The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 141 immediately
and SFAS No. 142 effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2002. As of June
30, 2001 the Company has no assets classified as goodwill under the new
pronouncements. However, the Company does have core deposit premiums. Under
the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the Company expects to continue amortizing
these intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. The impact of the
adoption of SFAS No. 141 and 142 is expected to be immaterial to the Company.

  The Bank's tax bad debt reserve balance of approximately $10.9 million as of
June 30, 2001, will, in future years, be subject to recapture in whole or in
part upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a distribution to
stockholders in excess of the Bank's current and accumulated earnings and
profit, a redemption of shares or upon a partial or complete liquidation of
the Bank. The Bank does not intend to make distributions to stockholders that
would result in recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserve. Since
management intends to use the reserve only for the purpose for which it was
intended, a deferred tax liability of approximately $3.8 million has not been
recorded.

</TABLE>

  Deferred tax assets are initially recognized for differences between the
financial statement carrying amount and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities which will result in future deductible amounts and operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is then established to
reduce that deferred tax asset to the level at which it is "more likely than
not" that the tax benefits will be realized. Realization of tax benefits of
deductible temporary differences and operating loss or tax credit
carryforwards depends on having sufficient taxable income of an appropriate
character within the carryback and carryforward periods. Sources of taxable
income that may allow for the realization of tax benefits include (1) taxable
income in the current year or prior years that is available through carryback,
(2) future taxable income, exclusive of the reversal of existing temporary
differences, that will result from the reversal of existing taxable temporary
differences and (3) future taxable income generated by future operations. In
addition, tax planning strategies may be available to accelerate taxable
income or deductions, change the character of taxable income or deductions, or
switch from tax-exempt to taxable investments so that there will be sufficient
taxable income of an appropriate character and in the appropriate periods to
allow for realization of the tax benefits. Management believes that the above-
described deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized and,
accordingly, has not established a valuation allowance for the years ended
June 30, 2001 and 2000.

  Included in other liabilities are current taxes payable of $422,000 and
$311,000 at June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

(11) Regulatory Capital and Earnings Per Share

  The Bank is required to maintain certain minimum levels of regulatory
capital as set forth by the OTS in capital standards applicable to all
thrifts. These capital standards include a core capital requirement, a
tangible capital requirement and a risk-based capital requirement. The Bank
exceeds all capital requirements at June 30, 2001, as shown in the following
table:

  The Federal Deposit Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 contains prompt
corrective action (PCA) provisions pursuant to which banks and savings
institutions are to be classified into one of five categories, based primarily
upon capital adequacy, and which require specific supervisory actions as
capital levels decrease. The OTS regulations implementing the PCA provisions
define the five capital categories. The following table sets forth the
definitions of the categories and the Bank's ratios as of June 30, 2001 and
2000:

                            =================     =======================   ========================   ========================
</TABLE>

  The OTS also has authority, after an opportunity for a hearing, to downgrade
an institution from well-capitalized to adequately capitalized, or to subject
an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to the supervisory
actions applicable to the next lower category, for supervisory concerns. Based
on the latest notification from the OTS, at June 30, 2001 and 2000, the Bank
was a well-capitalized institution. There are no conditions or events that
management believes has changed the institution's category under the capital
guidelines.

 Dividends

  Savings association subsidiaries of holding companies generally are required
to provide their OTS District Director not less than 30 days' advance notice
of any proposed declaration of a dividend on the association's stock. Under
regulations adopted by the OTS, the insured institution's ability to declare
and pay a dividend to its holding company is subject to certain limitations.
The regulation establishes a three-tiered system of regulation, with the
greatest flexibility being afforded to well-capitalized associations. The Bank
is considered a well-capitalized institution for purposes of dividend
declarations. No dividends were declared or paid by the Bank in 2001. On May
19, 2000, the Bank declared a $1.0 million dividend payable to the Company
based on an authorization by the Board of Directors of the Bank.

(12) Retirement Plans

 Defined Benefit/Cash Balance Plan

  The Bank maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (the
Plan). Employees become eligible to participate in the Plan upon attaining the
age of 21 and completing one year of service during which they have served a
minimum of 1,000 hours. Until December 31, 1999, the Plan was an income
replacement retirement plan. The benefits were based on years of service and
the three consecutive years of employment during which the participant earned
the highest compensation. Contributions were intended to provide not only for
benefits attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to be
earned in the future. Effective December 31, 1993, the Plan was frozen for
benefit service accrued, and employees hired after November 30, 1992 did not
participate in the Plan.

  The Board of Directors approved the conversion of the Plan into a Cash
Balance Plan effective January 1, 2000. Under the provisions of the Cash
Balance Plan, a cash balance account is established for each participant at
plan entry and increased over time with pay and interest credits. Pay credits
are equal to 5.0% of eligible pay and are credited to each participant's cash
balance account annually. Interest credits are based on ten-year Treasury Note
rates and are credited to a participant's cash balance account quarterly. At
termination of employment, a participant (if vested) becomes entitled to
receive his or her cash balance account in a single payment or have it
converted to a monthly annuity payable for life (or over a joint lifetime with
his or her beneficiary) at retirement. Employees are eligible to participate
in the Cash Balance Plan upon attaining the age of 21 and completing one year
of service during which they have served a minimum of 1,000 hours. The Cash
Balance Plan is intended to be an ERISA-qualified plan, and the Bank is
preparing the filing for Internal Revenue Service (IRS) approval. The Bank
implemented the Cash Balance Plan, effective January 1, 2000, on a provisional
basis.

  Plan assets, at fair value, are primarily comprised of government
obligations and short-term investments.

length of service and are offset by benefits provided by Social Security and
the Company's other qualified retirement plans.

  The following table sets forth the Plan's funded status and amounts
recognized in the Bank's consolidated statements of financial condition:

  The weighted average discount rates used in determining the actuarial
present value of the benefit obligations were 7.25% as of June 30, 2001 and
7.75% as of June 30, 2000.

 Retirement Benefit Equalization Plan

  In conjunction with the conversion of the Bank's Defined Benefit Plan into a
Cash Balance Plan effective January 1, 2000, the SERP was converted into a
Retirement Benefit Equalization Plan (RBEP) for certain employees. The
Retirement Benefit Equalization Plan (RBEP) is a supplemental plan to the Cash
Balance Plan, 401(k) Plan, and ESOP and is intended to provide certain covered
employees with the total amount of retirement income that they would otherwise
receive under these plans if not for legislated ceilings in compliance with
certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code which limit retirement benefits
payable from qualified plans.

<PAGE>

                  QUAKER CITY BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


  Under the provisions of the RBEP, a cash balance account is established for
each participant at plan entry and increased over time with contribution and
interest credits. Contribution credits are equal to the amounts not
contributed under the qualified plans due to IRS limitations and are credited
to each participant's cash balance account annually.

  Interest credits are based on ten-year Treasury Note rates and are credited
to a participant's cash balance account quarterly.

  The expense related to the RBEP totaled $154,000 and $47,000, for the fiscal
years ended June 30, 2001 and 2000. As this plan was newly created, there were
no expenses for this plan for fiscal 1999.

 Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)

  The Company has established an ESOP for all employees who are age 21 or
older and have completed one year of service with the Bank during which they
have served a minimum of 1,000 hours. The ESOP is internally leveraged and
borrowed $3.1 million from the Company to purchase 10% of the outstanding
shares of the common stock of Quaker City Bancorp, Inc. issued in the original
conversion to common stock ownership. The loan will be repaid principally from
the Bank's discretionary contributions to the ESOP. In conjunction with the
conversion of the Bank's Defined Benefit Plan into a Cash Balance Plan
effective January 1, 2000, and the inclusion of all eligible employees as
participants in the Plan, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the
ESOP which allows the loan underlying the ESOP to be reamortized over a longer
period of time. ESOP participants will receive essentially the same benefit,
but the length of time by which it will be received will be extended from
September 2003 to December 2004. At June 30, 2001 and 2000, the outstanding
balance on the loan was $815,000 and $1.0 million, respectively. Shares
purchased with the loan proceeds are held in a suspense account for allocation
among participants as the loan is repaid. Contributions to the ESOP and shares
released from the suspense account are allocated among participants on the
basis of compensation, as described in the plan, in the year of allocation.
Benefits generally become 100% vested after five years of vesting service.
Vesting will accelerate upon retirement, death or disability of the
participant or in the event of a change in control of the Bank or the Company.
Forfeitures will be reallocated among remaining participating employees, in
the same proportion as contributions. Benefits may be payable upon death,
retirement, early retirement, disability or separation from service. Since the
annual contributions are discretionary, the benefits payable under the ESOP
cannot be estimated. The Company accounts for its ESOP in accordance with
Statement of Position 93-6. Accordingly, the Company reports compensation
expense equal to the fair value of the shares allocated, and the allocated
shares are considered outstanding for the computation of earnings per share.
The expense related to the ESOP totaled $1.0 million, $1.0 million and $1.0
million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
At June 30, 2001 and 2000, unearned compensation related to the ESOP
approximated $794,000 and $1.0 million, respectively, and is shown as a
reduction of stockholders' equity in the accompanying consolidated statements
of financial condition.

</TABLE>

  The fair value of unallocated ESOP shares totaled $4.9 million and $3.2
million at June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

 401(k) Plan

  Effective July 1, 1997, the Bank implemented a 401(k) plan. Employees become
eligible to participate in the Plan upon attaining the age of 21 and
completing one year of service during which they have served a minimum of
1,000 hours. The benefits are based on employee compensation. During 2001,
2000, and 1999, the expense for this plan totaled $104,000, $89,000, and
$57,000, respectively.

(13) Incentive Plans

 Recognition and Retention Plan (RRP)

  The Bank adopted the RRP as a method of providing officers, employees and
nonemployee directors of the Bank with a proprietary interest in the Company
in a manner designed to encourage such persons to remain with the Bank. The
Bank contributed funds to the RRP to enable the trust to acquire, in the
aggregate, 4% of the shares of common stock in the conversion. Under the RRP,
awards are granted in the form of shares of common stock held by the RRP.
These shares represent deferred compensation and have been accounted for as a
reduction of stockholders' equity. Shares allocated vest over a period of
three to five years commencing on January 1, 1995 and continuing on each
anniversary date thereafter. Awards are automatically vested upon a change in
control of the Company or the Bank. In the event that before reaching normal
retirement, an officer or employee terminates service with the Company or the
Bank, that person's nonvested awards are forfeited.

  There were no expenses related to the RRP for fiscal years ended June 30,
2001 and 2000. The expense related to the RRP for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1999 was approximately $115,000. All shares under the RRP were distributed
as of January, 1999. Currently, there is no intention to continue this plan.

 Stock Option and Incentive Plans

  In March of 1994 the stockholders of the Company ratified two stock option
plans, the 1993 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the Stock Plan) and the 1993
Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors (the Directors' Plan). In fiscal 1998,
the stockholders of the Company ratified the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan (the
1997 Stock Plan). All Plans provide for the grant of options at an exercise
price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. The Plans are
intended to promote stock ownership by directors and selected officers and
employees of the Company to increase their proprietary interest in the success
of the Company and to encourage them to remain in the employ of the Company or
its subsidiaries. Awards granted under the Plans may include incentive stock
options, nonstatutory options, limited rights which are exercisable only upon
a change in control of the Bank or the Company, restricted stock, stock
appreciation rights and other stock-based benefits.

  The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations for its
plans, all of which are fixed stock option plans. Accordingly, the Company did
not recognize compensation expense in connection with awards of stock options
because the exercise price and the fair market value were the same at the
dates of award. Had compensation cost for the Company Plans been recognized
based upon the fair value of the options at the grant date consistent with the
methodology specified in SFAS No. 123, the Company's net earnings and net
earnings per share at June 30, 2001, 2000, and 1999 would have been reduced to
the pro forma amounts indicated below (in thousands, except per share
amounts):

</TABLE>

  The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during
2001, 2000 and 1999 were $12.49, $7.36 and $6.69, respectively, on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted-
average assumptions were used for fiscal 2001: volatility of 25.5%, no
expected dividends, risk free interest rate of 5.14% and an expected life of 8
years. The following weighted-average assumptions were used for fiscal 2000:
volatility of 25.12%, no expected dividends, risk-free interest rate of 6.33%
and an expected life of 8 years. The following weighted-average assumptions
were used for fiscal 1999: volatility of 18.54%, no expected dividends, risk-
free interest rate of 5.93%, and an expected life of 8 years. The effects of
applying SFAS No. 123 for these pro forma disclosures are not likely to be
representative of the effects on reported income for future years as options
vest over several years and additional awards may be made each year.

  The Directors' Plan authorizes the granting of stock options for a total of
161,719 shares of common stock. The Stock Plan authorizes the granting of
stock options for a total of 485,156 shares of common stock. All options
granted under both plans were granted at an exercise price of $4.80 per share.
The aggregate number of shares of common stock outstanding and available for
issuance pursuant to the 1997 Stock Plan is 560,465 shares. Options covering a
total of 73,874 shares were granted in fiscal 2001 at a weighted average
exercise price of $28.68 per share, which was the fair market value on the
grant date. Options covering a total of 100,257 shares were granted in fiscal
2000 at a weighted average exercise price of $15.70 per share, which was the
fair market value on the grant date. Options covering a total of 110,000
shares were granted in fiscal 1999 at a weighted average exercise price of
$16.13 per share, which was the fair market value on the grant date.

  All options initially granted under the Directors' Plan became fully
exercisable January 1, 1995. Each option granted under the Directors' Plan
expires upon the earlier of ten years following the date of grant or one year
following the date the optionee ceases to be a director. All options granted
under the Stock Plan are exercisable in three equal annual installments
commencing January 1, 1995 and continuing on each anniversary date thereafter.
Each option granted under the Stock Plan expires upon the earlier of ten years
following the date of grant or three months following the date on which the
employee ceases to perform services for the Bank or the Company, except that
in the event of death, disability, retirement or upon a change in control of
the Company or the Bank, options may be exercisable for up to one year
thereafter or such longer period as determined by the Company.

(14) Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

  The Company leases certain premises and equipment on a long-term basis. Some
of these leases require the Company to pay property taxes and insurance. Lease

  At June 30, 2001 and 2000, the Company had approved commitments to originate
loans of approximately $24.1 million and $15.0 million, respectively,
substantially all of which were for one to four unit residential loans and
multifamily residential loans. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to
lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition
established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates
or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since certain
of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total
commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The
Company minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by requiring
that customers meet certain conditions prior to disbursing funds. The amount
of collateral, if any, is based on a credit evaluation of the borrower and
generally involves residential real estate.

  At June 30, 2001 and 2000, the Company had $25.0 million and $25.5 million
of approved undisbursed lines of credit, respectively.

  At June 30, 2001 and 2000, the Company had commitments to sell loans of $3.7
million and $11.2 million, respectively, for which the related loans are
included in loans held for sale. There were commitments to purchase loans of
$9.9 million at June 30, 2001 and no commitments to purchase loans at June 30,
2000. The Company had no commitments to sell investment securities or MBS at
June 30, 2001 and 2000. There were no commitments to purchase investment
securities or MBS at June 30, 2001 and 2000.

  The Company is not involved in any pending legal proceedings other than
routine legal proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business. Such
routine legal proceedings in the aggregate are believed by management to be
immaterial to the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

(16) Fair Value of Financial Instruments

  Pursuant to requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America, the Company has included information about the
fair values of the Company's financial instruments, whether or not such
instruments are recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of
financial condition. In cases where quoted market prices are not available,
fair values are estimated based upon discounted cash flows. Those techniques
are significantly affected by the assumptions utilized, including the assumed
discount rates and estimates of future cash flows. In this regard, the derived
fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent
markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in an immediate sale or
other disposition of the instrument. SFAS No. 107 excludes certain financial
instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements.
All components of cash and cash equivalents and accrued interest receivable
and payable are presumed to have approximately equal book and fair values
because the periods over which such amounts are realized are relatively short.
As a result of the assumptions utilized, the aggregate fair value estimates
presented herein do not necessarily represent the Company's aggregate
underlying fair value.

  The fair values of investment securities and MBS are generally obtained from
market bids for similar or identical securities, or are obtained from quotes
from independent security brokers or dealers.

  Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial
characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as one to four units,
multifamily, commercial real estate and other. Each loan category is further
segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and by performing and
nonperforming categories. The fair value of performing loans is calculated by
discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using
estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk
inherent in the loan. The estimate of maturity is based on the contractual
term of the loans to maturity, adjusted for estimated prepayments. Fair value
for nonperforming loans is based on management's evaluation of fair value as
determined by specific borrower information and, if appropriate, the fair
value of the underlying collateral.

  The fair values of deposits are estimated based upon the type of deposit
product. Demand and money market deposits are presumed to have equal book and
fair values. The estimated fair values of time deposits are determined by
discounting the cash flows of segments of deposits having similar maturities
and rates, utilizing a yield curve that approximated the rates offered as of
the reporting date. No value has been estimated for the Company's long-term
relationships with depositors (commonly known as the core deposit premium)
since such intangible asset is not a financial instrument pursuant to the
definitions contained in SFAS No. 107.

  The fair values of borrowings were estimated using current market rates of
interest for similar borrowings.

  The fair values of off-balance sheet items are based on rates for similar
transactions as of the reporting date.

               AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
                                       OF
                           QUAKER CITY BANCORP, INC.

                (Originally incorporated on September 13, 1993)

     FIRST:  The name of the Corporation is Quaker City Bancorp, Inc.
     -----
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Corporation").

     SECOND:  The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the
     ------
State of Delaware is Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, in the City
of Wilmington, County of New Castle.  The name of the registered agent at that
address is The Corporation Trust Company.

     THIRD:  The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
     -----
activity for which a corporation may be organized under the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware.

     FOURTH:
     ------

          A.  The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the
     Corporation shall have authority to issue is twenty-two million
     (22,000,000) consisting of:

          1.  Two million (2,000,000) shares of Preferred Stock, par value one
          cent ($.01) per share (the "Preferred Stock"); and

          2.  Twenty million (20,000,000) shares of Common Stock, par value one
          cent ($.01) per share (the "Common Stock").

          B.  The Board of Directors is authorized, subject to any limitations
     prescribed by law, to provide for the issuance of the shares of Preferred
     Stock in series, and by filing a certificate pursuant to the applicable law
     of the State of Delaware (such certificate being hereinafter referred to as
     a "Preferred Stock Designation"), to establish from time to time the number
     of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the designation,
     powers, preferences, and rights of the shares of each such series and any
     qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof.  The number of
     authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not
     below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative
     vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Stock, without a vote of
     the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote
     of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any Preferred
     Stock Designation.

          C.  1.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of
                  Incorporation, in no event shall any record owner of any
                  outstanding Common Stock which is beneficially owned, directly
                  or indirectly, by a person who, as of any record date for the
                  determination of stockholders entitled to vote on any matter,
                  beneficially owns in excess of 10% of the then-outstanding
                  shares
<PAGE>

                  of Common Stock (the "Limit"), be entitled, or permitted to
                  any vote in respect of the shares held in excess of the Limit.
                  The number of votes which may be cast by any record owner by
                  virtue of the provisions hereof in respect of Common Stock
                  beneficially owned by such person beneficially owning shares
                  in excess of the Limit shall be a number equal to the total
                  number of votes which a single record owner of all Common
                  Stock beneficially owned by such person would be entitled to
                  cast, (subject to the provisions of this Article FOURTH)
                  multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
                  of shares of such class or series which are both beneficially
                  owned by such person and owned of record by such record owner
                  and the denominator of which is the total number of shares of
                  Common Stock beneficially owned by such person owning shares
                  in excess of the Limit.

               2. The following definitions shall apply to this Section C of
                  this Article FOURTH:

                  a.   "Affiliate" shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Rule
                       12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under the
                       Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as in effect
                       on the date of filing of this Certificate of
                       Incorporation.

                  b.   "Beneficial ownership" shall be determined pursuant to
                       Rule 13d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the
                       Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (or any
                       successor rule or statutory provision), or, if said Rule
                       13d-3 shall be rescinded and there shall be no successor
                       rule or provision thereto, pursuant to said Rule 13d-3 as
                       in effect on the date of filing of this Certificate of
                       Incorporation; provided, however, that a person shall, in
                       any event, also be deemed the "beneficial owner" of any
                       Common Stock:

                       (1)  which such person or any of its affiliates
                            beneficially owns, directly or indirectly; or

                       (2)  which such person or any of its affiliates has (i)
                            the right to acquire (whether such right is
                            exercisable immediately or only after the passage of
                            time), pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or
                            understanding (but shall not be deemed to be the
                            beneficial owner of any voting shares solely by
                            reason of an agreement, contract, or other
                            arrangement with this Corporation to effect any
                            transaction which is described in any one or more of
                            clauses 1 through 5 of Section A of Article

                                       2

                            EIGHTH), or upon the exercise of conversion rights,
                            exchange rights, warrants, or options or otherwise,
                            or (ii) sole or shared voting or investment power
                            with respect thereto pursuant to any agreement,
                            arrangement, understanding, relationship or
                            otherwise (but shall not be deemed to be the
                            beneficial owner of any voting shares solely by
                            reason of a revocable proxy granted for a particular
                            meeting of stockholders, pursuant to a public
                            solicitation of proxies for such meeting, with
                            respect to shares of which neither such person nor
                            any such Affiliate is otherwise deemed the
                            beneficial owner); or

                       (3)  which are beneficially owned, directly or
                            indirectly, by any other person with which such
                            first mentioned person or any of its Affiliates acts
                            as a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate or
                            other group pursuant to any agreement, arrangement
                            or understanding for the purpose of acquiring,
                            holding, voting or disposing of any shares of
                            capital stock of this Corporation; and provided
                            further, however, that (1) no Director or Officer of
                            this Corporation (or any Affiliate of any such
                            Director or Officer) shall, solely by reason of any
                            or all of such Directors or Officers acting in their
                            capacities as such, be deemed, for any purposes
                            hereof, to beneficially own any Common Stock
                            beneficially owned by any other such Director or
                            Officer (or any Affiliate thereof), and (2) neither
                            any employee stock ownership or similar plan of this
                            Corporation or any subsidiary of this Corporation,
                            nor any trustee with respect thereto or any
                            Affiliate of such trustee (solely by reason of such
                            capacity of such trustee), shall be deemed, for any
                            purposes hereof, to beneficially own any Common
                            Stock held under any such plan. For purposes only of
                            computing the percentage of beneficial ownership of
                            Common Stock of a person, the outstanding Common
                            Stock shall include shares deemed owned by such
                            person through application of this subsection but
                            shall not include any other Common Stock which may
                            be issuable by this Corporation pursuant to any
                            agreement, or upon exercise of conversion rights,
                            warrants or options, or otherwise. For all other

                                       3
<PAGE>

                            purposes, the outstanding Common Stock shall include
                            only Common Stock then outstanding and shall not
                            include any Common Stock which may be issuable by
                            this Corporation pursuant to any agreement, or upon
                            the exercise of conversion rights, warrants or
                            options, or otherwise.

                    c.   The "Limit" shall mean 10% of the then-outstanding
                         shares of Common Stock.

                    d.   A "person" shall include an individual, a firm, a group
                         acting in concert, a corporation, a partnership, an
                         association, a joint venture, a pool, a joint stock
                         company, a trust, an unincorporated organization or
                         similar company, a syndicate or any other group formed
                         for the purpose of acquiring, holding or disposing of
                         securities or any other entity.

               3.   The Board of Directors shall have the power to construe and
                    apply the provisions of this section and to make all
                    determinations necessary or desirable to implement such
                    provisions, including but not limited to matters with
                    respect to (i) the number of shares of Common Stock
                    beneficially owned by any person, (ii) whether a person is
                    an affiliate of another, (iii) whether a person has an
                    agreement, arrangement, or understanding with another as to
                    the matters referred to in the definition of beneficial

                    of this section.

                    any person who is reasonably believed to beneficially own
                    Common Stock in excess of the Limit (or holds of record
                    Common Stock beneficially owned by any person in excess of
                    the Limit) supply the Corporation with complete information
                    as to (i) the record owner(s) of all shares beneficially
                    owned by such person who is reasonably believed to own

               5.   Except as otherwise provided by law or expressly provided in
                    this Section C, the presence, in person or by proxy, of the
                    holders of record of shares of capital stock of the
                    Corporation entitling the holders thereof to cast a majority
                    of the votes (after giving effect, if required, to the
                    provisions of this Section C) entitled to be cast by the
                    holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation
                    entitled to

                                       4
<PAGE>

                    vote shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the
                    stockholders, and every reference in this Certificate of
                    Incorporation to a majority or other proportion of capital
                    stock (or the holders thereof) for purposes of determining
                    any quorum requirement or any requirement for stockholder
                    consent or approval shall be deemed to refer to such
                    majority or other proportion of the votes (or the holders
                    thereof) then entitled to be cast in respect of such capital
                    stock.

               6.   Any constructions, applications, or determinations made by
                    the Board of Directors pursuant to this section in good
                    faith and on the basis of such information and assistance as
                    was then reasonably available for such purpose shall be
                    conclusive and binding upon the Corporation and its
                    stockholders.

               7.   In the event any provision (or portion thereof) of this
                    Section C shall be found to be invalid, prohibited or
                    unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions (or
                    portions thereof) of this Section shall remain in full force
                    and effect, and shall be construed as if such invalid,
                    prohibited or unenforceable provision had been stricken
                    herefrom or otherwise rendered inapplicable, it being the
                    intent of this Corporation and its stockholders that each
                    such remaining provision (or portion thereof) of this
                    Section C remain, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
                    applicable and enforceable as to all stockholders, including
                    stockholders owning an amount of stock over the Limit,
                    notwithstanding any such finding.

     FIFTH:  The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
     -----
business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further
definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of
its Directors and stockholders:

          A.  The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or
     under the direction of the Board of Directors.  In addition to the powers
     and authority expressly conferred upon them by statute or by this
     Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation, the
     Directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such
     acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation.

          B.  The Directors of the Corporation need not be elected by written
     ballot unless the Bylaws so provide.

          C.  Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders
     of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special
     meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any
     consent in writing by such stockholders.

          D.  Special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be called
     only by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a
     majority of the Whole Board

                                       5
<PAGE>

     or as otherwise provided in the Bylaws.  The term "Whole Board" shall mean
     the total number of authorized directorships (whether or not there exist
     any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such
     resolution is presented to the Board for adoption).

     SIXTH:
     -----

          A.  The number of Directors shall be fixed from time to time
     exclusively by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a
     majority of the Whole Board.  The Directors shall be divided into three
     classes, as nearly equal in number as reasonably possible, with the term of
     office of the first class to expire at the first annual meeting of
     stockholders, the term of office of the second class to expire at the
     annual meeting of stockholders one year thereafter and the term of office
     of the third class to expire at the annual meeting of stockholders two
     years thereafter with each Director to hold office until his or her
     successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.  At each annual
     meeting of stockholders following such initial classification and election,
     Directors elected to succeed those Directors whose terms expire shall be
     elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding annual
     meeting of stockholders after their election with each Director to hold
     office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and
     qualified.

          B.  Subject to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock
     outstanding, the newly created directorships resulting from any increase in
     the authorized number of Directors or any vacancies in the Board of
     Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification,
     removal from office or other cause may be filled only by a majority vote of
     the Directors then in office, though less than a quorum, and Directors so
     chosen shall hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of
     stockholders at which the term of office of the class to which they have
     been chosen expires.  No decrease in the number of Directors constituting
     the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent Director.

          C.  Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of
     Directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting
     of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in the manner
     provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

          D.  Subject to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock
     then outstanding, any Director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be
     removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the
     affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the voting power
     of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation
     entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors (after giving
     effect to the provisions of Article FOURTH of this Certificate of
     Incorporation ("Article FOURTH")), voting together as a single class.

     SEVENTH:  The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or
     -------
repeal Bylaws of the Corporation.  Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the
Bylaws of the Corporation by the Board of Directors shall require the approval
of a majority of the Whole Board.  The stockholders shall also have power to
adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the

                                       6
<PAGE>

Corporation; provided, however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of
any class or series of stock of this Corporation required by law or by this
Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80
percent of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors
(after giving effect to the provisions of Article FOURTH), voting together as a
single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provisions of the
Bylaws of the Corporation.

     EIGHTH:

                    Affiliate of any Interested Stockholder, of any assets of

                    any Interested Stockholder or any Affiliate of any
                    Interested Stockholder in exchange for cash, securities or
                    other property (or a combination thereof) having an
                    aggregate Fair Market Value (as hereinafter defined)

                    of the outstanding common stock of the Corporation and its
                    Subsidiaries, except for any issuance or transfer pursuant
                    to an employee benefit plan of the Corporation or any
                    Subsidiary thereof; or

               4.   the adoption of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or
                    dissolution of the Corporation proposed by or on behalf of

                    Stockholder; or

                                       7
<PAGE>

               5.   any reclassification of securities (including any reverse
                    stock split), or recapitalization of the Corporation, or any
                    merger or consolidation of the Corporation with any of its
                    Subsidiaries or any other transaction (whether or not with
                    or into or otherwise involving an Interested Stockholder)
                    which has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing

                    previously acquired any shares of a particular class of
                    Voting Stock):

<PAGE>

                    cash or in the same form as the Interested Stockholder has
                    previously paid for shares of such class of Voting Stock. If
                    the Interested Stockholder has paid for shares of any class
                    of Voting Stock with varying forms of consideration, the
                    form of consideration to be received per share by holders of

                    the form used to acquire the largest number of shares of
                    such class of Voting Stock previously acquired by the
                    Interested Stockholder. The price determined in accordance
                    with subparagraph B.2 of this Article EIGHTH shall be

                    event.

               d.   After such Interested Stockholder has become an Interested
                    Stockholder and prior to the consummation of such Business
                    Combination:  (1) except as approved by a majority of the
                    Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), there
                    shall have been no failure to declare and pay at the regular
                    date therefor any full quarterly dividends (whether or not
                    cumulative) on any outstanding stock having preference over
                    the Common Stock as to dividends or liquidation; (2) there
                    shall have been (i) no reduction in the annual rate of
                    dividends paid on the Common Stock (except as necessary to
                    reflect any subdivision of the Common Stock), except as
                    approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors, and
                    (ii) an increase in such annual rate of dividends as
                    necessary to reflect any reclassification (including any
                    reverse stock split), recapitalization, reorganization or
                    any similar transaction which has the effect of reducing the
                    number of outstanding shares of the Common Stock, unless the
                    failure to so increase such annual rate is approved by a
                    majority of the Disinterested Directors, and (3) neither
                    such Interested Stockholder or any of its Affiliates shall
                    have become the beneficial owner of any additional shares of
                    Voting Stock except as part of the transaction which results
                    in such Interested Stockholder becoming an Interested
                    Stockholder.

               e.   After such Interested Stockholder has become an Interested
                    Stockholder, such Interested Stockholder shall not have
                    received the benefit, directly or indirectly (except
                    proportionately as a stockholder), of any loans, advances,
                    guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance or any tax
                    credits or other tax advantages provided, directly or
                    indirectly, by the Corporation, whether in anticipation of
                    or in connection with such Business Combination or
                    otherwise.

                    information statement is required to be mailed pursuant to
                    such Act or subsequent provisions).

               Corporation or any Holding Company or Subsidiary thereof) who or
               which:

               a.   is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more

               b.   is an Affiliate of the Corporation and at any time within
                    the two-year period immediately prior to the date in
                    question was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly,
                    of 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding
                    Voting Stock; or

               c.   is an assignee of or has otherwise succeeded to any shares
                    of Voting Stock which were at any time within the two-year
                    period immediately prior to the date in question
                    beneficially owned by any Interested Stockholder, if such

                    of a transaction or series of transactions not involving a
                    public offering within the meaning of the Securities Act of

               be determined in the manner provided in Section C of Article
               FOURTH hereof.

          4.   "Affiliate" and "Associate" shall have the respective meanings
               ascribed to such terms in Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules and
               Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as in

          5.   "Subsidiary" means any corporation of which a majority of any
               class of equity security is owned, directly or indirectly, by the
               Corporation; provided, however, that for the purposes of the
               definition of Interested Stockholder set forth in Paragraph 2 of
               this Section C, the term "Subsidiary" shall mean only a
               corporation of which a majority of each class of equity security
               is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation.

          6.   "Disinterested Director" means any member of the Board of
               Directors who is unaffiliated with the Interested Stockholder and
               was a member of the Board of Directors prior to the time that the
               Interested Stockholder became an Interested Stockholder, and any
               Director who is thereafter chosen to fill any vacancy of the
               Board of Directors or who is elected and who, in either event, is
               unaffiliated with the Interested Stockholder and in connection
               with his or her initial assumption of office is recommended for
               appointment or election by a majority of Disinterested Directors
               then on the Board of Directors.

          7.   "Fair Market Value" means:

               a.   in the case of stock, the highest closing sales price of the
                    stock during the 30-day period immediately preceding the
                    date in question of a share of such stock on the National
                    Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System
                    or any system then in use, or, if such stock is admitted to
                    trading on a principal United States securities exchange
                    registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
                    amended, Fair Market Value shall be the highest sale price
                    reported during the 30-day period preceding the date in
                    question, or, if no such quotations are available, the Fair
                    Market Value on the date in question of a share of such
                    stock as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith,
                    in each case with respect to any class of stock,
                    appropriately adjusted for any dividend or distribution in
                    shares of such stock or any stock split or reclassification
                    of outstanding shares of such stock into a greater number of
                    shares of such stock or any combination or reclassification
                    of outstanding shares of such stock into a smaller number of
                    shares of such stock, and

               b.   in the case of property other than cash or stock, the Fair
                    Market Value of such property on the date in question as
                    determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.

          8.   Reference to "Highest Per Share Price" shall in each case with
               respect to any class of stock reflect an appropriate adjustment
               for any dividend or distribution in shares of such stock or any
               stock split or reclassification of outstanding shares of such
               stock into a greater number of shares of such

                                       12
<PAGE>

          stock or any combination or reclassification of outstanding shares of
          such stock into a smaller number of shares of such stock.

          9.   In the event of any Business Combination in which the Corporation
               survives, the phrase "consideration other than cash to be
               received" as used in Subparagraphs (a) and (b) of Paragraph 2 of
               Section B of this Article EIGHTH shall include the shares of
               Common Stock and/or the shares of any other class of outstanding
               Voting Stock retained by the holders of such shares.

          D.  A majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Corporation shall
     have the power and duty to determine for the purposes of this Article
     EIGHTH, on the basis of information known to them after reasonable inquiry:
     (a) whether a person is an Interested Stockholder; (b) the number of shares
     of Voting Stock beneficially owned by any person; (c) whether a person is
     an Affiliate or Associate of another; and (d) whether the assets which are
     the subject of any Business Combination have, or the consideration to be
     received for the issuance or transfer of securities by the Corporation or
     any Subsidiary in any Business Combination has an aggregate Fair Market
     Value equaling or exceeding 25% of the combined Fair Market Value of the
     Common Stock of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries.  A majority of the
     Disinterested Directors shall have the further power to interpret all of
     the terms and provisions of this Article EIGHTH.

          E.  Nothing contained in the Article EIGHTH shall be construed to
     relieve any Interested Stockholder from any fiduciary obligation imposed by
     law.

          F.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate of
     Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser
     vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of
     any particular class or series of the Voting Stock required by law, this
     Certificate of Incorporation or any Preferred Stock Designation.  the
     affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the voting power
     of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock (after giving
     effect to the provisions of Article FOURTH), voting together as a single
     class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal this Article EIGHTH.

     NINTH:  The Board of Directors of the Corporation, when evaluating any
     -----
offer of another Person (as defined in Article EIGHTH hereof) to (A) make a
tender or exchange offer for any equity security of the Corporation, (B) merge
or consolidate the Corporation with another corporation or entity or (C)
purchase or otherwise acquire all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of the Corporation, may, in connection with the exercise of its judgment
in determining what is in the best interest of the Corporation and its
stockholders, give due consideration to all relevant factors, including, without
limitation, those factors that Directors of any subsidiary of the Corporation
may consider in evaluating any action that may result in a change or potential
change in the control of the subsidiary, and the social and economic effect of
acceptance of such offer:  on the Corporation's present and future customers and
employees and those of its Subsidiaries (as defined in Article EIGHTH hereof);
on the communities in which the Corporation and its Subsidiaries operate or are
located; on the ability of the Corporation to fulfill

                                       13
<PAGE>

its corporate objective as a savings and loan holding company under applicable
laws and regulations; and on the ability of its subsidiary savings and loan
association to fulfill the objectives of a federally-chartered stock form
savings and loan association under applicable statutes and regulations.

     TENTH:  A.  Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be
     -----
made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a
"proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director or an
Officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a Director, Officer, employee or agent of another corporation or
of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service
with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether
the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a
Director, Officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a
Director, Officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by
the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the
case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted
the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise
taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or
suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that,
except as provided in Section C hereof with respect to proceedings to enforce
rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee
in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee
only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation.

          B.  The right to indemnification conferred in Section A of this
     Article TENTH shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the
     expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final
     disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however,
     that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an advancement of
     expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a Director or
     Officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered
     by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, services to an employee
     benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an
     undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such
     indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
     determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right
     to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not
     entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section or
     otherwise.  The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
     expenses conferred in Sections A and B of this Article TENTH shall be
     contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has
     ceased to be a Director, Officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the
     benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators.

          C.  If a claim under Section A or B of this Article TENTH is not paid
     in full by the Corporation within sixty days after a written claim has been
     received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an
     advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be
     twenty days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter

                                       14
<PAGE>

bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim.
If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expenses of
prosecuting or defending such suit.  In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee
to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by
the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a
defense that, and (ii) in any suit by the Corporation to recover an advancement
of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking the Corporation shall be
entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the
Delaware General Corporation Law.  Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances
because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the
indemnitee, be a defense to such suit.  In any suit brought by the indemnitee to
enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder,
or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the
terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this
Article TENTH or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

          D.  The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses
     conferred in this Article TENTH shall not be exclusive of any other right
     which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the
     Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of
     stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise.

          E.  The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect
     itself and any Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or
     subsidiary or Affiliate or another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
     trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether
     or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person
     against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General
     Corporation Law.

          F.  The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by
     the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the
     advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the
     fullest extent of the provisions of this Article TENTH with respect to the
     indemnification and advancement of expenses of Directors and Officers of
     the Corporation.

     ELEVENTH:  A Director of this Corporation shall not be personally liable to
     --------
the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a Director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the Director's
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct

                                       15
<PAGE>

or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the Director derived an
improper personal benefit. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended to
authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal
liability of Directors, then the liability of a Director of the Corporation
shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, as so amended.

     Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph by the stockholders
of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a
Director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

     TWELFTH:  The Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal any
     -------
provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner
prescribed by the laws of the State of Delaware and all rights conferred upon
stockholders are granted subject to this reservation; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any
provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in
addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of this
Corporation required by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation, the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the voting power of
all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors (after giving effect to
the provisions of Article FOURTH), voting together as a single class, shall be
required to amend or repeal this Article TWELFTH, Section C of Article FOURTH,
Section C or D of Article FIFTH, Article SIXTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH
or Article TENTH.

     This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which restates and
integrates and does further amend the provisions of the Corporation's
Certificate of Incorporation, has been duly adopted by the Board of Directors of
the Corporation in accordance with the provisions of Sections 242 and 245, and
has been approved by the stockholders of the Corporation in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 242 and 245, of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned declares that the matters set forth in
this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation are true and correct of
his own knowledge.

Date:  November 24, 1998
