   Item 1.  Business.

   General.

       Banta Corporation (the "Corporation"), together with its subsidiaries,
   is one of the larger printing organizations in the United States,
   providing a broad range of printing and graphic arts services.  The
   Corporation was incorporated in Wisconsin in 1901.  Its principal
   executive offices are located at 225 Main Street, Box 8003, Menasha,
   Wisconsin, 54952-8003.  The Corporation had a total of 5,700 employees at
   the end of fiscal 1995.

       The Corporation operates in one business segment-Printing Services. 
   Market classifications of the Corporation's sales are commercial
   (catalogs, direct mail and single-use products);  books (educational,
   general, trade, data manuals and project management services); magazines;
   and other (digital imaging services, production of point-of-purchase
   displays and security products). At the end of fiscal 1995, the
   Corporation's operations were conducted at 30 production facilities in the
   United States located in Wisconsin, Minnesota, California, Colorado,
   Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Missouri, North Carolina, Utah,
   Virginia and Washington and at five European production facilities located
   in Ireland, Scotland, and The Netherlands.

       The following table sets forth the approximate percentage of
   consolidated net sales contributed by each class of similar products and
   services which accounted for ten percent or more of consolidated net sales
   for any of the last three fiscal years.

       In October 1995, the Corporation acquired B.G. Turnkey Services
   Limited ("B.G. Turnkey"). B.G. Turnkey, which has been included in the
   book market classification since the acquisition date, reported sales for
   1994 of approximately $160 million. The purchase price consisted of
   236,765 shares of the Corporation's common stock and approximately $21
   million of the Corporation's debentures which were called and prepaid in
   December 1995. The Corporation also paid $3.2 million to former
   shareholders of B.G. Turnkey in exchange for a covenant not to compete.

       During 1995, the Corporation purchased Applied Technology Corporation,
   which serves the single-use health care market, and New Frontiers
   Information Corporation, which provides customers with online solutions
   for distributing catalogs and direct marketing materials via the
   Internet's World Wide Web. The combined purchase price for these two
   acquisitions was approximately $9.0 million.

       In August 1994, the Corporation completed its acquisition of United
   Graphics Inc. ("UGI") for approximately $9.5 million in cash and a $1.5
   million note. The Corporation also paid $4 million to former shareholders
   of UGI in exchange for a covenant not to compete. UGI, which has been
   included in the book market classification since the acquisition date,
   reported sales for its fiscal year prior to acquisition of approximately
   $28 million.

       In March 1994, the Corporation purchased substantially all of the
   assets of Danbury Printing & Litho, Inc. ("Danbury"). The purchase price
   consisted of $16.3 million in cash plus the assumption of selected
   liabilities. Danbury, which has been included in the commercial market
   classification since the acquisition date, reported sales of approximately
   $35 million in 1993.

   Customers.

       The Corporation sells its products and services to a large number of
   customers and ordinarily does not have long-term contracts with its
   customers.  Production agreements covering one to three years are,
   however, more frequent for magazine and catalog production. Substantially
   all sales are made to customers through employees of the Corporation and
   its subsidiaries based on customer specifications.  The fifteen largest
   customers accounted for approximately 25%,  23% and 25% of net sales
   during 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  No customer accounted for more
   than 10% of the Corporation's net sales in 1995, 1994 or 1993.  In the
   opinion of management, the loss of any single customer would not have a
   material long-term adverse effect on the Corporation.

   Backlog.

       The Corporation is primarily a manufacturing services company and
   provides its customers with printing, converting and other services.  Lead
   time for services varies, depending upon the type of customer, the
   industry being serviced and seasonal factors.  Backlogs would be expressed
   in terms of time scheduled on equipment and not dollar value. 
   Consequently, the dollar value of backlog is not readily available.

   Markets Served.

       Below is a description of the primary markets the Corporation serves:

   - Commercial

       The Corporation produces catalogs primarily for the consumer,
   industrial and retail catalog markets.  Bindery services provide ink-jet
   labeling and demographic binding (which allows several different versions
   of the same catalog to be bound simultaneously).  Distribution services
   provided by various Banta operating units, including computerized mail
   distribution planning systems which assist the Corporation's customers in
   minimizing postage costs, are an integral part of catalog printing
   services.

       Printed materials for direct marketing customers are provided by three
   Banta units.  These products vary in format and size and include magazine
   and catalog inserts, bill stuffers, brochures, booklets, cards and target
   market products designed to sell a product or solicit a response. Over the
   past two years, the Corporation has invested in imaging equipment which
   personalizes direct mail pieces at press speeds. This capability is
   becoming increasingly important to customers and the Corporation expects
   to make additional investments in this important technology. The
   Corporation's acquisition of Danbury in 1994 improved its ability to
   provide direct marketing materials to customers in the Northeastern United
   States. These three units experienced higher levels of utilization in 1995
   than in 1994, which contributed to increased sales in this market.

       Catalog and direct marketing materials are primarily distributed
   through the United States Postal Service ("USPS") as third class or bulk
   rate mail.  The substantial escalation in postage rates, which increased
   by in excess of 14% effective January 1, 1995, significantly impacted the
   cost of doing business for the Corporation's customers, particularly when
   combined with the increases in paper prices (see Raw Materials section
   below).

       One of the Corporation's subsidiaries, Ling Products, Inc., provides
   printed products to the fast-food industry and converts poly film and
   paper into single-use products for the food service industry and health
   care industry.  In addition, Ling Products extrudes films, using both cast
   and blown extruders, for use in its manufacturing processes and for sale
   to external customers.  Its health care products include plastic garment
   covers, examination gowns, stretcher sheets, examination table paper,
   pillow covers, and gloves for personnel who come into contact with
   patients having highly communicable diseases. The acquisition of Applied
   Technology Corporation in 1995 expanded the health care product offerings
   to include disposable thermometer sheaths, dental camera covers, cotton-
   tipped applicators and tongue depressors.

   - Books

       The Corporation prints consumable elementary and high school workbooks
   and other products for publishers of educational and general book markets
   including textbooks (primarily soft cover), testing materials and
   paperbound books.  Print opportunities in the consumable educational
   workbook market have decreased during the last several years.  Publisher
   consolidations have resulted in fewer companies offering educational
   products which has reduced the number of projects printed.  Additionally,
   the effort to improve the nation's educational system has prompted schools
   to try alternate teaching methods.  Some of these efforts have replaced
   consumable workbooks with other  instructional materials.

       To reduce its concentration in the elementary and high school markets,
   the Corporation has increased its marketing efforts relating to other
   softcover books including college texts, general books, data manuals and
   software documentation for the computer industry.  The Corporation's
   operating units serving the computer equipment and software industries
   print manuals, using both offset printing and high speed photocopying, and
   offer complete turnkey services including computer disk replication,
   product packaging and distribution. The acquisition of B.G. Turnkey in
   1995 increased the Corporation's product offerings to include project
   management, procurement, packaging, assembly and fulfillment services for
   computer software and hardware manufacturers primarily in Europe. This
   acquisition will also enable the Corporation to help meet customers'
   international distribution needs. The Corporation's acquisition of UGI in
   1994 enhanced its ability to service software publishers in the
   Northwestern United States.

       The Corporation's book units also produce multimedia products for
   educational publishers, industry and professional and trade associations. 

       Other customers include publishers of trade books, calendars,
   religious books, cookbooks and manuals.

   - Magazines

       The Corporation's two plants serving the magazine market print, sort
   and mail magazines representing more than 500 different titles.  These
   magazines include primarily short-to-medium run publications (usually less
   than 350,000 copies) which are generally distributed to subscribers by
   mail.  The Corporation's magazine customers are primarily publishers of
   specialty magazines, including religious, business and professional
   journals and hobby, craft and sporting publications. The Corporation began
   provides its customers with computerized mailing list and distribution
   services.

       The January 1, 1995 postage rate increase and increasing paper prices
   (see Raw Materials section below) also increased operating costs for the
   Corporation's magazine customers.

   - Other

       Prepress services are provided by five of the Corporation's operating
   units to publishers, printers and advertising agencies.  Such services
   include the conversion of full-color photographs, art and text into color
   separated film for use in the production of printing plates. These units
   also provide electronic graphic design, digital photography and on-demand
   print services. During the last several years these units have diversified
   their customer base to include packaging customers and increased their
   ability to maximize plant utilization by connecting their facilities
   through an extensive network of high-speed T-1 telecommunication lines.

       During the past several years, the Corporation has expanded its
   service offerings to include CD-ROM production, CD Interactive programming
   and developing interactive online products for the World Wide Web. These
   services are primarily provided by three of the Corporation's subsidiaries
   - KnowledgeSet Corporation, The DI Group, Inc. And New Frontiers
   Information Corporation, which was acquired in 1995.

       KCS Industries Inc., a subsidiary of the Corporation, produces point-
   of-purchase products such as custom designed signs, displays, labels and
   decals for a variety of customers including those in the brewing,
   cosmetic, food, appliance, automotive and home entertainment industries. 
   KCS Industries also produces, through a joint venture, postage stamps in
   booklet, coil and sheet format for the USPS.

   Competitive Conditions.

       The Corporation is subject to competition from a large number of
   companies, some of which have greater resources and capacity than the
   Corporation. The graphic arts industry has undergone a period of
   consolidation for a number of years. This trend has resulted in the
   emergence of several additional competitors which are similar to the
   Corporation in size and product offerings. The major competitive factors
   in the Corporation's business are price, quality of finished products,
   distribution capabilities, ongoing customer service and availability of
   time on equipment which is appropriate in size and function for a given
   project.  The consolidation of customers within certain of the
   Corporation's markets provides both greater competitive pricing pressures
   and opportunities for increased volume solicitation.  In recent years,
   excess capacity in the printing industry has resulted in lower unit
   prices. Despite the unit price reductions, the Corporation has been able
   to improve its earnings in part because it is financially able to invest
   in modern technologically advanced equipment, which helps reduce unit
   costs, and because of productivity gains resulting from Continuous
   Improvement programs.

       There are seasonal fluctuations in the usage of printing equipment
   which in times of low demand and excess capacity can give rise to
   increased pricing pressure.  In the educational market, for instance,
   activity is greater in the first half of the year, and in the catalog and
   direct marketing markets, activity is greater in the second half of the
   year. Computer software and hardware products are also typically in
   greater demand during the second half of the year, although the release of
   a new product by a major customer can increase activity on an "event"
   basis at any time during the year.

   Raw Materials.

       The principal raw material used by the Corporation is paper.  Most of
   the Corporation's production facilities are located in heavily
   concentrated papermaking areas, and the Corporation can generally obtain
   quality paper at competitive prices.  The Corporation is not dependent
   upon any one source for its paper or other raw materials.

       In the fourth quarter of 1994 and throughout 1995, there was a
   dramatic increase in paper prices and a tightening of availability, with
   nearly all grades on allocation and delivery times extending up to six
   weeks or more. During the fourth quarter of 1995 paper prices stabilized
   somewhat, and it is anticipated that allocation restrictions may be
   reduced or eliminated in 1996 due to the softening demand for paper. The
   solid relationships the Corporation has built with paper suppliers over
   the years has been beneficial during periods of limited paper availability
   as the Corporation is able to meet its customers needs and was able to
   accommodate its added production capacity in 1995. It is customary for
   printers to adjust sales prices to reflect market fluctuations in paper
   prices. The average cost of paper to the Corporation's customers was about
   33% higher in 1995 than in 1994, 3% lower in 1994 than in 1993 and 2%
   higher in 1993 than in 1992.

       The Corporation uses a number of other raw materials including ink,
   resins, solvents, adhesives, wire, packaging materials and subcontracted
   components.  Costs for many of these materials increased significantly
   during the second half of 1994 and throughout 1995.

   Development.

       In the graphic arts industry, most research and development is done by
   equipment and material suppliers.  The Corporation generally does not
   engage in long-range research and development relating to equipment and
   has not spent significant amounts of money for such purposes.  One of the
   purposes of the Corporation's technical research and development effort is
   to establish a competitive advantage in existing markets by focusing on
   improving operating procedures, increasing machine speeds and improving
   monitoring of paper usage, as well as working on the development of
   proprietary inks, coatings, adhesives and machine modifications. The
   Corporation has also increased its emphasis on the development of new
   products and services using digital technology which includes video tape,
   CD-ROM and data base management products.  During the last several years,
   eleven professional and technical employees have worked primarily on
   research and development activities.  Additionally, approximately fifty
   persons from quality control and engineering devoted a portion of their
   time to research and development.

       The Corporation has environmental compliance programs primarily for
   control of internal and external air quality, ground water quality,
   disposal of waste material and all aspects of the work environment
   concerning employee health.  Capital expenditures for air quality
   equipment have approximated 1% to 3% of total capital expenditures in each
   of the last three years.  Planned capital expenditures for environmental
   control equipment are expected to be in the same range for 1996.  The
   Corporation also incurs ongoing costs in monitoring compliance with
   environmental laws, in connection with disposal of waste materials and in
   connection with laws governing the remediation of sites at which the
   Corporation has previously disposed of waste materials.  Requirements of
   the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state officials nationwide,
   relating to disposal of wastes in landfill sites, are increasing and
   result in higher costs for the Corporation and its competitors.  Costs for
   environmental compliance and waste disposal have not been material to the
   Corporation in the past, but the Corporation presently believes that
   expenditures for these purposes will have a negative impact on its
   earnings and those of its competition in the future.  These increased
   costs should not have a material impact on the Corporation's competitive
   position, assuming similar expenditures are required to be made by
   competitors. The Corporation does not believe at the present time that any
   costs, claims or penalties that may be incurred or assessed under
   environmental laws, in connection with known environmental assessment and
   remediation matters, beyond any reserves already provided, will have a
   material adverse effect upon the operations or consolidated financial
   position of the Corporation.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT  PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

   We have audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
   the consolidated financial statements included in the Banta Corporation
   annual report to shareholders and incorporated by reference in this Form
   10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated January 30, 1996. Our audit
   was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those statements taken
   as a whole. The schedule listed in the index in item 14(a) (2) is the
   responsibility of the Corporation's management and is presented for
   purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules
   and is not part of the basic financial statements. The schedule has been
   subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic
   financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material
   respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation
   to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

                                BANTA CORPORATION    
                            (a Wisconsin corporation)


                               ARTICLE I.  OFFICES

             1.01.     Principal and Business Offices.  The corporation may
   have such principal and other business offices, either within or without
   the State of Wisconsin, as the Board of Directors may designate or as the
   business of the corporation may require from time to time.

             1.02.     Registered Office.  The registered office of the
   corporation required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law to be
   maintained in the State of Wisconsin may be, but need not be, identical
   with the principal office in the State of Wisconsin, and the address of
   the registered office may be changed from time to time by the Board of
   Directors.  The business office of the registered agent of the corporation
   shall be identical to such registered office.

                            ARTICLE II.  SHAREHOLDERS

             2.01.     Annual Meeting.  The annual meeting of the
   shareholders of the corporation (the "Annual Meeting") shall be held on
   the second Tuesday in the month of April of each year, at the hour of two
   (2) o'clock p.m. (local time), or at such other time and date as may be
   fixed by or under the authority of the Board of Directors, for the purpose
   of electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as
   may properly come before the Annual Meeting in accordance with Section
   2.13 of these by-laws.  If the day fixed for the Annual Meeting shall be a
   legal holiday in the State of Wisconsin, such meeting shall be held on the
   next succeeding business day.  If the election of directors shall not be
   held on the day designated herein, or fixed as herein provided, for any
   Annual Meeting, or at any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors
   shall cause the election to be held at a special meeting of the
   shareholders (a "Special Meeting") as soon thereafter as conveniently may
   be.  In fixing a meeting date for any Annual Meeting, the Board of
   Directors may consider such factors as it deems relevant within the good
   faith exercise of its business judgment.

             2.02.     Special Meetings.

             (a)  A Special Meeting may be called only by (i) the Chairman of
   the Board, (ii) the President or (iii) the Board of Directors and shall be
   called by the Chairman of the Board or the President upon the demand, in
   accordance with this Section 2.02, of the holders of record of shares
   representing at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on any
   issue proposed to be considered at the Special Meeting.

             (b)  In order that the corporation may determine the
   shareholders entitled to demand a Special Meeting, the Board of Directors
   may fix a record date to determine the shareholders entitled to make such
   a demand (the "Demand Record Date").  The Demand Record Date shall not
   precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the Demand Record Date
   is adopted by the Board of Directors and shall not be more than 10 days
   after the date upon which the resolution fixing the Demand Record Date is
   adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to
   have shareholders demand a Special Meeting shall, by sending written
   notice to the Secretary of the corporation by hand or by certified or
   registered mail, return receipt requested, request the Board of Directors
   to fix a Demand Record Date.  The Board of Directors shall promptly, but
   in all events within 10 days after the date on which a valid request to
   fix a Demand Record Date is received, adopt a resolution fixing the Demand
   Record Date and shall make a public announcement of such Demand Record
   Date.  If no Demand Record Date has been fixed by the Board of Directors
   within 10 days after the date on which such request is received by the
   Secretary, the Demand Record Date shall be the 10th day after the first
   day on which a valid written request to set a Demand Record Date is
   received by the Secretary.  To be valid, such written request shall set
   forth the purpose or purposes for which the Special Meeting is to be held,
   shall be signed by one or more shareholders of record (or their duly
   authorized proxies or other representatives), shall bear the date of
   signature of each such shareholder (or proxy or other representative) and
   shall set forth all information about each such shareholder and about the
   beneficial owner or owners, if any, on whose behalf the request is made
   that would be required to be set forth in a shareholder's notice described
   in paragraph (a)(ii) of Section 2.13 of these by-laws.

             (c)  In order for a shareholder or shareholders to demand a
   Special Meeting, a written demand or demands for a Special Meeting by the
   holders of record as of the Demand Record Date of shares representing at
   least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be
   considered at the Special Meeting must be delivered to the corporation. 
   To be valid, each written demand by a shareholder for a Special Meeting
   shall set forth the specific purpose or purposes for which the Special
   Meeting is to be held (which purpose or purposes shall be limited to the
   purpose or purposes set forth in the written request to set a Demand
   Record Date received by the corporation pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
   Section 2.02, shall be signed by one or more persons who as of the Demand
   Record Date are shareholders of record (or their duly authorized proxies
   or other representatives), shall bear the date of signature of each such
   shareholder (or proxy or other representative), and shall set forth the
   name and address, as they appear in the corporation's books, of each
   shareholder signing such demand and the class or series and number of
   shares of the corporation which are owned of record and beneficially by
   each such shareholder, shall be sent to the Secretary by hand or by
   certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and shall be
   received by the Secretary within 70 days after the Demand Record Date.

             (d)  The corporation shall not be required to call a Special
   Meeting upon shareholder demand unless, in addition to the documents
   required by paragraph (c) of this Section 2.02, the Secretary receives a
   written agreement signed by each Soliciting Shareholder (as defined
   herein), pursuant to which each Soliciting Shareholder, jointly and
   severally, agrees to pay the corporation's costs of holding the Special
   Meeting, including the costs of preparing and mailing proxy materials for
   the corporation's own solicitation, provided that if each of the
   resolutions introduced by any Soliciting Shareholder at such meeting is
   adopted, and each of the individuals nominated by or on behalf of any
   Soliciting Shareholder for election as director at such meeting is
   elected, then the Soliciting Shareholders shall not be required to pay
   such costs.  For purposes of this paragraph (d), the following terms shall
   have the meanings set forth below:

             (i)  "Affiliate" of any Person shall mean any Person
        controlling, controlled by or under common control with such
        first Person.

             (ii) "Participant" shall have the meaning assigned to such
        term in Rule 14a-11 promulgated under the Securities Exchange
        Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").

             (iii)  "Person" shall mean any individual, firm,
        corporation, partnership, joint venture, association, trust,
        unincorporated organization or other entity.

             (iv) "Proxy" shall have the meaning assigned to such term
        in Rule 14a-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

             (v)  "Solicitation" shall have the meaning assigned to such
        term in Rule 14a-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

             (vi) "Soliciting Shareholder" shall mean, with respect to
        any Special Meeting demanded by a shareholder or shareholders,
        any of the following Persons:

                  (A)  if the number of shareholders signing the demand or
             demands for a meeting delivered to the corporation pursuant to
             paragraph (c) of this Section 2.02 is 10 or fewer, each
             shareholder signing any such demand;

                  (B)  if the number of shareholders signing the demand or
             demands for a meeting delivered to the corporation pursuant to
             paragraph (c) of this Section 2.02 is more than 10, each Person
             who either (I) was a Participant in any Solicitation of such
             demand or demands or (II) at the time of the delivery to the
             corporation of the documents described in paragraph (c) of this
             Section 2.02, had engaged or intended to engage in any
             Solicitation of Proxies for use at such Special Meeting (other
             than a Solicitation of Proxies on behalf of the corporation); or

                  (C)  any Affiliate of a Soliciting Shareholder, if a
             majority of the directors then in office determine, reasonably
             and in good faith, that such Affiliate should be required to
             sign the written notice described in paragraph (c) of this
             Section 2.02 and/or the written agreement described in this
             paragraph (d) in order to prevent the purposes of this Section
             2.02 from being evaded.

             (e)  Except as provided in the following sentence, any Special
   Meeting shall be held at such hour and day as may be designated by
   whichever of the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Board of
   Directors shall have called such meeting.  In the case of any Special
   Meeting called by the Chairman of the Board or the President upon the
   demand of shareholders (a "Demand Special Meeting"), such meeting shall be
   held at such hour and day as may be designated by the Board of Directors;
   provided, however, that the date of any Demand Special Meeting shall be
   not more than 70 days after the Meeting Record Date (as defined in Section
   2.05 of these by-laws); and provided further that in the event that the
   directors then in office fail to designate an hour and date for a Demand
   Special Meeting within 10 days after the date that valid written demands
   for such meeting by the holders of record as of the Demand Record Date of
   shares representing at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on
   any issue proposed to be considered at the Special Meeting are delivered
   to the corporation (the "Delivery Date"), then such meeting shall be held
   at 2:00 p.m. (local time) on the 100th day after the Delivery Date or, if
   such 100th day is not a Business Day (as defined below), on the first
   preceding Business Day.  In fixing a meeting date for any Special Meeting,
   the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Board of Directors may
   consider such factors as he or it deems relevant within the good faith
   exercise of his or its business judgment, including, without limitation,
   the nature of the action proposed to be taken, the facts and circumstances
   surrounding any demand for such meeting, and any plan of the Board of
   Directors to call an Annual Meeting or a Special Meeting for the conduct
   of related business.

             (f)  The corporation may engage nationally or regionally
   recognized independent inspectors of elections to act as an agent of the
   corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of
   the validity of any purported written demand or demands for a Special
   Meeting received by the Secretary.  For the purpose of permitting the
   inspectors to perform such review, no purported demand shall be deemed to
   have been delivered to the corporation until the earlier of (i) 5 Business
   Days following receipt by the Secretary of such purported demand and (ii)
   such date as the independent inspectors certify to the corporation that
   the valid demands received by the Secretary represent at least 10% of all
   the votes entitled to be cast on each issue proposed to be considered at
   the Special Meeting.  Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way
   be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any
   shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any demand,
   whether during or after such 5 Business Day period, or to take any other
   action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or
   defense of any litigation with respect thereto).

             (g)  For purposes of these by-laws, "Business Day" shall mean
   any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking
   institutions in the State of Wisconsin are authorized or obligated by law
   or executive order to close.

             2.03.     Place of Meeting.  The Board of Directors, the
   Chairman of the Board or the President may designate any place, either
   within or without the State of Wisconsin, as the place of meeting for any
   Annual Meeting or for any Special Meeting, or for any postponement
   thereof.  If no designation is made, the place of meeting shall be the
   principal business office of the corporation in the State of Wisconsin. 
   Any meeting may be adjourned to reconvene at any place designated by vote
   of the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board or the
   President.

             2.04.     Notice of Meeting.  Written notice stating the place,
   day and hour of any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting shall be delivered
   not less than 10 (unless a longer period is required by the Wisconsin
   Business Corporation Law) nor more than 70 days before the date of such
   meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the
   Secretary, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting
   and to other shareholders as may be required by the Wisconsin Business
   Corporation Law.  In the event of any Demand Special Meeting, such notice
   of meeting shall be sent not more than 30 days after the Delivery Date. 
   If mailed, notice pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall be deemed to be
   effective when deposited in the United States mail, addressed to each
   shareholder at his or her address as it appears on the stock record books
   of the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid.  Unless otherwise
   required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, a notice of an Annual
   Meeting need not include a description of the purpose for which the
   meeting is called.  In the case of any Special Meeting, (a) the notice of
   meeting shall describe any business that the Board of Directors shall have
   theretofore determined to bring before the meeting and (b) in the case of
   a Demand Special Meeting, the notice of meeting (i) shall describe any
   business set forth in the statement of purpose of the demands received by
   the corporation in accordance with Section 2.02 of these by-laws and (ii)
   shall contain all of the information required in the notice received by
   the corporation in accordance with Section 2.13(b) of these by-laws.  If
   an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting is adjourned to a different date,
   time or place, the corporation shall not be required to give notice of the
   new date, time or place if the new date, time or place is announced at the
   meeting before adjournment; provided, however, that if a new Meeting
   Record Date for an adjourned meeting is or must be fixed, the corporation
   shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to persons who are shareholders
   as of the new Meeting Record Date.

             2.05.     Fixing of Record Date.  The Board of Directors may fix
   in advance a date not less than 10 days and not more than 70 days prior to
   the date of any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting as the record date for
   the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at,
   such meeting (the "Meeting Record Date").  In the case of any Demand
   Special Meeting, (i) the Meeting Record Date shall be not later than the
   30th day after the Delivery Date and (ii) if the Board of Directors fails
   to fix the Meeting Record Date within 30 days after the Delivery Date,
   then the close of business on such 30th day shall be the Meeting Record
   Date.  The shareholders of record on the Meeting Record Date shall be the
   shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting.  Except as
   provided by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law for a court-ordered
   adjournment, a determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to
   vote at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting is effective for any
   adjournment of such meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new
   Meeting Record Date, which it shall do if the meeting is adjourned to a
   date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting. 
   The Board of Directors may also fix in advance a date as the record date
   for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to take any other
   action or determining shareholders for any other purpose.  Such record
   date shall be not more than 70 days prior to the date on which the
   particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be
   taken.  The record date for determining shareholders entitled to a
   distribution (other than a distribution involving a purchase, redemption
   or other acquisition of the corporation's shares) or a share dividend is
   the date on which the Board of Directors authorizes the distribution or
   share dividend, as the case may be, unless the Board of Directors fixes a
   different record date.

             2.06.     Shareholder Lists.  After a Meeting Record Date has
   been fixed, the corporation shall prepare a list of the names of all of
   the shareholders entitled to notice of the meeting.  The list shall be
   arranged by class or series of shares, if any, and show the address of and
   number of shares held by each shareholder.  Such list shall be available
   for inspection by any shareholder, beginning two business days after
   notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and
   continuing to the date of the meeting, at the corporation's principal
   office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where
   the meeting will be held.  A shareholder or his or her agent may, on
   written demand, inspect and, subject to the limitations imposed by the
   Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, copy the list, during regular business
   hours and at his or her expense, during the period that it is available
   for inspection pursuant to this Section 2.06.  The corporation shall make
   the shareholders' list available at the meeting and any shareholder or his
   or her agent or attorney may inspect the list at any time during the
   meeting or any adjournment thereof.  Refusal or failure to prepare or make
   available the shareholders' list shall not affect the validity of any
   action taken at a meeting of shareholders.

             2.07.     Quorum and Voting Requirements; Postponements;
   Adjournments.

             (a)  Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take
   action on a matter at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting only if a
   quorum of those shares exists with respect to that matter.  If the
   corporation has only one class of stock outstanding, such class shall
   constitute a separate voting group for purposes of this Section 2.07. 
   Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, any by-law
   adopted under authority granted in the Articles of Incorporation, or the
   Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, a majority of the votes entitled to be
   cast on the matter shall constitute a quorum of the voting group for
   action on that matter.  Once a share is represented for any purpose at any
   Annual Meeting or Special Meeting, other than for the purpose of objecting
   to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, it is
   considered present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists for
   the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting
   unless a new Meeting Record Date is or must be set for the adjourned
   meeting.  If a quorum exists, except in the case of the election of
   directors, action on a matter shall be approved if the votes cast within
   the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the
   action, unless the Articles of Incorporation, any by-law adopted under
   authority granted in the Articles of Incorporation, or the Wisconsin
   Business Corporation Law requires a greater number of affirmative votes.
   Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, directors
   shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled
   to vote in the election of directors at any Annual Meeting or Special
   Meeting at which a quorum is present. For purposes of this Section
   2.07(a), "plurality" means that the individuals with the largest number of
   votes are elected as directors up to the maximum number of directors to be
   chosen at the Annual Meeting or Special Meeting.

             (b)  The Board of Directors acting by resolution may postpone
   and reschedule any previously scheduled Annual Meeting or Special Meeting;
   provided, however, that a Demand Special Meeting shall not be postponed
   beyond the 100th day following the Delivery Date.  Any Annual Meeting or
   Special Meeting may be adjourned from time to time, whether or not there
   is a quorum, (i) at any time, upon a resolution of shareholders if the
   votes cast in favor of such resolution by the holders of shares of each
   voting group entitled to vote on any matter theretofore properly brought
   before the meeting exceed the number of votes cast against such resolution
   by the holders of shares of each such voting group or (ii) at any time
   prior to the transaction of any business at such meeting, by the Chairman
   of the Board or pursuant to resolution of the Board of Directors.  No
   notice of the time and place of adjourned meetings need be given except as
   required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law.  At any adjourned
   meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business
   may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as
   originally notified.

             2.08.     Conduct of Meetings.  The Chairman of the Board, and
   in his absence the President, shall call any Annual Meeting or Special
   Meeting to order and shall act as chairman of such meeting.  In the
   absence of the Chairman of the Board and the President, such duties shall
   be performed by a Vice-President in the order provided under Section 4.07,
   or in their absence, by any person chosen by the shareholders present. 
   The Secretary of the corporation shall act as secretary of all Annual
   Meetings and Special Meetings, but, in the absence of the Secretary, the
   presiding officer may appoint any other person to act as secretary of the
   meeting.

             2.09.     Proxies.  At any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting, a
   shareholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy.  A
   shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the
   shareholder by signing an appointment form, either personally or by his or
   her attorney-in-fact. An appointment of a proxy is effective when received
   by the Secretary or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized
   to tabulate votes.  An appointment is valid for eleven months from the
   date of its signing unless a different period is expressly provided in the
   appointment form.  The Board of Directors shall have the power and
   authority to make rules establishing presumptions as to the validity and
   sufficiency of proxies.

             2.10.     Voting of Shares.  Each outstanding share shall be
   entitled to one vote upon each matter submitted to a vote at any Annual
   Meeting or Special Meeting except to the extent that the voting rights of
   the shares of any class or classes are enlarged, limited or denied by the
   Articles of Incorporation or the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law.

             2.11.     Acceptance of Instruments Showing Shareholder Action. 
   If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment
   corresponds to the name of a shareholder, the corporation, if acting in
   good faith, may accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and
   give it effect as the act of a shareholder.  If the name signed on a vote,
   consent, waiver or proxy appointment does not correspond to the name of a
   shareholder, the corporation, if acting in good faith, may accept the
   vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act
   of the shareholder if any of the following apply:

             (a)  The shareholder is an entity and the name signed purports
   to be that of an officer or agent of the entity.

             (b)  The name purports to be that of a personal representative,
   administrator, executor, guardian or conservator representing the
   shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence of fiduciary status
   acceptable to the corporation is presented with respect to the vote,
   consent, waiver or proxy appointment.

             (c)  The name signed purports to be that of a receiver or
   trustee in bankruptcy of the shareholder and, if the corporation requests,
   evidence of this status acceptable to the corporation is presented with
   respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment.

             (d)  The name signed purports to be that of a pledgee,
   beneficial owner, or attorney-in-fact of the shareholder and, if the
   corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the corporation of the
   signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder is presented with
   respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment.

             (e)  Two or more persons are the shareholders as co-tenants or
   fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at least one of
   the co-owners and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all
   co-owners.

   The corporation may reject a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment if
   the Secretary or other officer or agent of the corporation who is
   authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis
   for doubt about the validity of the signature on it or about the
   signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder.

             2.12.     Waiver of Notice by Shareholders.  A shareholder may
   waive any notice required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, the
   Articles of Incorporation or these by-laws before or after the date and
   time stated in the notice. The waiver shall be in writing and signed by
   the shareholder entitled to the notice, contain the same information that
   would have been required in the notice under applicable provisions of the
   Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (except that the time and place of
   meeting need not be stated) and be delivered to the corporation for
   inclusion in the corporate records.  A shareholder's attendance at any
   Annual Meeting or Special Meeting, in person or by proxy, waives objection
   to all of the following:  (a) lack of notice or defective notice of the
   meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting or
   promptly upon arrival objects to holding the meeting or transacting
   business at the meeting; and (b) consideration of a particular matter at
   the meeting that is not within the purpose described in the meeting
   notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it
   is presented.

             2.13.     Notice of Shareholder Business and Nomination of
   Directors.

             (a)  Annual Meetings.

             (i)  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of
        Directors of the corporation and the proposal of business to be
        considered by the shareholders may be made at an Annual Meeting
        (A) pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting, (B) by or
        at the direction of the Board of Directors or (C) by any
        shareholder of the corporation who is a shareholder of record at
        the time of giving of notice provided for in this by-law and who
        is entitled to vote at the meeting and complies with the notice
        procedures set forth in this Section 2.13.

             (ii) For nominations or other business to be properly
        brought before an Annual Meeting by a shareholder pursuant to
        clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i) of this Section 2.13, the
        shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to
        the Secretary of the corporation.  To be timely, a shareholder's
        notice shall be received by the Secretary of the corporation at
        the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than
        60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the second Tuesday in the
        month of April; provided, however, that in the event that the
        date of the Annual Meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or
        delayed by more than 60 days from the second Tuesday in the
        month of April, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be
        so received not earlier than the 90th day prior to the date of
        such Annual Meeting and not later than the close of business on
        the later of (x) the 60th day prior to such Annual Meeting and
        (y) the 10th day following the day on which public announcement
        of the date of such meeting is first made.  Such shareholder's
        notice shall be signed by the shareholder of record who intends
        to make the nomination or introduce the other business (or his
        duly authorized proxy or other representative), shall bear the
        date of signature of such shareholder (or proxy or other
        representative) and shall set forth:  (A) the name and address,
        as they appear on this corporation's books, of such shareholder
        and the beneficial owner or owners, if any, on whose behalf the
        nomination or proposal is made; (B) the class and number of
        shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by such
        shareholder or beneficial owner or owners; (C) a representation
        that such shareholder is a holder of record of shares of the
        corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to
        appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to make the
        nomination or introduce the other business specified in the
        notice; (D) in the case of any proposed nomination for election
        or re-election as a director, (I) the name and residence address
        of the person or persons to be nominated, (II) a description of
        all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder or
        beneficial owner or owners and each nominee and any other person
        or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the
        nomination is to be made by such shareholder, (III) such other
        information regarding each nominee proposed by such shareholder
        as would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies
        for elections of directors, or would be otherwise required to be
        disclosed, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the
        Exchange Act, including any information that would be required
        to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to Regulation
        14A had the nominee been nominated by the Board of Directors and
        (IV) the written consent of each nominee to be named in a proxy
        statement and to serve as a director of the corporation if so
        elected; and (E) in the case of any other business that such
        shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, (I) a brief
        description of the business desired to be brought before the
        meeting and, if such business includes a proposal to amend these
        by-laws, the language of the proposed amendment, (II) such
        shareholder's and beneficial owner's or owners' reasons for
        conducting such business at the meeting and (III) any material
        interest in such business of such shareholder and beneficial
        owner or owners.

             (iii)  Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of
        paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 2.13 to the contrary, in the
        event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of
        Directors of the corporation is increased and there is no public
        announcement naming all of the nominees for director or
        specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors made by
        the corporation at least 70 days prior to the second Tuesday in
        the month of April, a shareholder's notice required by this
        Section 2.13 shall also be considered timely, but only with
        respect to nominees for any new positions created by such
        increase, if it shall be received by the Secretary at the
        principal executive offices of the corporation not later than
        the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which
        such public announcement is first made by the corporation.

             (b)  Special Meetings.  Only such business shall be conducted at
   a Special Meeting as shall have been described in the notice of meeting
   sent to shareholders pursuant to Section 2.04 of these by-laws. 
   Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made
   at a Special Meeting at which directors are to be elected pursuant to such
   notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or
   (ii) by any shareholder of the corporation who (A) is a shareholder of
   record at the time of giving of such notice of meeting, (B) is entitled to
   vote at the meeting and (C) complies with the notice procedures set forth
   in this Section 2.13.  Any shareholder desiring to nominate persons for
   election to the Board of Directors at such a Special Meeting shall cause a
   written notice to be received by the Secretary of the corporation at the
   principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than 90 days
   prior to such Special Meeting and not later than the close of business on
   the later of (x) the 60th day prior to such Special Meeting and (y) the
   10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of
   the date of such Special Meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board
   of Directors to be elected at such meeting.  Such written notice shall be
   signed by the shareholder of record who intends to make the nomination (or
   his duly authorized proxy or other representative), shall bear the date of
   signature of such shareholder (or proxy or other representative) and shall
   set forth:  (A) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's
   books, of such shareholder and the beneficial owner or owners, if any, on
   whose behalf the nomination is made; (B) the class and number of shares of
   the corporation which are beneficially owned by such shareholder or
   beneficial owner or owners; (C) a representation that such shareholder is
   a holder of record of shares of the corporation entitled to vote at such
   meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to make
   the nomination specified in the notice; (D) the name and residence address
   of the person or persons to be nominated; (E) a description of all
   arrangements or understandings between such shareholder or beneficial
   owner or owners and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming
   such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination is to be made by
   such shareholder; (F) such other information regarding each nominee
   proposed by such shareholder as would be required to be disclosed in
   solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or would be otherwise
   required to be disclosed, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under
   the Exchange Act, including any information that would be required to be
   included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to Regulation 14A had the
   nominee been nominated by the Board of Directors; and (G) the written
   consent of each nominee to be named in a proxy statement and to serve as a
   director of the corporation if so elected.

             (c)  General.

             (i)  Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the
        procedures set forth in this Section 2.13 shall be eligible to
        serve as directors.  Only such business shall be conducted at an
        Annual Meeting or Special Meeting as shall have been brought
        before such meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth
        in this Section 2.13.  The chairman of the meeting shall have
        the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any
        business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in
        accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.13
        and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance
        with this Section 2.13, to declare that such defective proposal
        shall be disregarded.

             (ii) For purposes of this Section 2.13, "public
        announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported
        by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable
        national news service or in a document publicly filed by the
        corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant
        to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

             (iii)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
        Section 2.13, a shareholder shall also comply with all
        applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
        regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in
        this Section 2.13.  Nothing in this Section 2.13 shall be deemed
        to limit the corporation's obligation to include shareholder
        proposals in its proxy statement if such inclusion is required
        by Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

                        ARTICLE III.  BOARD OF DIRECTORS

             3.01.     General Powers and Number.    All corporate powers
   shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and
   affairs of the corporation shall be managed under the direction of, its
   Board of Directors.  The number of directors of the corporation shall be
   nine (9).

             3.02.     Tenure and Qualifications.  Each director shall hold
   office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his
   successor shall have been elected and qualified, or until there is a
   decrease in the number of directors which takes effect after the
   expiration of his term, or until his prior death, resignation or removal. 
   A director may be removed by the shareholders only at a meeting called for
   the purpose of removing the director, and the meeting notice shall state
   that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is removal of the
   director.  A director may be removed from office but only for cause (as
   defined herein) if the number of votes cast to remove the director exceeds
   the number of votes cast not to remove him; provided, however, that, if
   the Board of Directors, by resolution, shall have recommended removal of a
   director, then the shareholders may remove such director without cause by
   the vote referred to above.  As used herein, "cause" shall exist only if
   the director whose removal is proposed has been convicted of a felony by a
   court of competent jurisdiction, where such conviction is no longer
   subject to direct appeal, or has been adjudged liable for actions or
   omissions in the performance of his duty to the corporation in a matter
   which has had a materially adverse effect on the business of the
   corporation, where such adjudication is no longer subject to appeal.  A
   director may resign at any time by delivering written notice which
   complies with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law to the Chairman of
   the Board or to the corporation.  A director's resignation is effective
   when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective
   date.  Directors need not be residents of the State of Wisconsin but must
   be shareholders of the corporation.

             3.03.     Regular Meetings.  A regular meeting of the Board of
   Directors shall be held without other notice than this by-law immediately
   after the Annual Meeting, and each adjourned session thereof.  The place
   of such regular meeting shall be the same as the place of the Annual
   Meeting which precedes it, or such other suitable place as may be
   announced at such Annual Meeting.  The Board of Directors may provide, by
   resolution, the time and place, either within or without the State of
   Wisconsin, for the holding of additional regular meetings without other
   notice than such resolution.

             3.04.     Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Board of
   Directors may be called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board,
   the President or any three directors. The Chairman of the Board or the
   President may fix any place, either within or without the State of
   Wisconsin, as the place for holding any special meeting of the Board of
   Directors, and if no other place is fixed the place of meeting shall be
   the principal business office of the corporation in the State of
   Wisconsin.

             3.05.     Notice; Waiver.  Notice of each meeting of the Board
   of Directors (unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to Section 3.03)
   shall be given by written notice delivered or communicated in person, by
   telegram, facsimile or other form of wire or wireless communication, or by
   mail or private carrier, to each director at his business address or at
   such other address as such director shall have designated in writing filed
   with the Secretary, in each case not less than 48 hours prior to the time
   of the meeting.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be effective
   when deposited in the United States mail so addressed, with postage
   thereon prepaid.  If notice be given by telegram, such notice shall be
   deemed to be effective when the telegram is delivered to the telegraph
   company.  If notice is given by private carrier, such notice shall be
   deemed to be effective when the notice is delivered to the private
   carrier.  Whenever any notice whatever is required to be given to any
   director of the corporation under the Articles of Incorporation or these
   by-laws or any provision of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, a
   waiver thereof in writing, signed at any time, whether before or after the
   time of meeting, by the director entitled to such notice, shall be deemed
   equivalent to the giving of such notice.  The corporation shall retain any
   such waiver as part of the permanent corporate records.  A director's
   attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to
   him of the meeting unless the director at the beginning of the meeting or
   promptly upon his arrival objects to holding the meeting or transacting
   business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to
   action taken at the meeting.  Neither the business to be transacted at,
   nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board of
   Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such
   meeting.

             3.06.     Quorum.  Except as otherwise provided by the Wisconsin
   Business Corporation Law or by the Articles of Incorporation or these
   by-laws, a majority of the number of directors set forth in Section 3.01
   shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting
   of the Board of Directors, but a majority of the directors present (though
   less than such quorum) may adjourn the meeting from time to time without
   further notice.

             3.07.     Manner of Acting.  The act of the majority of the
   directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the
   act of the Board of Directors, unless the act of a greater number is
   required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law or by the Articles of
   Incorporation or these by-laws.

             3.08.     Conduct of Meetings.  The Chairman of the Board, and
   in his absence, the President, or a Vice-President in the order provided
   under Section 4.07, and in their absence, any director chosen by the
   directors present, shall call meetings of the Board of Directors to order
   and shall act as chairman of the meeting.  The Secretary of the
   corporation shall act as secretary of all meetings of the Board of
   Directors, but in the absence of the Secretary, the presiding officer may
   appoint any Assistant Secretary or any director or other person present to
   act as secretary of the meeting.  Minutes of any regular or special
   meeting of the Board of Directors shall be prepared and distributed to
   each director.

             3.09.     Vacancies.  Except as provided below, any vacancy
   occurring in the Board of Directors, including a vacancy resulting from an
   increase in the number of directors, may be filled by any of the
   following:  (a) the shareholders; (b) the Board of Directors; or (c) if
   the directors remaining in office constitute fewer than a quorum of the
   Board of Directors, the directors, by the affirmative vote of a majority
   of all directors remaining in office.  If the vacant office was held by a
   director elected by a voting group of shareholders, only the holders of
   shares of that voting group may vote to fill the vacancy if it is filled
   by the shareholders, and only the remaining directors elected by that
   voting group may vote to fill the vacancy if it is filled by the
   directors.  A vacancy that will occur at a specific later date, because of
   a resignation effective at a later date or otherwise, may be filled before
   the vacancy occurs, but the new director may not take office until the
   vacancy occurs.

             3.10.     Compensation.  The Board of Directors, by affirmative
   vote of a majority of the directors then in office, and irrespective of
   any personal interest of any of its members, may establish reasonable
   compensation of all directors for services to the corporation as
   directors, officers or otherwise, or may delegate such authority to an
   appropriate committee.  The Board of Directors also shall have authority
   to provide for or to delegate authority to an appropriate committee to
   provide for reasonable pensions, disability or death benefits, and other
   benefits or payments, to directors, officers and employees to the
   corporation.

             3.11.     Presumption of Assent.  A director of the corporation
   who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee
   thereof of which he is a member at which action on any corporate matter is
   taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless any of
   the following occurs:  (a) the director objects at the beginning of the
   meeting or promptly upon his arrival to holding the meeting or transacting
   business at the meeting; (b) the director dissents or abstains from an
   action taken and minutes of the meeting are prepared that show the
   director's dissent or abstention from the action taken; (c) the director
   delivers written notice that complies with the Wisconsin Business
   Corporation Law of his dissent or abstention to the presiding officer of
   the meeting before its adjournment or to the corporation immediately after
   adjournment of the meeting; or (d) the director dissents or abstains from
   an action taken, minutes of the meeting are prepared that fail to show the
   director's dissent or abstention from the action taken, and the director
   delivers to the corporation a written notice of that failure that complies
   with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law promptly after receiving the
   minutes.  Such right to dissent or abstain shall not apply to a director
   who voted in favor of such action.

             3.12.     Committees.  The Board of Directors by resolution
   adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the number of directors
   set forth in Section 3.01 may create one or more committees, appoint
   members of the Board of Directors to serve on the committees and designate
   other members of the Board of Directors to serve as alternates. Each
   committee shall have two or more members who shall, unless otherwise
   provided by the Board of Directors, serve at the pleasure of the Board of
   Directors.  A committee may be authorized to exercise the authority of the
   Board of Directors, except that a committee may not do any of the
   following:  (a) authorize distributions; (b) approve or propose to
   shareholders action that the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law requires
   to be approved by shareholders; (c) fill vacancies on the Board of
   Directors or, unless the Board of Directors provides by resolution that
   vacancies on a committee shall be filled by the affirmative vote of the
   remaining committee members, on any Board committee; (d) amend the
   corporation's Articles of Incorporation; (e) adopt, amend or repeal
   by-laws; (f) approve a plan of merger not requiring shareholder approval;
   (g) authorize or approve reacquisition of shares, except according to a
   formula or method prescribed by the Board of Directors; and (h) authorize
   or approve the issuance or sale or contract for sale of shares, or
   determine the designation and relative rights, preferences and limitations
   of a class or series of shares, except that the Board of Directors may
   authorize a committee to do so within limits prescribed by the Board of
   Directors.  Unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in
   creating the committee, a committee may employ counsel, accountants and
   other consultants to assist it in the exercise of its authority.

             3.13.     Telephonic Meetings.  Except as herein provided and
   notwithstanding any place set forth in the notice of the meeting or these
   by-laws, members of the Board of Directors (and any committee thereof) may
   participate in regular or special meetings by, or through the use of, any
   means of communication by which all participants may simultaneously hear
   each other, such as by conference telephone.  If a meeting is conducted by
   such means, then at the commencement of such meeting the presiding officer
   shall inform the participating directors that a meeting is taking place at
   which official business may be transacted. Any participant in a meeting by
   such means shall be deemed present in person at such meeting. 
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, no action may be taken at any meeting held
   by such means on any particular matter which the presiding officer
   determines, in his sole discretion, to be inappropriate under the
   circumstances for action at a meeting held by such means.  Such
   determination shall be made and announced in advance of such meeting.

             3.14.     Unanimous Consent without Meeting.  Any action
   required or permitted by the Articles of Incorporation or these by-laws or
   any provision of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law to be taken by the
   Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) at a meeting may be taken
   without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so
   taken, shall be signed by all members of the Board or of the committee, as
   the case may be, then in office.  Such action shall be effective when the
   last director or committee member signs the consent, unless the consent
   specifies a different effective date.

                              ARTICLE IV.  OFFICERS

             4.01.     Number.  The principal officers of the corporation
   shall be a Chairman of the Board, a President, one or more
   Vice-Presidents, not to exceed six (6) at any given time, a Secretary, and
   a Treasurer, each of whom shall be elected by the Board of Directors. 
   Such other officers and assistant officers as may be deemed necessary may
   be elected or appointed by the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors
   may also authorize any duly appointed officer to appoint one or more
   officers or assistant officers.  Any two or more offices may be held by
   the same person.

             4.02.     Election and Term of Office.  The officers of the
   corporation to be elected by the Board of Directors shall be elected
   annually by the Board of Directors at the first meeting of the Board of
   Directors held after the Annual Meeting.  If the election of officers
   shall not be held at such meeting, such election shall be held as soon
   thereafter as conveniently may be.  Each officer shall hold office until
   his successor shall have been duly elected or until his prior death,
   resignation or removal.

             4.03.     Removal and Resignation.  The Board of Directors may
   remove any officer and, unless restricted by the Board of Directors or
   these by-laws, an officer may remove any officer or assistant officer
   appointed by that officer, at any time, with or without cause and
   notwithstanding the contract rights, if any, of the officer removed. 
   Election or appointment shall not of itself create contract rights. An
   officer may resign at any time by delivering notice to the corporation
   that complies with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law.  The
   resignation shall be effective when the notice is delivered, unless the
   notice specifies a later effective date and the corporation accepts the
   later effective date.

             4.04.     Vacancies.  A vacancy in any principal office because
   of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or otherwise, shall be
   filled by the Board of Directors for the unexpired portion of the term. 
   If a resignation of an officer is effective at a later date as
   contemplated by Section 4.03 hereof, the Board of Directors may fill the
   pending vacancy before the effective date if the Board provides that the
   successor may not take office until the effective date.

             4.05.     Chairman of the Board.  The Chairman of the Board
   shall, when present, preside at all Annual Meetings and Special Meetings
   and at all meetings of the Board of Directors.  He shall perform such
   other duties and functions as shall be assigned to him from time to time
   by the Board of Directors or in these by-laws.  Except where by law the
   signature of the President of the corporation is required, the Chairman of
   the Board shall possess the same power and authority as the President to
   sign, execute and acknowledge, on behalf of the corporation, all deeds,
   mortgages, bonds, stock certificates, contracts, leases, reports and all
   other documents or instruments and shall have such additional power to
   sign, execute and acknowledge, on behalf of the corporation, as may be
   authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors.

             4.06.     President.  The President shall be the chief executive
   officer of the corporation and, subject to the control of the Board of
   Directors, shall in general supervise and control all of the business and
   affairs of the corporation.  He shall have authority, subject to such
   rules as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors, to appoint such
   agents and employees of the corporation as he shall deem necessary, to
   prescribe their powers, duties and compensation, and to delegate authority
   to them.  Such agents and employees shall hold office at the discretion of
   the President.  He shall have authority to sign, execute and acknowledge,
   on behalf of the corporation, all deeds, mortgages, bonds, stock
   certificates, contracts, leases, reports and all other documents or
   instruments necessary or proper to be executed in the course of the
   corporation's regular business, or which shall be authorized by resolution
   of the Board of Directors; and, except as otherwise provided by law or the
   Board of Directors, he may authorize any Vice President or other officer
   or agent of the corporation to sign, execute and acknowledge such
   documents or instruments in his place and stead.  In general he shall
   perform all duties incident to the office of President and such other
   duties as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors from time to time.

             4.07.     The Vice-Presidents.  In the absence of the President
   or in the event of his death, inability or refusal to act, or in the event
   for any reason it shall be impracticable for the President to act
   personally, the Vice-President (or in the event there be more than one
   Vice-President, the Vice-Presidents in the order designated by the Board
   of Directors, or in the absence of any designation, then in the order of
   their election) shall perform the duties of the President, and when so
   acting, shall have all the powers of and be subject to all the
   restrictions upon the President.  Any Vice-President may sign, with the
   Secretary or Assistant Secretary, certificates for shares of the
   corporation and shall perform such other duties and have such authority as
   from time to time may be delegated or assigned to him by the President or
   by the Board of Directors.  The execution of any instrument of the
   corporation by any Vice-President shall be conclusive evidence, as to
   third parties, of his authority to act in the stead of the President.

             4.08 The Secretary.  The Secretary shall:  (a) keep the minutes
   of all Annual Meetings and Special Meetings and of all meetings of the
   Board of Directors in one or more books provided for that purpose
   (including records of actions taken without a meeting); (b) see that all
   notices are duly given in accordance with the provisions of these by-laws
   or as required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law; (c) be custodian
   of the corporate records and of the seal of the corporation and see that
   the seal of the corporation is affixed to all documents the execution of
   which on behalf of the corporation under its seal is duly authorized; (d)
   maintain a record of the shareholders of the corporation, in a form that
   permits preparation of a list of the names and addresses of all
   shareholders, by class or series of shares and showing the number and
   class or series of shares held by each shareholder; (e) sign with the
   Chairman of the Board, the President, or a Vice-President, certificates
   for shares of the corporation, the issuance of which shall have been
   authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors; (f) have general
   charge of the stock transfer books of the corporation; and (g) in general
   perform all duties incident to the office of Secretary and have such other
   duties and exercise such authority as from time to time may be delegated
   or assigned to him by the President or by the Board of Directors.

             4.09.     The Treasurer.  The Treasurer shall:  (a) have charge
   and custody of and be responsible for all funds and securities of the
   corporation; (b) maintain appropriate accounting records; (c) receive and
   give receipts for moneys due and payable to the corporation from any
   source whatsoever, and deposit all such moneys in the name of the
   corporation in such banks, trust companies or other depositaries as shall
   be selected in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.04; and (d) in
   general perform all of the duties incident to the office of Treasurer and
   have such other duties and exercise such other authority as from time to
   time may be delegated or assigned to him by the President or by the Board
   of Directors.  If required by the Board of Directors, the Treasurer shall
   give a bond for the faithful discharge of his duties in such sum and with
   such surety or sureties as the Board of Directors shall determine.

             4.10.     Assistant Secretaries and Assistant Treasurers.  There
   shall be such number of Assistant Secretaries and Assistant Treasurers as
   the Board of Directors may from time to time authorize.  The Assistant
   Secretaries may sign with the Chairman of the Board, the President or a
   Vice-President certificates for shares of the corporation the issuance of
   which shall have been authorized by a resolution of the Board of
   Directors.  The Assistant Treasurers shall respectively, if required by
   the Board of Directors, give bonds for the faithful discharge of their
   duties in such sums and with such sureties as the Board of Directors shall
   determine.  The Assistant Secretaries and Assistant Treasurers, in
   general, shall perform such duties and have such authority as shall from
   time to time be delegated or assigned to them by the Secretary or the
   Treasurer, respectively, or by the President or the Board of Directors.

             4.11 Other Assistants and Acting Officers.  The Board of
   Directors shall have the power to appoint, or to authorize any duly
   appointed officer of the corporation to appoint, any person to act as
   assistant to any officer, or as agent for the corporation in his stead, or
   to perform the duties of such officer whenever for any reason it is
   impracticable for such officer to act personally, and such assistant or
   acting officer or other agent so appointed by the Board of Directors or
   the appointing officer shall have the power to perform all the duties of
   the office to which he is so appointed to be assistant, or as to which he
   is so appointed to act, except as such power may be otherwise defined or
   restricted by the Board of Directors or the appointing officer.

             4.12 Salaries.  The salaries of the principal officers shall be
   fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors or by a duly authorized
   committee thereof, and no officer shall be prevented from receiving such
   salary by reason of the fact that he is also a director of the
   corporation.

           ARTICLE V.  CONTRACTS, LOANS, CHECKS AND DEPOSITS; SPECIAL
                   CORPORATE ACTS

             5.01.     Contracts.  The Board of Directors may authorize any
   officer or officers, agent or agents, to enter into any contract or
   execute or deliver any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the
   corporation, and such authorization may be general or confined to specific
   instances.  In the absence of other designation, all deeds, mortgages and
   instruments of assignment or pledge made by the corporation shall be
   executed in the name of the corporation by the Chairman of the Board, the
   President or one of the Vice-Presidents and by the Secretary, an Assistant
   Secretary, the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer; the Secretary or an
   Assistant Secretary, when necessary or required, shall affix the corporate
   seal thereto; and when so executed no other party to such instrument or
   any third party shall be required to make any inquiry into the authority
   of the signing officer or officers.

             5.02.     Loans.  No indebtedness for borrowed money shall be
   contracted on behalf of the corporation and no evidences of such
   indebtedness shall be issued in its name unless authorized by or under the
   authority of a resolution of the Board of Directors.  Such authorization
   may be general or confined to specific instances.

             5.03.     Checks, Drafts, etc.  All checks, drafts or other
   orders for the payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness
   issued in the name of the corporation, shall be signed by such officer or
   officers, agent or agents of the corporation and in such manner as shall
   from time to time be determined by or under the authority of a resolution
   of the Board of Directors.

             5.04.     Deposits.  All funds of the corporation not otherwise
   employed shall be deposited from time to time to the credit of the
   corporation in such banks, trust companies or other depositories as may be
   selected by or under the authority of a resolution of the Board of
   Directors.

             5.05 Voting of Securities Owned by this Corporation.  Subject
   always to the specific directions of the Board of Directors, (a) any
   shares or other securities issued by any other corporation and owned or
   controlled by this corporation may be voted at any meeting of security
   holders of such other corporation by the Chairman of the Board of this
   corporation if he be present, or in his absence by the President of this
   corporation if he be present, or in his absence by any Vice-President of
   this corporation who may be present, and (b) whenever, in the judgment of
   the Chairman of the Board, or in his absence, of the President, or in his
   absence, of any Vice-President, it is desirable for this corporation to
   execute a proxy or written consent in respect to any shares or other
   securities issued by any other corporation and owned by this corporation,
   such proxy or consent shall be executed in the name of this corporation by
   the Chairman of the Board, the President or one of the Vice-Presidents of
   this corporation, without necessity of any authorization by the Board of
   Directors, affixation of corporate seal or countersignature or attestation
   by another officer.  Any person or persons designated in the manner above
   stated as the proxy or proxies of this corporation shall have full right,
   power and authority to vote the shares or other securities issued by such
   other corporation and owned by this corporation the same as such shares or
   other securities might be voted by this corporation.

             5.06.     No Nominee Procedures.  The corporation has not
   established, and nothing in these by-laws shall be deemed to establish,
   any procedure by which a beneficial owner of the corporation's shares that
   are registered in the name of a nominee is recognized by the corporation
   as the shareholder under Section 180.0723 of the Wisconsin Business
   Corporation Law.

             ARTICLE VI.  CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES AND THEIR TRANSFER

             6.01.     Certificates for Shares.  Certificates representing
   shares of the corporation shall be in such form, consistent with the
   Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, as shall be determined by the Board of
   Directors.  Such certificates shall be signed by the Chairman of the
   Board, the President or a Vice-President and by the Secretary or an
   Assistant Secretary.  All certificates for shares shall be consecutively
   numbered or otherwise identified.  The name and address of the person to
   whom the shares represented thereby are issued, with the number of shares
   and date of issue, shall be entered on the stock transfer books of the
   corporation.  All certificates surrendered to the corporation for transfer
   shall be cancelled and no new certificate shall be issued until the former
   certificate for a like number of shares shall have been surrendered and
   cancelled, except as provided in Section 6.06.

             6.02.     Facsimile Signatures and Seal.  The seal of the
   corporation on any certificates for shares may be a facsimile.  The
   signatures of the Chairman of the Board, the President or any
   Vice-President and the Secretary or Assistant Secretary upon a certificate
   may be facsimiles if the certificate is countersigned by a transfer agent,
   or registered by a registrar, other than the corporation itself or an
   employee of the corporation.

             6.03.     Signature by Former Officers.  In case any officer,
   who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon any
   certificate for shares, shall have ceased to be such officer before such
   certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same
   effect as if he were such officer at the date of its issue.

             6.04.     Transfer of Shares.  Prior to due presentment of a
   certificate for shares for registration of transfer the corporation may
   treat the registered owner of such shares as the person exclusively
   entitled to vote, to receive notifications and otherwise to exercise all
   the rights and powers of an owner.  Where a certificate for shares is
   presented to the corporation with a request to register for transfer, the
   corporation shall not be liable to the owner or any other person suffering
   loss as a result of such registration of transfer if (a) there were on or
   with the certificate the necessary endorsements, and (b) the corporation
   had no duty to inquire into adverse claims or has discharged any such
   duty.  The corporation may require reasonable assurance that said
   endorsements are genuine and effective and in compliance with such other
   regulations as may be prescribed under the authority of the Board of
   Directors.

             6.05.     Restrictions on Transfer.  The face or reverse side of
   each certificate representing shares shall bear a conspicuous notation of
   any restriction imposed by the corporation upon the transfer of such
   shares.

             6.06.     Lost, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates. Where the
   owner claims that his certificate for shares has been lost, destroyed or
   wrongfully taken, a new certificate shall be issued in place thereof if
   the owner (a) so requests before the corporation has notice that such
   shares have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, and (b) files with the
   corporation a sufficient indemnity bond, and (c) satisfies such other
   reasonable requirements as the Board of Directors may prescribe.

             6.07.     Consideration for Shares.  The Board of Directors may
   authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible
   or intangible property or benefit to the corporation, including cash,
   promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services to be
   performed or other securities of the corporation.  Before the corporation
   issues shares, the Board of Directors shall determine that the
   consideration received or to be received for the shares to be issued is
   adequate.  In the absence of a resolution adopted by the Board of
   Directors expressly determining that the consideration received or to be
   received is adequate, Board approval of the issuance of the shares shall
   be deemed to constitute such a determination.  The determination of the
   Board of Directors is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration
   for the issuance of shares relates to whether the shares are validly
   issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The corporation may place in escrow
   shares issued in whole or in part for a contract for future services or
   benefits, a promissory note, or other property to be issued in the future,
   or make other arrangements to restrict the transfer of the shares, and may
   credit distributions in respect of the shares against their purchase
   price, until the services are performed, the benefits or property are
   received or the promissory note is paid.  If the services are not
   performed, the benefits or property are not received or the promissory
   note is not paid, the corporation may cancel, in whole or in part, the
   shares escrowed or restricted and the distributions credited.

             6.08.     Stock Regulation.  The Board of Directors shall have
   the power and authority to make all such further rules and regulations not
   inconsistent with the statutes of the State of Wisconsin as it may deem
   expedient concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificates
   representing shares of the corporation.

                               ARTICLE VII.  SEAL

             7.01.     The Board of Directors shall provide a corporate seal
   which shall be circular in form and shall have inscribed thereon the name
   of the corporation and the state of incorporation and the words,
   "Corporate Seal".

                         ARTICLE VIII.  INDEMNIFICATION

             (d)  "Breach of Duty" shall mean the Director or Officer
   breached or failed to perform his or her duties to the Corporation and his
   or her breach of or failure to perform those duties is determined, in
   accordance with Section 8.04, to constitute misconduct under Section
   180.0851 (2) (a) 1, 2, 3 or 4 of the Statute.

             (e)  "Corporation," as used herein and as defined in the Statute

   Corporation by way of merger, consolidation or acquisition of all or
   substantially all of the capital stock or assets of this Corporation.

             (f)  "Director or Officer" shall have the meaning set forth in

   conclusively presumed that any Director or Officer serving as a director,
   officer, partner, trustee, member of any governing or decision-making
   committee, employee or agent of an Affiliate shall be so serving at the
   request of the Corporation.

             (g)  "Disinterested Quorum" shall mean a quorum of the Board who
   are not Parties to the subject Proceeding or any related Proceeding.

             (h)  "Party" shall have the meaning set forth in the Statute;

   "Proceeding" shall also include all Proceedings (i) brought under (in
   whole or in part) the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange
   Act, their respective state counterparts, and/or any rule or regulation
   promulgated under any of the foregoing; (ii) brought before an Authority
   or otherwise to enforce rights hereunder; (iii) any appeal from a
   Proceeding; and (iv) any Proceeding in which the Director or Officer is a
   plaintiff or petitioner because he or she is a Director or Officer;
   provided, however, that such Proceeding is authorized by a majority vote
   of a Disinterested Quorum.

             (j)  "Statute" shall mean Sections 180.0850 through 180.0859,
   inclusive, of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, Chapter 180 of the
   Wisconsin Statutes, as the same shall then be in effect, including any
   amendments thereto, but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
   extent such amendment permits or requires the Corporation to provide
   broader indemnification rights than the Statute permitted or required the
   Corporation to provide prior to such amendment.

             8.02.     Mandatory Indemnification.  To the fullest extent
   permitted or required by the Statute, the Corporation shall indemnify a
   Director or Officer against all Liabilities incurred by or on behalf of
   such Director or Officer in connection with a Proceeding in which the
   Director or Officer is a Party because he or she is a Director or Officer.

             8.03.     Procedural Requirements. 

             (a)  A Director or Officer who seeks indemnification under
   Section 8.02 shall make a written request therefor to the Corporation. 
   Subject to Section 8.03(b), within 60 days of the Corporation's receipt of
   such request, the Corporation shall pay or reimburse the Director or
   Officer for the entire amount of Liabilities incurred by the Director or
   Officer in connection with the subject Proceeding (net of any Expenses
   previously advanced pursuant to Section 8.05).

             (b)  No indemnification shall be required to be paid by the
   Corporation pursuant to Section 8.02 if, within such 60-day period, (i) a
   Disinterested Quorum, by a majority vote thereof, determines that the
   Director or Officer requesting indemnification engaged in misconduct
   constituting a Breach of Duty or (ii) a Disinterested Quorum cannot be
   obtained.

             (c)  In either case of nonpayment pursuant to Section 8.03(b),
   the Board shall immediately authorize by resolution that an Authority, as
   provided in Section 8.04, determine whether the Director's or Officer's
   conduct constituted a Breach of Duty and, therefore, whether
   indemnification should be denied hereunder.

             (d)  (i) If the Board does not authorize an Authority to
   determine the Director's or Officer's right to indemnification hereunder
   within such 60-day period and/or (ii) if indemnification of the requested
   amount of Liabilities is paid by the Corporation, then it shall be
   conclusively presumed for all purposes that a Disinterested Quorum has
   determined that the Director or Officer did not engage in misconduct
   constituting a Breach of Duty and, in the case of subsection (i) above
   (but not subsection (ii)), indemnification by the Corporation of the
   requested amount of Liabilities shall be paid to the Director or Officer
   immediately.

             8.04.     Determination of Indemnification. 

             (a)  If the Board authorizes an Authority to determine a
   Director's or Officer's right to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.03,
   then the Director or Officer requesting indemnification shall have the
   absolute discretionary authority to select one of the following as such
   Authority:

             (i)  An independent legal counsel; provided, that such
        counsel shall be mutually selected by such Director or Officer
        and by a majority vote of a Disinterested Quorum or, if a
        Disinterested Quorum cannot be obtained, then by a majority vote
        of the Board;

             (ii) A panel of three arbitrators selected from the panels
        of arbitrators of the American Arbitration Association in
        Milwaukee, Wisconsin; provided, that (A) one arbitrator shall be
        selected by such Director or Officer, the second arbitrator
        shall be selected by a majority vote of a Disinterested Quorum
        or, if a Disinterested Quorum cannot be obtained, then by a
        majority vote of the Board, and the third arbitrator shall be
        selected by the two previously selected arbitrators, and (B) in
        all other respects, such panel shall be governed by the American
        Arbitration Association's then existing Commercial Arbitration
        Rules; or

             (iii)  A court pursuant to and in accordance with Section
        180.0854 of the Statute.

             (b)  In any such determination by the selected Authority there
   shall exist a rebuttable presumption that the Director's or Officer's
   conduct did not constitute a Breach of Duty and that indemnification
   against the requested amount of Liabilities is required.  The burden of
   rebutting such a presumption by clear and convincing evidence shall be on
   the Corporation or such other party asserting that such indemnification
   should not be allowed.

             (c)  The Authority shall make its determination within 60 days
   of being selected and shall submit a written opinion of its conclusion
   simultaneously to both the Corporation and the Director or Officer.

             (d)  If the Authority determines that indemnification is
   required hereunder, the Corporation shall pay the entire requested amount
   of Liabilities (net of any Expenses previously advanced pursuant to
   Section 8.05), including interest thereon at a reasonable rate, as
   determined by the Authority, within 10 days of receipt of the Authority's
   opinion; provided, that, if it is determined by the Authority that a
   Director or Officer is entitled to indemnification as to some claims,
   issues or matters, but not as to other claims, issues or matters, involved
   in the subject Proceeding, the Corporation shall be required to pay (as
   set forth above) only the amount of such requested Liabilities as the
   Authority shall deem appropriate in light of all of the circumstances of
   such Proceeding.

             (e)  The determination by the Authority that indemnification is
   required hereunder shall be binding upon the Corporation regardless of any
   prior determination that the Director or Officer engaged in a Breach of
   Duty.

             (f)  All Expenses incurred in the determination process under
   this Section 8.04 by either the Corporation or the Director or Officer,
   including, without limitation, all Expenses of the selected Authority,
   shall be paid by the Corporation.

             8.05.     Mandatory Allowance of Expenses. 

             (a)  The Corporation shall pay or reimburse, within 10 days
   after the receipt of the Director's or Officer's written request therefor,
   the reasonable Expenses of the Director or Officer as such Expenses are
   incurred; provided, the following conditions are satisfied:

             (i)  The Director or Officer furnishes to the Corporation
        an executed written certificate affirming his or her good faith
        belief that he or she has not engaged in misconduct which
        constitutes a Breach of Duty; and

             (ii) The Director or Officer furnishes to the Corporation
        an unsecured executed written agreement to repay any advances
        made under this Section 8.05 if it is ultimately determined by
        an Authority that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by
        the Corporation for such Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.04.

             (b)  If the Director or Officer must repay any previously
   advanced Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.05, such Director or Officer
   shall not be required to pay interest on such amounts.

             8.06.     Indemnification and Allowance of Expenses of Certain
   Others. 

             (a)  The Corporation shall indemnify a director or officer of an
   Affiliate (who is not otherwise serving as a Director or Officer) against
   all Liabilities, and shall advance the reasonable Expenses, incurred by
   such director or officer in a Proceeding to the same extent hereunder as
   if such director or officer incurred such Liabilities because he or she
   was a Director or Officer, if such director or officer is a Party thereto
   because he or she is or was a director or officer of the Affiliate.

             (b)  The Corporation shall indemnify an employee who is not a
   Director or Officer, to the extent that he or she has been successful on
   the merits or otherwise in defense of a Proceeding, for all reasonable
   Expenses incurred in the Proceeding if the employee was a Party because he
   or she was an employee of the Corporation.

             (c)  The Board may, in its sole and absolute discretion as it
   deems appropriate, pursuant to a majority vote thereof, indemnify (to the
   extent not otherwise provided in Section 8.06(b) hereof) against
   Liabilities incurred by, and/or provide for the allowance of reasonable
   Expenses of, an employee or authorized agent of the Corporation acting
   within the scope of his or her duties as such and who is not otherwise a
   Director or Officer.

             8.07.     Insurance.  The Corporation may purchase and maintain
   insurance on behalf of a Director or Officer or any individual who is or
   was an employee or authorized agent of the Corporation against any
   Liability asserted against or incurred by such individual in his or her
   capacity as such or arising from his or her status as such, regardless of
   whether the Corporation is required or permitted to indemnify against any
   such Liability under this Article VIII.

             8.08.     Notice to the Corporation.  A Director, Officer or
   employee shall promptly notify the Corporation in writing when he or she
   has actual knowledge of a Proceeding which may result in a claim of
   indemnification against Liabilities or allowance of Expenses hereunder,
   but the failure to do so shall not relieve the Corporation of any
   liability to the Director, Officer or employee hereunder unless the
   Corporation shall have been irreparably prejudiced by such failure (as
   determined, in the case of Directors or Officers only, by an Authority
   selected pursuant to Section 8.04(a)).

             8.09.     Severability.  If any provision of this Article VIII
   shall be deemed invalid or inoperative, or if a court of competent
   jurisdiction determines that any of the provisions of this Article VIII
   contravene public policy, this Article VIII shall be construed so that the
   remaining provisions shall not be affected, but shall remain in full force
   and effect, and any such provisions which are invalid or inoperative or
   which contravene public policy shall be deemed, without further action or
   deed by or on behalf of the Corporation, to be modified, amended and/or
   limited, but only to the extent necessary to render the same valid and
   enforceable.

             8.10.     Nonexclusivity of Article VIII.  The rights of a
   Director, Officer or employee (or any other person) granted under this
   Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
   indemnification against Liabilities or advancement of Expenses which the
   Director, Officer or employee (or such other person) may be entitled to
   under any written agreement, Board resolution, vote of shareholders of the
   Corporation or otherwise, including, without limitation, under the
   Statute. Nothing contained in this Article VIII shall be deemed to limit
   the Corporation's obligations to indemnify against Liabilities or advance
   Expenses to a Director, Officer or employee under the Statute.

             8.11.     Contractual Nature of Article VIII; Repeal or
   Limitation of Rights.  This Article VIII shall be deemed to be a contract
   between the Corporation and each Director, Officer and employee of the
   Corporation and any repeal or other limitation of this Article VIII or any
   repeal or limitation of the Statute or any other applicable law shall not
   limit any rights of indemnification against Liabilities or allowance of
   Expenses then existing or arising out of events, acts or omissions
   occurring prior to such repeal or limitation, including, without
   limitation, the right to indemnification against Liabilities or allowance
   of Expenses for Proceedings commenced after such repeal or limitation to
   enforce this Article VIII with regard to acts, omissions or events arising
   prior to such repeal or limitation.

                             ARTICLE IX.  AMENDMENTS

             9.01.     By Shareholders.  These by-laws may be altered,
   amended or repealed and new by-laws may be adopted by the shareholders at
   any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting at which a quorum is in attendance.

             9.02.     By Directors.  These by-laws may also be altered,
   amended or repealed and new by-laws may be adopted by the Board of
   Directors by affirmative vote of a majority of the number of directors
   present at any meeting at which a quorum is in attendance; provided,
   however, that the shareholders in adopting, amending or repealing a
   particular by-law may provide therein that the Board of Directors may not
   amend, repeal or readopt that by-law.

             9.03.     Implied Amendments.  Any action taken or authorized by
   the shareholders or by the Board of Directors, which would be inconsistent
   with the by-laws then in effect but is taken or authorized by affirmative
   vote of not less than the number of shares or the number of directors
   required to amend the by-laws so that the by-laws would be consistent with
   such action, shall be given the same effect as though the by-laws had been
   temporarily amended or suspended so far, but only so far, as is necessary
   to permit the specific action so taken or authorized.

                 SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLAN FOR KEY EMPLOYEES



                 As Amended and Restated Effective July 1, 1995


   <PAGE>
                                BANTA CORPORATION
                 SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLAN FOR KEY EMPLOYEES


   1.   Purpose of the Plan

             The purpose of this Banta Corporation Supplemental Retirement
   Plan for Key Employees (hereinafter referred to as the "Supplemental
   Plan") is to provide retirement income to Eligible Employees.  It is
   intended that the benefits provided hereunder, together with benefits paid
   under the tax-qualified pension plans maintained by the Employers, will
   provide Eligible Employees with total retirement benefits consistent with
   current trends in retirement pay planning, and thus better enable the
   Employers to attract and retain the key management personnel upon whose
   efforts the continued successful and profitable operation of their
   businesses depend.


   2.   Effective Date

             The Supplemental Plan became effective as of January 1, 1980.


   3.   Definitions

             The following terms used herein shall have the same meanings as
   the similar terms defined by the Banta Corporation Salaried Employees
   Pension Plan (hereinafter referred to as the "Retirement Plan"):

                  (a)  Average Monthly Compensation
                  (b)  Compensation
                  (c)  Corporation
                  (d)  Disability
                  (e)  Employers
                  (f)  Normal Retirement Date

   The term "Committee" shall have the same meaning as the term
   "Administrative Committee" in the Retirement Plan.  Notwithstanding the
   foregoing, for purposes of this Supplemental Plan, "Compensation" and
   "Average Monthly Compensation" for any period (1) shall be deemed to
   include any amounts not otherwise included therein or taken into account
   in the calculation thereof which the Eligible Employee would have received
   for such period but for his election to defer such amount pursuant to the
   Banta Corporation 1985 Deferred Compensation Plan and/or the Banta
   Corporation 1988 Deferred Compensation Plan, and (2) shall be calculated
   without regard to the limitations imposed by Section 401(a)(17) of the
   Internal Revenue Code of 1986 on the amount of compensation that may be
   taken into account by plans qualifying under such Section.

             The following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:

             "Qualified Plan Benefits" means an Eligible Employee's
             aggregate benefits accrued under the terms of the
             Retirement Plan (or any successor to such Plan) and any
             other tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan to which
             an Employer contributes, stated as a benefit payable in the
             form of a single life annuity commencing on his Normal
             Retirement Date.

             "Eligible Employee" means an employee of an Employer who: 
             (i) is the president of an Employer, or is in compensation
             grade 23 or above under the corporate compensation program
             in effect as of January 1, 1984 (or the comparable
             compensation grade under any modified or successor program,
             as determined by the Committee); (ii) has been approved for
             participation in this Supplemental Plan by the Executive
             Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and
             (iii) has entered into an agreement with the Corporation
             calling for his participation herein.

             "Credited Service" means the Eligible Employee's years and
             fractional portions thereof of Credited Service accumulated
             under the terms of the Retirement Plan plus, for an
             Eligible Employee whose employment is terminated on account
             of a Disability, the period of such Disability prior to his
             Normal Retirement Date which is not counted as Credited
             Service under the Retirement Plan, if any.
             "Eligibility Date" means the date on which the employee
             first enters compensation grade 23 or above or becomes the
             president of an Employer.


   4.   Administration

             The Supplemental Plan shall be administered by the Committee. 
   The Committee shall have the discretionary authority to construe and
   interpret the terms of the Supplemental Plan, to promulgate and revise
   rules and regulations relating to the Supplemental Plan and to make any
   other determinations which it deems necessary or advisable for the
   administration thereof.  Decisions and determinations by the Committee
   shall be final and binding on all parties, unless arbitrary and
   capricious.

   5.   Amount of Supplemental Retirement Benefits

             An eligible Employee's monthly benefits under this Supplemental
   Plan shall be equal to the sum of (i) and (ii) below, less (iii) below,
   determined as of the date his first monthly benefit payment is paid under
   the terms of the Retirement Plan:

               (i)     2.5% of the Eligible Employee's Average
                       Monthly Compensation multiplied by his years
                       of Credited Service, to a maximum of 10
                       years; plus

              (ii)     1.5% of his Average Monthly Compensation
                       multiplied by his years of Credited Service
                       in excess of 10 years to a maximum of 25
                       such years; minus

             (iii)     the amount of his Qualified Plan Benefits.


   6.   Eligibility For and Form and Timing of Benefits

             (a)  Except for the benefits described in subparagraphs (c) and
   (d) of this Paragraph, no benefits shall be payable under this Plan on
   account of an Eligible Employee, unless:

               (i)     Such Eligible Employee or his spouse becomes
                       entitled to benefits under the Retirement
                       Plan; and

              (ii)     In the case of an Eligible Employee approved
                       for participation herein on or after January
                       1, 1984, he shall have met one of the
                       following requirements as of the date his
                       employment terminates:

                       (A)  Completion of 10 years of continuous
                            service after his Eligibility Date;

                       (B)  Completion of 5 years of continuous
                            service after his Eligibility Date and
                            attainment of age 57;

                       (C)  Attainment of age 65; or


                       (D)  Death while employed with the Employers.

             (b)  The benefits computed under Paragraph 5 shall be paid to
   the Eligible Employee (and/or his spouse or other contingent annuitant or
   beneficiary) at such times and in such form and amounts as if such
   benefits were accrued under the Retirement Plan (including reductions for
   early commencement and form of benefits under said Retirement Plan). 
   Elections made under the Retirement Plan as to the form and timing of
   benefit payments shall also apply to benefits under this Supplemental
   Plan.

             (c)  In the event of the death of an Eligible Employee while
   actively employed by an Employer or during a period of Disability counted
   as Credited Service hereunder, but prior to the date on which his spouse
   would be eligible to receive any benefits under the Retirement Plan, his
   surviving spouse, if any, shall be entitled to monthly benefits for life
   under this Supplemental Plan equal to one-half of the amount determined
   under Paragraph 5 above, provided that clause (iii) thereof shall not
   apply.  Such benefits shall be calculated as of the date of the Eligible
   Employee's death and shall commence as of the first day of the following
   month.

             (d)  If an Eligible Employee's employment is terminated on
   account of a Disability and either (i) such Disability continues to his
   Normal Retirement Date, or (ii) at the cessation of such Disability such
   Eligible Employee has accumulated at least 10 years of Credited Service,
   then such Eligible Employee shall be entitled to benefits hereunder
   commencing on his Normal Retirement Date.  The amount of such benefits
   shall be the amount calculated under Paragraph 5 above, provided that
   clause (iii) thereof shall apply only if and to the extent the Eligible
   Employee is entitled to receive Qualified Plan Benefits.  Such benefits
   shall be paid as provided in subparagraph (b) of this Paragraph.


   7.   Effect of Change in Employment Status

             In the event an Eligible Employee (who is approved for
   participation herein on or after January 1, 1984) is transferred to a
   position with the Employer in which he is not an Eligible Employee as
   defined herein, such former Eligible Employer shall be entitled to
   benefits hereunder if at the time of his actual termination of employment
   with the Employers he has satisfied the conditions of Paragraph 6(a), (c)
   or (d).  The amount of such benefits shall be calculated under Paragraph 5
   on the basis of his Average Monthly Compensation and Credited Service as
   of the date such transfer occurred, reduced by the amount of his Qualified
   Plan Benefit calculated as of that date but adjusted for any increase in
   Qualified Plan Benefits resulting from subsequent amendments to the
   Retirement Plan.


   8.   Nature of Benefit

             Eligible Employees who are entitled to benefits hereunder have
   the status of general unsecured creditors of the Employers.  The
   Supplemental Plan constitutes a mere promise by the Employers to make
   benefit payments in the future as provided herein.  It is intended that
   the Supplemental Plan be unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of
   Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
   amended.


   9.   Non-Alienation of Payments

             Benefits payable under the Supplemental Plan shall not be
   subject in any manner to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,
   attachment, garnishment, anticipation or encumbrance of any kind, by will,
   or by inter vivos instrument.  Any attempt to alienate, sell, transfer,
   assign, pledge, anticipate or otherwise encumber any such benefit payment,
   whether currently or thereafter payable, shall not be recognized by the
   Committee or the Corporation.  Any benefit payment due hereunder shall not
   in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts or liabilities of any
   Eligible Employee or other person entitled thereto hereunder.  If any such
   person shall attempt to alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge,
   anticipate or encumber any benefit payments to be made to that person
   under the Supplemental Plan or any part thereof, or if by reason of such
   person's bankruptcy or other event happening at any time, such payments
   would devolve upon anyone else or would not be enjoyed by such person,
   then the Committee in its discretion, may terminate such person's interest
   in any such benefit payment, and hold or apply it to or for the benefit of
   that person, the spouse, children or other dependents thereof, or any of
   them, in such manner as the Committee deems proper.


   10.  Limitation of Rights Against the Employers

             Participation in this Supplemental Plan, or any modifications
   thereof, or the payments of any benefits hereunder, shall not be construed
   as giving to any person any right to be retained in the service of the
   Employers, limiting in any way the right of the Employers to terminate
   such person's employment at any time, evidencing any agreement or
   understanding that the Employers will employ such person in any particular
   position or at any particular rate of compensation or guaranteeing such
   person any right to receive any other form or amount of remuneration from
   the Employers.


   11.  Applicable Laws

             The Supplemental Plan shall be construed, administered and
   governed in all respects under and by the laws of the State of Wisconsin
   to the extent not preempted by federal law.


   12.  Liability

             Neither the Employers nor any shareholder, director, officer or
   other employee of the Employers or any other person shall be liable for
   any act or failure to act hereunder except for gross negligence or fraud.


   13.  Amendment or Termination

             (a)  The Corporation, by action of its board of directors,
   reserves the right to amend or modify this Supplemental Plan at any time,
   provided that no such amendment or modification shall adversely affect an
   Eligible Employee's right to benefits hereunder without his written
   consent, unless the Corporation shall have substituted therefor an
   equivalent amount of immediate or deferred compensation under some other
   plan, program or individual agreement with the Eligible Employee.

             (b)  It is understood that an Eligible Employee's entitlement to
   benefits under this Supplemental Plan may be automatically reduced as the
   result of an increase in his Qualified Plan Benefits.  If, as of any date,
   an Eligible Employee's Qualified Plan Benefits projected to his Normal
   Retirement Date are such that if the Eligible Employee continued in the
   service of the Employers through his Normal Retirement Date he would not
   be expected to be entitled to any benefits from this Supplemental Plan,
   then such Eligible Employee's rights to any benefits hereunder shall
   cease, whether or not he ultimately becomes entitled to the full amount of
   such projected Qualified Plan Benefits.  Nothing herein shall be construed
   in any way to limit the right of the Corporation to amend or modify the
   Retirement Plan or any other employee benefit plan in its sole discretion.

             In the event a Participant's employment is terminated by
        reason of death, disability or normal or early retirement (as
        permitted by the Company's retirement plans), the Participant
        will be entitled to receive a partial award for any Performance
        Period in which he was a Participant and during which he was
        employed for at least 24 months (or such shorter period as shall
        be determined by the Committee).

             2.   The first sentence of Section 10 of the Plan was amended in
   its entirety to provide as follows:

             With the approval of the Committee, a person who is hired
        or first promoted to an eligible position during the first two
        years of a Performance Period may be permitted to receive a
        partial award for such Performance Period.

   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Operations

   Operational Highlights

        Banta Corporation achieved record sales and earnings in 1995,
   including a sales  milestone by recording revenue of more than one billion
   dollars for the first time.  The strong sales gain of $211 million, an
   increase of 26% from 1994 levels, to $1.023 billion was aided by:

   -    The October 1995 acquisition of B.G. Turnkey Services Limited, a
        company serving the computer software and hardware industry primarily
        in Europe, representing about one-quarter of the 1995 sales gain.

   -    Historical and significant increases in paper prices during 1995,
        representing approximately one-half of the sales increase.

   -    Continued market penetration for most of our operating units.

   -    Utilization of the new press capacity installed during 1994 and 1995.

         Along with record sales were record profits.  Net earnings of $53.5
   million represented an increase of 13.4% over 1994's record of $47.2
   million.  Earnings per share increased 12.2% to $1.75 per share.

         During 1995, Banta advanced its goal of increasing the proportion of
   its revenue from non-traditional print related activity. The acquisition
   of B.G. Turnkey Services significantly increases Banta's assembly,
   fulfillment and distribution services revenue. At the same time the
   acquisition of these European operations increases Banta's global scope,
   also a primary goal. Two smaller acquisitions improved Banta's ability to
   provide online services via the Internet's World Wide Web and expanded its
   coverage of the single-use health care products market.

         Acquisitions have been and are expected to continue to play a
   strategic and significant part in Banta's growth strategies. Management
   currently expects acquisitions to provide about one-third of Banta's
   future revenue gains.  Banta's acquisitions reinforce its commitment to
   provide growth opportunities for its business units.  Banta's 1994
   acquisitions, which accounted for 40% of that year's sales gain, were both
   traditional print companies.

         Significant increases in paper prices occurred during the fourth
   quarter of 1994 and throughout 1995.  Paper prices averaged more than one-
   third higher in 1995 than in 1994.  As is customary in the graphic arts
   industry, sales prices to Banta's customers were increased to reflect the
   higher paper costs.  Most paper grades were on allocation during 1995,
   however the solid relationships Banta maintains with major paper suppliers
   allowed Banta to meet customer needs and accomodate the Corporation's
   added production capacity.  Due to the substantial increase in delivery
   times, Banta's paper inventories increased by approximately one-third
   during late 1994 and early 1995.  These quantities were aggressively
   reduced to more traditional levels at 1995 year-end.  During the fourth
   quarter of 1995 paper prices stabilized somewhat, and it is anticipated
   that allocation restrictions may be reduced or eliminated in 1996 due to
   the softening demand for paper.

         During 1995, pricing remained competitive within the graphic arts
   industry as customers were burdened by the significant paper price
   increases, as well as postage rate increases, and they continued to look
   for ways to reduce costs.  Unit value-added sales prices continue to trend
   lower, reflecting the competitive markets. Banta has, however, generally
   been able to accommodate the lower pricing and still maintain its historic
   margin levels for these services primarily due to productivity
   improvements. Banta has aggressively invested in modern, technologically
   advanced equipment which has led to productivity gains. Banta also
   achieved gains through its Continuous Improvement programs and the efforts
   of its conscientious, dedicated employees in providing superior responses
   to customers' needs.

         Banta's earnings from operations as a percentage of sales dropped
   from 10.3% in 1994 to 9.6% in 1995. This reduction was primarily due to
   the higher paper prices, which generate lower margins, and the increased
   proportion of sales from assembly, packaging and distribution services,
   which contain a higher material content and therefore lower margins. These
   project management activities, however, require less capital investment
   and therefore are expected to provide greater return on investment than
   traditional print activities.

         Banta continues to investigate and invest in alternative methods of
   providing services that are expected to assist customers in distributing
   their information in a broad spectrum of media, including traditional
   print, digital print, CD-ROM and online. Banta also continues to make
   strategically important investments in digital technologies, remaining at
   the forefront of the graphic arts industry.

   Net Sales

         The Corporation classifies its sales as follows: commercial
   (catalogs, direct marketing materials and single-use products); books
   (educational, general, trade, data manuals and project management
   services); magazines; and other (point-of-purchase, security products and
   digital imaging services). Net sales for the market classifications, as a
   percent of consolidated net sales, were as follows:

                            1995      1994      1993

   Commercial                47%       46%       44%
   Books                     34        32        34
   Magazines                 11        12        12
   Other                      8        10        10
                            ---       ---       ---
                            100%      100%      100%
                            ===       ===       ===
         Percentage increases (decreases) in sales by market classification
   for 1995 compared with 1994 were as follows: commercial - 29%; books -
   34%; magazines - 18%; and other - (4)%.

         Acquisitions completed during 1994 and 1995 represented
   approximately 26% of the sales increase in the commercial market
   classification. Paper price increases represented approximately 50% of the
   commercial market sales increase. High utilization of the Corporation's
   first new-generation, 48-page press, which was installed during the third
   quarter of 1994, also contributed to the sales increase. The units which
   comprise the Banta Direct Marketing Group experienced higher levels of
   utilization in 1995 than they did in 1994, which also contributed to the
   sales increase.

         Book market sales increased in all categories. The acquisition of
   B.G. Turnkey Services represented over 60% of the sales increase in this
   market classification for 1995, which resulted in a large increase in
   project management services sales. Paper price increases represented
   approximately 30% of this market's sales increase. The remainder of the
   sales gain came primarily from educational and trade books. Demand for
   printed software documentation softened as digital documentation delivery
   gained wider acceptance, a trend expected to continue.

         During 1995, Banta continued to gain new titles and market share in
   special-interest magazines. The 1995 sales increase resulted from
   increased market penetration, higher paper prices and increased spending
   for magazine advertising pages. The two plants serving this market each
   added an eight-unit press during the second half of 1995, which provided
   the capacity necessary to service the sales increase.

         The sales decrease in the "other" classification resulted from lower
   utilization in each of the plants included in the classification. Activity
   levels at the Banta Digital Group facilities were impacted by the absence
   of 1994's large volume of packaging work that resulted from the new
   government labeling requirements. Sales volume was also affected by the
   conversion of more projects from manual to electronic processes, which
   reduced sales prices per unit. 

         Sales for 1994 increased 17% over 1993. All of the Corporation's
   market classifications registered sales increases for 1994; commercial -
   22%; books - 10%; magazines - 14%; and other - 16%.

         The acquisition of Danbury Printing & Litho in 1994 accounted for
   50% of the increase in the commercial market. Also contributing to the
   increase were the production of several biennial business-to-business
   catalog projects, press additions at three plants, and high levels of
   production activity late in the year due to customers' desire to mail
   product prior to the January 1, 1995, postage rate increase. The increase
   in book market sales resulted from the acquisition of United Graphics
   during the third quarter of 1994 and the increased sale of software
   documentation and project management services, which were facilitated by
   new fulfillment capabilities and capacity additions. The Corporation's
   special-interest magazine facilities increased sales as a result of
   greater market penetration and increased advertising pages. The increase
   in the "other" classification resulted from higher prepress service sales,
   which benefited from the government labeling requirements and new service
   offerings.

   Cost of Goods Sold

         In 1995, cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was 78.9% compared
   with 77.0% in 1994 and 76.8% in 1993. This overall margin decline in 1995
   resulted from several factors. Since the sale of paper generally has lower
   margins than manufacturing sales, the increase in paper sales reduced
   average margins. Also contributing to the margin decline was the inclusion
   of B.G. Turnkey Services in the fourth quarter. Its project management
   services generally provide lower margins than Banta's traditional print
   businesses because material content for these services represents a
   significantly greater proportion of the total sales. The Corporation's use
   of the LIFO inventory valuation method resulted in LIFO adjustments, which
   increased (reduced) cost of goods sold by $4,014,000, $844,000 and
   ($272,000) in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The change in LIFO
   valuation adjustment between 1995 and 1994, which is primarily due to the
   significant paper price increases, represents about one-third of the cost
   of goods sold percentage increase. Offsetting a portion of the increase in
   the cost of goods sold percentage were increased margins for the direct
   marketing materials operations of the commercial market due to increased
   plant utilization. Depreciation expense increased $9.2 million in 1995
   compared to 1994 as a result of the $64 million in capital expenditures in
   1995 and the acquisitions completed in 1994 and 1995. In 1994,
   depreciation increased $7.7 million compared to 1993. The increase in the
   cost of sales percentage for 1994 compared to 1993 was primarily the
   result of the increased LIFO valuation adjustments, as well as the cost of
   new capacity added in 1994 and lower margins associated with operations
   acquired in 1994.

   Expenses

         Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were
   11.5%, 12.7% and 12.7% in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Selling and
   administrative expenses increased $15.1 million (14.7%) in 1995 and $15.1
   million (17.2%) in 1994. The 1995 increase includes $7.9 million of costs
   (52% of the increase) related to the 1995 and 1994 acquisitions. 

         The remainder of the increase is due to costs required to support
   the sales increases generated from the Corporation's other operations,
   including sales commissions on the large revenue gains. Of the 1994
   expense increase, $5.3 million (35%) was due to acquisitions, with the
   remainder being costs necessary to support the additional 1994 sales
   volume.

   Earnings From Operations and Interest Expense

         Earnings from operations as a percent of sales were 9.6%, 10.3%, and
   10.5% in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Interest expense was $9.9
   million, $5.9 million and $5.3 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
   respectively. During 1995, the Corporation's average debt levels increased
   due to acquisitions, capital expenditures and increased average investment
   in working capital as a result of higher paper prices, higher inventory
   levels due to the tight paper market and higher activity levels in
   general. The increased debt levels caused the higher interest expense in
   1995. The interest expense increase in 1994 compared to 1993 resulted from
   higher average borrowing levels and rising interest rates.

         Pretax earnings as a percent of sales were 8.7%, 9.7% and 9.9% in
   1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Effective income tax rates were 39.9%,
   40.0% and 40.3% in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The small reduction
   in the effective tax rate in 1995 was due to lower tax rates on earnings
   of the European operations. An additional slight reduction in the
   effective tax rate is expected in 1996 as the European operations will be
   included for a full year.

   Current Ratio                         2.53           1.69         2.16


        During 1995, the Corporation issued $75 million of long-term debt at
   interest rates ranging from 6.81% to 7.98%.  The proceeds were used to
   repay all of Banta's short-term debt and to finance acquisitions.
   Management believes the Corporation's liquidity continues to be strong and
   the degree of leverage allows the Corporation to finance, at attractive
   borrowing rates, its capital expenditures, as well as any other investment
   opportunities that may arise.

        The $56 million reduction in short-term debt and the $27 million
   increase in cash during 1995 were the primary reasons that the
   Corporation's working capital increased $86 million. Due to the softening
   paper market in late 1995 and an emphasis on working capital control,
   Banta's year-end investment in operating working capital (excluding cash,
   notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt) increased only $3
   million in 1995.

        The Corporation's capital investment program reflects its commitment
   to maintain modern, efficient plants and to be able to utilize new
   printing and digital imaging technologies.  Preliminary plans for 1996 are
   for capital commitments to exceed $70 million. Cash requirements should
   exceed that amount as the unpaid balance of prior commitments exceeded $30
   million at the end of 1995.

        The Corporation generally raises short-term funds by selling
   commercial paper and issuing unsecured bank notes.  Such borrowings are
   primarily supported by lines of credit from three banks totaling $65
   million. The Corporation also has available uncommitted short-term
   borrowing facilities under which it can borrow on an unsecured basis.
   Average outstanding short-term borrowings during 1995 and 1994 were $19.4
   million and $26.0 million, respectively.

        In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the
   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
   of." The Corporation intends to adopt this standard during the first
   quarter of 1996. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a
   material effect on the Corporation's financial position or results of
   operations.

   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
   For the Periods Ended December 30, 1995 (1995), December 31, 1994 (1994)
   and January 1, 1994 (1993)

   (1) SUMMARY  OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
   Significant accounting policies followed by the Banta Corporation (the
   "Corporation") in maintaining financial records and preparing financial
   statements are:

   Business - The Corporation operates in a single business segment -
   printing services.  Customers, which are primarily located throughout the
   United States, are granted credit on an unsecured basis. No one customer
   accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales during 1995, 1994 or
   1993.

   Year-end - The Corporation's operating year ends on the Saturday closest
   to December 31.  The years 1995, 1994 and 1993 ended December 30, 1995,
   December 31, 1994 and January 1, 1994, respectively, and comprised 52
   weeks each.

   Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements
   include the accounts of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. All
   significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

   Earnings Per Share of Common Stock - Net earnings per share of common
   stock is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number
   of common shares and common equivalent shares related to the assumed
   exercise of stock options. Average common and common equivalent shares for
   computation of earnings per share were 30,624,134, 30,365,840 and
   30,219,567 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

   Recognition of Sales - In accordance with trade practices of the printing
   industry, sales are recorded by the Corporation primarily upon completion
   of manufacturing. Substantially all such sales are produced to customer
   specifications, therefore, the Corporation has no material amounts of
   finished goods inventory.

   Foreign Currency Translation - Financial statements of foreign
   subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars in accordance with
   the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52.
   Foreign currency translation gains and losses were insignificant in 1995.

   Capitalized Interest - The Corporation capitalizes interest on major
   building and equipment installations and depreciates the amount over the
   lives of the related assets. The total interest incurred was $11,128,000
   in 1995, $7,588,000 in 1994 and $6,547,000 in 1993 of which $1,237,000,
   $1,686,000 and $1,201,000 was capitalized in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
   respectively.

   Cash and Short-term Investments - Short-term investments, with maturities
   of less than 90 days at the date of purchase, are considered cash
   equivalents for purposes of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
   and statements of cash flows.

   Inventories - Approximately 36% and 49% of total inventories in 1995 and
   1994, respectively, and the majority of the Corporation's inventories used
   in its printing operations, are accounted for at cost, determined by a
   last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, which is not in excess of market. The
   remaining inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the
   first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

   Inventories include material, labor and manufacturing overhead.  Inventory
   amounts at year-end are as follows:

                                                     Dollars in thousands
                                                       1995         1994

   Raw materials and supplies                       $ 44,815        $37,106 
   Work-in-process and finished goods                 34,789         35,531 
                                                    --------        -------
   FIFO value (current cost) of
    all inventories                                   79,604         72,637
   Excess of current cost over carrying
    value of LIFO inventories                         (8,854)        (4,840)
                                                    --------        -------
   Net inventories                                  $ 70,750        $67,797
                                                    ========        =======

   During 1995, inventory quantities were reduced in certain printing
   facilities. These reductions resulted in liquidations of LIFO inventory
   layers carried at lower costs which prevailed in prior years. The effect
   of these liquidations was to decrease cost of goods sold by $1,915,000.

   Plant and Equipment - Plant and equipment (including major renewals and
   betterments) are carried at cost and depreciated by ratable charges over
   the estimated useful life of the assets.  Substantially all depreciation
   is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting
   purposes.  Accelerated depreciation methods are used for tax purposes. 
   Leasehold improvements are generally amortized over the term of the leases
   on a straight-line basis.

   Income Taxes - Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on
   the difference between the financial statement and the tax basis of assets
   and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which
   the differences are expected to reverse.

   Cost in Excess of Net Assets of Businesses Acquired - Cost in excess of
   net assets of businesses acquired ("goodwill") is amortized and charged
   against operations on a straight-line method over periods of 25 to 40
   years.  The realizability of goodwill is evaluated annually based upon the
   undiscounted earnings of the businesses acquired compared with the
   unamortized amount of goodwill. Accumulated amortization of goodwill was
   $4,719,000 and $3,807,000 as of December 30, 1995, and December 31, 1994,
   respectively.

   Derivative Financial Instruments - The Corporation occasionally utilizes
   interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to
   hedge specific interest rate and foreign currency exposures. These
   derivative financial instruments are not used for trading purposes. The
   Corporation was party to no material derivative financial instrument
   contracts in 1995, 1994 and 1993.

   Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
   with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
   estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
   liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
   date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
   expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from
   those estimates.

   Long-Lived Assets - In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards
   Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
   "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
   Assets to be Disposed of." The Corporation intends to adopt this standard
   during the first quarter of 1996. The adoption of this standard is not
   expected to have a material effect on the Corporation's financial position
   or results of operations.

   Stock-Based Compensation - In October 1995, the Financial Accounting
   Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
   123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." The Corporation intends to
   adopt this standard in 1996 by making the required footnote disclosures
   only. Therefore, the adoption of this standard is not expected to have an
   effect on the Corporation's financial position or results of operations.

   (2) ACQUISITIONS

   Acquisition of B.G. Turnkey Services Limited - In October 1995, the
   Corporation acquired B.G. Turnkey Services Limited ("B.G. Turnkey"). B.G.
   Turnkey, headquartered in Cork, Ireland, provides project management,
   product assembly, fulfillment and product localization services to
   computer software and hardware companies primarily  from facilities
   located in Ireland, Scotland and The Netherlands. B.G. Turnkey reported
   sales for 1994 of approximately $160 million. The purchase price consisted
   of 236,765 shares of the Corporation's common stock and approximately $21
   million of the Corporation's debentures which were called and prepaid in
   December 1995. The payment of these debentures is classified as cash used
   for acquisitions in the Statement of Cash Flows. The Corporation also paid
   $3.2 million to former shareholders of B.G. Turnkey in exchange for a
   covenant not to compete. The purchase price plus the liabilities assumed
   exceeded the fair value of the tangible assets and identified intangible
   assets purchased by a preliminary estimate of $12.2 million. The final
   adjustments to the purchase price are not expected to be significant. This
   acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, the
   accompanying financial statements include B.G. Turnkey's results beginning
   with the acquisition date.

   Acquisition of United Graphics Inc. - In August 1994, the Corporation
   acquired the outstanding shares of United Graphics Inc. ("UGI") for
   approximately $9.5 million in cash and a $1.5 million note.  The purchase
   price plus the liabilities assumed exceeded the fair value of the tangible
   and identified intangible assets purchased by $7.2 million.  The
   Corporation also paid $4 million to former shareholders of UGI in exchange
   for covenants not to compete.   UGI reported sales for its most recent
   fiscal year prior to the acquisition of approximately $28 million.  This
   acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, the
   accompanying financial statements include UGI's results beginning with the
   acquisition date.

   Acquisition of Danbury Printing & Litho, Inc. - In March 1994, the
   Corporation purchased substantially all of the assets of Danbury Printing
   & Litho, Inc. ("Danbury").  The purchase price of $16.3 million in cash
   plus the assumption of selected liabilities was equal to the fair value of
   the assets acquired.  Danbury reported sales of approximately $35 million
   in 1993.  This acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and
   accordingly, the accompanying financial statements include Danbury's
   results beginning with the acquisition date.

   Other Acquisitions - During 1995, the Corporation purchased Applied
   Technology Corporation, which serves the single-use health care market,
   and New Frontiers Information Corporation, which provides customers with
   online solutions for distributing catalogs and direct marketing materials
   via the Internet's World Wide Web. The combined purchase price for these
   two acquisitions was $9.0 million.

   (3) NOTES PAYABLE

   The Corporation generally obtains short-term financing through the
   issuance of commercial paper and unsecured notes to banks. At December 30,
   1995, the Corporation had no such borrowings outstanding. At December 31,
   1994, the Corporation had outstanding commercial paper and unsecured notes
   aggregating $44,351,000 and $11,650,000, respectively, at a weighted
   average interest rate of 6.19%. The average outstanding borrowings during
   1995 and 1994 were $19.4 million and $26.0 million, respectively.  The
   weighted-average interest rates on such borrowings during 1995 and 1994
   were 6.12% and 4.89%, respectively.

   At December 30, 1995, the Corporation had lines of credit available
   totaling $68.2 million, none of which were in use. Of this total, $65.0
   million represents a credit facility made available by three banks which
   can be used to support both commercial paper and unsecured notes.

   (4) LONG-TERM DEBT

   Long-term debt, including amounts payable within one year, consists of the
   following:

                                                         =======     =======

   Maturities of long-term debt during the next five years are: 1996,
   $7,853,000; 1997, $5,518,000; 1998, $5,987,000; 1999, $7,803,000; and
   2000, $7,154,000.  Industrial Revenue Bonds aggregating $2,660,000 are
   secured by certain real estate and equipment.

   The Promissory Note agreements contain various operating and financial
   covenants.  The more restrictive of these covenants require that working
   capital be maintained at a minimum of $40,000,000, current assets be 150%
   of current liabilities and consolidated tangible net worth be not less
   than $125,000,000. Funded debt of up to 50% of the sum of consolidated net
   worth and consolidated funded debt may be incurred without prior consent 
   of the noteholders. The Corporation may incur short-term debt of up to 25%
   of consolidated net worth at any time and is required to be free of all
   such obligations in excess of 12.5% of consolidated net worth for 60
   consecutive days each year.  The agreements also contain limitations on
   leases and ratable security on certain types of liens.

   One of the Promissory Note agreements contains covenants which restrict
   the payment of dividends.  As of December 30, 1995, $94,398,000 of
   retained earnings was available for the payment of dividends under the
   most restrictive of such covenants.

   Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Corporation for 
   loans with similar terms and average maturities, the fair value of long-
   term debt as of December 30, 1995, including current maturities, was
   $154,096,000.

   (5) STOCK AND INCENTIVE PROGRAMS FOR MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES

   The Corporation has a Management Incentive Award Plan which provides for
   the payment of cash awards or bonuses to officers and other key employees
   with respect to any year in which the Corporation and its operating units
   achieve specified objectives.  Awards under the plan were $2,799,000 in
   1995, $2,770,000 in 1994 and $2,710,000 in 1993.

   The Corporation also has a Long-term Incentive Plan which provides for
   payment of cash awards to key officers and executives of the Corporation
   upon achievement of specified objectives over three-year performance
   periods. Awards under the plan were $511,000 for the 1993 to 1995
   performance period, $609,000 for the 1992 to 1994 performance period and
   $530,000 for the 1991 to 1993 performance period.
    
   At December 30, 1995, the Corporation had options outstanding or available
   for grant under several stock option plans - the 1995 Equity Incentive
   Plan, the 1991 Stock Option Plan and the 1987 Nonstatutory Stock Option
   Plan. Options may no longer be granted under the 1987 plan.  Under the
   plans, options to purchase common stock are granted to officers and key
   employees at prices not less than the fair market value of the common
   stock on the date of grant. Options granted under the 1987 plan and the
   1991 plan may be exercised up to five years after the date of grant.
   Options granted under the 1995 plan may be exercised up to 10 years from
   the date of the grant.

   The plans permit participants to use option shares for the purpose of
   offsetting income tax liabilities incurred upon the exercise of stock
   options. The terms of the 1995 and 1991 Plans allow for grants of either
   Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock Options. The 1995 and 1991
   Plans include provisions which authorize options to be granted to non-
   employee Directors.

   The following table summarizes activity under the stock option plans:

                                           Options        Price Range

                                         ========= 

   Of the options outstanding at December 30, 1995, 833,142 were exercisable
   at prices ranging from $111/8 to $24 1/8.  The balance of the options
   become exercisable at various times through 1998 at prices ranging from
   $20 5/8 to $29 1/2.  At December 30, 1995, 1,333,464 shares of the
   Corporation's common stock were reserved for future option grants.
   During 1995, 1994 and 1993, 124,078, 86,090 and 64,068 shares,
   respectively, were submitted to the Corporation in partial payment for
   stock option exercises and to offset income tax liabilities. These shares
   were canceled by the Corporation.

   (6)  CAPITAL STOCK

   In January 1996, the Corporation's Board of Directors approved a three-
   for-two stock split to be effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend,
   which will be paid  in March 1996. All  common stock per share amounts and
   common stock data, other than the actual shares outstanding, have been
   restated in the consolidated financial statements and throughout the
   Annual Report to reflect the stock split.

   In April 1993, the Corporation distributed a three-for-two stock split
   effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend, following the action of the
   shareholders increasing the authorized shares of common stock from
   30,000,000 shares to 75,000,000 shares.  The par value of the additional
   shares issued was capitalized by a transfer of $662,000 from retained
   earnings to common stock.  

   The Corporation has been authorized by the Board of Directors to purchase
   up to 1,500,000 shares of outstanding common stock in the open market.  As
   of December 30, 1995, no  shares of the Corporation's stock had been
   repurchased under this program.

   Pursuant to the Corporation's Shareholder Rights Plan, one common stock
   purchase right is included with each outstanding share of common stock. In
   the event the rights become  exercisable, each right will initially 
   entitle its holder to buy one-half of one share of the Corporation's
   common stock at a price of $40 per share (equivalent to $20 per one-half
   share), subject to adjustment.  The rights will become exercisable if a
   person or group acquires 20% or more of the Corporation's common stock or
   announces a tender offer for 20% or more of the common stock.  Upon the
   occurrence of certain events, including a person, or group, acquiring 20%
   or more of the Corporation's common stock, each right will entitle the
   holder to purchase, at the right's then-current exercise price, common
   stock of the Corporation or, depending on the circumstances, common stock
   of the acquiring corporation having a market value of twice such exercise
   price.   The rights may be redeemed by the Corporation at a price of one
   cent per right at any time prior to the rights becoming exercisable or
   prior to their expiration in November 2001.

   (7)  OPERATING LEASES

   The Corporation leases a variety of assets used in its operations
   including manufacturing facilities, warehouses, office space, office
   equipment, automobiles and trucks.  Annual rentals amounted to $7,661,000,
   $5,261,000 and $3,199,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Minimum
   rental commitments for the years 1996 through 2000 aggregate $8,010,000, 
   $7,202,000, $6,717,000, $4,753,000 and $4,331,000, respectively, and
   $25,385,000 thereafter.

   (8) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

   Pension Plans - The Corporation and its unions have several pension plans
   covering substantially all employees.  The plans are non-contributory and
   benefits are based on an employee's years of service and earnings.  The
   Corporation makes contributions to the qualified plans each year, at least
   equal to the minimum required contributions as defined by the Employee
   Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974.  A Non-qualified

   Approximately 54% of the Corporation's non-salaried employees are covered
   by multiemployer union sponsored, collectively bargained defined benefit
   pension plans.  Pension expense includes $2,027,000, $1,787,000 and
   $1,588,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, attributable to the
   multiemployer plans.  These costs are determined in accordance with the
   provisions of negotiated labor contacts.

   Postretirement Health Care Costs - The Corporation and its subsidiaries
   provide non-contractual limited health care benefits for certain retired
   employees. The program provides for defined initial contributions by the
   Corporation toward the cost of postretirement health care coverage.  The
   balance of the cost is borne by the retirees.  The program provides that
   increases in the Corporation's contribution toward coverage will not
   exceed 4% per year.

   Effective January 3, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
   Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
   Benefits Other than Pensions."  In connection with the adoption of this
   statement, the Corporation elected to amortize the accumulated
   postretirement benefit obligation (transition obligation), aggregating
   $5,088,000 as of January 3, 1993, over a 20-year period.  

   The following table sets forth the plan's status at December 30, 1995, and
   December 31, 1994:

   The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement
   benefit obligation was 7.25% and 8.50% at December 30, 1995, and December
   31, 1994, respectively.  Due to the terms of the Corporation's
   postretirement health care program, assumed health care cost rate trends
   do not affect the Corporation's costs.

   Other Benefits - The Corporation has established an Incentive Savings Plan
   (401K) for substantially all of its non-bargained employees.  Employee
   contributions are partially matched by the Corporation in accordance with
   criteria set forth in the plan.  Matching contributions charged to
   earnings for 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $2,148,000, $1,467,000 and
   $1,311,000, respectively.

   (9) CONTINGENCIES

   The Corporation is involved in various claims, including those related to
   environmental matters, and lawsuits arising in the normal course of
   business.  In the opinion of management, the ultimate liability, if any,
   for these claims and lawsuits beyond any reserves already provided, will
   not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated statements of
   earnings of the Corporation.

   Report of Independent Public Accountants

   TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF BANTA CORPORATION:

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated  balance sheets of Banta
   Corporation (a Wisconsin corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 30,
   1995 and December 31, 1994, and the related consolidated statements of
   earnings, shareholders' investment and cash flows for each of the fiscal
   years in the three-year period ended December 30, 1995.  These financial
   statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management.  Our
   responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
   based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
   standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
   obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
   free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
   basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
   statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
   used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
   the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
   provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
   in all material respects, the financial position of Banta Corporation and
   subsidiaries as of December 30, 1995 and December 31, 1994, and the
   results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal
   years in the three-year priod ended December 30, 1995, in conformity with
   generally accepted accounting principles.

   Responsibility for Financial Statements


   The Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial references
   appearing in this Annual Report were prepared by management in conformity
   with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate for the
   circumstances.  Where acceptable alternative accounting principles exist,
   as described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
   Statements, management uses its best judgment in selecting those
   principles that reflect fairly the financial position and results of
   operations of the Corporation.  The accounting records and systems of
   internal control are designed to reflect the transactions of the
   Corporation in accordance with established policies and procedures. 
   Financial and operational reviews are undertaken by management to provide
   assurance that the books and records properly reflect transactions
   authorized by the Corporation.

   The Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in this Annual Report have
   been audited by Arthur Andersen LLP.  Their audits were made in accordance
   with generally accepted auditing standards and provide an independent
   review of those management responsibilities that relate to the preparation
   of this Annual Report.

   The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, comprised of directors who
   are not officers or employees, reviews the financial and accounting
   reports of the Corporation, including a review and discussion of the
   principles and procedures used by management in preparation of the
   financial statements.  The independent auditors have full and free access
   to the Audit Committee and meet with it to review the results of the audit
   engagement, the preparation of the Annual Report and to discuss auditing
   and financial reporting matters.
