ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

General

         Barnes & Noble, Inc. ("Barnes & Noble" or the "Company"), the world's
largest bookseller*, operated 483 "super" stores in 48 states and the District
of Columbia and 528 mall-based bookstores in 45 states and the District of
Columbia as of January 31, 1998. The Company's rapidly expanding "super" store
business operates under the Barnes & Noble Booksellers, Bookstop and Bookstar
trade names (collectively "Barnes & Noble stores") and its mall-based business
operates under the B. Dalton Bookseller, Doubleday Book Shops and Scribner's
Bookstore trade names (collectively "B. Dalton stores"). The Company is the
world's largest supplier of books through direct-mail catalogs* and publishes
books under its own Barnes & Noble Books imprint for exclusive sale through its
retail bookstores and mail-order catalogs. The Company is also the exclusive
bookseller in America Online's Marketplace (AOL keyword: BarnesandNoble) and
maintains its own Web site (BarnesandNoble.com), operating the "world's largest
bookseller online." Barnes & Noble is the only book retailer operating through
all four channels of distribution: retail stores, the Internet, 1-800-THE-BOOK
and mail order. During fiscal 1997, the Company's share of the consumer book
market increased to approximately 14%.

         The Company's principal business is the retail sale of trade books
(generally hardcover and paperback consumer titles, excluding educational
textbooks and specialized religious titles), mass market paperbacks (such as
mystery, romance, science fiction and other popular fiction), children's
books, off-price bargain books and magazines. These collectively account for
substantially all of the Company's sales. Bestsellers represent only 3% of the
Barnes & Noble store sales.

         The Company's fiscal year is comprised of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on
the Saturday closest to the last day of January. The fiscal year ended January
31, 1998 ("fiscal 1997") was comprised of 52 weeks and the fiscal year ended
February 1, 1997 ("fiscal 1996") was comprised of 53 weeks.

         The Company generated revenues of $2.797 billion during fiscal 1997,
an increase of 14.2%, compared with revenues of $2.448 billion during fiscal
1996. Fiscal 1996 includes 53 weeks; excluding the impact of the 53rd week,
revenues increased 16%. During fiscal 1997, revenues from Barnes & Noble stores
rose 20.7% to $2.246 billion from $1.861 billion during fiscal 1996. The
Company's net earnings before an extraordinary charge due to early
extinguishment of debt, increased $13.4 million, or 26.2%, to $64.7 million
during fiscal 1997 from $51.2 million during fiscal 1996. The extraordinary
charge of $11.5 million recorded in fiscal 1997 equated to $0.17 per common
dilutive share resulting in net earnings of $53.2 million or $0.76 per common
dilutive share compared with $0.75 per common dilutive share for the prior year.

Barnes & Noble Stores


         General

          The Company is the largest operator of book "super" stores in the
United States* with 483 stores, of which 65 were opened in fiscal 1997. During
fiscal 1997, Barnes & Noble stores generated 80.3% of

total Company revenues, up from 76.0% during the prior year. The Barnes &
Noble stores realized a comparable store sales increase of 9.4% during fiscal
1997.

         Barnes & Noble stores range in size from 10,000 to 60,000 square feet
depending upon market size. The 65 Barnes & Noble stores opened during fiscal
1997 added 1.6 million square feet to the Barnes & Noble store base, bringing
the total square footage to 10.8 million square feet, a 16% increase over the
prior year. The Company intends to open approximately 60 Barnes & Noble stores
during the 52 weeks ending January 30, 1999 which are expected to average
26,000 square feet in size. With its market leadership position and its high
standards for site selection, store design, merchandising and customer service,
the Company believes that its Barnes & Noble store business continues to have
significant growth opportunities and intends to expand its operations in new and
existing markets. The Company plans to continue opening as many new stores in
the future that meet its strict standard for return on investment. The Company
believes that the key elements contributing to the success of the Barnes & Noble
stores are:

         Proximity to Customers. The Company's strategy is to increase its
share of the consumer book market, as well as to increase the size of the
market. Since it began its "super" store roll-out, the Company has employed a
market clustering strategy. As of January 31, 1998, Barnes & Noble had stores
in 140 of the total 208 DMA markets (Designated Market Area). In 71 of the 140
markets the Company has only one Barnes & Noble store. The Company believes its
early market penetration and the stores' proximity to their customers strengthen
its market position and increase its franchise value. Most Barnes & Noble stores
are located in high-traffic areas with convenient access to major commercial
thoroughfares and ample parking. Most stores offer extended shopping hours,
generally 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., seven days a week.

         Dominant Title Selection. Each Barnes & Noble store features an
authoritative selection of books, ranging between 60,000 and 175,000 titles.
Each store's comprehensive title selection is customized to the local
community's interests and demands. To further the breadth of title selection,
Barnes & Noble funds the Discover Great New Writers program supporting the
work of newly published authors, and emphasizes books published by small and

independent publishers and university presses. In addition to this extensive 
on-site selection, each store will special order any book from the more than 
one million books in print. The Company believes that its tremendous selection,
including many otherwise hard-to-find titles, builds customer loyalty.

         Experienced Booksellers. Seven years into its "super" store roll-out,
the Company has a large and experienced base of booksellers from which it can
select managers and booksellers to fill positions in the Company's expanding
business. The Company's culture of outgoing, helpful and knowledgeable
booksellers consists of 27,200 full- and part-time employees operating over
1,000 stores as of January 31, 1998. During fiscal 1997, 75% of the new Barnes
& Noble store managers were promoted from within this group, from which the
Company realizes the benefits of better store-level execution, staffing and
customer service.

         Store Design and Ambiance. Barnes & Noble stores are designed to be
reminiscent of an old world library, with wood fixtures, antique style chairs
and tables, ample public space, a cafe and public restrooms. Barnes & Noble's
literary cafes, for which the Starbucks Coffee Company is the sole provider of
coffee products, further the image of its "super" stores as a community
meeting place.


                                      5
<PAGE>


         Music Departments. As of January 31, 1998, the Company had 155 Barnes
& Noble stores with music departments which range in size from 2,000 to 4,000
square feet. The music departments generally stock over 50,000 titles in
classical music, opera, jazz, blues and pop rock, tailored to the tastes of
the Company's core customers - the 35- to 45-year age group. Listening
stations are available for customers to preview selected compact disks.

         Discount Pricing. Barnes & Noble stores employ a nationwide discount
pricing strategy. The New York Times hardcover bestsellers are discounted 30%
off the publishers' suggested retail price, with a 10% discount on most other
hardcover books. The Company believes that its pricing strategies enable the
Company to be highly competitive.

         Marketing and Community Relations. Barnes & Noble stores are launched
with a major grand opening campaign involving extensive print and radio
advertising, direct-mail marketing and community events. Each store plans its
own community-based calendar of events, including author appearances,
children's storytelling hours, poetry readings and discussion groups. The
Company believes its community focus encourages customer loyalty, significant
word-of-mouth publicity and free media coverage. The Company also supports
communities through efforts on behalf of First Book, a national organization
dedicated to providing books to children with little or no access to them
outside of school. The Company is one of the leading sponsors of Writer's
Harvest, an annual series of readings held across the country sponsored by
Share our Strength, one of the nation's foremost anti-poverty organization.

         Proprietary Product. The Company features titles published under the

Barnes & Noble Books imprint in its retail stores and mail-order catalogs.
During fiscal 1997, sales of Barnes & Noble's self-published titles grew over
30% in terms of retail dollars over fiscal 1996. During 1997 the Company
introduced more titles under its own imprint, bringing its total catalog of
self-published books to over 1,500 titles. Sales of these books enable the
Company to distinguish its product offerings from those of its competitors and
offer customers high quality books at excellent values while generating
attractive gross margins.

         Merchandising and Marketing

         The Company's merchandising strategy for its Barnes & Noble stores is
to be the authoritative community bookstore which carries a dominant selection
of titles in all subjects, including an extensive selection of titles from
small independent publishers and university presses. Each Barnes & Noble store
stocks from 60,000 to 175,000 titles, of which approximately 50,000 titles are
common to all stores; the balance is crafted to reflect the lifestyles and
interests of each store's customers. Before a store opens, the Company's
buyers study the community and customize the title selection with offerings
from the store's local publishers and authors. After the store opens, each
Barnes & Noble store manager is responsible for adjusting the buyers'
selection to the interests, lifestyles and demands of the store's local
customers. The Company's proprietary database, which includes catalogued sales
rankings of over 650,000 titles in over 110 subjects, provides each store with
comprehensive title selections in those subjects in which it seeks to expand.
During 1997, the Company began rolling out the next generation of its
state-of-the-art store system. The new store system greatly enhances
store-level customer service and productivity with its extremely fast register
transactions and its title database with more than one million titles designed
specifically for book browsing. The roll-out will be substantially completed
in 1998.

         Store Locations and Properties

         The Company's experienced real estate personnel select sites for new
Barnes & Noble stores after an extensive review of demographic data and other
information relating to market potential, bookstore visibility and access,
available parking, surrounding businesses, compatible nearby tenants,
competition and the location of other Barnes & Noble stores. Most stores are
located in high-visibility areas adjacent to main traffic corridors in strip
shopping centers or freestanding buildings. The Company has been successful in
converting existing structures into dynamic bookstores in the Barnes & Noble
store format such as conversions of old movie theaters, bowling alleys and
landmark buildings.

District of Columbia as of January 31, 1998 are listed below:

         Expansion



                                      7
<PAGE>


         The Company believes its Barnes & Noble store format offers the
greatest opportunity to increase its share of the expanding consumer book
market and intends to strengthen its position as the world's leading operator
of book superstores by opening approximately 60 new stores during fiscal 1998.

         All stores will be opened under the Barnes & Noble Booksellers trade
name, and positions in those stores will be filled from within the Company
wherever possible.

         The Company anticipates that its expansion plans will be supported by
a combination of continuing strong demand for consumer books, which has grown
over the past five years at a rate of 5.0% compounded annually according to
Veronis, Suhler & Associates Communications Industry Forecast ("Veronis
Suhler") and incremental sales generated by new stores.

         Demographic trends in the United States support the prospect of

continued growth in the retail book industry. The principal book buying
population is between 45 and 64 years of age. According to the U.S. Bureau of
the Census, over the next five years this age group is expected to increase
17%. 

B. Dalton Stores

         General

         The Company is the second largest operator of mall bookstores in the
United States*. During fiscal 1997, B. Dalton generated revenues of
approximately $509.4 million, or 18.2% of the Company's total revenues,
compared with 23.1% of total Company revenues during fiscal 1996.

         Most B. Dalton stores range in size from 2,800 to 6,000 square feet.
These stores stock between 15,000 and 25,000 titles, feature new releases,
bestsellers and children's books, and carry a solid selection of titles in
categories such as business, computers, cooking and reference. B. Dalton
employs a market-by-market discount pricing strategy which generally discounts
hardcover bestsellers from 15% to 25% off the publishers' suggested retail
prices. B. Dalton also offers a Book$avers discount card for an annual fee
which allows customers an additional 10% discount on substantially all
purchases. The Company's 18 Doubleday and nine Scribner's bookstores utilize a
more upscale format in select shopping malls and place a greater emphasis on
hardcover and gift books.

         The Company is continuing to execute a strategy to maximize returns
from its B. Dalton stores in response to declining sales attributable
primarily to superstore competition and, to a lesser extent, weaker overall
consumer traffic in shopping malls. Part of the Company's strategy has been to
close underperforming stores, which has resulted in the closing of more than
50 B. Dalton stores per year since 1989 as leases come up for renewal.

<PAGE>

         The Company has also been expanding the size of some of its new B.
Dalton stores and is seeking better locations within malls. A new B. Dalton
prototype was developed for this purpose; more than 100 new or converted stores
have been opened in the new format and are performing, on average, better than
the remaining store base.

         Merchandising and Marketing

           Each B. Dalton store carries a solid selection of core titles
within a variety of subject categories which are supplemented by new releases,
bestsellers and other titles specially selected to meet local demand. B.

Dalton's merchandise strategy is to expand title assortments within categories
it believes have significant growth potential, such as children's books, mass
market paperbacks (such as mystery, romance, science fiction and other popular
fiction), publishers' remainders and other bargain books including the
Company's self-published books. B. Dalton's product offerings are merchandised
to attract shoppers responding to movies, television talk show topics and
current events. Each store has the ability to customize its selection to its
local customers based upon their interests and demands.

         B. Dalton's advertising and promotional programs focus on
point-of-sale and storefront signage and other in-store promotions designed to
attract walk-by mall traffic. B. Dalton takes full advantage of cooperative
advertising funds made available by publishers and generally limits its
expenditures and promotional programs to the amount of such funds. In
addition, stores customarily incur advertising costs, often in amounts equal
to a percentage of their annual sales, for lease required advertising of
mall-related promotional events.

         Store Locations and Properties

           Approximately 90% of B. Dalton stores are located in enclosed
regional shopping malls. The remaining stores are located in strip shopping
centers and central business districts. Site selections and lease renewals for
all B. Dalton stores are made after an extensive review of demographic data,
mall tenants, location within the mall and competitive factors.

         The number of B. Dalton stores located in each state and the District
of Columbia as of January 31, 1998 are listed below:

         The Company remains committed to opening stores in new shopping mall
projects which meet the Company's return on investment criteria and
anticipates opening four new B. Dalton stores during the 52 weeks ending
January 30, 1999. Given the declining rate of new mall development and the
Company's continuing plans to close B. Dalton stores, the Company anticipates
it will continue to realize a decline in the number of B. Dalton stores during
1998 primarily due to lease expirations. During fiscal 1997, the Company opened
4 B. Dalton stores and closed 53 stores, primarily as a result of electing not 
to renew expiring leases.

BarnesandNoble.com

         General

         During March of 1997, the Company, through its wholly owned
subsidiary BarnesandNoble.com Inc., became the exclusive bookseller in America
Online's marketplace (keyword: BarnesandNoble), linking the world's largest
bookseller with the world's most popular Internet online service. America
Online provides its over 12 million members with access to the proprietary
database of BarnesandNoble.com, and enables the Company to directly reach a
well-established online community. The exclusive four-year agreement gives
BarnesandNoble.com an extensive presence throughout America Online. In May of
1997, BarnesandNoble.com launched its own Web site. The Company believes that
it brings significant competitive advantages to the online bookselling market,
including its distribution expertise, proprietary title database, large
customer base and established brand recognition. BarnesandNoble.com employs a
discount pricing strategy of 30% to 40% off publishers' suggested retail prices
for hardcover and 20% off publishers' suggested retail prices for paperback.

         The Company's database of every book in print is powered by a 
proprietary search engine that allows users to locate books by author, title or
subject. To further tailor customers' searches, BarnesandNoble.com includes book
descriptions, reviews and author interviews on hundreds of thousands of titles,
along with recommendations by the Company's editors and the Company's online
community of readers. From the latest bestsellers and new releases to diverse
titles from small presses and university publishers, the Company has more books
available for same-day shipping from the Company's distribution center than any
online bookseller. Currently, the Company offers almost 600,000 titles for
same-day shipping covering almost 90% of orders placed through
BarnesandNoble.com. In 1997, over 250,000 customers in 149 countries purchased
their books from BarnesandNoble.com.

         Merchandising and Marketing




                                      10
<PAGE>


         Since the launch of BarnesandNoble.com, the Company has aggressively
pursued and won marketing and distribution deals with the Web's leading
content, search and commerce sites. These deals serve to extend the reach of
BarnesandNoble.com by creating links to high traffic sites, such as Lycos, CNN
Interactive, Discovery Channel Online, ZD Net, The New York Times, Time Inc.,
New Media and USA Today. The reach was further extended by the thousands of
additional Web sites that have joined the Company's innovative affiliate
network. All of the affiliates earn commissions based upon sales generated
from the traffic they direct to BarnesandNoble.com. The Company also entered
into a partnership with Disney Online, in which BarnesandNoble.com is the
exclusive bookseller for their site and operates a Disney bookstore on the
BarnesandNoble.com site. BarnesandNoble.com has a dedicated management team of
e-commerce marketing and technology professionals. As a leader in the
fast-growing world of e-commerce, the Company intends to actively advertise
and further develop affiliate relationships.

Other Strategies

         Proprietary Publishing. With publishing and distribution rights to
over 1,500 titles covering a wide range of subject categories, the Company
further differentiates its product offerings from those of its competitors by
publishing books under its own Barnes & Noble Books imprint for exclusive sale
in its retail stores, direct mail catalogs and BarnesandNoble.com. As part of
this activity, the Company licenses titles directly from domestic and
international publishers as well as from literary agents, commissions books
directly from authors, reprints classic titles in the public domain and
creates collections of fiction and non-fiction using in-house editors. These
books are published under the Barnes & Noble Books imprint. By self-publishing
books, the Company is able to significantly lower its merchandise costs and
pass on a portion of the savings to its customers. While the prices of these
books represent significant value to customers, they also generate
substantially higher gross profit margins than those realized on sales of
non-proprietary books.

         Books published by the Company are featured prominently in the
Company's direct-mail catalogs, in the front of the Company's stores, and on
the BarnesandNoble.com Web site. The Company is continuing to expand the scope
of its publishing program by increasing the number of titles it publishes,
particularly dictionaries, reference books, children's books and classics.
During the 52 weeks ended January 31, 1998, sales of the Company's proprietary
books increased 30% over proprietary book sales during the 53 weeks ended
February 1, 1997.

         Mail-Order. Complementing its leadership position as the world's
largest bookseller, Barnes & Noble is the world's largest supplier of books
through direct-mail catalogs*. The Company mails over 15 million catalogs each
year to its in-house mailing list of over one million customers. The Company
acquires new customers by mailing additional catalogs to potential customers
on targeted mailing lists, as well as by placing catalog-request ads in

national and local newspapers and upscale magazines. Through the direct-mail
catalogs, the Company sells publishers' remainders and imported books at up to
80% off publishers' suggested retail prices, as well as the Company's
self-published books under its Barnes & Noble Books imprint. The Company
believes that its extensive catalog mailings over the past eleven years have

                                      11
<PAGE>

created substantial name recognition in the United States and internationally,
which has benefited both the retail stores and the online business.

         Strategic Investments. The Company maintains an equity investment in
Chapters, Inc., an Ontario corporation which is publicly traded on the Toronto
Stock Exchange. Chapters is the largest book retailer in Canada and the third
largest in North America*, operating 347 bookstores, including 29 superstores.
The Company also maintains an equity investment in Calendar Club L.L.C., an
operator of seasonal calendar kiosks in the United States and internationally.

Store Operations

         The Company has seasoned management teams for its Barnes & Noble and
B. Dalton stores, including those for real estate, merchandising and store
operations. Field management includes regional store directors and district
managers supervising multiple store locations. Each B. Dalton store generally
employs a manager, an assistant manager and approximately seven full- and
part-time booksellers. By comparison, each Barnes & Noble store generally
employs a manager, two assistant managers and approximately 40 full- and
part-time booksellers. Most Barnes & Noble stores also employ a full-time
community relations manager. The Company's large employee base provides the
Company with experienced booksellers to fill positions in the Company's new
Barnes & Noble stores. The Company anticipates that a significant percentage
of the personnel required to manage its expanding business will continue to
come from within its existing operations.

         Field management for all of the Company's bookstores, including
regional store directors, district managers and store managers, participate in
a bonus program tied to sales. The Company believes that the compensation of
its field management is competitive with that offered by other specialty
retailers of comparable size.

         The Company has a twelve-week manager training program in which
existing store managers train new store managers in all areas of store
operations. Store managers are generally responsible for training other
booksellers in accordance with detailed procedures and guidelines prescribed
by the Company, utilizing training aids available at each bookstore. In
addition, district managers participate in semi-annual training and
merchandising conferences.


Purchasing

         Barnes & Noble's buyers negotiate terms, discounts and cooperative
advertising allowances with publishers for all of the Company's bookstores.
The Company's increased use of its distribution center enables it to maximize
available discounts and the Company's multiple strategies greatly enhance its
ability to create customized marketing programs with many of its vendors. The
Company has teams of buyers who specialize in customizing inventory for each
of the Company's bookselling strategies. Store inventories are further
customized by the store managers, who may respond to local demand by
purchasing a limited amount of fast-selling titles through a nationwide
wholesaling network.



                                      12
<PAGE>

         The Company purchases books on a regular basis from over 1,600
publishers and approximately 50 wholesale distributors. Purchases from the top
five suppliers (including publishers and wholesale distributors) accounted for
approximately 47% of the Company's book purchases during the 52 weeks ended
January 31, 1998, and no single supplier accounted for more than 16% of the
Company's purchases during this period. Consistent with retail book industry
practice, substantially all of the Company's book purchases are returnable for
full credit, a practice which substantially reduces the Company's risk of
inventory obsolescence.

         Publishers control the distribution of titles by virtue of copyright
protection, which limits availability on most titles to a single publisher.
Since the retail, or list, prices of titles, as well as the retailers' cost
price, are also generally determined by publishers, the Company has limited
options concerning availability, cost and profitability of its book inventory.
However, these limitations are mitigated by (i) the substantial number of
titles available (over one million), (ii) the Company's ability to maximize
available discounts and (iii) its positive relationships with publishers, which
are enhanced by the Company's significant purchasing volume.

         Publishers periodically offer their excess inventory in the form of
remainder books to book retailers and wholesalers through an auction process
which generally favors booksellers such as the Company who are able to buy
substantial quantities. These books are generally purchased in large
quantities at favorable prices and are then sold to consumers at significant
discounts off publishers' list prices.

Distribution

         Over the past three years, the Company has invested significant
capital in its systems and technology, by building new platforms, implementing
new software applications and opening a new distribution center. During
September 1996 the Company opened a new state-of-the-art 344,000 square foot
distribution facility in South Brunswick, New Jersey. Historically, the
Company replenished through its distribution network some of its fast-moving

frontlist titles and bargain and self-published books and had the remaining
inventory drop-shipped directly to the stores from wholesalers and publishers.
Significantly more inventory is sourced through the Company's new distribution
center which provides increased gross margins through more direct buying from
publishers rather than wholesalers, improved store-level just-in-time
deliveries to yield higher sales volumes, and increased inventory turnover.

         In addition, the Company's distribution network provides a
significant competitive advantage for BarnesandNoble.com. By stocking nearly
600,000 titles, the Company is currently in a position to provide overnight
delivery service to its online customers at gross margins which can allow the
Company to offer very deep discounts. The Company plans to significantly
increase the number of titles in the distribution center in the next year.

Management Information and Control Systems

         The Company has focused a majority of its information resources on
strategically positioning and implementing systems to support store
operations, merchandising and finance. The Company 



                                      13
<PAGE>

determined that an open-architecture distributed computing environment would
provide the flexibility needed in the future and as a result a migration to a
client server platform was initiated.

         Building on the Company's previous proprietary inventory management
system, during 1996 the Company introduced a new client server store system
("BookMaster"). BookMaster is an inventory management system with integrated
point of sale features that utilizes a proprietary data-warehouse-based
replenishment system. It enhances communications and real-time access to our
network of stores, distribution center and wholesalers. In addition,
implementation of just-in-time replenishment has provided for more rapid
replenishment of books to all stores. The BookMaster system roll-out will be
substantially completed in 1998.

         The Company continues to implement systems to improve efficiencies in
back office processing in the human resources, finance and merchandising
areas. An offsite business recovery capability has been developed and
implemented to assure uninterrupted systems support.

         Year 2000. The Company is continuing its comprehensive evaluation of
all computer systems and microprocessors and is in the process of replacing,
modifying and/or converting those systems which are not yet year 2000
compliant. The incremental cost over the next two years is being determined as
part of the continuing evaluation. Management does not expect such costs to
have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of
operations of the Company.

Competition


         The retail bookselling business is highly competitive. The Company
competes in the superstore business with Borders Group, Inc. and other
national chains which have substantially fewer superstores than the Company,
and in the mall bookstore business with Walden Book Company, Inc., a
subsidiary of Borders Group, Inc. and the largest operator of mall bookstores
in the country*. The Company also competes with regional chains, as well as
independent single store operators, local multi-store operators, department
stores, variety discounters, drug stores and warehouse clubs. Many of the
Company's competitors have been expanding in both store size and number of
outlets. The Company competes with Internet-based competition from numerous
booksellers including online companies, such as Amazon.com, traditional book 
retailers and publishers. The Company expects future online competition 
to intensify.

Trademarks and Servicemarks

         B. Dalton Bookseller, Bookstar and Book$avers are Company-owned
service marks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Barnes & Noble, Doubleday Book Shops and Scribner's Bookstores are federally
registered service marks which have been licensed to the Company under
long-term license agreements which are royalty-free. These license agreements
provide the Company with the exclusive right to use the Doubleday and
Scribner's service marks only in connection with the retail sale of books.

Employees

         The Company currently employs approximately 3,500 full-time salaried,
11,000 full-time hourly and between 15,000 and 17,000 part-time hourly
employees. The fluctuation in the number of part-time hourly employees is due
to the seasonality of the business. The Company's employees are not
represented by unions and the Company believes that its relationship with its
employees is excellent.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

         All but one of the Barnes & Noble stores are leased. The leases
typically provide for an initial term of ten or fifteen years with one or more
renewal options. The terms of the Barnes & Noble store leases for its 482
leased stores open as of January 31, 1998 expire as follows:

         All B. Dalton stores are leased. The leases generally provide for an
initial ten-year term with no renewal option. The terms of the 528 B. Dalton
leases as of January 31, 1998 expire as follows:

         The Company generally has been able to renew expiring leases on
favorable terms, and believes that renewals of leases expiring in the future
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition
or results of operations.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         Various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business
are pending against the Company. The subject matter of these proceedings
primarily includes commercial disputes and employment issues. The results of
these proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

         In March 1998, the American Booksellers Association ("ABA") and
twenty-six independent bookstores filed a lawsuit in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and
Borders Group, Inc. alleging violations of the Robinson-Patman Act, the
California Unfair Trade Practice Act and the California Unfair Competition
Law. The Complaint seeks injunctive and declaratory relief; treble damages on
behalf of each of the bookstore plaintiffs, and, with 



                                      16

respect to the California bookstore plaintiffs, any other damages permitted by
California law; disgorgement of money, property and gains wrongfully obtained
in connection with the purchase of books for resale, or offered for resale, in
California from March 18, 1994 until the action is completed and pre-judgment
interest on any amounts awarded in the action, as well as attorney fees and
costs. The Company intends to vigorously defend the action.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

         There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during
the 13 weeks ended January 31, 1998.

         AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT dated as of November 18,
1997, among: BARNES & NOBLE, INC., a corporation duly organized and
validly existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (together with
its successors and assigns, the "Company"); each of the Subsidiaries of
the Company identified under the caption "SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS" on the
signature pages hereto (each such Subsidiary and each other Subsidiary of
the Company that becomes a "Subsidiary Guarantor" pursuant to Section
9.17 hereof, together with its successors and assigns, but excluding any
Released Guarantors, individually, a "Subsidiary Guarantor" and,
collectively, the "Subsidiary Guarantors" and, together with the Company,
the "Obligors"); each of the lenders named under the caption "Lenders" on
the signature pages hereof (together with its successors and assigns,
individually, a "Lender" and, collectively, the "Lenders"); THE CHASE
MANHATTAN BANK, in its capacity as Swingline Bank under Section 2.01(b)
hereof (in such capacity, together with its successors in such capacity,
the "Swingline Bank"); and THE CHASE MANHATTAN BANK, as agent for the
Lenders (in such capacity, together with its successors in such capacity,
the "Administrative Agent").

         The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors are engaged as an
integrated group in the business of distributing and selling books and
related products, and in related or complementary businesses, and in
furnishing the required supplies, services, equipment, credit and other
facilities for such integrated operation. This integrated operation
requires financing on such a basis that credit supplied to the Company be
made available from time to time to the Subsidiary Guarantors, as
required for the continued successful operation of the Obligors,
separately, and the integrated operation of the Obligors as a whole. In
that connection, the Obligors, certain of the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent entered into a Credit Agreement dated as of March
28, 1996 (the "Existing Credit Agreement") pursuant to which said Lenders
agreed to extend credit to the Company in an aggregate amount not
exceeding $550,000,000. The Obligors have requested that the Lenders
increase the aggregate Commitments to extend credit to the Company (all
or a substantial portion of which will be made available by the Company
to the Subsidiary Guarantors) to an aggregate principal amount not
exceeding $850,000,000 to refinance certain existing indebtedness of the
Obligors, including all of the obligations under the existing Credit
Agreement, to enable certain acquisitions and capital expenditures by the
Obligors, for working capital and for other corporate purposes.

         To induce the Lenders to extend such credit, the Obligors desire
to enter into this Agreement, which will amend and restate the Existing
Credit Agreement in all respects, and pursuant to which the Lenders will
make loans to and issue or participate in letters of credit for account
of the Company, the Swingline Bank will make loans to the Company, each
Subsidiary Guarantor will guarantee the credit so extended to the Company
and each of the Obligors will agree to execute and deliver security

agreements providing for security interests and liens to be granted by
the Obligors on certain of their respective Properties as collateral
security for the obligations of the Obligors to the Lenders, the
Swingline Bank and the Administrative Agent hereunder. Each Obligor
expects to derive benefit, directly or indirectly, from the credit so
extended to the Company, both in its separate capacity and as a member of
the integrated group, because the successful operation of each Obligor is
dependent on the continued successful performance of the functions of the
integrated group as a whole.

         Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:


         Section 1.  Definitions and Accounting Matters

         1.01 Certain Defined Terms. As used herein, the following terms shall

         receipt by the Swingline Bank and shall specify the principal
         amount of the Swingline Loan to be borrowed (which shall be at

         principal office in New York City designated by the Company.

                  (ii) The Company hereby irrevocably authorizes and

                                                              Exhibit 10.1


                  (iii) In the event that the power of the Swingline Bank
         to give such a notice of borrowing on behalf of the Company is
         terminated for any reason whatsoever (including, without
         limitation, a termination resulting from the occurrence of an
         event specified in clause (f) or (g) of Section 10 hereof with
         respect to the Company), or the Swingline Bank is otherwise
         precluded for any reason whatsoever from giving a notice of
         borrowing on behalf of the Company as provided in the preceding
         sentence, each Lender shall, upon notice from the Swingline
         Bank, promptly purchase from the Swingline Bank a participation
         in (or, if and to the extent specified by the Swingline Bank, a
         direct interest in) such Swingline Loan in the amount of the
         Base Rate Loan it would have been obligated to make pursuant to
         such notice of borrowing. Each Lender shall, not later than 2:00
         p.m. New York time on the Business Day on which such notice is
         given (if such notice is given by 10:00 a.m. New York time) or
         noon New York time on the next succeeding Business Day (if such
         notice is given after 10:00 a.m. New York time), make available
         the amount of the Base Rate Loan to be made by it (or the amount
         of the participation or direct interest to be purchased by it,
         as the case may be) to the Administrative Agent at the account
         specified in Section 2.02(a) hereof and the amount so received
         by the Administrative Agent shall be made available to the
         Swingline Bank by depositing the same, in immediately available
         funds, in an account of the Swingline Bank maintained at the
         principal office of the Swingline Bank in New York City
         designated by the Swingline Bank. Promptly following its receipt
         of any payment in respect of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline
         Bank shall pay to each Lender that has acquired a participation
         in such Swingline Loan such Lender's proportionate share of such
         payment. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
         notwithstanding (including, without limitation, in Section 7.02
         hereof), the obligation of each Lender to make its Base Rate
         Loan (or purchase its participation or direct interest in the
         Swingline Loan, as the case may be) pursuant to this Section

         2.02(b)(iii) is unconditional under any and all circumstances
         whatsoever and shall not be subject to set-off, counterclaim or
         defense to payment that such Lender may have or have had against
         the Company, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Bank or any
         other Lender and, without limiting any of the foregoing, shall
         be unconditional irrespective of (A) the occurrence of any
         Default, (B) the financial condition of the Company, any
         Subsidiary Guarantor, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline
         Bank or any other Lender or (C) the termination or cancellation
         of the Revolving Credit Commitments. The Company agrees that any
         Lender so purchasing a participation (or direct interest) in
         such Swingline Loan may exercise all rights of set-off, bankers'
         lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such
         participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of
         a Swingline Loan in the amount of such participation; provided
         that no Lender shall be obligated to purchase participations or
         direct interests in any Swingline Loan pursuant to this Section
         2.02(b)(iii) if such Swingline Loan was made by the Swingline
         Bank after it received notice from the Administrative Agent of
         the occurrence and continuance of a Default.

                  (iv) The Administrative Agent shall promptly furnish to
         the Swingline Bank copies of each notice of the existence of any
         Default or Event of Default received by it from any Lender or
         any Obligor. 

         2.03  Letters of Credit. Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement, the Revolving Credit Commitments may be utilized, upon the request 
of the Company, in addition to the Loans provided for by Section 2.01(a) 
hereof, by the issuance by the Issuing Bank of letters of credit (together 
with any letters of credit issued by the Issuing Bank under the Existing 
Credit Agreement (the "Existing Chase Letters of Credit"), collectively, 
"Letters of Credit") for account of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries 
(other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a Released Guarantor) as specified 
by the Company, and the Issuing Bank agrees to issue Letters of Credit on the 
terms and conditions set forth herein, provided that in no event shall (i) the
aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liabilities, together with the
aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Credit Loans and Swingline
Loans outstanding, exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit
Commitments as in effect from time to time, (ii) the outstanding
aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liabilities exceed $45,000,000
and (iii) the expiration date of any Letter of Credit extend beyond the
earlier of the Revolving Credit Commitment Termination Date and the date
12 months following the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The following
additional provisions shall apply to Letters of Credit:

                                                               Exhibit 10.1

                  (a) The Company shall give the Administrative Agent at
         least three Business Days' irrevocable prior notice (effective

         upon receipt) specifying the Business Day (which shall be no
         later than 30 days preceding the Revolving Credit Commitment
         Termination Date) each Letter of Credit is to be issued and the
         account party or parties therefor and describing in reasonable
         detail the proposed terms of such Letter of Credit (including
         the beneficiary thereof) and the nature of the transactions or
         obligations proposed to be supported thereby (including whether
         such Letter of Credit is to be a commercial letter of credit or
         a standby letter of credit). Upon receipt of any such notice,
         the Administrative Agent shall advise the Issuing Bank and each
         Lender of the contents thereof. Any amendment, modification or
         supplement to any Letter of Credit hereunder shall be made with
         prior notice to the Administrative Agent and in accordance with
         clause (k) of this Section 2.03.

                  (b) On each day during the period commencing with the
         issuance by the Issuing Bank of any Letter of Credit (or, in the
         case of any Existing Chase Letter of Credit, the Closing Date)
         and until such Letter of Credit shall have expired or been
         terminated, the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Lender shall
         be deemed to be utilized for all purposes of this Agreement in
         an amount equal to such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment
         Percentage of the then undrawn face amount of such Letter of
         Credit. Each Lender (other than the Issuing Bank) agrees that,
         upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit hereunder, it shall
         automatically and without any further action on the part of the
         Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender acquire a
         participation in the Issuing Bank's liability under such Letter
         of Credit in an amount equal to such Lender's Revolving Credit
         Commitment Percentage of such liability, and each Lender (other
         than the Issuing Bank) thereby shall absolutely, unconditionally
         and irrevocably assume, as primary obligor and not as surety,
         and shall be unconditionally obligated to the Issuing Bank to
         pay and discharge when due, its Revolving Credit Commitment
         Percentage of the Issuing Bank's liability under such Letter of
         Credit.

                  (c) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of
         Credit of any demand for payment under such Letter of Credit,
         the Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Company (through the
         Administrative Agent) of the amount to be paid by the Issuing
         Bank as a result of such demand and the date on which payment is
         to be made by the Issuing Bank to such beneficiary in respect of
         such demand. Notwithstanding the identity of the account party
         of any Letter of Credit, the Company hereby unconditionally
         agrees to pay and reimburse the Administrative Agent for account
         of the Issuing Bank for the amount of each demand for payment
         under such Letter of Credit at or prior to the date on which
         payment is to be made by the Issuing Bank to the beneficiary
         thereunder, without presentment, demand, protest or other
         formalities of any kind.

                  (d) Forthwith upon its receipt of a notice referred to
         in paragraph (c) of this Section 2.03, the Company shall advise

         the Administrative Agent whether or not the Company intends to
         borrow hereunder to finance its obligation to reimburse the
         Issuing Bank for the amount of the related demand for payment
         and, if it does, submit a notice of such borrowing as provided
         in Section 4.05 hereof. In the event that the Company fails to
         so advise the Administrative Agent, or if the Company fails to
         reimburse the Issuing Bank for a demand for payment under a
         Letter of Credit by the date of such payment, the Administrative
         Agent shall give each Lender prompt notice of the amount of the
         demand for payment, specifying such Lender's Revolving Credit
         Commitment Percentage of the amount of the related demand for
         payment.

                  (e) Each Lender (other than the Issuing Bank) shall pay
         to the Administrative Agent for account of the Issuing Bank at
         the Principal Office in Dollars and in immediately available
         funds, the amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment
         Percentage of any payment under a Letter of Credit upon notice
         by the Issuing Bank (through the Administrative Agent) to such
         Lender requesting such payment and specifying such amount. Each
         such Lender's obligation to make such payments to the
         Administrative Agent for account of the Issuing Bank under this
         paragraph (e), and the Issuing Bank's right to receive the same,
         shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by
         any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, the
         failure of any other Lender to make its payment under this
         paragraph (e), the

         financial condition of the Company (or any other account party), the
         existence of any Default or the termination of the Revolving Credit
         Commitments (provided that the relevant Letter of Credit shall have
         been issued by the Issuing Bank prior to the Revolving Credit
         Commitment Termination Date). Each such payment to the Issuing Bank
         shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction
         whatsoever.

                  (f) Upon the making of each payment by a Lender to the
         Issuing Bank pursuant to paragraph (e) above in respect of any
         Letter of Credit, such Lender shall, automatically and without
         any further action on the part of the Administrative Agent, the
         Issuing Bank or such Lender, acquire (i) a participation in an
         amount equal to such payment in the Reimbursement Obligation
         owing to the Issuing Bank by the Company hereunder and under the
         Letter of Credit Documents relating to such Letter of Credit and
         (ii) a participation in a percentage equal to such Lender's
         Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage in any interest or other

         amounts payable by the Company hereunder and under such Letter
         of Credit Documents in respect of such Reimbursement Obligation
         (other than the commissions, charges, costs and expenses payable
         to the Issuing Bank pursuant to paragraph (g) of this Section
         2.03). Upon receipt by the Issuing Bank from or for account of
         the Company of any payment in respect of any Reimbursement
         Obligation or any such interest or other amount (including by
         way of setoff or application of proceeds of any collateral
         security) the Issuing Bank shall promptly pay to the
         Administrative Agent for account of each Lender entitled
         thereto, such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of
         such payment, each such payment by the Issuing Bank to be made
         in the same money and funds in which received by the Issuing
         Bank. In the event any payment received by the Issuing Bank and
         so paid to the Lenders hereunder is rescinded or must otherwise
         be returned by the Issuing Bank, each Lender shall, upon the
         request of the Issuing Bank (through the Administrative Agent),
         repay to the Issuing Bank (through the Administrative Agent) the
         amount of such payment paid to such Lender, with interest at the
         rate specified in paragraph (j) of this Section 2.03.

                  (g) The Company shall pay to the Issuing Bank an
         issuance fee on the daily average undrawn amount of each Letter
         of Credit for the period from and including the date of issuance
         of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any Existing Chase
         Letter of Credit, from and including the Closing Date) to and
         including the date such Letter of Credit is drawn in full,
         expires or is terminated, at a rate per annum equal to
         Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans (without giving effect to
         clause (ii) of the definition of "Applicable Margin") as in
         effect from time to time (such issuance fee to be
         non-refundable, to be paid in arrears on each Quarterly Date and
         on the Revolving Credit Commitment Termination Date and to be
         calculated, for any day, after giving effect to any payments
         made under such Letter of Credit on such day). The Issuing Bank
         shall pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Lender
         (other than the Issuing Bank), from time to time at reasonable
         intervals (but in any event at least quarterly), but only to the
         extent actually received from the Company, an amount equal to
         such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of all such
         fees in respect of each Letter of Credit (including, for the
         period from and after the Closing Date, each Chase Letter of
         Credit), including any such fee in respect of any period of any
         renewal or extension thereof. In addition, the Company shall pay
         to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee on the daily average undrawn
         amount of each Letter of Credit for the period from and
         including the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in
         the case of any Existing Chase Letter of Credit, from and
         including the Closing Date) to and including the date such
         Letter of Credit is drawn in full, expires or is terminated, at
         a rate per annum equal to 1/10 of 1% (such fronting fee shall be
         non-refundable, shall be paid in arrears on each Quarterly Date
         and on the Revolving Credit Commitment Termination Date and
         shall be calculated, for any day, after giving effect to any

         payments made under such Letter of Credit on such day) together
         with all commissions, charges, costs and expenses in the amounts
         customarily charged by the Issuing Bank from time to time in
         like circumstances with respect to the issuance of each Letter
         of Credit and drawings and other transactions relating thereto.

                  (h) Promptly following the end of each calendar quarter, the
         Issuing Bank shall deliver (through

         the Administrative Agent) to each Lender and the Company a notice
         describing the aggregate amount of all Letters of Credit issued during
         such quarter. Upon the request of any Lender from time to time, the
         Issuing Bank shall deliver any other information reasonably requested
         by such Lender with respect to each Letter of Credit then outstanding.

                  (i) The issuance by the Issuing Bank of each Letter of
         Credit shall, in addition to the conditions precedent set forth
         in Section 7 hereof, be subject to the conditions precedent that
         (i) such Letter of Credit shall be in such form and contain such
         terms as shall be satisfactory to the Issuing Bank consistent
         with its then current practices and procedures with respect to
         letters of credit of the same type, and shall support such
         transactions as shall be consistent with the Company's ordinary
         course of business and (ii) the Company shall have executed and
         delivered such applications, agreements and other instruments
         relating to such Letter of Credit as the Issuing Bank shall have
         reasonably requested consistent with its then current practices
         and procedures with respect to letters of credit of the same
         type, provided that in the event of any conflict between any
         such application, agreement or other instrument and the
         provisions of this Agreement or any Security Document, the
         provisions of this Agreement and the Security Documents shall
         control.

                  (j) To the extent that any Lender fails to pay any
         amount required to be paid pursuant to paragraph (e) or (f) of
         this Section 2.03 on the due date therefor, such Lender shall
         pay interest to the Issuing Bank (through the Administrative
         Agent) on such amount from and including such due date to but
         excluding the date such payment is made (i) during the period
         from and including such due date to but excluding the date three
         Business Days thereafter, at a rate per annum equal to the
         Federal Funds Rate (as in effect from time to time) and (ii)
         thereafter, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate (as in
         effect from time to time) plus 2%.

                  (k) The issuance by the Issuing Bank of any
         modification or supplement to any Letter of Credit hereunder

         shall be subject to the same conditions applicable under this
         Section 2.03 to the issuance of new Letters of Credit, and no
         such modification or supplement shall be issued hereunder unless
         either (i) the respective Letter of Credit affected thereby
         would have complied with such conditions had it originally been
         issued hereunder in such modified or supplemented form or (ii)
         the Majority Lenders shall have consented thereto.

                  (l) Each Lender agrees that on the Closing Date it
         shall automatically acquire a participation in the Issuing
         Bank's liability under each Existing Chase Letter of Credit in
         an amount equal to such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment
         Percentage of such liability, and each Lender thereby shall
         absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably assume, as primary
         obligor and not as surety, and shall be unconditionally
         obligated to the Issuing Bank to pay and discharge when due, its
         Commitment Percentage of the Issuing Bank's liability under each
         Existing Chase Letter of Credit.

The Company hereby indemnifies and holds harmless each Lender (including
the Issuing Bank) and the Administrative Agent from and against any and
all claims and damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which such
Lender or the Administrative Agent may incur (or which may be claimed
against such Lender or the Administrative Agent by any Person whatsoever)
by reason of or in connection with the execution and delivery or transfer
of or payment or refusal to pay by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of
Credit; provided that the Company shall not be required to indemnify any
Lender or the Administrative Agent for any claims, damages, losses,
liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the extent,
caused by (x) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Issuing
Bank in determining whether a request presented under any Letter of
Credit complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (y) the
Issuing Bank's failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the
presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and
conditions of such Letter of Credit. Nothing in this Section 2.03 is
intended to limit the other obligations of the Company, any Lender or the
Administrative Agent under this Agreement.

         (a) The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
account of each Lender a commitment fee on the daily average unused
amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender (for which
purpose the aggregate amount of any Letter of Credit Liabilities and the
aggregate amount of the Swingline Commitment (whether or not utilized)
shall be deemed to be a pro rata (based on the Revolving Credit
Commitments) use of each Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment), for the
period from and including the Closing Date to but not including the
earlier of the date the Revolving Credit Commitments are terminated and
the Revolving Credit Commitment Termination Date, at a rate per annum

for the failure of any Defaulting Lender to make a Loan to be made by such
Defaulting Lender, and no Lender shall have any obligation to the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender for the failure by such Defaulting Lender to make any
Loan required to be made by such Defaulting Lender. The amounts payable by the
Company at any time hereunder and under the Notes to each Lender shall be a
separate and independent debt and each Lender shall be entitled to protect and
enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement and the Notes, and it shall not
be necessary for any other Lender or the Administrative Agent to consent to, or
be joined as an additional party in, any proceedings for such purposes.

         2.08  Notes

Swingline Note or any continuation thereof; provided that the failure by
the Swingline Bank to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not
affect any of the obligations of the Company hereunder or under the
Swingline Note to make a payment when due.


         (c) The date, amount, Type, interest rate and duration of
Interest Period (if applicable) of each Revolving Credit Loan made by

by it, endorsed by such Lender on the schedule attached to such Revolving
Credit Note or any continuation thereof; provided that the failure of
such Lender to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect
the obligations of the Company to make a payment when due of any amount
owing hereunder or under such Revolving Credit Note in respect of the
Revolving Credit Loans.

         (e) No Lender shall be entitled to have its Revolving Credit
Notes subdivided by exchange for promissory notes of lesser denominations

provided that the Company shall give the Administrative Agent notice of each
such prepayment, Conversion or Continuation as provided in Section 4.05 hereof
(and, upon the prepayment date specified in any such notice of prepayment, the
amount to be prepaid shall become due and payable hereunder). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, and without limiting the rights and remedies of the Lenders under
Section 10 hereof,

in the event that any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Administrative Agent may (and at the request of the Majority Lenders shall)
suspend the right of the Company to borrow any Revolving Credit Loan as a
Eurodollar Loan, to Convert any Revolving Credit Loan into a Eurodollar Loan or
to Continue any Revolving Credit Loan as a Eurodollar Loan, in which event all

the Revolving Credit Loans in an aggregate amount, and the Revolving
Credit Commitments shall be automatically reduced by an amount, equal to
100% of the Net Available Proceeds of such Disposition (together with
100% of the Net Available Proceeds of all prior Dispositions as to which
prepayment has not yet been made under this Section 2.10(a)).

         (b) Equity Issuance. Upon any Equity Issuance (other than any
issuance of Senior Subordinated Debt) that occurs during the continuance

         Credit Loans) or their respective Revolving Credit Loans (in the
         case of Conversions and Continuations of Revolving Credit
         Loans), and Eurodollar Loans having the same Interest Period

         amounts of their respective Revolving Credit Loans of such Type;

                  (c) each payment or prepayment of principal of
         Revolving Credit Loans shall be made for account of the Lenders
         pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal
         amounts of Revolving Credit Loans held by the Lenders; and

prepayment of principal of Revolving Credit Loans shall be in an aggregate
amount equal to $5,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof (borrowings, Conversions or prepayments of or into Revolving Credit
Loans of different Types or, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, having different
Interest Periods at the same time hereunder to be deemed separate borrowings,
Conversions and prepayments for purposes of the foregoing, one for each Type or
Interest Period). Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
the aggregate principal amount of Eurodollar Loans having the same Interest
Period shall be in an amount at least equal to $5,000,000 and, if any Eurodollar
Loans having the same Interest Period would otherwise be in a lesser principal
amount for any period, such Loans shall be Base Rate Loans during such period.

         4.05 Certain Notices. Notices by the Company to the Administrative
Agent of terminations or reductions of Commitments and of borrowings,
Conversions, Continuations and optional prepayments of Revolving Credit Loans,
of Types of Revolving Credit Loans and of the duration of Interest Periods shall
be irrevocable and shall be effective only if received by the Administrative
Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (or 3:00 p.m. in the case of a borrowing or
prepayment of, Conversions into, Continuations as, or the duration of an
Interest Period for, Eurodollar Loans) New York time on the number of Business
Days prior to the date of the relevant termination, reduction, borrowing,
Conversion, Continuation or optional prepayment or the first day of such
Interest Period specified below:

                                                                 Number of
                                                                  Business
                  Notice                                         Days Prior

         Termination or reduction
         of Commitments                                            Three

         Borrowing or prepayment of,
         or Conversions into,
         Base Rate Loans                                         Same Day

         Borrowing or prepayment of,
         Conversions into, Continuations
         as, or duration of Interest
         Period for, Eurodollar Loans                              Three


Each such notice of termination or reduction shall specify the amount of
the Commitments to be terminated or reduced. Each such notice of
borrowing, Conversion, Continuation or optional prepayment shall specify
the Type of each Revolving Credit Loan to be borrowed, Converted,
Continued or prepaid, the date of borrowing, Conversion, Continuation or
optional prepayment (which shall be a Business Day), and, if any such
Revolving Credit Loan is to be borrowed or Continued as, or Converted

into, a Eurodollar Loan, the duration of the Interest Period for such
Revolving Credit Loan. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Lenders of the contents of each such notice. In the event that the
Company fails to select the Type of Revolving Credit Loan, or the
duration of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loan,
within the time period and otherwise as provided in this Section 4.05,
such Revolving Credit Loan (if outstanding as a Eurodollar Loan) will be
automatically Converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then
current Interest Period for such Revolving Credit Loan or (if outstanding
as a Base Rate Loan) will remain as, or (if not then outstanding) will be
made as, a Base Rate Loan.

         4.06 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent. Unless the 
Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Lender or the Company (the 
"Payor") prior to the date on which the Payor is to make payment to the 
Administrative Agent of (in the case of a Lender) the proceeds of a Loan to be 
made by such Lender, or an amount payable in respect of a participation in a 
Letter of Credit Liability to be acquired by such Lender, hereunder or (in the 
case of the Company) a payment to the Administrative Agent for account of one 
or more of the Lenders

hereunder (such payment being herein called the "Required Payment"), which
notice shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor does not intend to make
the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may
assume that the Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such
assumption (but shall not be required to), make the amount thereof available to
the intended recipient(s) on such date; and, if the Payor has not in fact made
the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient(s) of such
payment shall, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so made
available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the
period commencing on the date (the "Advance Date") such amount was so made
available by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent
recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate for
such day and, if such recipient(s) shall fail promptly to make such payment, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount, on demand, from
the Payor, together with interest as aforesaid, provided that if the
recipient(s) shall fail to return, and the Payor shall fail to make, the
Required Payment to the Administrative Agent within three Business Days of the
Advance Date, then the Payor and the recipient(s) shall each be obligated to pay
interest on the Required Payment as follows:

                  (a) if the Required Payment shall represent a payment
         to be made by the Company to the Lenders, the Company and the
         recipient(s) shall each be obligated retroactively to the
         Advance Date to pay interest in respect of the Required Payment
         at the Post-Default Rate (and, in case the recipient(s) shall
         return the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, without
         limiting the obligation of the Company under Section 3.02 hereof

         to pay interest to such recipient(s) at the Post-Default Rate in
         respect of the Required Payment);

                  (b) if the Required Payment shall represent proceeds of
         a Loan to be made by the Lenders to the Company, the Payor and
         the Company shall each be obligated retroactively to the Advance
         Date to pay interest in respect of the Required Payment at the
         rate of interest provided for such Required Payment pursuant to
         Section 3.02 hereof (and, in case the Company shall return the
         Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, without limiting
         any claim the Company may have against the Payor in respect of
         the Required Payment); and

                  (c) if the Required Payment shall represent a payment
         to be made by a Lender to the Issuing Bank in respect of a
         participation in a Letter of Credit Liability to be acquired by
         such Lender, the Payor shall be obligated retroactively to the
         Advance Date to pay interest in respect of the Required Payment
         at the rate of interest provided for such Required Payment
         pursuant to Section 3.02 hereof with respect to Base Rate Loans.

Nothing in this Section 4.06 shall require the Company to pay any greater
amount in respect of principal of any Loan, interest on any Loan or any
Letter of Credit Liability than it would be required to pay hereunder in
the absence of this Section 4.06.

         4.07  Sharing of Payments, Etc.

         (a) The Company agrees that, in addition to (and without
limitation of) any right of set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim a
Lender or the Swingline Bank may otherwise have, each Lender and the
Swingline Bank shall be entitled, at its option, to offset balances held
by it for account of the Company at any of its offices, in Dollars or in
any other currency, against any principal of or interest on any of such
Lender's Revolving Credit Loans, any of the Swingline Loans, any of the
Reimbursement Obligations or any other amount payable to such Lender or
the Swingline Bank (as the case may be) hereunder, that is not paid when
due (regardless of whether such balances are then due to the Company), in
which case it shall promptly thereafter notify the Company and the
Administrative Agent thereof, provided that such Lender's or the
Swingline Bank's (as the case may be) failure to give such notice shall
not affect the validity thereof.

         (b) If any Lender shall obtain from any Obligor payment of any
principal of or interest on any Loan or 

                                     -30-

Letter of Credit Liability owing to it or payment of any other amount under this
Agreement or any other Basic Document through the exercise of any right of

set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim or similar right or otherwise (other than
from the Administrative Agent as provided herein), and, as a result of such
payment, such Lender shall have received a greater percentage of the principal
of or interest on the Loans or Letter of Credit Liabilities or such other
amounts then due hereunder or thereunder by such Obligor to such Lender than the
percentage received by any other Lender, it shall promptly purchase from such
other Lenders participations in (or, if and to the extent specified by such
Lender, direct interests in) the Loans or Letter of Credit Liabilities or such
other amounts, respectively, owing to such other Lenders (or in interest due
thereon, as the case may be) in such amounts, and make such other adjustments
from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end that all the Lenders shall
share the benefit of such excess payment (net of any expenses that may be
incurred by such Lender in obtaining or preserving such excess payment) pro rata
in accordance with the unpaid principal of and/or interest on the Loans or
Letter of Credit Liabilities or such other amounts, respectively, owing to each
of the Lenders. To such end all the Lenders shall make appropriate adjustments
among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such
payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored.

         (c) The Company agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a
participation (or direct interest) pursuant to the foregoing clause (b)
may exercise all rights of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or
similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such
Lender were a direct holder of Loans or other amounts (as the case may
be) owing to such Lender in the amount of such participation.

         (d) Nothing contained herein shall require any Lender to
exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Lender to
exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with
respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of any Obligor. If, under
any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender
receives a secured claim in lieu of a set-off to which this Section 4.07
applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its
rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the
rights of the Lenders entitled under this Section 4.07 to share in the
benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.


         Section 5.  Yield Protection, Etc.

         5.01  Additional Costs

         (a) The Company shall pay directly to each Lender from time to
time such amounts as such Lender may reasonably and in good faith
determine to be necessary to compensate such Lender for any increased
costs that such Lender reasonably and in good faith determines are
attributable to its making or maintaining of any Eurodollar Loans or its
obligation to make any Eurodollar Loans hereunder, or any reduction in
any amount receivable by such Lender hereunder in respect of any of such
Loans or such obligation (such increases in costs and reductions in
amounts receivable being herein called "Additional Costs"), resulting
from any Regulatory Change that:

                  (i) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts

         payable to such Lender under this Agreement or its Note in
         respect of any of such Loans (other than taxes imposed on or
         measured by the overall net income of such Lender or of its
         Applicable Lending Office for any of such Loans by the
         jurisdiction in which such Lender has its principal office or
         such Applicable Lending Office); or

                  (ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit
         or similar requirements (other than, in the case of any Lender
         for any period as to which the Company is required to pay any
         amount under paragraph (e) below, the reserves against
         "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Regulation D therein referred
         to) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or
         any deposits with or other liabilities of, such Lender
         (including, without limitation, any of such Loans or any
         deposits referred to in the definition of "Eurodollar Rate" in
         Section 1.01 hereof), or any commitment of such Lender hereunder
         (including, without limitation, the Commitments of such Lender);
         or

                                     -31-

                                                                Exhibit 10.1

                  (iii) imposes any other condition affecting this
         Agreement or its Note (or any of such extensions of credit or
         liabilities) or its Commitments.

If any Lender requests compensation from the Company under this Section
5.01(a), the Company may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender thereafter
to make or Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into
Eurodollar Loans, until the Regulatory Change giving rise to such request
ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 5.04
hereof shall be applicable), provided that such suspension shall not
affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested
to the extent such Lender certifies that such compensation is still
payable notwithstanding such suspension.

         (b) Without limiting the effect of the provisions of paragraph
(a) of this Section 5.01, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory
Change, any Lender either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or
measured by the excess above a specified level of the amount of a
category of deposits or other liabilities of such Lender that includes
deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Eurodollar Loans is
determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of extensions of
credit or other assets of such Lender that includes Eurodollar Loans or
(ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of
liabilities or assets that it may hold, then, if such Lender so elects by
notice to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the
obligation of such Lender to make or Continue, or to Convert Base Rate
Loans into, Eurodollar Loans hereunder shall be suspended until such

Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of
Section 5.04 hereof shall be applicable) and the Company shall not be
obligated to pay any Additional Costs for which the Lender ceases to be
liable or to incur.

         (c) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of
this Section 5.01 (but without duplication), the Company shall pay
directly to each Lender from time to time on request such amounts as such
Lender may determine reasonably and in good faith to be necessary to
compensate such Lender (or, without duplication, the bank holding company
of which such Lender is a subsidiary) for any costs that it determines
reasonably and in good faith are attributable to the maintenance by such
Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office or such bank holding company),
pursuant to any law or regulation or any interpretation, directive or
request (whether or not having the force of law and whether or not
failure to comply therewith would be unlawful) of any court or
governmental or monetary authority

                  (i)  following any Regulatory Change, or

                  (ii) implementing any risk-based capital guideline or
         other requirement (whether or not having the force of law and
         whether or not the failure to comply therewith would be
         unlawful) heretofore or hereafter issued by any government or
         governmental or supervisory authority implementing at the
         national level the Basel Accord (including, without limitation,
         the Final Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Board of
         Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 C.F.R. Part 208,
         Appendix A; 12 C.F.R. Part 225, Appendix A) and the Final
         Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Office of the Comptroller
         of the Currency (12 C.F.R. Part 3, Appendix A)),

of capital in respect of its Commitments or Loans (such compensation to
include, without limitation, an amount equal to any reduction of the rate
of return on assets or equity of such Lender (or any Applicable Lending
Office or such bank holding company) to a level below that which such
Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office or such bank holding company)
could have achieved but for such law, regulation, interpretation,
directive or request). For purposes of this Section 5.01(c) and Section
5.06 hereof, "Basel Accord" shall mean the proposals for risk-based
capital framework described by the Basel Committee on Banking Regulations
and Supervisory Practices in its paper entitled "International
Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards" dated July
1988, as amended, modified and supplemented and in effect from time to
time or any replacement thereof.

         (d) Each Lender shall notify the Company and the Administrative
Agent of any event occurring after the 

                                     -32-

date of this Agreement entitling such Lender to compensation under paragraph (a)
or (c) of this Section 5.01 as promptly as practicable, but in any event within
30 days, after such Lender obtains actual knowledge thereof; provided that (i)
if any Lender fails to give such notice within 30 days after it obtains actual
knowledge of such an event, such Lender shall, with respect to compensation
payable pursuant to this Section 5.01 in respect of any costs resulting from
such event, only be entitled to payment under this Section 5.01 for costs
incurred from and after the date 30 days prior to the date that such Lender does
give such notice and (ii) each Lender will designate a different Applicable
Lending Office for the Loans of such Lender affected by such event if such
designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation
and will not, in the reasonable opinion of such Lender, be disadvantageous to
such Lender, except that such Lender shall have no obligation to designate an
Applicable Lending Office located in the United States of America. Each Lender
will furnish to the Company a certificate setting forth the basis and amount of
each request by such Lender for compensation under paragraph (a) or (c) of this
Section 5.01. Determinations and allocations by any Lender for purposes of this
Section 5.01 of the effect of any Regulatory Change pursuant to paragraph (a) or
(b) of this Section 5.01, or of the effect of capital maintained pursuant to
paragraph (c) of this Section 5.01, on its costs or rate of return of
maintaining Loans or its obligation to make Loans, or on amounts receivable by
it in respect of Loans, and of the amounts required to compensate such Lender
under this Section 5.01, shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations
and allocations are made on a reasonable basis and absent demonstrable error.

         (e) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing, the Company
shall pay to each Lender on the last day of each Interest Period so long
as such Lender is maintaining reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities"
under Regulation D (or, unless the provisions of paragraph (b) above are
applicable, so long as such Lender is, by reason of any Regulatory
Change, maintaining reserves against any other category of liabilities
which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on
Eurodollar Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or against
any category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender which
includes any Eurodollar Loans) an additional amount (determined by such
Lender and notified to the Company through the Administrative Agent)
equal to the product of the following for each Eurodollar Loan for each
day during such Interest Period:
                  (i)  the principal amount of such Eurodollar Loan outstanding
         on such day; and

                  (ii) the remainder of (x) a fraction the numerator of
         which is the rate (expressed as a decimal) at which interest
         accrues on such Eurodollar Loan for such Interest Period as
         provided in this Agreement (less the Applicable Margin) and the
         denominator of which is one minus the effective rate (expressed
         as a decimal) at which such reserve requirements are imposed on
         such Lender on such day minus (y) such numerator; and

                  (iii)  1/360.

         5.02 Limitations on Types of Loans. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of any Eurodollar Rate for

any Interest Period:

                  (a) the Administrative Agent determines reasonably and
         in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive, that
         quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred
         to in the definition of "Eurodollar Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof
         are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the
         relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates of
         interest for Eurodollar Loans as provided herein; or

                  (b) the Majority Lenders determine reasonably and in
         good faith, which determination shall be conclusive, and notify
         the Administrative Agent that the relevant rates of interest
         referred to in the definition of "Eurodollar Rate" in Section
         1.01 hereof upon the basis of which the rate of interest for
         Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period is to be determined
         are not likely to adequately cover the cost to such Lenders of
         making or maintaining Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give the Company and each Lender
prompt notice thereof and, so long as such 

                                     -33-

condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to make
additional Eurodollar Loans, to Continue Eurodollar Loans or to Convert Base
Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans, and the Company shall, on the last day(s) of
the then current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding Eurodollar Loans, either
prepay such Loans or Convert such Loans into Base Rate Loans in accordance with
Section 2.09 hereof.

         5.03 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its Applicable Lending
Office to honor its obligation to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans hereunder,
then such Lender shall promptly notify the Company thereof (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) and such Lender's obligation to make or Continue, or to
Convert Loans of any other Type into, Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until
such time as such Lender may again make and maintain Eurodollar Loans (in which
case the provisions of Section 5.04 hereof shall be applicable).

         5.04 Treatment of Affected Loans. If the obligation of any Lender to
make Eurodollar Loans or to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into,
Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.03 hereof,
such Lender's Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate
Loans on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for Eurodollar
Loans (or, in the case of a Conversion required by Section 5.01(b) or 5.03
hereof, on such earlier date as such Lender may specify to the Company with a
copy to the Administrative Agent) and, unless and until such Lender gives notice
as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 5.01 or 5.03
hereof that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:


                  (a) to the extent that such Lender's Eurodollar Loans
         have been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of
         principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lender's
         Eurodollar Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate
         Loans; and

                  (b) all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued
         by such Lender as Eurodollar Loans shall be made or Continued
         instead as Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate Loans of such
         Lender that would otherwise be Converted into Eurodollar Loans
         shall remain as Base Rate Loans.

If such Lender gives notice to the Company with a copy to the
Administrative Agent that the circumstances specified in Section 5.01 or
5.03 hereof that gave rise to the Conversion or non-Continuation of such
Lender's Eurodollar Loans pursuant to this Section 5.04 no longer exist
(which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing
to exist) at a time when Eurodollar Loans made by other Lenders are
outstanding, such Lender's Base Rate Loans shall be automatically
Converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s)
for such outstanding Eurodollar Loans, to the extent necessary so that,
after giving effect thereto, all Revolving Credit Loans held by the
Lenders holding Eurodollar Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as
to principal amounts, Types and Interest Periods) in accordance with
their respective Commitments.

         5.05 Compensation. The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent
for account of each Lender, upon the request of such Lender through the
Administrative Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the
reasonable opinion of such Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost or
expense that such Lender determines is attributable to:

                  (a) any payment, mandatory or optional prepayment or
         Conversion of a Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender for any
         reason (including, without limitation, the acceleration of the
         Loans pursuant to Section 10 hereof) on a date other than the
         last day of the Interest Period for such Loan;

                  (b) any failure by the Company for any reason
         (including, without limitation, the failure of any of the
         conditions precedent specified in Section 7 hereof to be
         satisfied) to borrow a Eurodollar Loan from such Lender on the
         date for such borrowing specified in the relevant notice of
         borrowing given under Section 2.02 hereof; or

                                     -34-

                                                                 Exhibit 10.1

                  (c) any failure for any reason (including, without
         limitation, as provided in Section 5.02 or 5.03 hereof, but

         excluding as a result of the failure by such Lender to make a
         Loan it is obligated to make hereunder) of a Loan of such Lender
         to be Continued as or Converted into a Eurodollar Loan on the
         date for such Continuation or Conversion specified in the
         relevant notice given under Section 2.09 hereof.

Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such compensation
shall include an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount of
interest that otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so
paid, prepaid or Converted or not borrowed, Continued or Converted for
the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, Conversion or
failure to borrow, Continue or Convert to the last day of the then
current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to
borrow, Continue or Convert, the Interest Period for such Loan that would
have commenced on the date specified for such borrowing, Continuation or
Conversion) at the applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided for
herein (less, in the case of any failure to borrow a Eurodollar Loan, or
to Continue a Loan as or to Convert a Loan into a Eurodollar Loan, solely
as a result of the limitation set forth in Section 5.02 or 5.03 hereof,
the Applicable Margin for such Loan) over (ii) the amount of interest
that otherwise would have accrued on such principal amount at a rate per
annum equal to the interest component of the amount such Lender would
have bid in the London interbank market for Dollar deposits of leading
banks in amounts comparable to such principal amount and with maturities
comparable to such period (as reasonably determined by such Lender).

         5.06 Additional Costs in Respects of Letters of Credit. Without
limiting the obligations of the Company under Section 5.01 hereof (but without
duplication), if as a result of any Regulatory Change or any risk-based capital
guideline or other requirement heretofore or hereafter issued by any government
or governmental or supervisory authority implementing at the national level the
Basel Accord, there shall be imposed, modified or deemed applicable any tax,
reserve, special deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement against or
with respect to or measured by reference to Letters of Credit issued or to be
issued hereunder and the result shall be to increase the cost to any Lender or
Lenders of issuing (or purchasing participations in) or maintaining its
obligation hereunder to issue (or purchase participations in) any Letter of
Credit or reduce any amount receivable by any Lender hereunder in respect of any
Letter of Credit (which increases in cost, or reductions in amount receivable,
shall be the result of such Lender's or Lenders' reasonable allocation of the
aggregate of such increases or reductions resulting from such event), then, upon
demand by such Lender or Lenders (through the Administrative Agent), the Company
shall pay immediately to the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender or
Lenders, from time to time as specified by such Lender or Lenders (through the
Administrative Agent), such additional amounts as shall be sufficient to
compensate such Lender or Lenders (through the Administrative Agent) for such
increased costs or reductions in amount. A statement as to such increased costs
or reductions in amount incurred by any such Lender or Lenders, submitted by
such Lender or Lenders to the Company shall be conclusive in the absence of
demonstrable error as to the amount thereof.

         5.07  U.S. Taxes

         (a) The Company agrees to pay to each Lender that is not a U.S.

Person such additional amounts as are necessary in order that the net
payment of any amount due to such non-U.S. Person hereunder after
deduction for or withholding in respect of any U.S. Tax imposed with
respect to such payment (or in lieu thereof, payment of such U.S. Tax by
such non-U.S. Person), will not be less than the amount stated herein to
be then due and payable, provided that the foregoing obligation to pay
such additional amounts shall not apply:

              (i) to any payment to a Lender hereunder unless such Lender
         is, on the date hereof (or on the date it becomes a Lender as
         provided in Section 12.06(b) hereof) and on the date of any
         change in the Applicable Lending Office of such Lender, either
         entitled to submit a Form 1001 (relating to such Lender and
         entitling it to a complete exemption from withholding on all
         interest to be received by it hereunder in respect of the Loans)
         or Form 4224 (relating to all interest to be received by such
         Lender hereunder in respect of the Loans), or

             (ii) to any U.S. Tax imposed solely by reason of the failure
         by such non-U.S. Person to comply with applicable certification,
         information, documentation or other reporting requirements
         concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connections
         with the United States of America of such non-U.S. Person if
         such compliance is required by statute or regulation of the
         United States of America as a precondition to relief or
         exemption from such U.S. Tax.

For the purposes of this Section 5.07(a), (w) "Form 1001" shall mean Form
1001 (Ownership, Exemption, or Reduced Rate Certificate) of the
Department of the Treasury of the United States of America, (x) "Form
4224" shall mean Form 4224 (Exemption from Withholding of Tax on Income
Effectively Connected with the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the
United States) of the Department of the Treasury of the United States of
America (or in relation to either such Form such successor and related
forms as may from time to time be adopted by the relevant taxing
authorities of the United States of America to document a claim to which
such Form relates), (y) "U.S. Person" shall mean a citizen, national or
resident of the United States of America, a corporation, partnership or
other entity created or organized in or under any laws of the United
States of America, or any estate or trust that is subject to Federal
income taxation regardless of the source of its income and (z) "U.S.
Taxes" shall mean any present or future tax, assessment or other charge
or levy imposed by or on behalf of the United States of America or any
taxing authority thereof or therein.

         (b) Within 30 days after paying any amount to the Administrative

Agent or any Lender from which it is required by law to make any
deduction or withholding, and within 30 days after it is required by law
to remit such deduction or withholding to any relevant taxing or other
authority, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent for
delivery to such non-U.S. Person evidence satisfactory to such Person of
such deduction, withholding or payment (as the case may be).
         (c) Each Lender that is a Lender on the Closing Date and is not
a U.S. Person agrees to furnish to the Administrative Agent (with a copy
to the Company) on the Closing Date an appropriately completed Form 1001
or Form 4224 and each Lender that becomes a Lender after the Closing Date
pursuant to Section 12.06(b) hereof and is not a U.S. Person agrees to
furnish to the Administrative Agent (with a copy to the Company),
promptly after becoming a Lender, an appropriately completed Form 1001 or
Form 4224.

         5.08  Replacement of Certain Lenders

         (a) Provided that no Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Company may, at any time, replace any Lender (i) that has
requested compensation from the Company pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.06
hereof or (ii) that has given the Company the notice contemplated by
Section 5.03 hereof or (iii) which is not a U.S. Person and as to which
the Company is obligated to make payments under Section 5.07 hereof, by
giving not less than ten Business Days' prior notice to the
Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify such Lender), that it
intends to replace such Lender with one or more banks or other financial
institutions (including, but not limited to, any other Lender under this
Agreement) selected by the Company that (a) have agreed to replace such
Lender as provided in this Section 5.08 and (b) are reasonably acceptable
to the Administrative Agent (the Administrative Agent agreeing not to
unreasonably delay notifying the Company whether a proposed replacement
lender is acceptable). Upon the effective date of any replacement under
this Section 5.08 and as a condition to such replacement, the replacement
lender or lenders shall pay to the Lender being replaced the principal of
the Loans held by such Lender and the Company shall pay to such Lender
all accrued interest on such Loans and all other amounts owing to such
Lender hereunder (including any amounts payable under Section 5.05 hereof
as if such Loans were being prepaid by the Company), whereupon each such
replacement bank (if not already a Lender) shall become a "Lender" for
all purposes of this Agreement.

         (b) If any Lender that is a Reference Bank (or a Wholly Owned
Subsidiary of a Reference Bank, as the case may be) shall be replaced
pursuant to this Section 5.08, such Reference Bank shall thereupon cease
to be a Reference Bank and, if as a result of the foregoing, there shall
only be two Reference Banks remaining, then the Administrative Agent
(after consultation with the Company) shall, by notice to the Company and
the Banks, designate another

Lender as a Reference Bank, so that there shall at all times be three Reference
Banks.

         5.09 Consistent Treatment. Each Lender shall apply the provisions of
this Section 5 in substantially the same manner, and to the same extent, as such
Lender applies comparable provisions applicable to similarly-situated borrowers.


         Section 6.  Guarantee

         6.01 Guarantee. The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby jointly and severally
guarantee to each Lender and the Administrative Agent and their
respective successors and assigns the prompt payment in full when due
(whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the
principal of and interest on the Revolving Credit Loans made by the
Lenders to, and the Revolving Credit Note held by each Lender of, and the
principal of and interest on the Swingline Loans made by the Swingline
Bank to, and the Swingline Note of, the Company and all other amounts
(including, without limitation, Reimbursement Obligations) from time to
time owing to the Lenders or the Administrative Agent by the Company
under this Agreement and under the Notes and by any Obligor under any of
the other Basic Documents, in each case strictly in accordance with the
terms thereof (and giving effect to any amendment or modification of such
terms), including all amounts which would become due but for the
operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code and the operation of Sections 502(b) and 506(b) of the Bankruptcy
Code (such obligations being herein collectively called the "Guaranteed
Obligations"). The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby further jointly and
severally agree that if the Company shall fail to pay in full when due
(whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the
Guaranteed Obligations, the Subsidiary Guarantors will promptly pay the
same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of
any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at
extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the
terms of such extension or renewal.

         6.02 Obligations Unconditional. The obligations of the Subsidiary
Guarantors under Section 6.01 hereof are absolute and unconditional, joint and
several, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or
enforceability of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement, the Notes
or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any
substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any
of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or
guarantor, it being the intent of this Section 6.02 that the obligations of each
of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional,
joint and several, under any and all circumstances. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more
of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of any of the
Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder, which liabilities shall remain absolute and

unconditional as described above:

                  (i) at any time or from time to time, without notice to
         the Subsidiary Guarantors, the time for any performance of or
         compliance with any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be
         extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived;

                  (ii) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions
         of this Agreement or the Notes or any other agreement or
         instrument referred to herein or therein shall be done or
         omitted;

                  (iii) the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations
         shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall
         be modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any
         right under this Agreement or the Notes or any other agreement
         or instrument referred to herein or therein shall be waived or
         any other guarantee of any of the Guaranteed Obligations
         (including the Guarantee hereunder of any other Subsidiary
         Guarantor) or any security therefor shall be released or
         exchanged in whole or in part or 


                                     -37-

                                                               Exhibit 10.1

         otherwise dealt with; or

                  (iv) any lien or security interest granted to, or in
         favor of, the Administrative Agent or any Lender or Lenders as
         security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be
         perfected.

The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence, presentment,
demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any
requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Lender exhaust any
right, power or remedy or proceed against the Company under this
Agreement or the Notes or any other agreement or instrument referred to
herein or therein, or against any other Person under any other guarantee
of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations.

         6.03 Reinstatements. The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors 
under this Section 6 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that
for any reason any payment by or on behalf of the Company in respect of the
Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder
of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in
bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise and the Subsidiary Guarantors jointly
and severally agree that they will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each
Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or
such Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any

such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that
such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment
under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

         6.04 Subrogation. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby jointly and
severally agrees that until the payment and satisfaction in full of all
Guaranteed Obligations and the expiration and termination of the Commitments of
the Lenders under this Agreement, they shall not exercise any right or remedy
arising by reason of any performance by them of their guarantee in Section 6.01
hereof, whether by subrogation or otherwise, against the Company or any other
guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the
Guaranteed Obligations.

         6.05 Remedies. The Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree
that, as between the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Lenders, the obligations of
the Company under this Agreement and the Notes may be declared to be forthwith
due and payable as provided in Section 10 hereof (and shall be deemed to have
become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said
Section 10) for purposes of Section 6.01 hereof notwithstanding any stay,
injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations
from becoming automatically due and payable) as against the Company and that, in
the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become
automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable
by the Company) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary
Guarantors for purposes of said Section 6.01.

         6.06 Continuing Guarantee.  The guarantee in this Section 6 is a
continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations whenever
arising.

         6.07 Rights of Contribution. The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agree,
as between themselves, that if any Subsidiary Guarantor (an "Excess Funding
Guarantor") shall pay Guaranteed Obligations in excess of such Excess Funding
Guarantor's Pro Rata Share (as defined below) of such Guaranteed Obligations
(such excess payment, an "Excess Payment"), each other Subsidiary Guarantor
shall, on demand of such Excess Funding Guarantor (but subject to the next
sentence hereof), pay to such Excess Funding Guarantor an amount equal to such
other Subsidiary Guarantor's Pro Rata Share (such Pro Rata Share, for the
purpose of determining the amount due to the Excess Funding Guarantor under this
Section 6.07, to be determined without reference to the Excess Funding
Guarantor) of such Excess Payment. The payment obligation of each other
Subsidiary Guarantor to an Excess Funding Guarantor under this Section 6.07
shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in
full of the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the other provisions
of this Section 6, and such Excess Funding Guarantor shall not exercise any
right or remedy with respect to such Excess Payment until payment and 
satisfaction 

                                    -38-

                                                                Exhibit 10.1

in full of all of such obligations. For the purposes hereof, "Pro Rata Share"
shall mean, with respect to each Subsidiary Guarantor, the ratio (expressed as a

percentage and determined as of the Closing Date) of (a) the amount by which the
aggregate value of all of the Properties of such Subsidiary Guarantor at their
present fair saleable value exceeds the amount of all of the debts and
liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated
liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under
this Section 6) of such Subsidiary Guarantor to (b) the amount by which the
aggregate value of all of the Properties of all of the Subsidiary Guarantors at
their present fair saleable value exceeds the amount of all of the debts and
liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated
liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under
this Section 6) of all of the Subsidiary Guarantors.

         6.08 Limitation on Guarantee Obligations. In any action or proceeding
involving any state corporate law, or any state or Federal bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors
generally, if the obligations of any Subsidiary Guarantor under Section 6.01
hereof would otherwise, taking into account the provisions of Section 6.07
hereof, be held or determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, or
subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of
its liability under said Section 6.01, then, notwithstanding any other provision
hereof to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further
action by such Subsidiary Guarantor, any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any
other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount which
is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors
as determined in such action or proceeding.

         6.09 Release of Guarantors. A Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released
from its guarantee obligations under Section 6 hereof, and its Properties shall
be released from the Lien of the Security Agreement, upon the request of the
Company, so long as (a) such Subsidiary Guarantor is not B. Dalton Bookseller,
Inc., Barnes & Noble Booksellers, Inc. or Doubleday Book Shops, Inc. and (b) the
aggregate fair market value of the assets of all such Released Guarantors
calculated as of the time of the respective release does not exceed
$150,000,000. In the event that any Subsidiary Guarantor is so released, from
and after the date of such release:

                  (i) all financial reports delivered pursuant to this
         Agreement shall be prepared as if such Subsidiary was not a
         Subsidiary of the Company (and, in addition, the Company shall
         furnish the financial reports currently required under Section
         9.01(a) and 9.01(c)); and

                  (ii) all covenants in Sections 9.10 and 9.11 hereof
         shall be calculated as if such Subsidiary was not a Subsidiary
         of the Company.


         Section 7.  Conditions Precedent.

         7.01 Initial Extension of Credit. The obligation of any Lender or the
Swingline Bank to make its initial extension of credit hereunder (whether by
making a Loan or issuing a Letter of Credit) is subject to (i) the condition
precedent that such extension of credit shall be made on or before November 26,
1997 and (ii) the receipt by the Administrative Agent of the following

                      (ii) for each Obligor, a certificate of the
                  Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of such Obligor,

                  to which such Obligor is or is intended to be a party
                  and the extensions of credit hereunder, and that such
                  resolutions have not been modified, rescinded or
                  amended and are in full force and effect, (C) that the
                  charter of such Obligor has not been amended since the

good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization; (b) has

necessary and where failure so to qualify could, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

of the Lenders the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries as at February 1, 1997, and the related consolidated

Consolidated Subsidiaries as at August 2, 1997 and the related unaudited
consolidated statements of income and cash flows of the Company and the
Consolidated Subsidiaries for the six-month period ended on such date. Such
financial statements are complete and correct and fairly present the
consolidated financial condition of the Company and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries as at said date and the consolidated results of their operations
for the fiscal year ended on said date, all in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and practices applied on a consistent basis. None
of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has on the date hereof any material
contingent liabilities, liabilities for taxes, unusual forward or long-term
commitments or unrealized or anticipated losses from any unfavorable
commitments, except as referred to or reflected or provided for in said
financial statements (or in the notes thereto) as at said date. Since February

condition or operations of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken

proceedings by or before any governmental or regulatory authority or agency, now
pending or (to the knowledge of the Company) threatened against the Company or

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

         8.04 No Breach. None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the Notes and the other Basic Documents, the consummation of the
transactions herein and therein contemplated or compliance with the terms and
provisions hereof and thereof will conflict with or result in a breach of, or

require any consent under, the charter or by-laws of any Obligor, or any
applicable law or regulation, or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any
court or governmental authority or agency, or any agreement or instrument to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them
or any of their Property is bound or to which any of them is subject, or
constitute a default under any such agreement or instrument, or (except for the
Liens created pursuant to the Security Documents) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien upon any material Property of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any such agreement or instrument.

         8.05 Action. Each Obligor has all necessary corporate power, authority
and legal right to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each of
the Basic Documents to which it is a party; the execution, delivery and
performance by each Obligor of each of the Basic Documents to which it is a
party have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on its part
(including, without limitation, any required shareholder approvals); and this
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each Obligor and
constitutes, and each of the Notes and the other Basic Documents when executed
and delivered by each Obligor party thereto (in the case of the Notes, for
value) will constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Obligor
party thereto, enforceable against such Obligors in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws of general applicability affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights and (b) the application of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law).

         8.06 Approvals. No authorizations, approvals or consents of, and no
filings or registrations with, any governmental or regulatory authority or
agency, or any securities exchange, are necessary for the execution, delivery or
performance by any Obligor of the Basic Documents to which it is a party or for
the legality, validity or enforceability hereof or thereof, except for filings
and recordings in respect of the Liens created pursuant to the Security
Documents.

         8.07 Use of Credit. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
(other than Unrestricted Subsidiaries) is engaged principally, or as one of its
important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose,
whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying Margin Stock,
and no part of the proceeds of any extension of credit hereunder will be used to
buy or carry any Margin Stock.

Consolidated Subsidiaries have filed all Federal income tax returns and all

respect of taxes and other governmental charges are, in the opinion of the
Company, adequate.

(other than Unrestricted Subsidiaries) has obtained all permits, licenses and
other authorizations required under all applicable Environmental Laws to carry
on its business as now being or as proposed to be conducted, except to the
extent failure to have any such permit, license or authorization would not,

         notice), to examine, copy and make extracts from its books and
         records, to inspect any of its Properties, and to discuss its

         reasonably requested (as to both the manner of such examination,
         copying, extracting, inspection or discussion, and the scope
         thereof) by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case
         may be).

         9.04 Insurance. The Company will, and will cause each of its

the sale of such real property and (ii) the proceeds of any such sale
need not be applied to the obligations of the Company hereunder.

Guarantor hereunder, the Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, cause such Subsidiary (a) to execute and deliver a written instrument in
form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent pursuant to which
such Subsidiary shall become a "Subsidiary Guarantor" and, thereby, an "Obligor"
hereunder and (b) to deliver such proof of corporate action, incumbency of

delivered by each Obligor pursuant to Section 7.01 hereof on the Closing Date or
as the Majority Lenders or the Administrative Agent shall have reasonably
requested.

adverse effect on the interests of the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders.

         (b) The Company will not consent to any modification, supplement
or waiver of any of the provisions of the License Agreement that would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the interests

Investment Grade, the Company will not, and will not permit any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Unrestricted Subsidiaries and Released Guarantors) to,

face value thereof, any of their notes or accounts receivable (or any portion
thereof), except for compromises made in the ordinary course of business.

         Indebtedness referred to in paragraph (a) above); or any event
         specified in any note, agreement, indenture or other document
         evidencing or relating to any such Indebtedness or any event specified
         in any Interest Rate Protection Agreement shall occur if the effect of
         such event is to cause, or (with the giving of any notice or the lapse
         of time or both) to permit the holder or holders of such Indebtedness
         (or a trustee or agent on behalf of such holder or holders) to cause,
         such Indebtedness to become due, or to be prepaid in full (whether by
         redemption, purchase, offer to purchase or otherwise), prior to its
         stated maturity or to have the interest rate thereon reset to a level
         so that securities evidencing such Indebtedness trade at a level
         specified in relation to the par value thereof or, in the case of an
         Interest Rate Protection Agreement, to permit the payments owing under

         or deemed made herein or in any other Basic Document (or in any

         any certificate furnished to any Lender or the Administrative
         Agent pursuant to the provisions hereof or thereof, shall prove
         to have been false or misleading as of the time made, deemed
         made or furnished in any material respect, and (if such false or
         misleading representation is reasonably likely to be capable of
         being promptly made to be no longer false and misleading by
         actions of the Company) the same shall continue unremedied for
         at least 30 days after any executive officer of the Company
         knows or has reason to believe that such representation,
         warranty or certification is false or misleading; or

                  (d) (i) The Company shall default in the performance of
         any of its obligations under any of Sections 9.01(f), 9.03(a),

         9.05, 9.06, 9.07, 9.08, 9.09, 9.10, 9.11, 9.12 or 9.14 hereof;

         its obligations under Section 4.02 or 5.02 of the Security
         Agreement; or (iii) any Obligor shall default in the performance
         of any of its other obligations in this Agreement or any other

         unremedied for a period of 30 days after notice thereof to the
         Company by the Administrative Agent or any Lender (through the
         Administrative Agent); or

                  (e) The Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries
         shall admit in writing its inability to, or be generally unable
         to, pay its debts as such debts become due; or

                  (f) The Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries
         shall (i) apply for or consent to the appointment of, or the
         taking of possession by, a receiver, custodian, trustee,
         examiner or liquidator of itself or of all or a substantial part
         of its Property, (ii) make a general assignment for the benefit
         of its creditors, (iii) commence a voluntary case under the

         of any other law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,
         reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, arrangement or
         winding-up, or composition or readjustment of its debts, (v)

         the application or consent of the Company or any of its
         Significant Subsidiaries, in any court of competent
         jurisdiction, seeking (i) its reorganization, liquidation,
         dissolution, arrangement or winding-up, or the composition or
         readjustment of its debts, (ii) the appointment of a receiver,
         custodian, trustee, examiner, liquidator or the like of the

         effect, for a period of 60 or more days; or an order for relief
         against the Company or such Significant Subsidiary shall be
         entered in an involuntary case under the Bankruptcy Code; or

                  (h) A judgment or judgments for the payment of money in
         excess of $25,000,000 in the aggregate (exclusive of judgment
         amounts to the extent covered by insurance where the insurer has
         admitted liability in respect of such judgment) shall be
         rendered by one or more courts, administrative tribunals or
         other bodies having jurisdiction against the Company or any of
         its Significant Subsidiaries and the same shall not be
         discharged (or provision shall not be made for such discharge),
         or a stay of execution thereof shall not be procured, within 45
         days from the date of entry thereof and the Company or the
         relevant Significant Subsidiary shall not, within said period of
         45 days, or such longer period during which execution of the
         same shall have been stayed, appeal therefrom and cause the
         execution thereof to be stayed during such appeal; or

                  (i) An event or condition specified in Section 9.01(e)
         hereof shall occur or exist with respect to any Plan or
         Multiemployer Plan and, as a result of such event or condition,
         together with all other such events or conditions, the Company
         or any ERISA Affiliate shall incur a liability to a Plan, a
         Multiemployer Plan or PBGC (or any combination of the foregoing)
         which has a Material Adverse Effect; or

                  (j) There shall have been asserted against the Company
         or any of its Significant Subsidiaries claims or liabilities,
         whether accrued, absolute or contingent, based on or arising
         from the generation, storage, transport, handling or disposal of
         Hazardous Materials by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
         Affiliates, or any predecessor in interest of the Company or any
         of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or relating to any site or
         facility owned, operated or leased by the Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries or Affiliates, which claims or liabilities (insofar
         as they are payable by the Company or any of its Significant
         Subsidiaries but after deducting any portion thereof which is
         reasonably expected to be paid by other Persons jointly and
         severally liable therefor), in the judgment of the Majority
         Lenders are reasonably likely to be determined adversely to the
         Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, and the amount
         thereof is, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
         likely to have a Material Adverse Effect; or

                  (k)  Any Change of Control shall occur; or

                  (l) Except for expiration in accordance with its terms,
         any of the Security Documents shall be terminated or shall cease
         to be in full force and effect, for whatever reason; or at any
         time after the Closing Date the Administrative Agent shall not
         have (for the benefit of the Lenders), as collateral security
         for the Secured Obligations referred to in the Security
         Agreement, a valid prior perfected first Lien on and security
         interest in the Properties intended to be covered by the
         Security Documents, in each case subject to no equal or prior

         Liens; or any of the Guarantees set forth in Section 6 hereof
         shall cease to be in full force and effect for any reason;

THEREUPON: (1) in the case of an Event of Default other than one referred
to in paragraph (e), (f) or (g) of this Section 10 with respect to any
Obligor, the Administrative Agent may and, upon request of the Majority
Lenders, shall, by notice to the Company, terminate the Commitments
and/or declare all or any portion the principal amount then outstanding
of, and the accrued interest on, the Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations
and all other amounts payable by the Obligors hereunder and under the
Notes (including, without limitation, any amounts payable under Section
5.05 or 5.06 hereof) to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon such
amounts shall be immediately due and payable without presentment, demand,
protest or other formalities of any kind, all of which are hereby
expressly waived by each Obligor; and (2) in the case of the occurrence
of an Event of Default referred to in paragraph (e), (f) or (g) of this
Section 10 with respect to any Obligor, the Commitments shall
automatically be terminated and the principal amount then outstanding of,
and the accrued interest on, the Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations and
all other amounts payable by the Obligors hereunder and under the Notes
(including, without limitation, any amounts payable under Section 5.05 or
5.06 hereof) shall automatically become immediately due and payable
without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind,
all of which are hereby expressly waived by each Obligor.

         In addition, if the Administrative Agent (or the Majority
Lenders through the Administrative Agent) so requests by notice to the
Company upon or following a declaration by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to the preceding paragraph that the principal amount then
outstanding of, and accrued interest on, the Loans and Reimbursement
Obligations and all other amounts payable by the Company hereunder and
under the Notes have become due and payable, the Company shall (and, in
the case of any Event of Default referred to in paragraph (e), (f) or (g)
of this Section 10 with respect to any Obligor, forthwith, without any
demand or the taking of any other action by the Administrative Agent or
such Lenders) provide cover for the Letter of Credit Liabilities by
paying to the Administrative Agent immediately available funds in an
amount equal to the then aggregate undrawn face amount of all Letters of
Credit, which funds shall be held by the Administrative Agent in the
Collateral Account subject to and in accordance with the terms of the
Security Agreement.


         Section 11.  The Administrative Agent

         11.01 Appointment, Powers and Immunities. Each Lender hereby

irrevocably (subject to Section 11.08 hereof) appoints and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to act as its agent hereunder and under the other Basic
Documents with such powers as are specifically delegated to the Administrative
Agent by the terms of this Agreement and of the other Basic Documents, together
with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative
Agent (which term as used in this sentence and in Section 11.05 and the first
sentence of Section 11.06 hereof shall include reference to its affiliates and
its own and its affiliates' officers, directors, employees and agents): (a)
shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in
this Agreement and in the other Basic Documents, and shall not by reason of this
Agreement or any other Basic Document be a trustee for any Lender; (b) shall not
be responsible to the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any other Basic Document, or in any
certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by any
of them under, this Agreement or any other Basic Document, or for the value,
validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
Agreement, any Note or any other Basic Document or any other document referred
to or provided for herein or therein or for any failure by the Company or any
other Person to perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder; (c)
shall not be required (except to the extent expressly required under Section
11.03 hereof) to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection proceedings
hereunder or under any other Basic Document; and (d) shall not be responsible
for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under any other
Basic Document or under any other document or instrument referred to or provided
for herein or therein or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent may employ
agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it in good faith.
The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the holder
thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a notice of the assignment or
transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent, together
with the consent of the Company to such assignment or transfer (to the extent
provided in Section 12.06(b) hereof).

         11.02 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall
be entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication
(including, without limitation, any thereof by telephone, telecopy, telex,
telegram or cable) reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and
upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other
experts selected by the Administrative Agent. As to any matters not expressly
provided for by this Agreement or any other Basic Document, the Administrative
Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
acting, hereunder or thereunder in accordance with instructions given by the
Majority Lenders, and such instructions of the Majority Lenders and any action
taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders.

         11.03 Defaults. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Default (other than the non-payment
of principal of or interest on Loans, Reimbursement Obligations

or of commitment fees) unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from
a Lender or the Company specifying such Default and stating that such notice is
a notice of default. In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a
notice of the occurrence of a Default, the Administrative Agent shall give
prompt notice thereof to the Lenders (and shall give each Lender prompt notice
of each such non-payment). The Administrative Agent shall (subject to Sections
11.07 and 12.04 hereof) take such action with respect to such Default as shall
be directed by the Majority Lenders, provided that, unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in
the best interest of the Lenders except to the extent that this Agreement
expressly requires that such action be taken, or not be taken, only with the
consent or upon the authorization of the Majority Lenders or all of the Lenders.

         11.04 Rights as a Lender. With respect to its Commitments and the Loans
made by it, Chase (and any successor acting as Administrative Agent) in its
capacity as a Lender hereunder shall have the same rights and powers hereunder
as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as
the Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless the
context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual
capacity. Chase (and any successor acting as Administrative Agent) and its
affiliates may (without having to account therefor to any Lender) accept
deposits from, lend money to, make investments in and generally engage in any
kind of banking, trust or other business with the Obligors (and any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates) as if it were not acting as the Administrative
Agent, and Chase and its affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from
the Obligors for services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without
having to account for the same to the Lenders.

         11.05 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the
Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed under Section 12.03 hereof,
but without limiting the obligations of the Company under said Section 12.03)
ratably in accordance with the aggregate principal amount of the Loans and
Reimbursement Obligations held by the Lenders (or, if no Loans or Reimbursement
Obligations are at the time outstanding, ratably in accordance with their
respective Commitments), for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Administrative Agent (including by any Lender) arising out
of or by reason of any investigation in or in any way relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or any other Basic Document or any other documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (including, without limitation, the costs and
expenses that the Company is obligated to pay under Section 12.03 hereof, but
excluding, unless a Default has occurred and is continuing, normal
administrative costs and expenses incident to the performance of its agency
duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof or of
any such other documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any of the
foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful

misconduct of the party to be indemnified.

         11.06 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each
Lender agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and decision to enter into this Agreement and that
it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall
not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by
any Obligor of this Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents or any other
document referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the
Properties or books of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except for
notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be
furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial
condition or business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their
affiliates) that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any
of its affiliates.

                                                               Exhibit 10.1

         11.07 Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required of the
Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Basic Documents, the
Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or
refusing to act hereunder and thereunder unless it shall receive further
assurances to its satisfaction from the Lenders of their indemnification
obligations under Section 11.05 hereof against any and all liability and expense
that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action.

         11.08 Resignation or Removal of Administrative Agent. Subject to the
appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided
below, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving notice thereof
to the Lenders and the Company, and the Administrative Agent may be removed at
any time with or without cause by the Majority Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the right (after
consultation with and, if no Default is then continuing, approval by, the
Company) to appoint a successor Administrative Agent; provided that such
successor Administrative Agent shall have total assets in excess of
$50,000,000,000. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment
within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of
resignation or the Majority Lenders' removal of the retiring Administrative
Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders,
appoint a successor Administrative Agent, that shall be a bank that has an

office in New York, New York and shall have total assets in excess of
$50,000,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation or removal
hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 11 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent.

         11.09 Agency Fee. So long as the Commitments are in effect and until
payment in full of the principal of and interest on the Loans and all other
amounts payable by the Company hereunder, the Company will pay to the
Administrative Agent an agency fee in the amount specified in the Fee Letter,
payable annually in advance commencing on the date of execution and delivery of
this Agreement by all parties hereto and on each anniversary thereof. Such fee,
once paid, shall be non-refundable.

         11.10 Consents under Basic Documents. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 12.04 hereof with respect to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent
may, with the prior consent of the Majority Lenders (but not otherwise), consent
to any modification, supplement or waiver under any of the Basic Documents,
provided that, without the prior consent of each Lender, the Administrative
Agent shall not (except as provided herein or in the Security Documents) release
any collateral or otherwise terminate any Lien under any Basic Document
providing for collateral security, or agree to additional obligations being
secured by such collateral security (unless the Lien for such additional
obligations shall be junior to the Lien in favor of the other obligations
secured by such Basic Document).


         Section 12.  Miscellaneous

         12.01 Waiver. No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any
Lender to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with
respect to, any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or any Note shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, power or privilege under this Agreement or any Note preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
The remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies
provided by law.

         12.02 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications provided
for herein and under the Security Documents (including, without limitation, any
modifications of, or waivers, requests or consents under, this

of its Revolving Credit Loans, its Revolving Credit Notes, its
Commitments, and its Letter of Credit Interest (but only with the consent
of the Company and the Administrative Agent (which consents shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and, in the case of a Revolving Credit
Commitment or a Letter of Credit Interest, the Issuing Bank and, in the

(i) no such consent by the Company shall be required if any Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such
assignment; (ii) any such partial assignment (other than any such
assignment to another Lender) shall be in an amount at least equal to

                                                               Exhibit 10.1

and delivery by the assignee to the Company, the Administrative Agent and the
Issuing Lender of an instrument in writing pursuant to which such assignee
agrees to become a "Lender" hereunder (if not already a Lender) having the
Commitments, Loans and, if applicable, Letter of Credit Interest specified in
such instrument, and upon consent thereto by the Company, the Administrative
Agent and the Issuing Lender, to the extent required above, the assignee shall
have, to the extent of such assignment (unless otherwise provided in such
assignment with the consent of the Company, the Administrative Agent and the
Issuing Bank), the obligations, rights and benefits of a Lender hereunder
holding the Commitments, Loans and, if applicable, Letter of Credit Interest (or
portions thereof) assigned to it (in addition to the Commitments, Loans and
Letter of Credit Interest, if any, theretofore held by such assignee) and the
assigning Lender shall, to the extent of such assignment, be released from the
Commitments (or portion thereof) so assigned. Upon each such assignment the
assigning Lender shall pay the Administrative Agent an assignment fee of $3,500.

         (c) A Lender may, at any time or from time to time, sell or
agree to sell to one or more other Persons a participation in all or any
part of any Loans or Letter of Credit Interest held by it, or in its
Commitments, in which event each purchaser of a participation (a
"Participant") shall be entitled to the rights and benefits of the
provisions of Sections 9.01(g), 5.05, 5.06, 5.07 and 12.03 hereof with
respect to its participation in such Loans, Letter of Credit Interest and
Commitments as if (and the Company shall be directly obligated to such
Participant under such provisions as if) such Participant were a "Lender"
for purposes of said Section, but, except for the rights of the Lenders
under Section 4.06(c) hereof, shall not have any other rights or benefits
under this Agreement or any Note or any other Basic Document (the
Participant's rights against such Lender in respect of such participation
to be those set forth in the agreements executed by such Lender in favor
of the Participant). All amounts payable by the Company to any Lender
under Section 5 hereof in respect of the Loans and Letter of Credit
Interest held by it, and its Commitments, shall be determined as if such
Lender had not sold or agreed to sell any participations in such Loans,
Letter of Credit Interest and Commitments, and as if such Lender were
funding each of such Loan, Letter of Credit Interest and Commitments in
the same way that it is funding the portion of such Loan, Letter of
Credit Interest and Commitments in which no participations have been
sold. In no event shall a Lender that sells a participation agree with
the Participant to take or refrain from taking any action hereunder or
under any other Basic Document except that such Lender may agree with the
Participant that such Lender will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to (i) increase or extend the term, or extend the time
or waive any requirement for the reduction or termination, of such
Lender's Commitments, (ii) extend any date fixed for the payment of
principal of or interest on the related Loan or Loans, Reimbursement
Obligations or any portion of any fee hereunder payable to the
Participant, (iii) reduce the amount of any such payment of principal,
(iv) reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon, or any fee

hereunder payable to the Participant, to a level below the rate at which
the Participant is entitled to receive such interest or fee, (v) increase
the rights or reduce the obligations of the Company to prepay the related
Loans or (vi) consent to any modification, supplement or waiver of this
Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents to the extent that the
same, under Section 11.10 or 12.04 hereof, requires the consent of each
Lender.

         (d) In addition to the assignments and participations permitted
by the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.06, any Lender may assign
and pledge all or any portion of its Loans and its Note to any Federal
Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and any
Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank, and such Loans
and Note shall be fully transferrable as provided therein. No such
assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations
hereunder.

         (e) A Lender may furnish any information concerning the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in the possession of such Lender from time to
time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and
participants), subject, however, to the provisions of Section 12.13
hereof.

         (f) Anything in this Section 12.06 to the contrary
notwithstanding, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates may acquire (whether by assignment, participation or
otherwise), and no Lender shall assign or participate to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any interest in any Commitments,
Loan or Reimbursement Obligation without the prior consent of each
Lender.

         (g) The Swingline Bank may not assign or sell participations in
all or any part of its Swingline Loans, the Swingline Note or the
Swingline Commitment; provided that the Swingline Bank may assign to
another Lender all of its obligations, rights and benefits in respect of
the Swingline Loans, the Swingline Note and the Swingline Commitment with
the consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed). The Company may, from time to time, upon at least 30 days
prior notice, replace the Lender then acting as Swingline Bank with one
or more other Lenders, or add one or more other Lenders as additional
Swingline Banks (and, if so replaced with more than one other Lender, or
any other Swingline Banks are so added, such Lenders acting as Swingline
Bank shall enter into arrangements to ensure compliance with the terms
and conditions hereof relating to the Swingline Commitment). Upon the
effectiveness of any such assignment, the assignee shall have the
obligations, rights and benefits of the Swingline Bank hereunder, and the
Swingline Bank shall be released from the Swingline Commitment.
         

          12.07 Survival. The obligations of the Company under Sections 5.01,
5.05, 5.06, 5.07 and 12.03 hereof, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor
under Section 6.03 hereof, and the obligations of the Lenders under Section
11.05 and Section 12.13 hereof shall survive the repayment of the Loans and
Reimbursement Obligations and the termination of the Commitments for a period of
two years (provided that any claim or demand made by the Administrative Agent or
any Lender with respect to any such obligation prior to the end of such two-year
period shall survive the expiration of such period). In addition, each
representation and warranty made, or deemed to be made by a notice of any
extension of credit (whether by means of a Loan or a Letter of Credit), herein
or pursuant hereto shall survive the making of such representation and warranty
for a period of two years (provided that any claim or demand made by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to any such representation or
warranty prior to the end of such two-year period shall survive the expiration
of such period), and no Lender shall be deemed to have waived, by reason of
making any extension of credit hereunder (whether by means of a Loan or a Letter
of Credit), any Default which may arise by reason of such representation or
warranty proving to have been false or misleading, notwithstanding that such
Lender or the Administrative Agent may have had notice or knowledge or reason to
believe that such representation or warranty was false or misleading at the time
such extension of credit was made.

         12.08 Captions. The table of contents and captions and section headings
appearing herein are included solely for convenience of reference and are not
intended to affect the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing
any such counterpart.

Notes shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the

proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each Obligor irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any
claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

         12.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE OBLIGORS, THE ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT, THE LENDERS, THE ISSUING BANK AND THE SWINGLINE BANK HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

(or prospective assignee or participant) first executes and delivers to the
respective Lender and the Company a confidentiality agreement in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Company and such Lender.

               [Form of Opinion of Counsel to the Obligors]

                                                        November __, 1997

To the Lenders party to the
Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement referred to
below and The Chase Manhattan Bank,
as Administrative Agent


Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  We have acted as counsel to Barnes & Noble, Inc. (the
"Company") and its subsidiaries in connection with the Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated as of November
__, 1997, among the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company identified
on the signature pages thereof under the caption "SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS",
the lenders named therein and The Chase Manhattan Bank, as
Administrative Agent, providing for extensions of credit to be made by
said lenders to the Company in an aggregate amount not exceeding
$850,000,000. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as
defined therein.

         In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined (a)
the Basic Documents and (b) the originals or conformed copies of such
corporate records, agreements and instruments of the obligors,
certificates of public officials and of officers of the Obligors, and
such other documents and records, and such matters of law, as we have
deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In
our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the
authenticity of documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity
with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as
copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, we have
relied upon statements of governmental officials and upon representations
made in or pursuant to the Basic Documents and certificates and
statements of appropriate representatives of the obligors.

         In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed that,
other than with respect to the Obligors, all of the documents referred to
in this opinion have been duly authorized by, have been duly executed and
delivered by, and constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of, all of the parties to such documents, that all
signatories to such documents have been duly authorized and that all such
parties are duly organized and validly existing and have the power and
authority (corporate or other) to execute, deliver and perform such
documents.

         Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the

comments and qualifications set forth below, and having considered such
questions of law as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions
expressed below, we are of the opinion that:

         1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and
has the necessary corporate power to make and perform the Credit
Agreement and the Notes and the other Basic Documents to which it is a
party and to borrow under the Credit Agreement. Each Subsidiary
Guarantor is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the respective state indicated opposite
its name in Schedule II to the Credit Agreement. The Company is duly
qualified to transact business in the State of New York and, to our
knowledge, the Subsidiary Guarantors are duly qualified to transact
business in all such jurisdictions where failure so to qualify would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition or operations of the Company and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Each Subsidiary Guarantor has the
necessary corporate power to make and perform the Credit Agreement

<PAGE>

and the other Basic Documents to which it is a party.

         2. The making and performance by each Obligor of the Credit
Agreement and the other Basic Documents to which it is a party including,
in the case of the Company, the Notes and the borrowings by the Company
under the Credit Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action, and do not and will not violate any provision of any
applicable law or regulation or any provision of the charter or by-laws
of any Obligor or result in the breach of, or constitute a default or
require any consent under, or (except for the Liens created pursuant to
the Security Documents) result in the creation of any Lien upon any
material Property of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to,
any indenture or other material agreement or instrument known to us to
which the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor is a party or by which the
Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or its Properties may be bound.

         3. The Credit Agreement, the Security Agreement, and the
Security Agreement Amendment constitute, and the Notes when executed and
delivered for value will constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations
of the respective Obligor enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws of general
applicability affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and (b) the
application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and
except that no opinion is expressed as to Section 4.07(c) or Section 11
(other than Section 11.09) of the Credit Agreement.

         We express no opinion as to the effect, or applicability, upon
the obligations of any Subsidiary Guarantor under the Credit Agreement,
the Security Agreement, and the Security Agreement Amendment of any
Federal or state law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers. In

addition, we express no opinion as to (i) whether a Federal or state
court outside of the State of New York would give effect to the choice of
New York law provided for in the Credit Agreement and the Notes and in
the other Basic Documents, (ii) the second sentence of Section 12.10 of
the Credit Agreement, insofar as such sentence relates to the subject
matter jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York to adjudicate any controversy related to the Credit
Agreement or the Notes or (iii) the waiver of inconvenient forum set
forth in Section 12.10 of the Credit Agreement with respect to
proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York. We also wish to point out that the obligations of the
Obligors under the Security Agreement and the Security Agreement
Amendment may be subject to possible limitations upon the exercise of
remedial or procedural provisions contained in the Security Agreement and
the Security Agreement Amendment, provided that such limitations do not,
in our opinion, make the remedies and procedures which will be afforded
to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders inadequate for the practical
realization of the substantive benefits purported to be provided to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders by the Security Agreement and the
Security Agreement Amendment. Finally, we wish to point out that
provisions of the Basic Documents which permit the Administrative Agent
or any Lender to take action or make determinations, or to benefit from
indemnities and similar undertakings of the Obligors, may be subject to a
requirement that such action be taken or such determinations be made, and
that any action or inaction by the Administrative Agent or any Lender
which may give rise to a request for payment under such an undertaking be
taken or not taken, on a reasonable basis and in good faith.

         4. There are no legal or arbitral proceedings, and no
proceedings by or before any governmental or regulatory authority or
agency, pending or (to our knowledge) threatened against the Company or
any Subsidiary Guarantor that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

         5. No authorizations, consents, approvals, licenses, filings or
registrations with any governmental or regulatory authority or agency are
required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by any
Obligor of the Basic Documents to which it is a party, except the filings
and recordings of Liens to be created pursuant to the Security Documents.

         6. The Security Agreement (as amended by the Security Agreement
Amendment) is effective to create, in favor of the Administrative Agent
for the benefit of the Lenders thereunder, a valid security interest (to
the 

<PAGE>

extent that Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code is applicable
thereto) in the right, title and interest of the Obligors in the
Collateral (as defined in the Security Agreement), as collateral security
for the payment of the Secured Obligations (as so defined), except that
the security interest in Collateral in which any obligor acquires rights
after the commencement of a case against it under the Bankruptcy Code
will be limited by Section 552 of the Bankruptcy Code. By virtue of the

filings described in Annex 1 attached hereto, all such security interests
which can be perfected by a Uniform Commercial Code filing in the United
States of America will have been, upon such filings being completed, so
perfected. We express no opinion as to the right, title or interest of
any obligor in any of the Collateral.

         7. The issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each
Issuer under and as defined in the Security Agreement (as amended by the
Security Agreement Amendment) is correctly described in Annex 1 thereto,
and represented by the certificates therein identified. The security
interest in the Pledged Stock under and as defined in the Security
Agreement (as amended by the Security Agreement Amendment) represented by
each such certificate constitutes a valid, perfected security interest so
long as the Administrative Agent holds such certificates.

         In rendering the foregoing opinions, we have assumed, without
independent investigation, that (i) the Company has not issued the Notes
and no Subsidiary Guarantor has guaranteed the Secured Obligations with
actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud their respective present or
future creditors, (ii) upon issuance of the Notes by the Company and the
guarantee by the Subsidiary Guarantors, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary Guarantors was insolvent or engaged, or about to engage, in a
business or transaction for which the property remaining with the Company
or any Subsidiary Guarantors, as the case may be, was unreasonably small
capital, or intended to incur, or believed that it was incurring, debts
beyond its ability to pay as they become due, and (iii) each of the
Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor will satisfy in full any final
judgment against it in any action for money damages that either results
from an action pending against it on the date the Notes and the guarantee
were issued or docketed against it on such date.

         The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the
Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and,
to the extent necessary, the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, and we do not express any opinion as to the laws of any other
jurisdiction.

         This opinion letter is provided to you by us pursuant to Section
7.01(c) of the Credit Agreement and may not be relied upon by any other
person or for any purpose other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Basic Documents without our prior written consent in
each instance.

                                        Very truly yours,

               [Form of Opinion of Special New York Counsel
                         to Chase, CIBC and ING]


                                                        November __, 1997


To:      The Lenders party to the
         Credit Agreement referred to
         below and The Chase Manhattan Bank
         as Administrative Agent

                         Re: Barnes & Noble, Inc.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         We have acted as special New York counsel to The Chase Manhattan
Bank, CIBC Inc. and ING (U.S.) Capital Corporation in connection with
the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November __, 1997
(the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") between Barnes & Noble,
Inc. (the "Company"), the Subsidiaries of the Company identified on the
signature pages thereof under the caption "SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS" (the
"Subsidiary Guarantors"), the Lenders identified in the Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement (the "Lenders") and The Chase Manhattan Bank,
as Administrative Agent. All capitalized terms defined in the Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement are used with the same meanings, unless
otherwise defined, in this opinion letter.

         In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined (a)
the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Note, the Security
Agreement and the Security Agreement Amendment (collectively, the "Loan
Documents") and (b) such corporate records of the Obligors and such other
documents as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions
expressed below. In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of
all signatures, the authenticity of documents submitted to us as
originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all
documents submitted to us as copies. When relevant facts were not
independently established, we have relied upon statements of governmental
officials and upon representations made in or pursuant to the Loan
Documents and certificates of appropriate representatives of the
Obligors.

         In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed that
all of the documents referred to in this opinion have been duly
authorized by, have been or (in the case of the Notes) will be duly
executed and delivered by, and (except, to the extent set forth below, as
to the Obligors) constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of, all of the parties to such documents, that all
signatories to such documents have been duly authorized and that all such
parties are duly organized and validly existing and have the power and

authority (corporate or other) to execute, deliver and perform such
documents.

         Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the
comments and qualifications set forth below, and having considered such
questions of law as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions
expressed below, we are of the opinion that:

         1. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement constitutes, and
the Notes when duly executed and delivered for value will constitute, the
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against
it in accordance with their respective terms, except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally and except as
the enforceability of such Loan Documents is subject to the application
of general principles of equity (regardless of 

<PAGE>

whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including
without limitation (a) the possible unavailability of specific
performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (b)
concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.

         2. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of each Subsidiary Guarantor,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally
and except as the enforceability of the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement is subject to the application of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law),
including without limitation (a) the possible unavailability of specific
performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (b)
concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.

         3. The Security Agreement and the Security Agreement Amendment
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Obligor,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except (a) as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally,
(b) as the enforceability of the Security Agreement and the Security
Agreement Amendment is subject to the application of general principles
of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or
at law), including without limitation (1) the possible unavailability of
specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and
(2) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing
and (c) that the enforceability of the obligations of the Obligors under
the Security Agreement and the Security Agreement Amendment may be
subject to possible limitations upon the exercise of remedial or
procedural provisions contained in the Security Agreement (as amended by
the Security Agreement Amendment), provided that (subject to clauses (a)
and (b) above) such limitations do not, in our opinion, make the remedies
and procedures afforded to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders

inadequate for the practical realization of the substantive benefits
purported to be provided to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by
the Security Agreement and the Security Agreement Amendment.

         The foregoing opinions are also subject to the following
comments and qualifications:

         (a) The enforceability of Section 12.03 of the Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement may be limited by laws rendering unenforceable
indemnification contrary to Federal or state securities laws and the
public policy underlying such laws.

         (b) The enforceability of provisions in the Loan Documents to
the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in writing may
be limited under certain circumstances.

         (c) We express no opinion as to (i) the effect of the laws of
any jurisdiction in which any Lender is located (other than the State of
New York) that limits the interest, fees or other charges it may impose,
(ii) Section 4.07(c) of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or the
last sentence of Section 2.02(b), (iii) the second sentence of Section
12.10 of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement insofar as such
sentence relates to the subject matter jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York to adjudicate any
controversy related to the Loan Documents and (iv) the waiver of
inconvenient forum set forth in Section 12.10 of the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement with respect to proceedings in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York.

         (d) We express no opinion as to the applicability to the
obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors (or the enforceability of such
obligations) of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or Article 10 of the
New York Debtor and Creditor Law, or any other provision of law, relating
to fraudulent conveyances, transfers or obligations. Nevertheless, we
have assumed, without independent verification, that you have made or
caused to be made such valuations and projections as you have deemed
necessary to demonstrate and satisfy yourselves that, after giving effect
to the respective guarantee, each Subsidiary Guarantor will not (i) be
insolvent, (ii) have liabilities (including contingent, unmatured and
subordinated liabilities) that are beyond its ability to pay as such
liabilities mature or (iii) have an unreasonably small capital with which
to conduct its business.

                                   -2-

         The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the
federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of
New York, and we do not express any opinion as to the laws of any other
jurisdiction.

         This opinion letter is provided to you by us pursuant to Section
7.01(d) of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and may not be
relied upon by any other person or for any purpose other than in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents
without our prior written consent in each instance.

                                              Very truly yours,






DKD/ILA

                  AMENDMENT TO PLEDGE AND SECURITY AGREEMENT

         AMENDMENT TO PLEDGE AND SECURITY AGREEMENT, dated as of November 18,

existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Company"); each of the
Subsidiaries of the Company identified under the caption "SUBSIDIARY
GUARANTORS" on the signature pages hereof (individually, a "Subsidiary
Guarantor" and, collectively, the "Subsidiary Guarantors" and, together with
the Company, the "Obligors"); and THE CHASE MANHATTAN BANK, as agent for the
lenders or other financial institutions or entities party, as lenders, to the
Credit Agreement referred to below (in such capacity, together with its
successors in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent").

                  The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, certain lenders and
the Administrative Agent are parties to a Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement dated as of November 18, 1997 (as modified and supplemented and in
effect from time to time, the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement"),
providing, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, for extensions of
credit (by making of loans and issuing letters of credit) to be made by said
lenders to the Company in an aggregate principal or face amount not exceeding
$850,000,000 (as that amount may be increased as provided therein). The
Obligors and the Agent wish to amend the Security Agreement referred to in the
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement in certain respects and, accordingly,

         Security Agreement is amended by replacing the reference to
         "$550,000,000" with a reference to "$850,000,000."

                  b. Name Change. The Administrative Agent has changed its
         name from The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association) to The
         Chase Manhattan Bank and each reference in the Security Agreement to
         The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association) shall be deemed to be
         a reference to The Chase Manhattan Bank.

                  c. Annex 1. Annex 1 to the Security Agreement shall be
         amended in its entirety to read as Annex 1 hereto.

                  d. Annex 2. Annex 2 to the Security Agreement shall be

                  g. Annex 5. Annex 4 to the Security Agreement shall be

                  h. Amendment and Restatement of Credit Agreement. Each
         reference in the Security Agreement to the Credit Agreement shall be
         deemed to be a reference to the Amended and Restated Credit
         Agreement.

         Section 5. Miscellaneous. Except as herein provided, the Security
Agreement shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect. This Amendment
may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together

                      EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT PLAN

                             INTRODUCTION

B. Dalton Bookseller, Inc., prior to 1987 a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Dayton-Hudson Corporation, established the B. Dalton Company Employees'
Retirement Plan as of January 1, 1987 ("B. Dalton Plan"). Effective
January 1, 1992, the Pension Plan for Employees of Doubleday Book Shops,
Inc. was merged into the B. Dalton Plan.

As of January 1, 1994, sponsorship of the B. Dalton Plan was transferred
from B. Dalton Bookseller, Inc. to Barnes & Noble, Inc.. The B. Dalton
Plan was amended and restated in its entirety and renamed the Barnes &
Noble, Inc. Employees' Retirement Plan effective as of January 1, 1994
("Plan").

This amendment and restatement of the Plan is effective as of January 1,
1998 and incorporates the provisions of the Retirement Protection Act of
1994 as part of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

Except as otherwise herein specified, the rights and benefits of any
Participant who retires or whose employment is terminated are determined
in accordance with the provisions of the Plan in effect and operative at
the time of such retirement or termination.

                          continuous period,

                  (c)     each hour for which back pay, irrespective of
                          mitigation of damages, is either awarded or agreed to

                          credited under (a) or (b), which shall be credited to
                          the computation period or periods to which the award,
                          agreement or payment pertains, rather than to the
                          computation period in which the award, agreement or
                          payment is made,

                          under paragraph (a) or (b) above during a period of
                          Parental Leave but not more than 501 hours for any

                          single continuous period. In the case in which hours
                          cannot be determined, eight hours of service per day
                          of such absence shall be credited. However, the number
                          of hours credited to an Employee under this paragraph
                          (d) during the computation period in which the
                          Parental Leave began, when added to the hours credited
                          to an Employee under paragraphs (a) through (c) above
                          during that computation period, shall not exceed 501.
                          If the number of hours credited under this paragraph
                          (d) for the computation period in which the Parental
                          Leave began is zero, the provisions of this paragraph
                          (d) shall apply as though the Parental Leave began in
                          the immediately following computation period, and

                  (e)     solely for purposes of determining whether an Employee

                          under paragraph (a) or (b) above during a period of
                          leave for the birth, adoption or placement of a child,
                          to care for a spouse or an immediate family member

         For purposes of paragraph (b), a payment shall be deemed to be
         made by or due from an Employer or Affiliate regardless of

         Affiliate directly, or indirectly through, among others, a trust
         fund or insurer to which the Employer or Affiliate contributes
         or pays premiums, and regardless of whether contributions made
         or due to the trust fund, insurer or other entity are for the

         above for the non-performance of duties for any single
         continuous period (whether or not such period occurs in a single
         computation period).

         No hours shall be credited on account of any period during which
         the Employee performs no duties and receives payment solely for
         the purpose of complying with unemployment compensation,
         workers' compensation or disability insurance laws.

         The Hours of Service credited shall be determined as required by
         Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Section
         2530.200b-2(b) and (c). In crediting Hours of Service hereunder,
         each Employee for whom the Employer or Affiliate does not
         maintain hourly work records and who completes at least one Hour
         of Service (pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) above)

         during any week shall be credited with 45 Hours of Service for
         such week. For each other Employee, Hours of Service shall be
         credited based on the number of hours actually worked.

3.01     Years of Vesting Service

 (a)     A Plan Year in which an Eligible Employee completes at least
         1,000 Hours of Service counts as a full Year of Vesting Service.
         Except as provided below, no Years of Vesting Service is counted
         for any Plan Year in which an Eligible Employee completes less
         than 1,000 Hours of Service, except that the Plan Year during
         which he first completed an Hour of Service and the Plan Year
         containing his Termination of Employment shall be aggregated for
         the purpose of determining if the Eligible Employee shall be
         credited with an additional Year of Vesting Service, provided
         the Eligible Employee works at an annualized rate of 1,000 Hours
         of Service in the Plan Year in which his Termination of
         Employment occurs.

 (b)     Service rendered prior to January 1, 1989 shall be recognized
         for vesting purposes to the extent that such service was
         recognized for such purpose under the terms of the Plan as in
         effect prior to such date.

 (c)     An Eligible  Employee  shall  incur a one-year  Break in
         Service for any Plan Year after the year in which an Eligible 
         Employee  first  becomes  employed  during which he does not
         complete  more than 500 Hours of Service.  If an Eligible 
         Employee who has not completed  the vesting  requirements  for
         a vested  Pension has a Break in Service in which the number of 
         consecutive  one-year  Breaks in Service  equals or exceeds
         five,  the service  rendered  before his most recent Break in
         Service  shall be excluded from his Years of Vesting Service. 
         If an Eligible  Employee  terminates his employment with the
         Employer and all Affiliates and is  reemployed  after  having a
         Break in  Service,  his service  before the Break in Service 
         shall be excluded  from his Years of Vesting  Service,  except
         as provided in  Section 3.03.  A period during which an
         Eligible

                                                                         Page 16

         Employee is on a leave of absence approved by the Employer or on 
         temporary layoff shall not be considered as a Break in Service, 
         provided he returns to work at the end of an approved leave of absence 
         or upon recall when notified after a temporary layoff.

 (d)     If an Eligible Employee shall have been absent from the service
         of the Employer because of service in the Armed Forces of the
         United States and if he shall have returned to the service of
         the Employer having applied to return while his reemployment
         rights were protected by law, that absence shall not count as a
         Break in Service, but instead shall be counted as Years of

         Vesting Service.

 (e)     Each of the following periods of service shall be counted in a
         person's Years of Vesting Service to the extent that it would be
         recognized under paragraphs (a) through (c) above with respect
         to Eligible Employees:

         (i)      a period of service as an Employee, but not an
                  Eligible Employee, of the Employer, 

         (ii)     a period of service as an employee of an
                  Affiliate (excluding any period of service prior to
                  the date the entity became an Affiliate, unless
                  otherwise provided by the Board of Directors), and

         (iii)    in the case of a person who is a Leased Employee
                  before or after a period of service as an Eligible
                  Employee or a period of service described in (i) or
                  (ii) above, a period during which he has performed
                  services for the Employer or an Affiliate as a Leased
                  Employee.

         The Break in Service rules of Sections 3.01 and 3.03 shall be
         applied as though all such periods of service were service as an
         Eligible Employee.

 (f)     Notwithstanding  any  provision  of this  Section 3.01  to the 
         contrary,  all  Years of  Vesting  Service calculations  for an 
         Eligible  Employee  hired prior to  January 1,  1976 shall be
         made using the elapsed time method  described in IRS Regulation 
         Section 1.410(a)-7T.  Service with regard to an individual
         hired prior to  January  1, 1976  shall  begin on the date the 
         Eligible  Employee  first  completes  an Hour of Service  and
         ends on the  Eligible  Employee's  severance  date.  For 
         purposes of this  Section  3.01(f), "severance date" means the
         earlier of (i) the date an Eligible Employee quits,  retires, 
         is discharged or dies or (ii) the  first  anniversary  of the 
         date on which an  Eligible  Employee  is first  absent  from
         service,  with or without  pay, for any other reason such as 
         vacation,  sickness,  disability,  layoff or leave  of 
         absence.  If the  employment  of an  Eligible  Employee  hired 
         prior  to  January  1,  1976 is terminated  and he is later 
         reemployed  within one year,  the period  between his severance 
         date and the date of his  reemployment  shall be included in
         his Years of Vesting Service.  However,  if his employment is 
         terminated  during  a  period  of  absence  from  service  for 
         reasons  such as  vacation,  sickness, disability,  layoff or
         leave of absence approved by the Employer,  service shall be
         counted for the period from his severance date to the date of
         his  reemployment  only if he is reemployed  within one year of

         the first day of that  absence.  For purposes of this Section 
         3.01(f),  a Break in Service  shall occur if an Eligible
         Employee is not reemployed  within one year after a severance
         date;  provided,  however,  that is an Eligible  Employee's 
         employment  is terminated  or if the Eligible  Employee is
         otherwise  absent from work because of Parental  Leave (as
         defined in Section  1.30),  a Break in Service shall occur only
         if the Eligible  Employee  is not  reemployed  or does not 
         return  to  active  service  within  two years of his severance 
         date;  and provided  further that the first year of such
         absence for Parental  Leave,  measured from his severance date,
         shall not be considered in determining the Eligible  Employee's 
         "period of Break in Service" for purposes of Section 3.01(c).

3.02     Credited Service

 (a)     A full year of Credited Service shall be counted for each Plan
         Year during which an Eligible Employee completes 1,000 Hours of
         Service as an Eligible Employee. If an Eligible Employee does
         not complete 1,000 Hours of Service during the Plan Years in
         which he first completes an Hour of Service or incurs his
         Termination of Employment, he shall receive credit for a
         fractional year equal to the actual number of months worked
         during such Plan Years, provided that he was working at the rate
         of 1,000 Hours of Service per Plan Year. For purposes of the
         preceding sentence, an Eligible Employee shall receive credit
         for a month of service, provided he has worked 15 or more days
         during such month.

 (b)     Credited Service shall include, to the extent required by law,
         any period of absence from service with the Employer due to
         service in the Armed Forces of the United States which is
         counted in an Eligible Employee's Years of Vesting Service as
         provided in Section 3.01(d) and which occurs after the date the
         Employee meets the requirements to be an Eligible Employee.

 (c)     Credited Service shall not be credited for any period in which a
         Participant is (i) not an Eligible Employee but is in the employ
         of the Employer, or (ii) in the employ of an Affiliate, or (iii)
         performing services for the Employer or an Affiliate as a Leased
         Employee.

 (d)     Notwithstanding  any provision of this  Section 3.02 to the
         contrary,  all Credited  Service  calculations for a
         Participant  employed by the Company  prior to January 1,  1976
         shall be made using the elapsed time method as described in IRS 
         Regulation  Section 1.410(a)-7T.  Service with regard to an 
         individual  hired prior to  January  1, 1976  shall  begin on
         the date the  Eligible  Employee  first  completes  an Hour of

         Service  and ends on the  Eligible  Employee's  severance 
         date.  For  purposes of this  Section  3.02(d), "severance
         date" means the earlier of (i) the date an

                                                                         Page 19

         Eligible Employee quits,  retires,  is discharged or dies or (ii) the 
         first  anniversary  of the  date on which an  Eligible  Employee  is
         first  absent  from service,  with or without  pay, for any other
         reason such as  vacation,  sickness,  disability,  layoff or leave of
         absence.

3.03     Restoration of Retired Participant or Other Former Eligible
         Employee to Service

 (a)     If a Participant in receipt of a Pension is restored to service
         with the Employer as an Eligible Employee, the following shall
         apply:
         
         (i)      His Pension shall continue through the month in which he
                  completes at least 960 Hours of Service, after which (A) if
                  his restoration to service occurs after his Normal Retirement
                  Date, his Pension shall be suspended during each Suspendible
                  Month (unless the provisions of Sections 4.02(c) and 5.04(b)
                  are applicable), and any optional benefit shall remain in
                  effect, unless the Participant shall elect otherwise; if the
                  Participant had commenced payment prior to his Normal
                  Retirement Date, however, any additional Pension he accrues
                  after his restoration to service shall be paid to his
                  surviving spouse in accordance with the provisions of Section
                  4.05 if he should die in active service, and (B) if his
                  restoration to service occurs before his Normal Retirement
                  Date, his Pension shall be suspended during each Suspendible
                  Month (unless the provisions of Sections 4.02(c) and 5.04(b)
                  are applicable), and any election of an optional benefit in
                  effect shall be void.

         (ii)     Any Years of Vesting Service and Credited Service to which he
                  was entitled when he retired or terminated service shall be
                  restored to him.
                  
         (iii)    Upon later retirement or termination his Pension shall be
                  based on the benefit formula then in effect and his Certified
                  Earnings and Credited Service before and after the period when
                  he was not in the service of the Employer reduced by an amount
                  that is the

                                                                         Page 20

                  Actuarial Equivalent of the benefits, if any, he received

                  before the earlier of the date of his restoration to service
                  or his Normal Retirement Date.

         (iv)     The part of the Participant's Pension upon later retirement
                  payable with respect to Credited Service rendered before his
                  previous Termination of Employment shall never be less than
                  the amount of his previous Pension modified to reflect any
                  option in effect on his later retirement.
                  
         (v)      Upon later retirement of a Participant in service after his
                  Normal Retirement Date, payment of the Participant's Pension
                  shall resume no later than the third month after the latest
                  Suspendible Month during the period of restoration, and shall
                  be adjusted, if necessary, in compliance with Title 29 of the
                  Code of Federal Regulations, Section 2530.203-3 in a
                  consistent and nondiscriminatory manner.

         (vi)     If a monthly Pension payment is made for a calendar month and
                  it is determined after the Participant's later retirement and
                  subsequent recommencement of benefits that such payment was
                  subject to permanent withholding pursuant to the provisions of
                  this paragraph (a), the amount of such payment shall be
                  applied as an offset against subsequent monthly payments
                  unless the Participant has previously repaid the overpayment.
                  However, the amount of any such offset shall not exceed, in
                  any month after the Participant attains Normal Retirement Age,
                  25 percent of the monthly total benefit payment that would
                  have been paid but for the offset.

         (vii)    The Employer shall notify a Participant of any suspension
                  under subparagraph (i) above. The notice shall conform to the
                  requirements of Section 2530.203-3(b)(4) of the Department of
                  Labor Regulations. The provisions of this Section shall be
                  administered in accordance with Section 2530.203-3 of the
                  Department of Labor Regulations.

 (b)     If a  Participant  entitled to but not in receipt of a Pension, 
         or a former  Participant,  or an Eligible Employee who was
         never a Participant  is reemployed  without  having had a Break
         in Service,  his Years of Vesting  Service and Credited 
         Service shall be determined as provided in  Sections 3.01  and
         3.02, and if reemployed  as an  Eligible  Employee,  he  shall, 
         in the case of a former  Participant,  immediately  be restored
         as a  Participant  as of his date of  reemployment,  and in the
         case of an Eligible  Employee who was never a  Participant, 
         become a Participant  in accordance  with  Section 2.01. 
         However,  if a former Participant  received a lump sum 
         settlement  in lieu of a Pension,  the Credited  Service to
         which he was entitled  at the time of his  termination  of
         service  shall be  restored  to him in  accordance  with the

         provisions of Section 3.03(c)(ii).

 (c)     If a Participant entitled to but not in receipt of a Pension or
         a former Participant who received a lump sum settlement in lieu
         of a Pension is reemployed after having had a Break in Service,
         the following shall apply:

         (i)      The Years of Vesting Service to which he was previously
                  entitled shall be restored to him, and if reemployed as an
                  Eligible Employee, he shall immediately be restored as a
                  Participant as of his date of reemployment.

         (ii)     Any Credited Service to which the Participant was entitled at
                  the time of his termination of service shall be restored to
                  him, except that if he received a lump sum settlement by the
                  end of the second Plan Year following the Plan Year in which
                  he incurred a Termination of Employment, that Credited Service
                  shall not be restored to him.

         (iii)    Upon later termination or retirement of a Participant whose
                  previous Credited Service has been restored under this
                  paragraph (c), his Pension shall be based on the benefit
                  formula then in effect and his Certified Earnings and Credited
                  Service before and after the period when he was not in the
                  service of the Employer, and shall be reduced, if
                  applicable, but not below zero, by an amount of Actuarial
                  Equivalent value to any lump


<PAGE>
                                                                         Page 22

                  sum settlement received upon his prior termination. However,
                  in no event shall the reduction provided for in the preceding
                  sentence exceed the portion of the Participant's Pension based
                  on the period of Credited Service included in the calculation
                  of the lump sum payment.

 (d)     If a former Participant who is not entitled to a Pension is
         restored to service, either as an Eligible Employee or as an
         Employee, after having had a Break in Service, the following
         shall apply:

         (i)      He shall again become a Participant as of his date of
                  restoration to service as an Eligible Employee.

         (ii)     Upon his restoration to membership, the Years of Vesting
                  Service to which he was previously entitled shall be restored
                  to him if the total number of consecutive one-year Breaks in
                  Service does not equal or exceed five.

         (iii)    Any Credited Service to which the Participant was entitled at
                  the time of his Termination of Employment of service which is
                  included in the Years of Vesting Service so restored shall be

                  restored to him.

         (iv)     Upon later termination or retirement of a Participant whose
                  previous Credited Service has been restored under this
                  paragraph (d), his Pension, if any, shall be based on the
                  benefit formula then in effect and his Certified Earnings and
                  Credited Service before and after the period when he was not
                  an Eligible Employee.

 (e)     If an Eligible Employee who was never a Participant is restored
         to service with the Employer, after having had a Break in
         Service, the Years of Vesting Service to which he was previously
         entitled under Section 3.01(e) shall be restored to him if he
         would be entitled to nonforfeitable benefits under the Plan if
         he were a Participant, or otherwise, if the total number of
         consecutive one-year Breaks in Service does not equal or exceed
         five.

            ARTICLE 4. ELIGIBILITY FOR AND AMOUNT OF BENEFITS

4.01     Normal Retirement

 (a)     The right of a Participant to his normal retirement Pension
         shall be nonforfeitable as of his Normal Retirement Age. A
         Participant who has attained his Normal Retirement Age may
         retire from service with the Employer and all Affiliates and
         receive a normal retirement Pension beginning on his Normal
         Retirement Date, or he may postpone his retirement and remain in
         service after his Normal Retirement Date, in which event the
         provisions of Section 4.02 shall be applicable.

 (b)     Subject to the provisions of Section 5.01,  the annual normal 
         retirement  Pension payable upon retirement on a  Participant's 
         Normal  Retirement  Date  (provided  he is  alive  on such 
         date)  shall  be equal to .7 percent of the Participant's 
         Final Average  Compensation not in excess of Covered 
         Compensation,  plus 1.3 percent  of such Final  Average 
         Compensation  in excess of Covered  Compensation,  multiplied 
         by the number of years of his Credited  Service up to 35 such
         years;  provided,  however,  that the annual normal retirement 
         Pension of a  Participant  who is affected by the  imposition 
         of the $150,000  limitation  on Certified  Earnings  provided 
         in  Section 1.09  shall be equal to the  greater  of (i) the 
         Participant's Pension  calculated  under the provisions of the
         Plan as determined with regard to such imposition or (ii) a 
         Pension  equal to the  Participant's  Accrued  Benefit 
         determined  as of  December 31,  1993  plus the Participant's 
         Accrued  Benefit based solely on service  after such date under

         the  provisions of the Plan as  determined  with  regard to
         such  imposition.  For  purposes of the Plan,  the  Accrued 
         Benefit as of December 31,  1993 shall be  determined  with
         regard to the  $200,000  limitation  on  Certified  Earnings
         provided  in  Section 1.09,  but  not  less  than  the 
         Participant's  Accrued  Benefit  determined  as of December 31, 
         1988.  However,  the annual normal retirement  Pension shall
         never be less than the greatest

         annual  amount of reduced  early  retirement  Pension  which the 
         Participant  could have  received  under Section 4.03  before his
         Normal Retirement Date and no increase in Covered  Compensation  shall
         decrease a Participant's Accrued Benefit under the Plan.

 (c)     Except as otherwise provided in Section 401(l) of the Code and
         applicable regulations thereunder, the cumulative permitted
         disparity fraction for purposes of computing a Participant's
         normal retirement Pension shall not exceed 35.

 (d)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the minimum monthly Pension
         payable to a Participant shall be equal to $2.00 multiplied by
         his years of Credited Service.

4.02     Late Retirement

 (a)     If a Participant postpones his retirement as provided in Section
         4.01(a), upon his Termination of Employment from the Employer
         and all Affiliates, he shall be entitled to a late retirement
         Pension beginning on the first day of the calendar month after
         the Administrator receives his written application to retire,
         which shall be his late retirement date.

 (b)     A  Participant  who  remains in service  after his Normal 
         Retirement  Date shall be entitled to a monthly retirement 
         Pension for each month during the postponement  period which
         does not constitute a Suspendible Month.  Upon later
         retirement,  the Participant shall be entitled to an immediate
         late retirement  Pension beginning on the  Participant's  late
         retirement date (provided he is alive on such date),  and
         subject to the provisions of Section 5.01,  shall be equal to
         the amount  determined in accordance with  Section 4.01 based
         on the  Participant's  Credited  Service and Final Average 
         Compensation  as of his late  retirement date  reduced by an
         amount  that is the  Actuarial  Equivalent  of any  benefits 
         he  previously  received pursuant to the preceding  sentence; 


<PAGE>
                                                                         Page 25


         provided that if the  Participant's  actual late  retirement
         date is later  than the  first  day of the  first  Plan  Year 
         following  his  Normal  Retirement  Date,  his late retirement 
         Pension  shall be  recomputed  as of the first day of each 
         subsequent  Plan Year  before  the Participant's  actual late 
         retirement  date (and as of his actual late  retirement  date)
         as if each such date were Participant's  late retirement date;
         and provided further that no reduction  hereunder as of the
         date of any such  recomputation  shall reduce the Participant's 
         late retirement  Pension below the amount of late retirement
         Pension payable to the Participant prior to such recomputation.

 (c)     (i)      In the event a Participant's  Pension is required to
                  begin under  Section 5.04(b)  prior to January 1, 
                  1998 and while the Participant is in active service, 
                  such required beginning date shall  not be the 
                  Participant's  Annuity  Starting  Date  for  purposes 
                  of  Article 5  and  the Participant  shall  receive a
                  late  retirement  Pension  commencing  on or before 
                  such  required beginning  date in an amount 
                  determined as if he had retired on such date.  The
                  Pension  payable to the  Participant  during his
                  period of active  service  shall be in the form of a
                  single  life annuity.  Upon  subsequent  retirement, 
                  the  Participant's  Pension  shall be paid in
                  accordance with the Participant's form of payment
                  election made pursuant to Article 5.
         
         (ii)     In the event a Participant's  Pension is required to
                  begin under  Section 5.04(b)  on or after January 1, 
                  1998 and while the Participant in active service, 
                  such beginning date shall be the  Participant's 
                  Annuity  Starting  Date for purposes of  Article 5, 
                  and his Pension shall be paid in accordance with the
                  Participant's form of payment election made pursuant
                  to Article 5.
         
         (iii)    As of each  succeeding  December 31  prior to the 
                  Participant's  actual late retirement date (and as of
                  his actual late retirement date), the  Participant's 
                  Pension shall be recomputed to reflect  additional 
                  accruals.  The Participant's  recomputed Pension shall
                  then be reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of the

                                                                         Page 26

                  
                  total  payments of his late  retirement  Pension which
                  were paid prior to each  such  recomputation  to 
                  arrive  at the  Participant's  late  retirement 
                  Pension; provided that no such reduction  shall reduce
                  the  Participant's  late  retirement  Pension below
                  the amount of late retirement  Pension payable to the

                  Participant  prior to the  recomputation of such
                  Pension.

4.03     Early Retirement

 (a)     A Participant who has not reached his Normal Retirement Date but
         who, prior to his Termination of Employment from the Employer
         and all Affiliates, has reached his 55th birthday and completed
         five Years of Vesting Service may retire from service with the
         Employer and all Affiliates and receive an early retirement
         Pension beginning on the first day of the calendar month after
         the Administrator receives his written application to retire,
         which shall be his early retirement date (provided he is living
         on such date).

 (b)     The early retirement Pension shall be a deferred Pension
         beginning on the Participant's Normal Retirement Date, and
         subject to the provisions of Section 5.01, shall be equal to his
         Accrued Benefit. However, the Participant may elect to receive
         an early retirement Pension beginning on the first day of any
         calendar month before his Normal Retirement Date, provided that
         an early payment date shall be subject to the notice and timing
         requirements described in Section 5.03(b). In that case, the
         Participant's Pension shall be reduced pursuant to Table 2 of
         Appendix A.

4.04     Vesting

 (a)     A Participant shall be 100 percent vested in, and have a
         nonforfeitable right to, his Accrued Benefit upon completion of
         five Years of Vesting Service, counted since the first day of
         the Plan Year in which his 18th birthday occurs if the
         Participant was hired on or after January 1, 1990. If

                                                                         Page 27

         the Participant's employment is subsequently terminated for reasons
         other than retirement or death, he shall be eligible to receive his
         vested Pension after the Administrator receives his written application
         for the Pension.

 (b)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant who was an Eligible
         Employee of the Employer on the Effective Date and whose accrued
         benefit under the Dayton Hudson Corporation Retirement Plan was
         transferred to the Plan shall be 100 percent vested in, and have
         a nonforfeitable right to, his Accrued Benefit under the Plan.

(c)      The vested Pension shall begin on the Participant's Normal
         Retirement Date, and subject to the provisions of Section 5.01,
         shall be equal to his Accrued Benefit. However, the Participant
         may elect to have his vested Pension begin on the first day of
         any calendar month before his Normal Retirement Date (provided

         he is living on such date). In that case, the Participant's
         Pension shall be reduced pursuant to Table 2 of Appendix A.

4.05     Spouse's Pension

 (a)     If a married Participant:
         (i)      dies in active service after reaching age 55 and completing 15
                  years of Credited Service, or

         (ii)     dies in active service prior to reaching age 55 and completing
                  15 years of Credited Service but after having met the
                  requirements for a Pension pursuant to Section 4.01, 4.02,
                  4.03 or 4.04, or

         (iii)    dies after retiring on any Pension, or after terminating
                  service with entitlement to a vested Pension, but in either
                  case before his Annuity Starting Date,


<PAGE>
                                                                         Page 28

                  a spouse's Pension shall be payable to his surviving spouse
                  for life provided that he and his spouse have been married
                  throughout the one-year period ending on the date of his
                  death.

 (b)     The spouse's Pension shall commence on what would have been the
         Participant's Normal Retirement Date (or the first day of the
         month following his date of death, if later). However, the
         Participant's spouse may elect to begin receiving payments as of
         the first day of any month following the Participant's date of
         death and prior to what would have been his Normal Retirement
         Date, provided such election is made on a form provided by the
         Administrator during the 90-day period ending on the date the
         payments to the spouse commence.

 (c)     (i)      The spouse's  Pension payable to the eligible spouse, 
                  if any, of a married  Participant described  in 
                  paragraph (a)(i)  above shall be equal to  50 percent 
                  of the monthly  Pension the Participant  would have 
                  received if he had a  Termination  of  Employment  on
                  the day before his death and elected to have his
                  Pension  commence  on his Normal  Retirement  Date in
                  the form of a single  life  annuity.  This  spouse's 
                  Pension  shall be  payable  for the life of the 
                  eligible spouse  and  shall  not  be  reduced  for 
                  commencement   prior  to  what  would  have  been  the
                  Participant's Normal Retirement Date.
         
         (ii)     Before  reduction in accordance  with  paragraph (d)
                  below (with regard to a Participant who has had a
                  Termination of Employment),  the spouse's  Pension
                  payable to the eligible  spouse, if any, of a

                  Participant  described in  paragraph (a)(ii)  or
                  (a)(iii)  above,  shall be equal to the amount of
                  benefit the spouse  would have  received  if the 
                  Pension to which the  Participant was entitled at his
                  date of death had commenced on his Normal  Retirement 
                  Date (or the first day of the  month  following  his
                  date of  death,  if  later)  in the form of a 
                  Qualified  Joint and Survivor  Annuity and the
                  Participant had died  immediately  thereafter. 
                  However,  if within the 90 day period prior to his
                  Annuity  Starting Date a

         

<PAGE>
                                                                         Page 29

                  Participant  has elected an optional form of Pension  which 
                  provides  for monthly  payments  to his spouse for life in an
                  amount  equal to at least  50 percent  but not more than  100
                  percent  of the monthly amount payable under the option for
                  the life of the  Participant  and such option is the 
                  Actuarial  Equivalent  of the Qualified Joint and  Survivor 
                  Annuity,  such  optional  form of Pension  shall be used for 
                  computing  the spouse's  Pension  instead of the  Qualified 
                  Joint and Survivor  Annuity.  The spouse's  Pension shall  be 
                  further  adjusted  to  reflect  its  commencement  prior to
                  the  Participant's  Normal Retirement Date as follows:
                
                  (A)     if the spouse of a  Participant  who dies
                          after  having met the  requirements  for early
                          retirement  elects early  commencement in
                          accordance with paragraph (b) above,  the
                          amount of the Pension  payable to the spouse
                          will be based on the amount of early 
                          retirement  Pension to which the  Participant 
                          would have been  entitled  if he had 
                          requested  benefit  commencement  at that
                          earlier date, reduced in accordance with
                          Section 4.03(b); and
           
                  (B)     if the spouse of any other  Participant  who
                          dies  prior to his  Annuity  Starting  Date
                          elects early  commencement  in accordance 
                          with  paragraph  (b) above,  the amount of the
                          Pension payable to the spouse  shall be based
                          on the  amount of vested  Pension to which the 
                          Participant would have been entitled if he had
                          requested benefit  commencement at that
                          earlier date,  reduced in accordance with
                          Section 4.04(c).

 (d)     With respect to a  Participant  who has incurred a Termination 
         of Employment  and whose spouse would have been entitled to a

         spouse's Pension under this Section had the  Participant's 
         death occurred prior to his Annuity  Starting  Date, the
         Pension  subsequently  payable to such  Participant  or the
         spouse's  Pension payable to his  spouse  after his  death, 
         whichever  is  applicable,  shall be reduced by the  applicable
         percentage  shown in the following table for each full month
         that the

         provisions of this  Section 4.05 are in  effect  with  respect  to the 
         Participant  after  his  Termination  of  Employment  and  prior to the
         Participant's  Annuity Starting Date or his date of death, if earlier. 
         Notwithstanding the foregoing,  no such  reduction  shall  be  made 
         with  respect  to any  period  before  the  later  of (i) the  date 
         the Administrator  furnishes  the  Participant  the  notice  of his 
         right to waive the  spouse's  Pension  in accordance  with  paragraph 
         (e)  below or (ii) the  commencement  of the  election  period

         effect of, an election  to waive the  spouse's  Pension,  (iii)
         the rights of the  Participant's  spouse,  and (vi) the right
         to make, and the effect of, a revocation of such an  election.

         the  spouse's  Pension to each Participant  as  soon  as 
         practicable  following  the  date  the  Participant  incurs  a

         spouse's Pension shall be effective only if it includes Spousal Consent
         to such election.

4.06     Maximum Benefit Limitation

         Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the
         maximum annual Pension payable to a Participant under the Plan
         shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 415 of
         the Code and any regulations issued thereunder. If the Pension
         begins before the Participant's 62nd birthday, the dollar
         limitation described in Section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Code shall
         be the Actuarial Equivalent of the maximum benefit payable at
         age 62. If the Pension begins after the Participant's Social
         Security Retirement Age, such dollar limitation shall be the
         Actuarial Equivalent of the maximum benefit payable at the
         Social Security Retirement Age. If the Pension is payable
         neither as a life annuity nor as a qualified joint and survivor
         annuity with the Participant's spouse as beneficiary, the
         maximum limitation shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the
         maximum limitation otherwise applicable. Actuarial Equivalent
         for the purposes of this Section 4.06 shall be determined in
         accordance with Section 415(b) of the Code and the regulations
         or rulings issued thereunder and using the Plan's early
         retirement, late retirement or optional benefit factors as
         appropriate, or if less, using factors calculated from the IRS
         Mortality Table, if applicable, and (i) with respect to an
         adjustment required under Section 415(b)(2)(B) or (C) of the
         Code, the IRS Interest Rate if the Pension is subject to the
         provisions of Section 417(e)(3) of the Code or 5 percent
         otherwise; and (ii) with respect to an adjustment required under
         Section 415(b)(2)(D) of the Code, an interest rate of 5 percent.

         If a Participant is a participant in any qualified defined
         contribution plan required to be taken into account for purposes
         of applying the combined plan limitations contained in Section
         415(e) of

         the Code, then for any year the sum of the defined
         benefit plan fraction and the defined contribution plan
         fraction, as such terms are defined in said Section 415(e),

         shall not exceed 1.0. If for any year the foregoing combined
         plan limitation would be exceeded, the benefit provided under
         this Plan shall be reduced to the extent necessary to meet that
         limitation.

         As of January 1 of each calendar year commencing on or after
         January 1, 1988, the dollar limitation as determined by the
         Commissioner of Internal Revenue for that calendar year shall
         become effective as the maximum permissible dollar amount of
         Pensions payable under the Plan during the Limitation Year
         ending within that calendar year, including Pensions payable to
         Participants who retired prior to that Limitation Year.

4.07     Transfers and Employment with an Affiliate

 (a)     If an Eligible  Employee (i) becomes  employed by the  Employer
         in any capacity  other than as an Eligible Employee as defined
         in  Article 1,  (ii)  becomes  employed  by an  Affiliate,  or
         (iii)  becomes a Leased Employee,  he shall  retain any 
         Credited  Service he has under this Plan.  Upon his later 
         retirement  or termination of employment  with the Employer or
         Affiliate (or upon benefit  commencement  in the case of a
         Leased  Employee),  any  benefits  to which the  Eligible 
         Employee  is  entitled  under the Plan shall be determined 
         under the Plan  provisions  in effect on the date he  ceases 
         to be an  Eligible  Employee  as defined in Article 1,  and
         only on the basis of his Credited  Service accrued and
         Certified  Earnings paid while he was an Eligible Employee as
         defined in Article 1.

         (b)     Subject to the Break in Service provisions of Article 3, in the
         case of a person who (i) was originally employed by the Employer in any
         capacity other than as an Eligible Employee as defined in Article 1,
         (ii) was originally employed by an Affiliate, or (iii) was originally
         providing  services to the Employer as a Leased Employee, and
         thereafter becomes

         an Eligible Employee, upon his later retirement or termination of
         employment, the benefits payable under the Plan shall be computed under
         the Plan provisions in effect at that time, and only on the basis of
         the Credited Service accrued and Certified Earnings paid while he is an
         Eligible Employee as defined in Article 1.

                      ARTICLE 5. PAYMENT OF PENSIONS


5.01     Automatic Form of Payment

 (a)     If the Participant is not married on his Annuity Starting Date,
         his Pension shall be payable in monthly installments ending with
         the last monthly payment before death, unless the Participant
         has elected an optional benefit as provided in Section 5.02.

 (b)     If the  Participant  is married on his Annuity  Starting  Date,
         and if he has not elected an optional form of benefit as
         provided in  Section 5.02,  the Pension  payable  shall be in
         the form of a Qualified  Joint and Survivor Annuity that is the
         Actuarial  Equivalent of the Pension otherwise  payable, 
         providing for a reduced Pension  payable to the  Participant 
         during his life, and after his death providing that one-half of
         that  reduced  Pension  will  continue to be paid during the
         life of, and to, the spouse to whom he was married  on  his 
         Annuity  Starting  Date.  Notwithstanding  the  preceding,  if
         an  option  described  in Section 5.02  provides for payments
         continuing after the Participant's death for the life of a
         Beneficiary at a rate of at least  50 percent  but not more
         than  100 percent  of the Pension  payable for the life of the 
         Participant  and if such option,  with the spouse to whom the 
         Participant  is married on his Annuity Starting  Date named as 
         Beneficiary,  would be of  greater  actuarial  value than the
         joint and  survivor annuity  described  above,  such option
         with such spouse as Beneficiary  shall be the Qualified  Joint
         and Survivor Annuity.

(c)      In any case, a lump sum payment  that is the  Actuarial Equivalent
         shall be made in lieu of all benefits if the present value of the
         Pension  payable to or on the behalf of the  Participant  determined as
         of the Participant's  Normal  Retirement Date or actual  Termination of
         Employment,  if later,  amounts to $3,500 (effective  January 1, 1998, 
         $5,000 or less). In determining  the amount of a lump sum payment 
         payable under this

                                                                         Page 35
         
         paragraph to a  Participant  whose Annuity  Starting Date is on or
         after January 1, 1998,  (i) Actuarial  Equivalent  shall  mean a 
         benefit,  in the  case of a lump  sum  benefit  payable  prior  to a
         Participant's  Normal  Retirement Date, of equivalent value to the
         benefit which would otherwise have been provided commencing at the
         Participant's  Normal Retirement Date, and (ii) the Actuarial 
         Equivalent shall be determined by using the IRS Mortality Table and the
         IRS Interest Rate.  Unless  otherwise  permitted by applicable  law, 
         the  determination  as to  whether  a lump sum  payment  is due shall
         be made as soon as practicable  following the  Participant's 
         termination of service or death.  Any lump sum benefit  payable shall

         be made as soon as  practicable  following  such  determination  and in
         any event  prior to the date Pension payments would have otherwise
         commenced as an annuity.

         In the event a Participant is not entitled to any Pension upon his
         Termination of Employment, he shall be deemed cashed-out under the
         provisions of this paragraph (c) as of the date he terminated service.
         However, if a Participant described in the preceding sentence is
         subsequently restored to service, the provisions of Section 3.03 shall
         apply to him without regard to such sentence.

5.02     Optional Forms of Payment

         Any Participant may, subject to the provisions of Section 5.03,
         elect to convert the Pension otherwise payable to him into an
         optional benefit that is the Actuarial Equivalent, as provided
         in one of the options named below.

            Ten-Year Certain and Life      A modified Pension payable
                     Option                during the Participant's
                                           life; if the  Participant
                                           dies within 120 months of his
                                           Annuity

                                           Beneficiary named by him when
                                           he elected the option; provided that
                                           if the Beneficiary does not survive
                                           the 120-month period, a lump sum
                                           payment that is the Actuarial
                                           Equivalent as determined in Table 1
                                           of Appendix A of the remaining
                                           payments shall be paid to the estate
                                           of the last to survive of the
                                           Participant and the Beneficiary.

                                           and after his death payable
                                           at 50 percent of the rate of
                                           his modified Pension during
                                           the life of, and to, the
                                           Beneficiary named by him when
                                           he elected the option. The
                                           Pension payable to the

                                           determined by multiplying the
                                           amount that would be paid to
                                           the Participant as a single

                                           life annuity by a reduction

                                           a single cash lump sum or
                                           monthly installments over a
                                           period to be selected by the
                                           Participant. In determining
                                           the amount of a lump sum

                                           under this Section to a
                                           Participant whose Annuity
                                           Starting Date is on or after

                                           Normal Retirement Date, of
                                           equivalent value to the
                                           benefit which would otherwise
                                           have been provided commencing
                                           at the Participant's Normal
                                           Retirement Date, and (b)
                                           Actuarial Equivalent shall be
                                           determined on the basis of
                                           the IRS Mortality Table and
                                           the IRS Interest Rate.

         If a Participant dies after Pension payments have commenced, any

 (a)     A married Participant's election of any option shall only be
         effective if Spousal Consent to the election is received by the

         (i)      the option provides for monthly payments to his spouse for
                  life after the Participant's death, in an amount equal to at
                  least 50 percent but not more than 100 percent of the monthly
                  amount payable under the option to the Participant, and

         than 30 days and no more than 90 days,  before his Annuity

         to the date the Participant receives the written explanation
         described in paragraph (b).

 (d)     Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) above, a
         Participant may, after having received the notice, affirmatively
         elect to have his benefit commence sooner than 30 days following
         his receipt of the notice, provided all of the following
         requirements are met:
         
         (i)      the Administrator clearly informs the Participant
                  that he has a period of at least 30 days after
                  receiving the notice to decide when to have his

                  particular optional form of payment; 

         (ii)     the Participant affirmatively elects a date for his

         to time during the election period  specified  in 
         paragraph (c)  or (d) above,  whichever is  applicable.  An
         election of an optional benefit shall be effective on the 
         Participant's  Annuity Starting Date and may not be modified or
         revoked after his Annuity  Starting Date unless  otherwise 
         provided  under  paragraph (d)  above. A revocation of any 
         election  shall  be  effective  when  the  completed  form is

         of the option  becomes effective,  the  election  shall be
         revoked  except as provided  in  Section 4.05(c).  If the 
         Beneficiary designated  under an option  dies  before the date
         the  election  of the  option  becomes  effective,  the
         election shall be revoked.

5.04     Commencement of Payments

 (a)     Except as otherwise provided in Article 4 or this Article 5,
         payment of a Participant's Pension shall begin as soon as
         administratively practicable following the latest of (i) the
         Participant's 65th birthday, (ii) the fifth anniversary of the
         date on which he became a Participant, or (iii) the
         Participant's Termination of Employment, (but not more than 60
         days after the close of the Plan Year in which the latest of
         (i), (ii) or (iii) occurs); provided, however, that if the
         amount of the payment to be made cannot be determined by 60 days
         following the Plan Year in which the latest of (i), (ii), or
         (iii) occur, a payment retroactive to that date shall be made.

 (b)     Notwithstanding  the preceding  paragraph and except as
         provided  below,  in the case of a Participant  in active 

         service who owns either (i) more than 5 percent of the 
         outstanding  stock of the Employer or (ii) stock  possessing 
         more than  5 percent of the total  combined  voting power of
         all stock of the Employer, the  Participant's  Pension shall
         begin not later than the April 1 following the calendar year in
         which he attains  age 70 1/2.  On and  after  the first day of

                                                                         Page 41

         

         later than April 1 of the calendar  year  following the calendar year
         in which he attains age 70 1/2,  provided that such  commencement  in
         active  service shall not be required  with respect to a  Participant 
         who attains age 70 1/2prior to  January 1, 1988 and who is not a
         5-percent owner as described above.

5.05     Distribution Limitation

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 5, all
         distributions from this Plan shall conform to the regulations
         issued under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code, including the
         incidental death benefit provisions of Section 401(a)(9)(G) of
         the Code. Further, such regulations shall override any Plan
         provision that is inconsistent with Section 401(a)(9) of the
         Code. For purposes of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code, the life
         expectancies of Participants and their spouses shall not be
         recalculated.

5.06     Direct Rollover of Certain Distributions

 (a)     This Section applies to certain distributions made on or after
         January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to
         the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election
         under this Article, a distributee may elect, at the time and in
         the manner prescribed by the Administrator, to have any portion
         of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an
         eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a
         direct rollover.

 (b)     The following definitions apply to the terms used in this
         Section:
         
         (i)      An "eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution of all
                  or any portion of the balance to the credit of the
                  distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution
                  does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of
                  substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently
                  than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the 
                  distributee 



<PAGE>
                                                                         Page 42

                  or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the 
                  distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or
                  for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution
                  to the extent such distribution is required under Section
                  401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution
                  that is not includible in gross income (determined without
                  regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with
                  respect to employer securities); 

         (ii)     An "eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement
                  account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual
                  retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an
                  annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, or a
                  qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code, that
                  accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution.
                  However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to
                  the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an
                  individual retirement account or individual retirement
                  annuity;
         
         (iii)    A "distributee" includes an Eligible Employee or former
                  Eligible Employee. In addition, the Eligible Employee's or
                  former Eligible Employee's surviving spouse and the Eligible
                  Employee's or former Eligible Employee's spouse or former
                  spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic
                  relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, are
                  distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or
                  former spouse; and

         (iv)     A "direct rollover" is a payment by the Plan to the eligible
                  retirement plan specified by the distributee.
        
         In the event that the provisions of this Section 5.06 or any
         part thereof cease to be required by law as a result of
         subsequent legislation or otherwise, this Section or any
         applicable part thereof shall be ineffective without the
         necessity of further amendments to the Plan.

6.01     Employer's Contributions

         It is the intention of the Employer to continue the Plan and

         make the contributions that are necessary to maintain the Plan

         standards prescribed by law. However, subject to the provisions
         of Article 10, the Employer may discontinue its contributions

6.02     Return of Contributions

 (a)     The Employer's contributions to the Plan are conditioned upon
         their deductibility under Section 404 of the Code. If all or
         part of the Employer's deductions for contributions to the Plan
         are disallowed by the Internal Revenue Service, the portion of
         the contributions to which that disallowance applies shall be
         returned to the Employer without interest, but reduced by any
         investment loss attributable to those contributions. The return
         shall be made within one year after the date of the disallowance
         of deduction.

 (b)     The Employer may recover without interest the amount of its
         contributions to the Plan made on account of a mistake in fact,
         reduced by any investment loss attributable to those
         contributions, if recovery is made within one year after the
         date of those contributions.

         forms, make such rules,  regulations,  interpretations and
         computations and shall take such other action to administer the
         Plan as it may deem  appropriate.  In  administering  the Plan,

         the Company shall act in a  nondiscriminatory  manner to the

                  of the Plan are allocated, by resolution of the Board
                  of Directors or by written instrument executed by the

         In addition to any other applicable arrangements for
         indemnification, the Employers jointly and severally agree to

         legal fees) of whatsoever kind and nature which may be imposed
         on, incurred by, or asserted against such person at any time by
         reason of such person's services as a fiduciary in connection
         with the Plan, but only if such person did not act dishonestly,
         or in bad faith, or in willful violation of the law or
         regulations under which such liability, loss, cost, or expense
         arises.

7.07     Establishment of Rules

         Subject to the limitations of the Plan, the Administrator from
         time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the
         Plan and the transaction of Plan business. The Administrator
         shall have discretionary authority to interpret the Plan and to
         make factual determinations (including but not limited to,
         determination of an individual's eligibility for Plan
         participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under
         the Plan and the date on which any individual ceases to be a
         Participant). The determination of the Administrator as to the
         interpretation of the Plan or any disputed question shall be
         conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law.

7.08     Correction of Errors

         It is recognized that in the operation and administration of the
         Plan certain mathematical and accounting errors may be made or
         mistakes may arise by reason of factual errors in information
         supplied to the Company or Funding Agent. The Company shall have
         power to cause such equitable adjustments to be made to correct
         for such errors as the Company in its discretion considers
         appropriate. Such adjustments shall be final and binding on all
         persons.

7.09     Prudent Conduct

         The Administrator shall use that degree of care, skill, prudence

         and diligence that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and
         familiar with such matters would use in a similar situation.

7.10     Actuary

         As an aid to the Administrator in fixing the rate of
         contributions payable to the Plan, the actuary designated by the
         Company shall make annual actuarial valuations of the contingent
         assets and liabilities of the Plan, and shall submit to the
         Company the rates of contribution recommended for use.

7.11     Maintenance of Accounts

         The Administrator shall maintain accounts showing the fiscal
         transactions of the Plan and shall keep in convenient form such
         data as may be necessary for actuarial valuations of the Plan.

7.12     Records

         Each Employer, each fiduciary with respect to the Plan, and each
         other person performing any functions in the operation or
         administration of the Plan or the management or control of the
         assets of the Plan shall keep such records as may be necessary
         or appropriate in the discharge of their respective functions
         hereunder, including records required by ERISA or any other
         applicable law. Records shall be retained as long as necessary
         for the proper administration of the Plan and at least for any
         period required by ERISA or other applicable law.

7.13     Appointment of Investment Manager

         The Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine the
         investment policy for the Plan. However, the Company may, in its
         sole discretion, appoint one or more investment managers to

                                                                         Page 48

         manage the assets of the Plan (including the power to acquire
         and dispose of all or part of such assets) as the Company shall
         designate. In that event, the authority over and responsibility
         for the management of the assets so designated shall be the sole
         responsibility of that investment manager.

         For purposes of this Article, the term "investment manager"
         means an individual who:

                  with respect to the Plan.

7.14     Expenses of Administration

         All expenses that arise in connection with the administration of
         the Plan, including but not limited to the compensation of the
         Trustee, administrative expenses and proper charges and
         disbursements of the Trustee and compensation and other expenses
         and charges of any enrolled actuary, counsel, accountant,
         specialist, or other person who has been retained by the Company
         in connection with the administration thereof, shall be paid
         from the funds of the Plan held by the Trustee under the trust
         agreement adopted for use in implementing the Plan, to the
         extent not paid by the Employer.

7.15     Claims and Review Procedures

 (a)     Applications for benefits and inquiries concerning the Plan (or
         concerning present or future rights to benefits under the Plan)
         shall be submitted to the Company in writing. An application

                                                                         Page 49

         for benefits shall be submitted on the prescribed form and shall be
         signed by the Participant, or in the case of a benefit payable
         after his death, by his Beneficiary.

 (b)     In the event that an  application  for  benefits is denied in
         whole or in part,  the Company  shall notify the  applicant  in 
         writing of the denial and of the right to review of the 
         denial.  The  written  notice shall set forth,  in a manner 
         calculated  to be  understood by the  applicant,  specific 
         reasons for the denial,  specific  references to the provisions
         of the Plan on which the denial is based, a description of any 
         information  or material  necessary for the applicant to
         perfect the  application,  an explanation of why the material
         is necessary,  and an  explanation  of the review  procedure 
         under the Plan. The written notice shall be given to the 
         applicant  within a reasonable  period of time (not more than
         90 days) after the Company received the  application,  unless
         special  circumstances  require further time for processing and
         the  applicant is advised of the  extension.  In no event shall
         the notice be given more than 180 days after the Company
         received the application.

 (c)     The Company shall from time to time appoint a committee (the

         "Review Panel") that shall consist of three individuals who may,
         but need not, be Eligible Employees. The Review Panel shall be
         the named fiduciary that has the authority to act with respect
         to any appeal from a denial of benefits or a determination of
         benefit rights.

 (d)     An  applicant  whose  application  for  benefits  was  denied
         in whole or part,  or the  applicant's  duly authorized 
         representative,  may appeal  the denial by  submitting  to the 
         Review  Panel a request  for a review of the application 
         within 60 days after  receiving  written notice of the denial
         from the Company. The Company shall give the applicant or his 
         representative an opportunity to review pertinent  materials,
         other than  legally  privileged  documents,  in  preparing  the 
         request  for a  review.  The request for a review  shall be in
         writing and  addressed



<PAGE>
                                                                         Page 50
        
         to the Review Panel.  The request for a review shall set forth all of
         the grounds on which it is based,  all facts in support of the request
         and any other  matters  that the  applicant  deems  pertinent. The
         Review Panel may require the  applicant  to submit such additional
         facts, documents or other materials as it may deem necessary or
         appropriate in making its review.

 (e)     The Review  Panel shall act on each  request for a review 
         within 60 days after  receipt,  unless  special circumstances 
         require  further time for processing  and the applicant is
         advised of the extension.  In no event shall the  decision on
         review be rendered  more than 120 days after the Review  Panel 
         received  the request  for a  review.  The  Review  Panel 
         shall  give  prompt  written  notice of its  decision  to the
         applicant and or the Company.  In the event that the Review
         Panel  confirms the denial of the  application for benefits in
         whole or in part, the notice shall set forth,  in a manner 
         calculated to be understood by the  applicant,  the specific 
         reasons for the decision and specific  references to the 
         provisions of the Plan on which the decision is based.

 (f)     The Review Panel shall adopt such rules, procedures and
         interpretations of the Plan as it deems necessary or appropriate
         in carrying out its responsibilities under this Section 7.15. In
         carrying out such responsibilities, the Review Panel shall have
         the sole and complete discretion to interpret and administer the
         terms of the Plan and to determine eligibility for benefits and
         the amount of any such benefits pursuant to the terms of the
         Plan, and in so doing the Review Panel may correct defects,
         supply omissions and reconcile inconsistencies to the extent
         necessary to effectuate the Plan, and such actions shall be
         binding and conclusive on all persons.


 (g)     No legal action for benefits under the Plan shall be brought
         unless and until the claimant (i) has submitted a written
         application for benefits in accordance with paragraph (a), (ii)
         has been

         notified by the Company that the application is denied,
         (iii) has filed a written request for a review of the
         application in accordance with paragraph (d) and (iv) has been
         notified in writing that the Review Panel has affirmed the
         denial of the application; provided, however, that legal action
         may be brought after the Company or the Review Panel has failed
         to take any action on the claim within the time prescribed by
         paragraphs (b) and (e) above.

                      ARTICLE 8. MANAGEMENT OF FUNDS

8.01     Funding Agent

 (a)     All the funds of the Plan  shall be held by a Funding  Agent 
         appointed  from time to time by the  Company under a trust
         instrument or an insurance or annuity contract  adopted,  or as
         amended,  by the Company for use in providing  the benefits of
         the Plan and paying its expenses not paid  directly by the
         Company.  The Company  shall  have the right to  determine  the
         form and  substance  of each trust  agreement  and group
         annuity  contract under which any part of the funds of the Plan
         is held,  subject only to the  requirement that they are not 
         inconsistent  with the  provisions  of the Plan.  Any such
         trust  agreement may contain provisions  pursuant to which the 
         trustee  will make  investments  on  direction  of a third 
         party.  The Company shall have no liability for the payment of
         benefits under the Plan nor for the  administration  of the
         funds paid over to the Funding Agent.

 (b)     The Company shall issue such written directions to the Funding
         Agent as are necessary to accomplish distributions to the
         Participants and Beneficiaries in accordance with the provisions
         of the Plan.

 (c)     The Funding Agent shall be entitled to receive such reasonable
         compensation for its services as may be agreed upon with the
         Company. The Funding Agent shall also be entitled to
         reimbursement for all reasonable and necessary costs, expenses,

         and disbursements incurred by it in the performance of its
         services. Such compensation and reimbursements shall be paid
         from the Trust Fund if not paid directly by the Company.

8.02     Exclusive Benefit Rule

         Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, no part of the corpus
         or income of the funds of the Plan shall be used for, or
         diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of
         Participants and other persons entitled to benefits under the
         Plan and paying Plan expenses not otherwise paid by the
         Employer, before the satisfaction of all liabilities with
         respect to them. No person shall have any interest in or right
         to any part of the earnings of the funds of the Plan, or any
         right in, or to, any part of the assets held under the Plan,
         except as and to the extent expressly provided in the Plan.

8.03     Funding Policy

         The Company shall adopt a procedure, and revise it from time to
         time as it shall consider advisable, for establishing and
         carrying out a funding policy and method consistent with the
         objectives of the Plan and the requirements of ERISA. It shall
         advise each Funding Agent of the funding policy in effect from
         time to time.

                      ARTICLE 9. GENERAL PROVISIONS

9.01     Nonalienation

         Except as required by any applicable law, no benefit under the
         Plan shall in any manner be anticipated, assigned or alienated,
         and any attempt to do so shall be void. However, payment shall
         be made in accordance with the provisions of any judgment,
         decree, or order which:

         (a)      creates for, or assigns to, a spouse, former
                  spouse, child or other dependent of a Participant the right to
                  receive all or a portion of the Participant's benefits under
                  the Plan for the purpose of providing child support, alimony
                  payments or marital property rights to that spouse, child or
                  dependent,


         (b)      is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law,

                  any option, not otherwise provided under the Plan, and
                  
         (d)      otherwise meets the requirements of Section 206(d) of ERISA,
                  as amended, as a "qualified domestic relations order", as
                  determined by the Administrator.
         
         If the present value of any series of payments meeting the
         criteria set forth in clauses (a) through (d) above amounts to
         $3,500 or less, a lump sum payment that is the Actuarial
         Equivalent, determined in the manner described in Section
         5.01(c), shall be made in lieu of the series of payments.

9.02     Conditions of Employment Not Affected by Plan

         Participation in the Plan shall not confer any legal rights upon
         any Eligible Employee or other person for a continuation of
         employment, nor shall it interfere with the right of the
         Employer (which right is hereby reserved) to discharge any
         Eligible Employee and to treat him without regard to the effect which
         that treatment might have upon him as a

         Participant or potential Participant of the Plan.

9.03     Facility of Payment

         If in the opinion of the Administrator a Participant or other
         person entitled to a benefit hereunder is unable to care for his
         affairs because of illness or accident or because he is a minor,
         the Administrator may direct that any benefit due him, unless
         claim shall have been made for the benefit by a duly appointed
         guardian or other legal representative, be paid to his spouse, a
         child, a parent or other blood relative, or any other person or
         institution then in the opinion of the Administrator caring for
         or maintaining the Participant or other person during this
         period, or to a person with whom he resides. Any payment so made
         shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the Plan for
         that benefit.

9.04     Information

         Each Participant or other person entitled to a benefit, before
         any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the
         Plan, shall file with the Company the information that it shall
         require to establish his rights and benefits under the Plan.

                  Code.

 (b)     For purposes of this  Section,  the Plan shall be  "top-heavy" 
         with respect to any Plan Year if as of the applicable 
         determination  date the top-heavy  ratio  exceeds  60 percent. 
         The  top-heavy  ratio shall be determined as of the applicable 
         valuation  date in accordance  with  Section 416(g)(3)  and
         (4)(B) of the Code on the basis of the UP-1984  Mortality 
         Table and an interest rate of 5 percent  per year  compounded
         annually.  For  purposes of  determining  whether  the Plan is 
         top-heavy,  the  present  value of Accrued Benefits  under the
         Plan will be combined with the present value of accrued 
         benefits or account  balances under each  other  plan in the 
         required  aggregation  group,  and in the  Employer's 
         discretion,  may be combined  with the  present  value of
         accrued  benefits  or  account  balances  under any other 
         qualified plan(s) in the permissive  aggregation  group.  The
         accrued  benefit of a non-key  employee under the Plan or any
         other defined benefit plan in the aggregation  group shall be
         (i) determined  under the method,  if any,  that  uniformly 
         applies for  accrual  purposes  under all plans  maintained  by
         the  Employer or an Affiliate,  or (ii) if there is no such 
         method,  as if such  benefit  accrued not more  rapidly  than
         the slowest accrual rate permitted under the fractional rule
         described in Section 411(b)(1)(C) of the Code.

 (c)     The following provisions shall be applicable to Participants for
         any Plan Year with respect to which the Plan is top-heavy:

         (i)      In lieu of the vesting requirements specified in Section 4.04,
                  a Participant shall be vested in, and have a nonforfeitable

                  right to, a percentage of his Accrued Benefit determined in
                  accordance with the provisions of Section 1.01 and
                  subparagraph (ii) below, as set forth in the following vesting
                  schedule:
 
                                Years of Vesting           Percentage
                                    Service                  Vested
                                ----------------           -----------
                                Less than 2 years               0%
                                    2 years                    20
                                    3 years                    40
                                    4 years                    60
                                 5 or more years              100
 
         (ii)     The Accrued Benefit of a Participant who is a non-key employee
                  shall not be less than 2 percent of his average remuneration
                  multiplied by the number of years of his Years of Vesting
                  Service, not in excess of 10, during the Plan Years for which
                  the Plan is top-heavy. That minimum benefit shall be payable
                  at a Participant's Normal Retirement Date. If payments
                  commence at a time other than the Participant's Normal
                  Retirement Date, the minimum Accrued Benefit shall be the
                  Actuarial Equivalent of that minimum benefit.

         (iii)    The multiplier "1.25" in Sections 415(e)(2)(B)(i) and
                  (3)(B)(i) of the Code shall be reduced to "1.0", and the
                  dollar amount "$51,875" in Section 415(e)(6)(B)(i)(I) of the
                  Code shall be reduced to "$41,500".

 (d)     If the Plan is top-heavy with respect to a Plan Year and ceases
         to be top-heavy for a subsequent Plan Year, the following
         provisions shall be applicable:

         (i)      The Accrued Benefit in any such subsequent Plan Year shall 
                  not be less than the minimum Accrued Benefit provided in 
                  paragraph (c)(ii) above, computed as of the end of the most
                  recent Plan Year for which the Plan was top-heavy.


<PAGE>
                                                                         Page 59

         (ii)     If a Participant has completed three years of Years of 
                  Vesting Service on or before the last day of the most recent 
                  Plan Year for which the Plan was top-heavy, the vesting 
                  schedule set forth in paragraph (c)(i) above shall continue
                  to be applicable.

         (iii)    If a Participant has completed at least two, but less than 
                  three, years of Years of Vesting Service on or before the 
                  last day of the most recent Plan Year for which the Plan was
                  top-heavy, the vesting provisions of Section 4.04 shall 
                  again be applicable; provided, however, that in no event 
                  shall the vested percentage of a Participant's Accrued Benefit

                  be less than the percentage determined under paragraph (c)(i) 
                  above as of the last day of the most recent Plan Year for 
                  which the Plan was top-heavy.

9.06     Offsets

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the monthly amounts
         otherwise payable hereunder shall be reduced by the amount
         (expressed on a comparable basis that is an Actuarial
         Equivalent) of the monthly pension, if any, to which the
         Participant is entitled under any other pension plan that meets
         the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code, or any
         comparable section or sections of any future legislation that
         amends, supplements, or supersedes said section, and that is
         financed in whole or in part by an Employer but only to the
         extent such other pension is attributable to employer
         contributions and to the same period of service for which the
         pension is being paid under this Plan.

9.07     Construction

 (a)     The Plan shall be construed, regulated and administered under
         ERISA as in effect from time to time, and the laws of the State
         of New York, except where ERISA controls.

 (b)     The masculine pronoun shall mean the feminine where
         appropriate, and vice versa.

 (c)     The titles and headings of the Articles and Sections in this
         Plan are for convenience only. In case of ambiguity or
         inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall
         control.

9.08     Prevention of Escheat

         If the Administrator cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any
         person to whom a payment is due under the Plan, the
         Administrator may, no earlier than three years from the date
         such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment
         to the last known address of such person as shown on the records
         of the Administrator or the Employer. If such person has not
         made written claim therefor within three months of the date of
         the mailing, the Administrator may, if it so elects and upon
         receiving advice from counsel to the Plan, direct that such
         payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be
         canceled on the records of the Plan and the amount thereof
         applied to reduce the contributions of the Employer. Upon such
         cancellation, the Plan shall have no further liability therefor
         except that, in the event such person or his Beneficiary later

         notifies the Administrator of his whereabouts and requests the
         payment or payments due to him under the Plan, the amount so
         applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions
         of the Plan.

              ARTICLE 10. AMENDMENT, MERGER, AND TERMINATION

10.01    Amendment of Plan

         The Company, by action of its Board of Directors or by action of
         a person so authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors,
         reserves the right at any time and from time to time, and
         retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in
         whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the Plan.
         However, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the
         funds of the Plan to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other
         than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits
         under the Plan, before the satisfaction of all liabilities with
         respect to them. No amendment shall be made which has the effect
         of decreasing the Protected Benefit of any Participant or of
         reducing the nonforfeitable percentage of the Accrued Benefit of
         a Participant below the nonforfeitable percentage computed under
         the Plan as in effect on the date on which the amendment is
         adopted, or if later, the date on which the amendment becomes
         effective.

10.02    Merger, Consolidation, or Transfer

         The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, merge this
         Plan with another qualified plan, subject to any applicable
         legal requirements. However, the Plan may not be merged or
         consolidated with, and its assets or liabilities may not be
         transferred to, any other plan unless each person entitled to
         benefits under the Plan would, if the resulting plan were then
         terminated, receive a benefit immediately after the merger,
         consolidation, or transfer which is equal to or greater than the
         benefit he would have been entitled to receive immediately
         before the merger, consolidation, or transfer if the Plan had
         then terminated.

10.03    Additional Participating Employers

 (a)     If any  company  is now or  becomes a  subsidiary  or 
         associated  company  of an  Employer,  the Board of Directors 
         may  include the  employees  of that  company in the 

         membership  of the Plan upon  appropriate action by that 
         company  necessary to adopt the Plan.  In that event,  or if
         any persons  become  Eligible Employees of an Employer as the
         result of merger or  consolidation  or as the result of
         acquisition of all or part of the assets or business of another 
         company,  the Board of  Directors  shall  determine  to what
         extent,  if any,  credit  and  benefits  shall be  granted  for 
         previous  service  with  the  subsidiary, associated  or other 
         company,  but subject to the  continued  qualification  of the
         trust for the Plan as tax-exempt under the Code.

 (b)     Any subsidiary or associated company may terminate its
         participation in the Plan upon appropriate action by it, in
         which event the funds of the Plan held on account of
         Participants in the employ of that company shall be determined
         by the Administrator and shall be applied as provided in Section
         10.04 if the Plan should be terminated, or shall be segregated
         by the Trustee as a separate trust, pursuant to certification to
         the Trustee by the Administrator, continuing the Plan as a
         separate plan for the employees of that company under which the
         board of directors of that company shall succeed to all the
         powers and duties of the Board of Directors, including the
         appointment of the administrator.

10.04    Termination of Plan

         The Company, by action of its Board of Directors, may terminate
         the Plan for any reason at any time. In case of termination of
         the Plan, the rights of Participants to their Protected Benefits
         as of the date of the termination, to the extent then funded or
         protected by law, if greater, shall be nonforfeitable. The funds
         of the Plan shall be used for the exclusive benefit of persons
         entitled to benefits under the Plan as of the date of
         termination, except as provided in Section 6.02. 



<PAGE>
                                                                         Page 63

         However, any funds not required to satisfy all liabilities of the Plan 
         for benefits because of erroneous actuarial computation shall be
         returned to the Employer. The Administrator shall determine on
         the basis of actuarial valuation the share of the funds of the
         Plan allocable to each person entitled to benefits under the
         Plan in accordance with Section 4044 of ERISA, or corresponding
         provision of any applicable law in effect at the time. In the
         event of a partial termination of the Plan, the provisions of
         this Section shall be applicable to the Participants affected by
         that partial termination.

10.05    Limitation Concerning Highly Compensated Employees or Highly
         Compensated Former Employees


 (a)     The  provisions of this Section shall apply (i) in the event
         the Plan is  terminated,  to any  Participant who is a Highly 
         Compensated  Employee or highly  compensated  former employee
         (as those terms are defined in  Section 414(q)  of the Code) of
         the  Employer  or an  Affiliate  and (ii) in any other  event, 
         to any Participant who is one of the 25 Highly  Compensated 
         Employees or highly  compensated former employees of the 
         Employer or  Affiliate  with the  greatest  compensation  in
         any Plan Year.  The amount of the annual payments to any one of
         the  Participants  to whom this Section applies shall not be
         greater than an amount equal to the  annual  payments  that 
         would be made on behalf of the  Participant  during the year
         under a single life annuity that is the Actuarial  Equivalent
         of the sum of the Participant's  Accrued Benefit and the
         Participant's other benefits under the Plan.

 (b)     If, (i) after  payment of Pension or other  benefits to any one
         of the  Participants  to whom this Section applies,  the value
         of Plan assets equals or exceeds  110 percent of the value of
         current  liabilities (as that  term is  defined  in  Section
         412(l)(7)  of the Code) of the  Plan,  (ii) the  value of the 
         Accrued Benefit  and other  benefits  of any one of the 
         Participants  to whom this  Section  applies is less than 1 percent of
         the value of current  liabilities of



<PAGE>
                                                                         Page 64

        
         the Plan, or (iii) the value of the benefits  payable to a Participant
         to whom this Section applies does not exceed the amount  described in 
         Section 411(a)(11)(A) of the Code,  the provisions of  paragraph (a) 
         above will not be applicable to the payment of benefits to such
         Participant.

 (c)     Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this Section, in the event the
         Plan is terminated, the restriction of this Section shall not be
         applicable if the benefit payable to any Highly Compensated
         Employee and any highly compensated former employee is limited
         to a benefit that is nondiscriminatory under Section 401(a)(4)
         of the Code.

 (d)     If it should subsequently be determined by statute, court
         decision acquiesced in by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
         or ruling by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, that the
         provisions of this Section are no longer necessary to qualify
         the Plan under the Code, this Section shall be ineffective
         without the necessity of further amendment to the Plan.

10.06    Doubleday Book Shops, Inc.

         Appendix B constitutes an integral part of the Plan and is

         applicable with respect to (i) those Participants included in
         the Plan who are employees of Doubleday Book Shops, Inc., and
         (ii) those former employees of Doubleday Book Shops, Inc. with
         continuing rights under the Pension Plan for Eligible Employees
         of Doubleday Book Shops, Inc. as of December 31, 1991. Such
         employees and former employees are subject to all the terms and
         conditions of the Plan, except as otherwise provided by 
         Appendix B.

         Doubleday Book Shops, Inc.:

         (i)      with respect to a part-time Employee, a Plan Year in which
                  such Employee has completed 1,000 or more Hours of Service;
                  and

         (ii)     with respect to a full-time Employee, a 12-month period of
                  uninterrupted employment rendered by such Employee with the

         subject, however, to the service rules of Section 3.01 of the
         Plan and the following provisions of this Section 3.01.

         If a full-time Employee's employment is terminated and he is
         later reemployed within one year, the period between his
         Termination of Employment and the date of his reemployment shall
         be included in Years of Vesting Service. However, if his
         employment is terminated during a period of absence from service
         for reasons such as vacation, sickness, disability, layoff, or
         leave of absence approved by the Employer, the period from his
         Termination of Employment to the date of his reemployment shall
         be counted in his Years of Vesting Service only if he is
         reemployed within one year of the first day of such absence.

 (b)     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.01,
         an Employee of Doubleday Book Shops, Inc. shall not be deemed to
         have incurred a One Year Break in Service if the Employee is
         absent from work because of:

         (i)      Service in the Armed Forces of the United States;


<PAGE>
                                                                         Page 71


         (ii)     An authorized leave of absence for sickness, vacation or
                  sabbatical granted in writing and for a period not in excess
                  of two years, or a temporary layoff for less than 12 months.

                  manner; or

         (iii)    Disability, other than permanent and total disability, as

         Inc. or any affiliated entity thereof within the meaning of
         Sections 414(b), (c), (m), and (o) of the Code shall be

         Credited Service for purposes of this Appendix B means all Years
         of Vesting Service rendered as an Employee of Doubleday Book
         Shops, Inc., except as provided below. Any period between a
         Termination of Employment (as defined in Section 1.41 of this
         Appendix B) and a reemployment date which is counted as Years of
         Vesting Service as provided in Section 3.01 of this Appendix B
         shall not be counted as Credited Service, except that Credited
         Service shall include any period of absence from service with
         the Employer due to service in the Armed Forces of the United
         States which is counted in a Participant's Years of Vesting
         Service as provided in the Plan. An Employee's Credited Service
         rendered prior to a Termination of Employment will not be
         restored to him upon subsequent reemployment if the Employee
         received a lump sum amount as provided in Section 5.01(c).

3.03     Reemployment

 (a)     If a Participant is reemployed by Doubleday Book Shops, Inc. and
         works at least eight days during a calendar month, any pension
         payments he is currently receiving shall be discontinued. After
         said month and prior to the month following his subsequent
         Termination of Employment, pension payments that the Participant
         would otherwise be entitled to receive shall be permanently
         withheld for each calendar month in which he works at least
         eight days.

 (b)     If a Participant's employment with Doubleday Book Shops, Inc.
         continues after he attains Normal Retirement Age, his pension
         payments will be permanently withheld for each calendar month in
         which he works at least eight days.


 (c)     If a Participant who was an employee of Doubleday Book Shops, 
         Inc. is rehired by any other Employer,  the provisions set
         forth in Section 3.03 of the Plan shall control.

3.04     Change in Employment Status

 (a)     If an Employee  employed  by  Doubleday  Book Shops,  Inc.  on
         a  full-time  basis  becomes  employed on a part-time  basis, 
         his Years of  Vesting  Service  prior to the date of such 
         change  in  status  shall be determined  under the provisions
         of Section 3.01 of this Appendix B as applicable to a full-time 
         Employee and his subsequent  Years of Vesting  Service shall be
         determined  under the provisions of Section 3.01 of this
         Appendix B as applicable to a part-time Employee;  provided, 
         however,  that in determining his Years of Vesting  Service 
         with  respect to the Plan Year in which such  change in status 
         occurs,  190 Hours of Service  will be counted  for each month
         (or part  thereof)  of  employment  prior to the date such
         change took place.

                                                                         Page 73

 (b)     If an Employee of Doubleday Book Shops,  Inc. who is employed
         on a part-time  basis becomes  employed on a full-time  basis, 
         his Years of Vesting Service prior to the first day of the Plan
         Year coincident with or next following  such change in status
         shall be determined  under the  provisions of  Section 3.01  of
         this Appendix B as  applicable to a part-time  Employee and his 
         subsequent  Years of Vesting  Service shall be determined 
         under  the  provisions  of  Section 3.01  of this  Appendix B 
         as  applicable  to a  full-time Employee;  provided,  however, 
         that in the Plan Year in which such change in status occurs,
         such Employee will be  credited  with one full Year of Vesting 
         Service if he  completes  1,000 Hours of Service in such Plan
         Year.  If the  Employee is not  credited  with one full Year of
         Vesting  Service in such Plan Year in accordance  with the
         prior  sentence,  his Years of Vesting  Service for the Plan
         Year in which the change in status  occurred shall equal the
         Years of Vesting  Service that would have been counted if the
         Employee had  remained a full-time  Employee up to the earlier
         of the end of such Plan Year or his  Termination  of
         Employment.

            ARTICLE 4. ELIGIBILITY FOR AND AMOUNT OF BENEFITS

4.01     Normal Retirement

4.03     Early Retirement

         If a Participant elects to begin payment of his early retirement
         Pension prior to his Normal Retirement Date, the Pension payable
         with respect to his period of employment as an Employee of
         Doubleday Book Shops, Inc. shall be equal to his accrued monthly
         Pension, as determined under this Appendix B, reduced by 5
         percent for each full year that the date the Participant's early
         retirement benefit commences precedes his Normal Retirement
         Date, with pro rata reductions hereunder based on fractions of a
         year.

4.05     Spouse's Pension

 (a)     If a Participant who:

         (i)      is an Employee of Doubleday Book Shops, Inc.
                  dies in active service prior to his Annuity Starting Date
                  having met the requirement for any pension benefit under
                  Article 4;

         (ii)     was an Employee of Doubleday Book Shops, Inc. dies after
                  Termination of Employment but prior to his Annuity Starting
                  Date with entitlement to a pension benefit under Article 4; or

         (iii)    was an Employee of Doubleday Book Shops, Inc. dies while
                  accruing service under Section 4.09 of this Appendix B and
                  prior to his Annuity Starting Date having met the requirement
                  for any pension benefit under Article 4;
         
         his eligible surviving spouse (if any) shall be entitled to a
         monthly Pension payable for life. The first payment of such
         survivor Pension benefit shall be made on the first day of the
         month following what would have been the Participant's Normal
         Retirement Date or his date of death, if later. However, the
         eligible surviving spouse may elect to begin receiving payments
         on the first day of the month coinciding with or following the
         month in which the Participant would have attained age 55 and
         prior to his Normal Retirement Date or the date of the
         Participant's death, if


<PAGE>
                                                                         Page 75

         

         later. The last monthly payment shall be made as of the first day of
         the month in which the eligible surviving spouse's death occurs.

         The amount of each monthly payment shall be equal to the amount
         of benefit the eligible surviving spouse would have received if
         the Pension benefit to which the Participant was entitled to as
         of his date of death had commenced on his Normal Retirement Date
         (or his date of death, if later) in the form of a Qualified
         Joint and Survivor Annuity and the Participant had died
         immediately thereafter. If the eligible surviving spouse elects
         an earlier commencement date, the amount of each payment shall
         be further adjusted to reflected commencement prior the
         Participant's Normal Retirement Date as follows:
         
         (i)      If the Participant's death occurred after he attained age 55
                  and the eligible surviving spouse elects early commencement,
                  the monthly Pension payable to the eligible surviving spouse
                  shall be based on the amount of the benefit determined under
                  Section 4.01 of this Appendix B to which the Participant would
                  have been entitled if he had requested benefit commencement in
                  the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity at that
                  earlier date, reduced as provided in Section 4.03 of this
                  Appendix.

         (ii)     If the Participant's death occurred before he attained age 55
                  and the eligible surviving spouse elects a commencement date 
                  on or after the date the Participant would have attained age 
                  55, the monthly pension payable to the eligible surviving 
                  spouse shall be based on the amount of benefit determined 
                  under Section 4.01 of this Appendix B to which the Participant
                  would have been entitled if he had commenced payment in the 
                  form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity at that earlier
                  date, reduced in accordance with the provisions of Section 
                  4.04 of this Appendix.

4.08     Protection of Benefits Accrued Prior to January 1, 1992

         Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, each Participant
         who was a participant in the Pension Plan for Employees of
         Doubleday Book Shops, Inc. on December 31, 1991 and who became a
         Participant in the Plan on January 1, 1992 shall not have his
         benefit (including optional forms of benefit and other benefits
         protected under Internal Revenue Code Section 411(d)(6) and
         regulations thereunder) accrued as of December 31, 1991 under
         the terms of the Pension Plan for Employees of Doubleday Book

         Shops, Inc. as in effect on such date reduced or eliminated.

4.09     Disability Retirement

         In the event a Participant, while he is an Employee of Doubleday

         before his Normal Retirement Date so that he is no longer able
         to continue in employment in the same or similar capacity, such
         Participant shall continue to be credited with Years of Vesting
         Service and years of Credited Service for all Plan purposes
         while he is permanently and totally disabled, but his Final
         Average Compensation shall be calculated as of the date he
         becomes permanently and totally disabled. Such Participant shall
         receive his retirement benefit as of his Normal Retirement Date
         unless he elects in writing to the Administrator that such
         benefit commence at an early retirement date. A Participant

                      ARTICLE 5. PAYMENT OF PENSIONS

5.02     Optional Forms of Payment

         In lieu of the amount and form of Pension payable to him under
         the Plan, and subject to any Spousal Consent required, a
         Participant may, under such rules as the Employer may prescribe,
         elect to have his Pension attributable to his employment as an
         Employee of the Doubleday Book Shops, Inc. (as determined under
         this Appendix B) paid under any of the following options:

         (a)      The Ten-Year Certain and Life Option available under the Plan,
                  determined by multiplying the amount that would be paid to him
                  on a life only basis by the applicable reduction factor from
                  Table 1 of this Appendix B.

         (b)      A Five-Year Certain and Life Option that is a modified Pension
                  payable during the Participant's life; if the Participant dies
                  within 60 months of his Annuity Starting Date, the balance of
                  those monthly payments shall be paid to the Beneficiary named
                  by him when he elected the option. The monthly amount payable
                  under this option will be determined by multiplying the amount
                  that would be paid to the Participant on a life-only basis by
                  the applicable reduction factor from Table 1 of this Appendix
                  B.

         (c)      The 50% Joint and Survivor Option available under the Plan,
                  determined by multiplying the amount that would be paid to him
                  on a life only basis by a reduction factor which is 90
                  percent, increased by 3/10 of 1 percent (but not more than 100

                  percent) for each year the contingent annuitant is older than
                  the Participant, and decreased by 3/10 of 1 percent for each
                  year the contingent annuitant is younger than the Participant.
                  
         (d)      The 100% Joint and Survivor Option available under the Plan,
                  determined by multiplying the amount that would be paid to him
                  on a life-only basis by a reduction factor which is 82
                  percent, increased by 6/10 of 1 percent (but not more than 100
                  percent) for each year the contingent annuitant is older than
                  the Participant, and decreased by 6/10 of 1 percent for each
                  year the contingent

                  annuitant is younger than the Participant.

         In the event the Beneficiary named under the provisions of
         paragraph (a) or (c) above fails to survive the Participant and
         the Participant has not designated a contingent beneficiary, the
         Beneficiary shall be deemed to be in the order of sequence
         below: (1) the Participant's eligible surviving spouse, if any,
         (2) his children then living, (3) his brothers or sisters then
         living, or (4) his estate. If the designated Beneficiary
         survives the Participant but dies prior to receiving the full
         number of payments under the five- or ten-year certain and life
         option and the Participant has not designated a contingent
         Beneficiary, distribution of the remaining payments will be made
         to the Beneficiary's estate.

    extraordinary charge.

(6) Net earnings (loss) does not give effect to preferred stock dividends.

    Holders of the Company's Series C Preferred Stock were entitled to dividends
    of $4,466 during fiscal 1993. Such accumulated dividends were paid from the
    proceeds of the Company's initial public offering completed on October 4,
    1993 (IPO). Accumulated dividends on all other series of preferred stock
    outstanding were converted into common stock or waived during fiscal 1993.

(7) All share and per-share amounts have been restated to give effect to a

    reflect the adoption, in fiscal 1997, of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 128, "Earnings per Share" for all periods presented. Fiscal
    1993 earnings per share were computed on a pro forma basis and give effect
    to certain employee stock options using the treasury stock method, the
    number of shares issued upon the conversions of preferred stock and the
    exercise of warrants in connection with the IPO and the number of shares
    issued equal in value to the redemption price of the Series C Preferred
    Stock, including accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(8) Comparable store sales increase (decrease) is calculated on a 52-week basis,
    and includes sales of stores that have been open for 12 months for B. Dalton
    stores and 15 months for Barnes & Noble stores (due to the high sales volume
    associated with grand openings). Comparable store sales for fiscal years
    1997 and 1996 include relocated Barnes & Noble stores and exclude B. Dalton
    stores which the company has closed or has a formal plan to close.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

        The Company's fiscal year is comprised of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the
Saturday closest to the last day of January. As used in this section, "fiscal
1997" represents the 52 weeks ended January 31, 1998, "fiscal 1996" represents
the 53 weeks ended February 1, 1997 and "fiscal 1995" represents the 52 weeks
ended January 27, 1996.

GENERAL

        Barnes & Noble, Inc. (Barnes & Noble or the Company), the world's
largest bookseller*, as of January 31, 1998 operates 483 "super" stores, 65 of
which were opened in fiscal 1997, under the Barnes & Noble Booksellers, Bookstop
and Bookstar trade names, and 528 mall bookstores under the B. Dalton
Booksellers, Doubleday Book Shops and Scribner's Bookstore trade names. Barnes &
Noble publishes books under its own imprint for exclusive sale through its
retail stores and mail-order catalogs. The Company is also the exclusive
bookseller in America Online's Marketplace (keyword: BarnesandNoble) and
maintains its own Web site (BarnesandNoble.com), operating the "world's largest
bookseller online." The Company employed approximately 27,200 full- and
part-time booksellers and created nearly 3,200 new jobs nationwide during fiscal
1997 primarily due to its Barnes & Noble store expansion.

        Barnes & Noble is the largest operator of book "super" stores in the
United States* with 483 Barnes & Noble stores located in 48 states and the
District of Columbia as of January 31, 1998. With more than 30 years of

bookselling experience, management has a strong sense of customers' changing
needs and the Company leads book retailing with a "community store" concept.
Barnes & Noble's typical store offers a comprehensive title base, a cafe, a
children's section, a music department and a calendar of ongoing events,
including author appearances and children's activities, that make each Barnes &
Noble store an active part of its community. Management estimates that as much
as 80% of the sales generated by a new Barnes & Noble store is incremental to
the community in which the store is located, representing a combination of
previously unfulfilled and newly created demand.

        Barnes & Noble stores range in size from 10,000 to 60,000 square feet
depending upon market size, and each store features an authoritative selection
of books, ranging from 60,000 to 175,000 titles. The comprehensive title
selection is diverse and reflects local interests. To further this diversity,
Barnes & Noble emphasizes books published by small and independent publishers
and university presses. Bestsellers represent only 3% of Barnes & Noble store
sales. In addition to the extensive on-site selection, each store can fill
customers' special order requests from the more than one million books in print.

        Barnes & Noble stores opened during fiscal 1997 added 1.6 million square
feet to the Barnes & Noble base, bringing the total square footage to 10.8
million square feet, a 16% increase over the prior year. Barnes & Noble stores
generated more than 80% of the Company's total revenues in fiscal 1997. The
Company plans to open approximately 60 Barnes & Noble stores in 1998 which are
expected to average 26,000 square feet in size.

        At the end of fiscal 1997, the Company operated 528 B. Dalton stores in
45 states and the District of Columbia. B. Dalton stores employ merchandising
strategies that target the "middle-American" consumer book market, offering a
wide range of bestsellers and general-interest titles. Doubleday and Scribner's
bookstores utilize a more upscale format aimed at the "carriage trade" in
higher-end shopping malls and place a greater emphasis on hardcover and gift
books. Most B. Dalton stores range in size from 2,800 to 6,000 square feet, and
while they are appropriate to the size of adjacent mall tenants, the opening of
superstores in nearby locations continues to have a significant impact on B.
Dalton stores.

        The Company is continuing to execute its strategy to maximize returns
from its B. Dalton division in response to declining sales attributable
primarily to superstore competition and, to a lesser extent, weaker overall
consumer traffic in shopping malls. Part of the Company's strategy has been to
close underperforming stores, which has resulted in the closing of more than 50
B. Dalton stores per year since 1989.

        The Company has also been expanding the size of some of its new B.
Dalton stores and is seeking better locations within malls. A new B. Dalton
prototype was developed for this purpose in 1993 and, since that time, more than
100 new or converted stores have been opened and are performing, on average,
better than the remaining store base.

        Complementing its leadership position as the world's largest bookseller,
Barnes & Noble is the world's largest supplier of books through catalogs*. The
Company mails over 15 million catalogs each year and maintains a list of over
one million customers worldwide. Barnes & Noble's extensive catalog mailings
have created substantial global name recognition which has benefited both the
retail stores and the online business.

        During 1997, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary
BarnesandNoble.com Inc., became the exclusive bookseller in America Online's
Marketplace, linking the world's largest bookseller with the world's most
popular Internet online service. The exclusive four-year agreement gives
BarnesandNoble.com an extensive presence throughout America Online. The Company
further extended its brand awareness by launching its own web site
(BarnesandNoble.com) through which it has entered into thousands of strategic
online alliances and affiliations, including Lycos, Web Crawler, ZDNet, The New
York Times and Disney. The Company believes that it brings significant
competitive advantages to the online bookselling market, including its
distribution expertise, proprietary title database, large customer base and
brand recognition.

         The Company further differentiates its product offerings from those of
its competitors by publishing books under its own Barnes & Noble Books imprint
for exclusive sale in its retail stores, direct-mail catalogs and through
BarnesandNoble.com. With publishing and distribution rights to over 1,500
titles, Barnes & Noble Books offers customers high-quality books at excellent
values and generates attractive gross margins.

        The Company also maintains an equity investment in Chapters Inc., an
Ontario company which is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Chapters
is the largest book retailer in Canada and the third largest in North America*,
operating 347 bookstores, including 29 superstores, as of the end of fiscal
1997.

(1) If operating margin, earnings (loss) before provision (benefit) for

    before the effects of the restructuring charge of $123,768 during fiscal
    1995, the percentage relationship that these items would bear to total
    revenues of the Company would be 4.5%, 3.1%, 1.4% and 1.7%,
    respectively.

52 WEEKS ENDED JANUARY 31, 1998 COMPARED WITH 53 WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 1, 1997

Revenues

        The Company's revenues increased 14.2% during fiscal 1997 to $2.797
billion from $2.448 billion during fiscal 1996. Fiscal 1996 includes 53 weeks;
excluding the impact of the 53rd week, revenues increased 16.0%. Fiscal 1997
revenues from Barnes & Noble stores, which contributed 80.3% of total revenues,
increased 20.7% to $2.246 billion from $1.861 billion in fiscal 1996.

        The increase in revenues was primarily due to the 9.4% increase in
Barnes & Noble comparable store sales and the opening of an additional 65 Barnes
& Noble stores during 1997. This increase was slightly offset by declining

revenues of B. Dalton stores which closed 53 stores and posted a comparable
store sales decline of 1.1%. BarnesandNoble.com, the Company's new online
subsidiary, also contributed to the increase in revenue, posting $14.6 million
of revenues during its first partial year of operations.

Cost of Sales and Occupancy

         The Company's cost of sales and occupancy includes costs such as rental
expense, common area maintenance, merchant association dues, lease-required
advertising and adjustments for LIFO.

        Cost of sales and occupancy increased 13.1% during fiscal 1997 to $2.019
billion from $1.785 billion in fiscal 1996 resulting in an increase in the
Company's gross margin rate to 27.8% in fiscal 1997 from 27.1% in fiscal 1996.
The gross margin expansion reflects more direct buying, reduced costs of
shipping and handling, and improvements in merchandise mix.

Selling and Administrative Expenses

        Selling and administrative expenses increased $74.7 million, or 16.0% to
$540.4 million in fiscal 1997 from $465.7 million in fiscal 1996. Selling and
administrative expenses increased to 19.3% of revenues during fiscal 1997 from
19.0% during fiscal 1996 primarily as a result of the start-up expenses from
BarnesandNoble.com. Excluding BarnesandNoble.com, selling and administrative
expenses would have declined to 18.9% of revenues, reflecting operating leverage
improvement.

                                      15

<PAGE>

Depreciation and Amortization

        Depreciation and amortization increased $17.2 million, or 28.8%, to
$77.0 million in fiscal 1997 from $59.8 million in fiscal 1996. The increase was
primarily the result of the new Barnes & Noble stores opened during fiscal 1997
and fiscal 1996.

Pre-Opening Expenses

        Pre-opening expenses declined in fiscal 1997 to $12.9 million from $17.6
million in fiscal 1996 reflecting fewer new stores compared with prior years.

Operating Profit

        Operating profit increased to $147.3 million in fiscal 1997 from $119.7
million in fiscal 1996. Despite the $15.4 million operating loss from
BarnesandNoble.com, operating margin improved to 5.3% of revenues during fiscal
1997 from 4.9% of revenues during fiscal 1996. Excluding BarnesandNoble.com,
operating margin for the retail business improved to 5.8% of revenues.

Interest Expense, Net and Amortization of Deferred Financing Fees

        Interest expense, net of interest income, and amortization of deferred

financing fees decreased $0.6 million in fiscal 1997 to $37.7 million from $38.3
million in fiscal 1996. The decline was primarily due to lower borrowings under
the Company's senior credit facilities.

Provision for Income Taxes

        Barnes & Noble's effective tax rate was 41.0% during fiscal 1997
compared with 37.1% during fiscal 1996. The fiscal 1996 provision reflected a
non-recurring $3.0 million rehabilitation tax credit.

Extraordinary Charge

        As a result of obtaining a new senior credit facility during 
fiscal 1997, the Company called its outstanding $190 million, 11 7/8% senior
subordinated notes on January 15, 1998, at a call premium of 5.9375%. The
extraordinary charge reflects (on an after-tax basis) such call premium along
with the write-off of related deferred financing fees.

Earnings

        Fiscal 1997 earnings before extraordinary charge increased $13.4
million, or 26.2%, to $64.7 million (or $0.93 per diluted share) from $51.2
million (or $0.75 per diluted share) during fiscal 1996. The extraordinary
charge in fiscal 1997 of $11.5 million equated to $0.17 per diluted share
resulting in net earnings during fiscal 1997 of $53.2 million (or $0.76 per
diluted share).

        All share and per-share amounts contained in this annual report have
been restated to reflect a two-for-one split of the Company's common stock in
September of 1997, and the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128, "Earnings per Share" (SFAS 128). Implementation of SFAS 128
did not have a material effect on the Company's diluted earnings per share. SFAS
128 requires the disclosure of basic earnings per share in addition to diluted
earnings per share.

53 WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 1, 1997, COMPARED WITH 52 WEEKS ENDED JANUARY 27, 1996

Revenues

        The Company's revenues  increased 23.8% during fiscal 1996 to $2.448
billion from $1.977 billion during fiscal 1995. Fiscal 1996 includes 53 weeks;
excluding the impact of the 53rd week, revenues increased 21.5%. During fiscal
1996, revenues from Barnes & Noble stores rose 37.9% to $1.861 billion from
$1.350 billion during fiscal 1995 and contributed 76.0% of total revenues, up
from 68.3% during fiscal 1995. B. Dalton stores generated revenues of $564.9
million (or 23.1% of total revenues) during fiscal 1996, down from $603.2
million (or 30.5% of total revenues) during fiscal 1995.

        The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in
sales from Barnes & Noble stores. The Company opened 91 Barnes & Noble stores
and closed 18 during fiscal 1996 (12 of which were relocated), increasing square
footage by 33% in fiscal 1996. Comparable store sales for Barnes & Noble stores,
which excludes the impact of the 53rd week of sales, increased 7.3% during
fiscal 1996, in comparison to 6.9% during fiscal 1995. During fiscal 1996,

revenues of B. Dalton stores declined, primarily due to the 72 store closings
and a comparable store sales decrease of 1.0%.

Cost of Sales and Occupancy

        The Company's cost of sales and occupancy includes costs such as rental
expense, common area maintenance, merchant association dues, lease-required
advertising and adjustments for LIFO.

        Cost of sales and occupancy increased 23.6% during fiscal 1996 to $1.785
billion from $1.445 billion during fiscal 1995, but decreased as a percentage of
revenues to 72.9% during fiscal 1996 from 73.1% during fiscal 1995 due to
improvements in merchandise mix, as well as increases in merchandise margins due
to more direct purchasing. Excluding the impact of LIFO, cost of sales and
occupancy as a percentage of revenues declined to 72.9% in fiscal 1996 from
73.4% in fiscal 1995.

Selling and Administrative Expenses

        Selling and administrative expenses increased $82.0 million, or 21.4% to
$465.7 million during fiscal 1996 from $383.7 million during fiscal 1995. The
Company's operating leverage continued to improve as selling and administrative
expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues to 19.0% during fiscal 1996 from
19.4% during fiscal 1995.

Depreciation and Amortization

         Depreciation and amortization increased $11.9 million, or 24.9%, to
$59.8 million during fiscal 1996 from $47.9 million during fiscal 1995. The
increase was primarily a result of the addition of 91 Barnes & Noble stores
during fiscal 1996.

Pre-Opening Expenses

        Pre-opening expenses increased $5.4 million, or 44.5%, to $17.6 million
during fiscal 1996 from $12.2 million during fiscal 1995. As the Company
amortizes pre-opening expenses over the respective store's first 12 months of
operation, the increase reflects the opening of 109 new Barnes & Noble stores
during the second half of fiscal 1995 and the first half of fiscal 1996 compared
with 68 stores in the corresponding period of the previous year.

Operating Profit (Loss)

        Operating profit, before the effects of the $123.8 million restructuring
charge in fiscal 1995, increased $31.1 million, or 35.0% to $119.7 million
during fiscal 1996 from $88.6 million during fiscal 1995. As a percentage of
revenues, operating profit increased to 4.9% during fiscal 1996 from 4.5% during
fiscal 1995 (before the effects of the restructuring charge), reflecting
improved operating leverage.


Interest Expense, Net and Amortization of Deferred Financing Fees

        Interest expense, net of interest income, and amortization of deferred
financing fees increased $10.2 million, or 36.0%, to $38.3 million during fiscal
1996 from $28.1 million during fiscal 1995. The increase resulted from a rise in
borrowings under the Company's credit facility to finance working capital and
capital expenditures. The impact of the increased borrowings was partially
offset by a reduction in the Company's weighted-average interest rate on its
short-term borrowings.

Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes

        The Company's income tax provision during fiscal 1996 was $30.2 million
compared with $26.1 million in fiscal 1995 (before the effects of the $123.8
million restructuring charge). Barnes & Noble's effective tax rate was 37.1%
during fiscal 1996 and 43.2% during fiscal 1995 (before the effects of the
restructuring charge). Such rates exceeded the federal statutory rate primarily
due to the combined effects of goodwill amortization and state and local taxes.
The fiscal 1996 provision also reflects a non-recurring $3.0 million
rehabilitation tax credit.

Net Earnings (Loss)

        As a result of the factors discussed above, the Company's net earnings
in fiscal 1996 increased to $51.2 million from $34.3 million in fiscal 1995
(before the effects of the $123.8 million restructuring charge). Fiscal 1996
earnings increased due to the continuing improvement in Barnes & Noble operating
profits combined with accelerating revenues over which to spread overhead costs.

        Net earnings per diluted share were $0.75 during fiscal 1996 compared
with $0.53 during fiscal 1995 (before the effects of the restructuring charge).
Net earnings increased 49.3% while earnings per diluted share increased 41.5%
due to an increase in the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding to 67.9
million shares during fiscal 1996 from 64.3 million shares during fiscal 1995,
reflecting the full-year impact of 5.0 million common shares issued in October
of 1995.

SEASONALITY

        The Company's business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with
the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the quarter
which includes the Christmas selling season. The growth in Barnes & Noble stores
continues to reduce such seasonal fluctuation. During fiscal 1997, the Company
reported operating profit in all four quarters for the first time since the
Company began its "super" store expansion.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

        Working capital requirements are generally at their highest during the
Company's fiscal quarter ending on or about January 31 due to the higher

payments to vendors for holiday season merchandise purchases and the
replenishment of merchandise inventories following this period of increased
sales. In addition, the Company's sales and merchandise inventory levels will
fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter as a result of the number and timing of new
store openings, as well as the amount and timing of sales contributed by new
stores.

        Cash flows from operating activities, funds available under its
revolving credit facility and vendor financing continue to provide the Company
with liquidity and capital resources for store expansion, seasonal working
capital requirements and capital investments.

        Cash Flow. Cash flows provided from (used by) operating activities were
$169.2 million, $119.5 million and ($56.8) million during fiscal 1997, 1996,
and 1995, respectively. The increased cash flow in fiscal 1997 was primarily due
to the improvement in net earnings. In fiscal 1996, improvement in cash flows
from operations was the result of increased net earnings and more efficient
working capital management; revenues increased 23.8% while inventory levels
declined 1.1% through faster inventory turns.

        The weighted-average age per square foot of the Company's 483 Barnes &
Noble stores was 2.8 years as of January 31, 1998 and is expected to increase to
approximately 3.3 years by January 30, 1999. As the relatively young Barnes &
Noble stores mature, and as the number of new stores opened during the fiscal
year decreases as a percentage of the existing store base, the increasing
operating profits of Barnes & Noble stores are expected to generate a greater
portion of cash flows required for working capital, including new store
inventories and capital expenditures. Earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) increased $44.7 million or 24.9% to
$224.2 million in fiscal 1997 from $179.5 million in fiscal 1996. This
improvement was achieved despite the start-up losses of BarnesandNoble.com.

        Capital Structure. Strong cash flows from operations, coupled with
improved working capital management, strengthened the Company's balance sheet
during fiscal 1997. The Company's shareholders' equity increased 16.6% to $531.8
million (net of the $11.5 million extraordinary charge) as of January 31, 1998,
from $456.0 million as of February 1, 1997, and return on beginning equity
increased to 14.2% in fiscal 1997 (excluding the extraordinary charge) from
12.8% during fiscal 1996. The Company's market capitalization more than doubled
during fiscal 1997, reflecting the market's recognition of the Company's strong
performance.

        On November 18, 1997, the Company obtained an $850 million senior credit
facility (the New Facility) with a syndicate led by The Chase Manhattan Bank.
The New Facility, structured as a five-year revolving credit, refinanced an
existing $450 million revolving credit and $100 million term loan facility (the
Old Facility). Net proceeds are available for general corporate purposes and
were used to redeem all of the Company's outstanding $190 million, 11 7/8%
senior subordinated notes on January 15, 1998.

        The New Facility permits borrowings at various interest rate options
based on the prime rate or London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) depending upon
certain financial tests and significantly reduces the interest rate margins over
LIBOR contained in the Old Facility. In addition, the agreement requires the

Company to pay a commitment fee up to 0.25% of the unused portion depending upon
certain financial tests. The New Facility contains covenants, limitations and
events of default typical of credit facilities of this size and nature.

        The amount outstanding under the Company's New Facility has been
classified as long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets due
to both the terms of the New Facility and the Company's intent and ability to
maintain principal amounts outstanding through November 2002.

        Borrowings under the Company's senior credit facilities averaged $184.5
million, $186.6 million and $62.0 million and peaked at $304.9 million, $292.8
million and $152.2 million during fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

        Capital Investment. Capital expenditures totaled $121.9 million, $171.9
million and $154.9 million during fiscal 1997, 1996

                                      18

and 1995, respectively. Capital expenditures in fiscal 1998,primarily for
approximately 60 new Barnes & Noble stores as well as computer hardware and
software associated with the Company's new store point-of-sale system, are
expected to be between $150 million and $175 million, although commitment to
such expenditures has not yet been made.

        Based on current operating levels and the store expansion planned for
the next fiscal year, management believes cash flows generated from operating
activities, short-term vendor financing and its borrowing capacity under its
revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet the Company's working
capital and debt service requirements, and support the development of its short-
and long-term strategies for at least the next 12 months.

        Year 2000. The Company is continuing its comprehensive evaluation of all
computer systems and microprocessors and is in the process of replacing,
modifying and/or converting those systems which are not year 2000 compliant. The
incremental cost over the next two years is being determined as part of the
continuing evaluation. Management does not expect such costs to have a material
adverse impact on the financial position or results of operations of the
Company.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

        Barnes & Noble, Inc. (Barnes & Noble), through its wholly owned
subsidiaries (collectively, the Company), is primarily engaged in the sale of
books through four principal bookselling strategies: its "super" store strategy
through its wholly owned subsidiary Barnes & Noble Booksellers, Inc., under its
Barnes & Noble Booksellers, Bookstop and Bookstar trade names (hereafter
collectively referred to as Barnes & Noble stores), its mall strategy through
its wholly owned subsidiaries B. Dalton Bookseller, Inc. and Doubleday Book
Shops, Inc., under its B. Dalton stores, Doubleday Book Shops and Scribner's
Bookstore trade names (hereafter collectively referred to as B. Dalton stores),
its direct-mail strategy through its wholly owned subsidiary Marboro Books
Corp., and its e-commerce strategy through its wholly owned subsidiary
BarnesandNoble.com Inc.

Consolidation

        The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Barnes &
Noble and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior-period
amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes.

Use of Estimates

        In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles, the Company is required to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

        The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid instruments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.

Merchandise Inventories

        Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost
is determined primarily by the retail inventory method on the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) basis for 83% and 79% of the Company's merchandise inventories

as of January 31, 1998 and February 1, 1997, respectively. The remaining
merchandise inventories are valued on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

        If substantially all of the merchandise inventories currently valued at
LIFO costs were valued at current costs, merchandise inventories would increase
approximately $5,102 and $8,800 as of January 31, 1998 and February 1, 1997,
respectively.

Property and Equipment

        Property andequipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. For financial reporting purposes, depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. For tax purposes,
different methods are used. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred,
while betterments and major remodeling costs are capitalized. Leasehold
improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of their estimated
useful lives or the terms of the respective leases. Capitalized lease
acquisition costs are being amortized over the average lease terms of the
underlying leases. Costs incurred in purchasing management information systems
are capitalized and included in property and equipment. These costs are
amortized over their estimated useful lives from the date the systems become
operational.

Intangible Assets and Amortization

        The costs in excess of net assets of businesses acquired are carried as
intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. The net intangible assets, consisting primarily of
goodwill and trade names, of $61,484 and $28,753 as of January 31, 1998, $63,604
and $29,890

                                      24

<PAGE>

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED


as of February 1, 1997, are amortized over 40 years using the straight-line
method.

        Amortization of goodwill and trade names included in depreciation
and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations is $3,257, $3,305 and $4,272 during fiscal 1997, 1996 and
1995, respectively. Accumulated amortization at January 31, 1998 and
February 1, 1997 was $41,293 and $38,036, respectively.

        The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of goodwill and
considers whether this goodwill should be completely or partially written off or
the amortization periods accelerated. The Company assesses the recoverability of
this goodwill based upon several factors, including management's intention with
respect to the acquired operations and those operations' projected undiscounted
store-level cash flows. 


Deferred Charges

        Costs incurred to obtain long-term financing are amortized over the
terms of the respective debt agreements using the straight-line method, which
approximates the interest method. Unamortized costs included in other noncurrent
assets as of January 31, 1998 and February 1, 1997 were $1,764 and $9,789,
respectively. Unamortized costs of $8,209 were included in the extraordinary
loss due to early extinguishment of debt for fiscal 1997. Amortization expense
included in interest and amortization of deferred financing fees is $1,678,
$1,846, and $2,304 during fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

        Revenue from sales of the Company's products is recognized at the time
of sale.

        The Company sells memberships which entitle purchasers to additional
discounts. The membership revenue is deferred and recognized as income over the
twelve-month membership period.

        Sales returns (which are not significant) are recognized at the time
returns are made.

Pre-opening Expenses

        Costs directly associated with the opening of new stores, primarily
payroll and occupancy costs, are deferred and amortized over the respective
store's first 12 months of operations.

Closed Store Expenses

        Upon a formal decision to close or relocate a store, the Company charges
unrecoverable costs to expense. Such costs include the net book value of
abandoned fixtures and leasehold improvements and a provision for future lease
obligations, net of expected sublease recoveries. Costs associated with store
closings of $5,113 during fiscal 1995 are included in selling and administrative
expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share

        In 1997 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 128, "Earnings per Share" (SFAS 128). Under SFAS 128, the presentation of
primary and fully diluted earnings per share is replaced by basic and diluted
earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilutive effect of
common stock equivalents and is computed by dividing income available to common
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share reflects, in periods in which they have a dilutive
effect, the impact of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options.
Also, as more fully described in Note 7, the Company effected a two-for-one
stock split during September 1997. Accordingly, all historical weighted average
share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the stock split and
the adoption of SFAS 128.

Income Taxes


        The provision (benefit) for income taxes includes federal, state and
local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the
enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the
differences reverse.

Stock Options

        The Company accounts for all transactions under which employees receive
shares of stock or other equity instruments in the Company or the Company incurs
liabilities to employees in amounts based on the price of its stock in
accordance with the

                                      25

<PAGE>

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees." Generally, compensation expense is not recognized for
stock option grants. The Company has not adopted the fair value method
encouraged, but not required, by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."

Reporting Period

        The Company's fiscal year is comprised of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the
Saturday closest to the last day of January. The reporting periods ended January
31, 1998, February 1, 1997 and January 27, 1996 contained 52 weeks, 53 weeks and
52 weeks, respectively.

3. Debt


Revolving Credit Facility

        On November 18, 1997, the Company obtained an $850,000 senior credit
facility (the New Facility) with a syndicate led by The Chase Manhattan Bank.
The New Facility, structured as a five-year revolving credit, refinanced an
existing $450,000 revolving credit and $100,000 term loan facility (the Old
Facility). The New Facility permits borrowings at various interest rate options
based on the prime rate or London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) depending upon
certain financial tests. In addition, the agreement requires the Company to pay
a commitment fee up to 0.25% of the unused portion depending upon certain
financial tests. The New Facility contains covenants, limitations and events of
default typical of credit facilities of this size and nature, including
financial covenants which require the Company to meet, among other things, cash
flow and interest coverage ratios and which limit capital expenditures. The New
Facility is secured by the capital stock, accounts receivable and general
intangibles of the Company's subsidiaries.

        Net proceeds from the New Facility are available for general corporate
purposes and were used to redeem all of the Company's outstanding $190,000, 
11 7/8% senior subordinated notes on January 15, 1998. As a result of the
refinancings, the Company recorded an extraordinary charge of $11,499 (net of
applicable taxes) due to the early extinguishment of debt during fiscal 1997.
The extraordinary charge represents the payment of a call premium associated
with the redemption of the senior subordinated notes of $6,656 (net of
applicable taxes) and the write-off of unamortized fees of $4,843 (net of
applicable taxes).

        The Company from time to time enters into interest rate swap agreements
to manage interest costs and risk associated with changes in interest rates.
These agreements effectively convert underlying variable - rate debt based on
prime rate or LIBOR to fixed - rate debt through the exchange of fixed and
floating interest payment obligations without the exchange of underlying
principal amounts. During fiscal 1996, the Company entered into interest rate
swap agreements totaling $100,000 with maturities ranging from 1999 to 2000. As
of January 31, 1998 the Company had outstanding $125,000 of swaps with
maturities ranging from 1999 to 2003. The Company recorded interest expense
associated with these agreements of $306 and $365 during fiscal years 1997 and
1996, respectively.

        Selected information related to the Company's revolving credit facility
is as follows:

Interest rate at end of year                          6.60%     6.87%      8.21%

        The balance outstanding as of January 31, 1998 reflects the refinancing
of the senior subordinated notes and the term loan.

        The average balance outstanding during the period was based on the
number of days outstanding. The weighted average interest rate during the period
was calculated as the result of dividing the related interest expense by average
borrowings outstanding.

        Fees expensed with respect to the unused portion of the Company's
revolving credit commitment were $1,204, $911 and $454, during fiscal 1997,1996
and 1995, respectively.

Long-Term Debt

        As of January 31, 1998 the $284,800 balance outstanding under the
Company's New Facility has been classified as long-term debt based on the terms
of the credit agreement and the Company's intention to maintain principal
amounts outstanding through November 2002. As of February 1, 1997 classified as
long - term debt were both the $190,000, 11 7/8% senior subordinated notes based
on the January 15, 2003 maturity date, and the $100,000 term loan outstanding
under the Old Facility which had scheduled repayments starting in 1998. The
subordinated notes and the term loan were paid on January 15, 1998 and November
18, 1997, respectively.

        The Company has no agreements to maintain compensating balances.

4. Fair Values of Financial Instruments

        The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents reported in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value due to the
short-term maturities of these assets.

        The aggregate fair value of the revolving credit facility, classified as
long-term debt as of January 31, 1998, approximates its carrying amount, because
of its recent and frequent repricing based upon market conditions. The fair
value of long-term debt, consisting of the senior subordinated notes and term
loan as of February 1, 1997, is based upon quoted market prices. Interest rate
swap agreements are valued based on market quotes obtained from dealers. The
fair value of the investment in Chapters Inc. is based on quoted market prices
and conversion rates at January 31, 1998 and February 1, 1997.

        The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial
instruments as of January 31, 1998 and February 1, 1997 are as follows:

                                   January 31,           February 1,

5. Employees' Retirement and Defined Contribution Plans

        The Company maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan
(the Pension Plan) for the benefit of substantially all of its employees who
meet certain eligibility requirements, primarily age and length of service.
Benefits provided by the Pension Plan are based on years of credited service,
the employee's compensation for any of five consecutive years in the last ten
years of service and covered earnings for Social Security benefits. The
Company's contributions to the Pension Plan are generally in amounts determined
by independent consulting actuaries.

        The Company also sponsors a defined contribution plan (the Savings Plan)
for the benefit of substantially all of its employees who meet certain
eligibility requirements, primarily age and length of service. The Savings Plan
allows employees to invest up to 15% of their current gross cash compensation on
a pre-tax or post-tax basis, at their option. The Company's contributions to the
Savings Plan are generally in amounts based upon a certain percentage of the
employees' pre-tax contributions.

        A summary of the components of net periodic pension cost for the Pension
Plan and the total contributions charged to employee benefit expenses for the
Savings Plan follows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED


        In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain
health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees (the Plan). Only
those employees receiving benefits or retired as of April 1, 1993 are eligible
to participate in the Plan and receive these benefits. The Plan is unfunded. The
following table sets forth the status of the Plan and the postretirement health
care liability of the Plan, which is attributable solely to retirees, recognized
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 1998 and
February 1, 1997 using a discount rate of 7.3% and 7.5%, respectively.

                                                 January 31,       February 1,

                                                 =========           ========

        The net periodic cost for the postretirement health care benefits under
the Plan is related to interest costs of $315, $326 and $375 during fiscal 1997,
1996 and 1995, respectively. The unrecognized (gain) loss resulting from the
impact of experience changes on current assumptions is recorded over the average
remaining life expectancy of the Plan participants.

        The health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of the
Plan benefits is assumed to be 8.0% in 1998, declining at one-half percent
decrements each year through 2004 to 5.0% in 2004 and each year thereafter. The
health care cost trend assumption has a significant effect on the amounts
reported. For example, a 1% increase in the health care cost trend rate would
increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $198
as of January 31, 1998 and the net periodic cost by approximately $32 during
fiscal 1997.

7. Shareholders' Equity

        On September 22, 1997, the Company effected a two-for-one stock split in
the form of a stock dividend. One additional share was issued for each share of
common stock held by shareholders of record as of September 2, 1997. Share and
per share amounts for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect this
split.

        On October 2, 1995, the Company completed a public offering of 5,000,000
shares of common stock (restated for the September 1997 two - for-one stock
split) which generated proceeds of $88,725 after deducting underwriting

discounts and commissions and expenses. The net proceeds were used for general
corporate purposes, including the financing of capital expenditures and
inventory purchases in connection with the accelerated expansion of the Barnes &
Noble store operations.

8. Restructuring Charge

        From 1989 through 1995, the Company closed, on average, between 50 and
60 mall bookstores per year primarily due to increasing competition from
superstores and declining mall traffic. During the fourth quarter of fiscal
1995, the Company accelerated its mall bookstore closing program with the aim of
forming a core of more profitable B. Dalton stores, and provided for these
closing costs and asset valuation adjustments through a non-cash restructuring
charge, and early adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
121, "Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Assets to be Disposed
of" (SFAS 121). In January 1996, the Company recorded a non-cash charge to
operating earnings of $123,768 ($87,303 after tax or $1.32 per share) to reflect
the aggregate impact of its restructuring plan and change in accounting policy.
The charge to earnings included a $33,000 write-down of goodwill, and $45,862
related to the write-down of fixed assets and other long-term assets. The
Company has substantially completed the store closing program.

        The following table sets forth the restructuring liability activity:

9. Stock Option Plans

        The Company currently has two incentive plans under which stock options
have been or may be granted to officers, directors and key employees of the
Company the 1991 Employee Incentive Plan (the 1991 Plan) and the 1996
Incentive Plan (the 1996 Plan). The options to purchase common shares generally
are issued at fair market value on the date of the grant, begin vesting after
one year in 33 1/3% or 25% increments per year, expire ten years from issuance
and are conditioned upon continual employment during the vesting period.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED


        The 1996 Plan and the 1991 Plan allow the Company to grant options to
purchase up to 6,000,000 and 4,732,704 shares of common stock, respectively.

        In addition to the two incentive plans, the Company has granted stock
options to certain key executives and directors. The vesting terms and
contractual lives of these grants are similar to that of the incentive plans.

        In accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" (SFAS 123), the Company discloses
the pro forma impact of recording compensation expense utilizing the
Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for
use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models
require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock
price volatility. Because the Company's stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management's opinion, the Black-Scholes model does not necessarily provide a
reliable measure of the fair value of its stock options.

        Had compensation cost for the Company's stock option grants been
determined based on the fair value at the stock option grant dates consistent
with the method of SFAS 123, the Company's net earnings and diluted earnings per
share for fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, would have been reduced by approximately
$3,863 or $0.06 per share, $5,305 or $0.08 per share, and $1,448 or $0.02 per
share, respectively.

        Because the application of the pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS
123 are required only to be applied to grants of options made by the Company
during fiscal 1995 and after, the above pro forma amounts may not be
representative of the effects of applying SFAS 123 to future years.

        The weighted-average fair value of the options granted during fiscal
1997, 1996 and 1995 were estimated at $8.05, $4.66 and $5.99 respectively, using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
volatility of 28%, risk-free interest rate of 6.54% in fiscal 1997, 6.63% in
fiscal 1996, and 6.59% in fiscal 1995, and an expected life of six years.

noncancelable agreements which expire at various dates through 2020 with
various renewal options for additional

                                      31

periods. The agreements, which have been classified as operating leases,
generally provide for both minimum and percentage rentals and require the
Company to pay all insurance, taxes and other maintenance costs. Percentage

rentals are based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums at
various stores.

        Rental expense under operating leases are as follows:

Fiscal Year             1997        1996          1995

        Future minimum annual rentals for stores scheduled for closing pursuant
to the Company's restructuring plan are included in the preceding table.
Future rental payments representing the exit costs associated with these
store closings were included in the Company's non-cash restructuring
charge of $123,768 recorded during fiscal 1995 and, therefore, do not
represent future operating expenses. Minimum rental obligations may
decline in the future, as the leases for these stores subject to the
restructuring plan are terminated or the restructuring plan is otherwise
completed.

11. Litigation

        Various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business are
pending against the Company. The subject matter of these proceedings primarily
includes commercial disputes and employment issues. The results of these
proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

12. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

        The Company leases space for its executive offices in properties in
which a principal shareholder/director/executive officer of the Company has a
minority interest. The space was rented at an aggregate annual rent including
real estate taxes of approximately $1,309, $1,307 and $1,376 in fiscal years
1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.


        Marboro Books Corp., the Company's mail-order subsidiary, leases a
76,000 square foot office/warehouse from a partnership in which a principal
shareholder/director/executive officer of the Company has a 50% interest,
pursuant to a lease expiring in 2023. Pursuant to such lease, the Company paid
$743, $665 and $664 in fiscal years 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

        The Company is provided with certain package shipping services by the
LTA Group, Inc. (LTA), a company in which the brother of a principal
shareholder/director/executive officer of the Company acquired a 20% interest
during fiscal 1996. The Company paid LTA $11,528 and $9,100 for such services
during fiscal years 1997 and 1996, respectively.

        The Company leases retail space in a building in which Barnes & Noble
College Bookstores, Inc. (B&N College), a company owned by a principal
shareholder/director/executive officer of the Company, subleases space for its
executive offices. Occupancy costs allocated by the Company to B&N College for
this space totaled $634 and $544 for the fiscal years ended January 31, 1998 and
February 1, 1997, respectively. In connection with the space, the Company
reimbursed B&N College during fiscal 1997, for a landmark tax credit totaling
$726.

        B&N College also allocated certain expenses it incurred on behalf of the
Company for salaries, employee benefit plan expenses and office support
services. These charges are included in selling and administrative expenses in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and approximated $75,
$115, and $1,219 for fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The Company
charged B&N College $473 during fiscal 1997 for capital expenditures, business
insurance and other operating costs incurred on their behalf.

        The Company uses a jet aircraft owned by B&N College and pays for the
costs and expenses of operating the aircraft based upon the Company's usage.
Such costs, which include fuel, insurance, personnel and other costs,
approximate $1,910, $1,685 and $1,298 during fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively, and are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED


        On November 27, 1996, Babbage's Etc., LLC (Babbage's), a company owned
by a principal shareholder/director/executive officer of the Company, acquired
substantially all of the assets of Software Etc. Stores, Inc. (Software), a
company (formerly a division of the Company) in which two principal
shareholder-directors had an ownership interest, and assumed the operations of
14 retail software departments located within Barnes & Noble stores. As of
January 31, 1998, there are 13 of these departments remaining. The Company pays
all rent related to these properties for which it receives a license fee from
Babbage's equal to 7.0% of the gross sales of such departments. The Company also
provides real estate and construction services to Babbage's and purchases

business insurance on its behalf for which the Company is reimbursed for its
incremental costs to provide such services. The Company charged Software and
Babbage's, on a combined basis, $1,430, $1,282 and $4,992 during fiscal 1997,
1996, and 1995, respectively, for such services, license fees, rent, operating
costs, insurance costs and benefit coverage. Babbage's also purchases
merchandise from the Company at prices equal to the Company's cost to obtain and
ship the merchandise.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


The Board of Directors
Barnes & Noble, Inc.

        We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Barnes &
Noble, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 31, 1998 and February 1, 1997
and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in
shareholders' equity and cash flows for the fiscal years ended January
31, 1998, February 1, 1997, and January 27, 1996, respectively. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.

        We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

        In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Barnes &
Noble, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of January 31, 1998 and February 1, 1997 and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for the fiscal years ended
January 31, 1998, February 1, 1997 and January 27, 1996, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.
