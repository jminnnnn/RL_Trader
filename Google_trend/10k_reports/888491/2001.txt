PART I

Item 1 -- Business of the Company

Overview

    Omega  Healthcare  Investors,  Inc. (the "Company") was  incorporated in the
state of  Maryland  on March 31,  1992.  It is a  self-administered  real estate
investment trust ("REIT") investing in income-producing  healthcare  facilities,
principally  long-term care facilities located in the United States. The Company
provides lease or mortgage  financing to qualified  operators of skilled nursing
facilities and, to a lesser extent,  assisted living and acute care  facilities.
Financing for investments has been historically provided by borrowings under the
Company's  revolving lines of credit,  private placements or public offerings of
debt or equity,  the  assumption of secured  indebtedness,  or a combination  of
these methods.  The Company also finances  acquisitions  through the exchange of
properties or the issuance of shares of its capital stock when such transactions
otherwise satisfy the Company's investment criteria.

    In November 1997, the Company formed Omega Worldwide, Inc. ("Worldwide"),  a
company  which  provides  asset  management  services  and  management  advisory
services,  as well as  equity  and  debt  capital  to the  healthcare  industry,
particularly  residential  healthcare services to the elderly. On April 2, 1998,
the Company contributed  substantially all of its assets in Principal Healthcare
Finance Limited,  ("Principal") an Isle of Jersey (United Kingdom)  company,  to
Worldwide in exchange for  approximately  8.5 million shares of Worldwide common
stock and 260,000 shares of Series B preferred stock. Of the 8,500,000 shares of
Worldwide  common stock  received by the Company,  approximately  5,200,000 were
distributed on April 2, 1998 to the  shareholders of the Company,  and 2,300,000
shares were sold by the Company on April 3, 1998.  As of December 31, 2000,  the
carrying  value  of  the  Company's   investment  in  Worldwide  is  $5,435,000,
represented by 1,163,000  shares of common stock and 260,000 shares of preferred
stock. The Company also holds a $1,615,000  investment in Principal  represented
by 990,000  ordinary  shares of  Principal  and a $1,266,000  investment  in the
Principal  Healthcare  Finance Trust, an Australian  Unit Trust.  ("Trust") (See
Note  11 to  the  Company's  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  Related  Party
Transactions).

    On July 17, 2000,  the Company  received gross proceeds of $100 million from
the  issuance  of one million  shares of Series C  Convertible  Preferred  Stock
("Series C") at $100 per share to Explorer Holdings,  L.P. Proceeds were used to
pay maturing debt. The Series C shares are initially convertible into 16 million
shares of common  stock,  par value $.10 per share,  of the Company (the "Common
Stock").  Dividends  on the Series C are  cumulative  from the date of  original
issue and are payable  quarterly  commencing  on November 15,  2000.  Holders of
Series C are  entitled to receive  dividends  at the greater of 10% per annum of
the liquidation  preference and the amount per share paid by Omega on its Common
Stock  based on the  number of shares of Common  Stock  into which the shares of
Series  C are  then  convertible.  (See  Note 10 to the  Company's  Consolidated
Financial Statements - Shareholders' Equity and Stock Options).

    During 1998, the Company  initiated a plan to dispose of certain  properties
judged to have limited  long-term  potential and  re-deploy  the  proceeds.  The
Company  recorded a provision  for  impairment of $6.8 million in 1998 to adjust
the carrying  value of those  assets  judged to be impaired to their fair value,
less cost of disposal. During the fourth quarter of 1999, management initiated a
plan for additional asset sales to be completed in 2000 and recorded a provision
for impairment of $19.5 million. During 2000, the Company recorded an additional
provision for impairment of $14.4 million  related to assets held for sale. (See
Item 7 Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results
of Operations).

    As  a consequence of the financial  difficulties  encountered by a number of
the Company's operators, the Company has recovered various long-term care assets
pledged as collateral for the operators' obligations either in connection with a
restructuring  or settlement  with certain  operators or pursuant to foreclosure
proceedings. Under normal circumstances,  the Company would classify such assets
as "assets  held for sale" and seek to  re-lease  or  otherwise  dispose of such
assets as promptly as practicable.  However,  a number of companies are actively
marketing  portfolios of similar assets and, in light of the current  conditions
in the long-term care industry  generally,  it has become more difficult both to
sell such  properties  and for potential  buyers to obtain  financing to acquire
such properties.  As a result,  during 2000, $24.3 million of assets  previously
classified as held for sale were  reclassified to "owned and operated assets" as
the timing and strategy for sale or, alternatively,  re-leasing, were revised in
light of prevailing market conditions.

    As of December 31, 2000,  the  Company's  portfolio of domestic  investments
consisted of 264 healthcare facilities,  located in 29 states and operated by 27
third-party  operators.  The Company's  gross  investments  in these  facilities
totaled  $919 million at December  31,  2000.  This  portfolio is made up of 130
long-term healthcare facilities and 2 rehabilitation  hospitals owned and leased
to third  parties,  fixed  rate,  participating  and  convertible  participating
mortgages  on 63 long-term  healthcare  facilities  and 69 long-term  healthcare


                                       1
<PAGE>

facilities that were recovered from customers and are currently operated through
third-party  management  contracts for the  Company's own account,  including 12
facilities subject to third-party  leasehold  interests.  The Company also holds
miscellaneous  investments  and closed  healthcare  facilities  held for sale of
approximately  $57.2  million at December  31,  2000,  including  $22.4  million
related to two  non-healthcare  facilities  leased by the United  States  Postal
Service,  Worldwide,  Principal  and Trust of $8.3 million and $15.6  million of
notes receivable.

Summary Financial Information

         The  following  tables  summarize  the  Company's Net Revenues and Real
Estate Assets by asset  category for December 31, 2000,  1999 and 1998,  setting

Description of the Business

    The Company  maintains  a  diversified  portfolio  of  long-term  healthcare
facilities or mortgages on healthcare  facilities  located in the United States.
In making  investments,  the  Company  generally  seeks and  intends to focus on
established,  creditworthy,  middle-market  healthcare  operators  that meet the
Company's standards for quality and experience of management.  The Company seeks
to diversify its  investments  in terms of geographic  locations,  operators and
facility types.

                                       2
<PAGE>

    In evaluating potential investments,  the Company considers such factors as:
(i) the quality and  experience of management  and the credit  worthiness of the
operator of the facility; (ii) the facility's historical, current and forecasted
cash flow and its adequacy to meet operational needs,  capital  expenditures and
lease or debt service obligations,  providing a competitive return on investment
to the Company;  (iii) the  construction  quality,  condition  and design of the
facility;  (iv) the geographic area and type of facility;  (v) the tax,  growth,
regulatory and reimbursement  environment of the community in which the facility
is located;  (vi) the occupancy and demand for similar healthcare  facilities in
the same or nearby communities; and (vii) the payor mix of private, Medicare and
Medicaid patients.

    A fundamental  investment  strategy of the Company is to obtain  contractual
rent  escalations  under  long-term,  non-cancelable,  "triple-net"  leases  and
revenue  participation  through  participating  mortgage  loans,  and to  obtain
substantial  liquidity  deposits.  Additional  security is typically provided by
covenants  regarding  minimum working  capital and net worth,  liens on accounts
receivable and other operating assets, and various provisions for cross-default,
cross-collateralization and corporate/personal guarantees, when appropriate.

    The Company  prefers to invest in equity  ownership  of  properties.  Due to
regulatory,   tax  or  other  considerations,   the  Company  sometimes  pursues
alternative  investment  structures,  including  convertible  participating  and
participating mortgages,  that achieve returns comparable to equity investments.
The following  summarizes the four primary investment  structures currently used
by  the  Company.   Average  annualized  yields  reflect  existing   contractual
arrangements  and  an  estimate  of  restructured  arrangements  for  one of the
Company's  troubled  operators.  However,  in  view  of  the  ongoing  financial
challenges in the long-term  care  industry,  no assurance can be given that the
operators of the Company's  facilities  will meet their payment  obligations  in
full or when due. Certain operators have recently  indicated to the Company that
they intend to delay or reduce the payment of their  contractual  obligations to
the Company, and therefore the annualized yields as of January 1, 2001 set forth
below are not  necessarily  indicative of or a forecast of actual yields,  which
may be lower.  (See Item 7 -  Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition  and Results of Operations  and Note 15 to the Company's  Consolidated
Financial Statements - Subsequent Events).

     Purchase/Leaseback.  The Company's  owned  properties are generally  leased
     under  provisions  of leases  for terms  ranging  from 8 to 17 years,  plus
     renewal options. The leases originated by the Company generally provide for
     minimum annual rentals which are subject to annual formula increases (i.e.,
     based upon such factors as increases in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI") or
     increases in the revenues of the underlying properties), with certain fixed
     minimum and maximum  levels.  Generally,  the  operator  holds an option to
     repurchase at set dates at prices based on specified formulas.  The average
     annualized yield from leases was 11.19% at January 1, 2001.

     Convertible Participating Mortgage. Convertible Participating Mortgages are
     secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying  real estate and personal
     property of the  mortgagor.  Interest  rates are usually  subject to annual
     increases  based upon  increases in the CPI or increases in revenues of the
     underlying   long-term  care  facilities,   with  certain  maximum  limits.
     Convertible Participating Mortgages afford the Company an option to convert
     its mortgage into direct  ownership of the  property,  generally at a point
     six to nine years from  inception;  they are then subject to a leaseback to
     the  operator  for the  balance  of the  original  agreed  term and for the
     original agreed participations in revenues or CPI adjustments.  This allows
     the Company to capture a portion of the potential  appreciation in value of
     the real estate. The operator has the right to buy out the Company's option
     at prices  based on specified  formulas.  The average  annualized  yield on
     these mortgages was approximately 12.99% at January 1, 2001.

     Participating  Mortgage.  Participating  Mortgages  are  secured  by  first
     mortgage liens on the underlying  real estate and personal  property of the
     mortgagor.  Interest rates are usually  subject to annual  increases  based
     upon  increases  in the CPI or  increases  in  revenues  of the  underlying
     long-term  care  facilities,  with  certain  maximum  limits.  The  average
     annualized yield on these investments was  approximately  13.26% at January
     1, 2001.

     Fixed-Rate  Mortgage.  These  Mortgages  have a fixed interest rate for the
     mortgage  term and are secured by first  mortgage  liens on the  underlying
     real estate and personal property of the mortgagor.  The average annualized
     yield on these investments was 11.20% at January 1, 2001.

    The table set forth in Item 2 -- Properties,  herein,  contains  information
regarding the Company's real estate properties,  their geographic locations, and
the types of investment structures as of December 31, 2000.

Borrowing   Policies.   The  Company  may  incur  additional   indebtedness  and
anticipates it will generally maintain a long-term debt-to-total  capitalization
(total capitalization is total shareholders equity plus long-term debt) ratio in
the range of 40% to 50%. The Company intends to review  periodically  its policy
with respect to its debt-to-total capitalization ratio and to modify such policy
as its management deems prudent in light of prevailing  market  conditions.  The
Company's  strategy generally has been to match the maturity of its indebtedness
with the maturity of its investment assets, and to employ long-term,  fixed-rate
debt to the extent  practicable  in view of market  conditions in existence from
time to time.

    The  Company  may use  proceeds of any  additional  indebtedness  to provide
permanent  financing for investments in additional  healthcare  facilities.  The
Company may obtain  either  secured or  unsecured  indebtedness,  and may obtain
indebtedness  which may be  convertible  into capital stock or be accompanied by
warrants to purchase  capital  stock.  Where debt  financing is present on terms
deemed  favorable,  the Company  generally may invest in  properties  subject to
existing  loans,  secured  by  mortgages,  deeds of trust  or  similar  liens on
properties.

    The  Company  has  two  secured  revolving  lines  of  credit  (the  "credit
facilities")  which  permit  borrowings  of up to $175  million and $75 million,
respectively.  These credit  facilities  provide working capital for the Company
and temporary funds for new investments in healthcare facilities.  The Company's
strategy has been to periodically  replace funds drawn on the credit  facilities
through  long-term,   fixed-rate  borrowings,   the  issuance  of  equity-linked
borrowings, or the issuance of additional shares of capital stock.

    The Company  also has $50 million of  available  funds  through July 1, 2001
pursuant to an Investment  Agreement with Explorer Holdings,  L.P.  ("Explorer")
which can be used,  upon  satisfaction  of certain  conditions,  to fund growth.
Following the drawing in full or expiration  of this  commitment,  Explorer will
have the option to provide up to an additional $50 million to fund growth for an
additional  twelve-month  period. (See Note 10 - Shareholders'  Equity and Stock
Options).

    Industry turmoil and continuing adverse economic  conditions have caused the
terms  on  which  the  Company  can  obtain  additional   borrowings  to  become
unfavorable.  If the Company is in need of capital to repay  indebtedness  as it
matures,  the Company may be required to liquidate  investments in properties at
times  which  may  not  permit  realization  of the  maximum  recovery  on  such
investments.  This also could result in adverse tax consequences to the Company.
The Company may also be required to pursue dilutive equity issuances. See Item 7
- --  Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of
Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Government  Healthcare  Regulation,  Reimbursements  and Industry  Concentration
Risks. The healthcare  industry is highly regulated by federal,  state and local
law, and is directly  affected by state and local  licensure,  fines and loss of
certification to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid  programs,  as well as
potential criminal penalties. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (the "Budget Act")
enacted a number of anti-fraud and abuse  provisions and contains civil monetary
penalties for an operator's  violation of the anti-kickback laws. The Budget Act
also  imposes an  affirmative  duty on operators to ensure they do not employ or
contract with persons excluded from the Medicare or other governmental programs.

                                       4
<PAGE>

It also provides a minimum  ten-year period for exclusion from  participation in
federal  healthcare  programs  for  operators  convicted  of a prior  healthcare
offense.

    Governmental   investigations   and  enforcement  of  healthcare  laws  have
increased dramatically and are expected to continue to increase. The increase in
governmental  investigations,  the Budget Act, future healthcare  legislation or
other changes in administration  or  interpretation  of governmental  healthcare
programs  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on the  liquidity,  financial
condition or results of operations of the Company's operators,  which could also
have a  material  adverse  effect on their  ability  to make  rent and  interest
payments to the Company.

    Based on information provided by the operators of the Company's  facilities,
the following table sets forth the  approximate  payor mix for the most recently
reported twelve-month period:
<TABLE>
          <S>                         <C>
         Medicaid .................. 55.3 %
         Medicare .................. 22.5
         Private ................... 12.7
         Other .....................  9.5
                                    -----
           Total ...................100.0 %
                                    =====
</TABLE>
    General  liability  and  professional  liability costs in the long-term care
industry  have  significantly  increased  over  the  past  several  years,  with
increases in the number and average  size of claims.  Excluding  Florida,  where
recent experience is materially  inconsistent with most other states, the number
of claims in the long-term  industry has been  increasing  annually at a rate of
approximately  8%, while the size of such claims has increased  14%. In Florida,
the number of claims has been  increasing  annually  at a rate of  approximately
23%, while the size of such claims has increased  18%.1 The increased  magnitude
and  unpredictability  of losses has led a number of insurance companies to exit
from the long-term care industry,  resulting in dramatically  increased premiums
and increased difficulties in obtaining coverage.

    Nearly  all of the Company's  properties are used as healthcare  facilities,
therefore,  the Company is directly  affected  by the risk  associated  with the
healthcare  industry.  The  Company's  lessees  and  mortgagors,  as well as the
facilities  owned and operated for the Company's  account,  derive a substantial
portion of their net operating revenues from third-party  payers,  including the
Medicare and Medicaid  programs.  Such programs are highly regulated and subject
to frequent and substantial  changes.  Due to the implementation of the terms of
the Budget Act,  effective  January 1, 1999,  the  majority  of skilled  nursing
facilities  shifted from payments  based on  reimbursable  cost to a prospective
payment  system  ("PPS")  for  services  provided  to  Medicare   beneficiaries.
Implementation  of PPS has affected each  long-term care facility to a different
degree  depending upon the amount of revenue it derives from Medicare  patients.
Long-term care facilities have had to attempt to restructure their operations to
operate profitably under the new Medicare PPS reimbursement policies.

     In  addition,   private  payors,   including   managed  care  payers,   are
increasingly   demanding   discounted  fee  structures  and  the  assumption  by
healthcare  providers of all or a portion of the  financial  risk of operating a
healthcare facility. Efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost
controls are expected to continue.  Any changes in reimbursement  policies which
reduce  reimbursement  levels could  adversely  affect revenues of the Company's
lessees and borrowers and thereby adversely affect those lessees' and borrowers'
abilities to make their monthly lease or debt payments to the Company.

    The  possibility  that the healthcare  facilities  will not generate  income
sufficient  to meet  operating  expenses or will yield  returns lower than those
available through investments in comparable real estate or other investments are
additional  risks of investing in  healthcare-related  real estate.  Income from
properties  and yields from  investments  in such  properties may be affected by
many  factors,  including  changes in  governmental  regulation  (such as zoning
laws),  general or local economic  conditions  (such as fluctuations in interest
rates and  employment  conditions),  the  available  local supply and demand for
improved real estate, a reduction in rental income as the result of an inability
to maintain occupancy levels, natural disasters (such as earthquakes and floods)
or similar factors.

  Liability Actuarial Analysis, February 12, 2001.

    Real estate  investments  are relatively  illiquid and,  therefore,  tend to
limit the ability of the Company to vary its  portfolio  promptly in response to
changes in economic or other conditions.  The Company's  properties are "special
purpose" properties that could not be readily converted to general  residential,
retail or office use. Healthcare  facilities that participate in Medicare and/or
Medicaid programs must meet extensive program  requirements,  including physical
plant and  operational  requirements,  which are revised from time to time. Such
requirements may include a duty to admit Medicare and Medicaid patients, thereby
limiting the ability of the  facility to increase its private pay census  beyond
certain  limits.  Medicare and Medicaid  facilities  are regularly  inspected to
determine  compliance  and may be  excluded  from the  programs -- in some cases
without a prior hearing -- for failure to meet program  requirements.  Transfers
of nursing homes and other  healthcare-related  facilities between operators are
subject to  regulatory  approvals  not required for  transfers of other types of
commercial  operations and other types of real estate. Thus, if the operation of
any of the Company's properties becomes unprofitable due to competition,  age of
improvements or other factors such that the lessee or borrower becomes unable to
meet its obligations on the lease or mortgage loan, the liquidation value of the
property may be substantially less, particularly relative to the amount owing on
any related  mortgage loan,  than would be the case if the property were readily
adaptable to other uses.

    Other changes in the healthcare  industry include  continuing  trends toward
shorter  lengths  of  stay,  increased  use of  outpatient  services,  increased
federal,  state and third-party  regulation and oversight of healthcare  company
operations and business practices and increased demand for capitated  healthcare
services  (delivery  of services at a fixed price per capita  basis to a defined
group of covered parties). The entrance of insurance companies into managed care
programs  is  also   accelerating  the  introduction  of  managed  care  in  new
localities,  and states and insurance  companies  continue to negotiate actively
the amounts they will pay for services.  Moreover,  the percentage of healthcare
services that are reimbursed under Medicare and Medicaid  programs  continues to
increase as the population  ages and as states expand their  Medicaid  programs.
Continued  eligibility  to  participate  in  these  programs  is  crucial  to  a
provider's   financial   strength.   Finally,   healthcare   regulation  through
Certificates  of Need ("CON") has tended to limit  construction of new long-term
care  facilities  in many  states.  Several  states  in which  the  Company  has
investments  have  repealed CON  legislation,  including  California  and Texas,
opening  up   opportunities   for  additional   competition  for  the  Company's
facilities.  As a result of the  foregoing,  the  revenues  and  margins  of the
operators of the Company's facilities may decrease,  resulting in a reduction of
the Company's rent/interest coverage from investments.

Potential Risks from Bankruptcies.  Generally,  the Company's lease arrangements
with a single operator who operates more than one of the Company's facilities is
designed  pursuant to a single master lease (a "Master  Lease" or  collectively,
the "Master  Leases").  Although  each lease or Master Lease  provides  that the
Company may terminate the Master Lease upon the  bankruptcy or insolvency of the
tenant,  the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978  ("Bankruptcy  Code") provides that a
trustee in a bankruptcy or  reorganization  proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code
(or  debtor-in-possession in a reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code) has the
power and the option to assume or reject the unexpired  lease  obligations  of a
debtor-lessee. In the event that the unexpired lease is assumed on behalf of the
debtor-lessee, all the rental obligations thereunder generally would be entitled
to a priority over other unsecured claims. However, the court also has the power
to  modify a lease if a  debtor-lessee  in a  reorganization  were  required  to
perform  certain  provisions  of a lease that the court  determined to be unduly
burdensome.  It is not possible at this time to determine whether or not a court
would hold that any lease or Master  Lease  contains any such  provisions.  If a
lease is  rejected,  the lessor  has a general  unsecured  claim  limited to any
unpaid rent  already  due plus an amount  equal to the rent  reserved  under the
lease, without acceleration, for the greater of one year or 15% of the remaining
term of such lease, not to exceed the rent obligation for three years.

    Generally,  with respect to the Company's  mortgage loans, the imposition of
an  automatic  stay  under  the  Bankruptcy  Code  precludes  the  Company  from
exercising foreclosure or other remedies against the debtor. A mortgagee also is
treated  differently from a landlord in three key respects.  First, the mortgage
loan is not subject to  assumption  or rejection  because it is not an executory
contract or a lease.  Second,  the  mortgagee's  loan may be divided  into (1) a
secured loan for the portion of the mortgage debt that does not exceed the value
of the property and (2) a general unsecured loan for the portion of the mortgage
debt that  exceeds the value of the  property.  A secured  creditor  such as the
Company is  entitled to the  recovery  of interest  and costs only if and to the
extent that the value of the collateral exceeds the amount owed. If the value of
the  collateral  is less than the debt,  a lender such as the Company  would not
receive or be entitled to any interest for the time period between the filing of
the case and confirmation.  If the value of the collateral does exceed the debt,
interest and allowed costs may not be paid during the bankruptcy  proceeding but
accrue until  confirmation of a plan or reorganization or some other time as the
court  orders.  Finally,  while a lease  generally  would  either be rejected or
assumed with all of its benefits  and burdens  intact,  the terms of a mortgage,
including the rate of interest and timing of principal payments, may be modified
if the debtor is able to effect a "cramdown" under the Bankruptcy Code.

    The receipt of liquidation  proceeds or the  replacement of an operator that
has  defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval  process of
any federal, state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the property or
the  replacement of the operator  licensed to manage the facility.  In addition,
certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment (such as

                                       6
<PAGE>
real  estate  taxes and  maintenance  costs)  are  generally  not  reduced  when
circumstances  cause a  reduction  in income  from the  investment.  In order to
protect its  investments,  the Company may take possession of a property or even
become licensed as an operator,  which might expose the Company to successorship
liability to government programs or require the Company to indemnify  subsequent
operators to whom it might  transfer the operating  rights and  licenses.  Third
party  payors may also  suspend  payments to the Company  following  foreclosure
until the Company  receives  the  required  licenses to operate the  facilities.
Should such events occur,  the Company's  income and cash flows from  operations
would be adversely affected. See Note 3 - Mortgage Notes Receivable and Note 5 -
Concentration of Risk, to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

Risks Related to Owned and Operated  Assets.  As a consequence  of the financial
difficulties encountered by a number of the Company's operators, the Company has
recovered  various  long-term  care  assets,   pledged  as  collateral  for  the
operators' obligations,  either in connection with a restructuring or settlement
with certain  operators  or pursuant to  foreclosure  proceedings.  Under normal
circumstances,  the Company would classify such assets as "assets held for sale"
and seek to  re-lease  or  otherwise  dispose  of such  assets  as  promptly  as
practicable. However, a number of companies are actively marketing portfolios of
similar  assets and, in light of the current  conditions in the  long-term  care
industry  generally,  it has become more difficult both to sell such  properties
and for potential buyers to obtain financing to acquire such properties.  During
2000,  $24.3  million  of  assets  previously  classified  as held for sale were
reclassified to "owned and operated  assets" as the timing and strategy for sale
or,  alternatively,  re-leasing,  were  revised  in light of  prevailing  market
conditions.

    The  Company  is  typically  required  to  hold  applicable  leases  and  is
responsible for the regulatory  compliance at its owned and operated facilities.
The  Company's  management   contracts  with  third-party   operators  for  such
properties  provide that the third-party  operator is responsible for regulatory
compliance,  but the Company  could be  sanctioned  for  violation of regulatory
requirements.  In addition,  the risk of third-party claims such as patient care
and  personal  injury  claims may be higher  with  respect to Company  owned and
operated properties as compared to the Company's leased and mortgaged assets.

Competition. The Company competes for additional healthcare facility investments
with other healthcare investors,  including other real estate investment trusts.
The  operators of the  facilities  compete with other  regional or local nursing
care facilities for the support of the medical community,  including  physicians
and acute  care  hospitals,  as well as the  general  public.  Some  significant
competitive factors for the placing of patients in skilled and intermediate care
nursing facilities include quality of care,  reputation,  physical appearance of
the facilities,  services offered,  family  preferences,  physician services and
price.

Federal Income Tax Considerations. At all times, the Company intends to make and
manage its  investments  (including the sale or disposition of property or other
investments)  and to  operate  in such a  manner  as to be  consistent  with the
requirements  of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") (or
regulations  thereunder)  to  qualify as a REIT,  unless,  because of changes in
circumstances or changes in the Code (or regulations  thereunder),  the Board of
Directors determines that it is no longer in the best interest of the Company to
qualify as a REIT. As a REIT, the Company  generally will not pay federal income
taxes on the  portion  of its  income  which  is  distributed  to  shareholders,
although  income  earned  from  foreclosure  property  (the  owned and  operated
assets),  after deducting  depreciation  expense,  is subject to corporate level
taxation.

Item 3 - Legal Proceedings

    On June 20,  2000,  the  Company  and its  chief  executive  officer,  chief
financial  officer  and chief  operating  officer  were named as  defendants  in
certain litigation brought by Ronald M. Dickerman,  in his individual  capacity,
in the United States  District  Court for the Southern  District of New York. In
the complaint,  Mr. Dickerman  contends that the Company and the named executive
officers violated Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and Rule 10b-5 promulgated  thereunder.  Mr. Dickerman  subsequently amended the
complaint to assert his claims on behalf of an unnamed class of  plaintiffs.  On
July 28, 2000,  Benjamin LeBorys commenced a class action lawsuit making similar
allegations against the Company and certain of its officers and directors in the
United States  District  Court for the Southern  District of New York. The cases
have been  consolidated,  and Mr.  LeBorys  has been named lead  plaintiff.  The
plaintiffs seek unspecified  damages. The Company has reported the litigation to
its  directors and officers  liability  insurer.  The Company  believes that the
litigation is without merit and is defending vigorously. The Company's Motion to
Dismiss was filed with the Court on February 16, 2001.

    On June 21, 2000, the Company was named as a defendant in certain litigation
brought  against it by  Madison/OHI  Liquidity  Investors,  LLC  ("Madison"),  a
customer  that  claims  that the  Company  has  breached  and/or  anticipatorily
breached a commercial  contract.  Mr. Dickerman is a partner of Madison and is a
guarantor of Madison's  obligations to the Company.  Madison claims damages as a
result of the alleged breach of approximately $700,000. Madison seeks damages as
a result of the claimed  anticipatory breach in the amount of $15 million or, in
the alternative,  Madison seeks specific performance of the contract as modified
by a course of conduct that Madison  alleges  developed  between Madison and the
Company.  The Company  contends that Madison is in default under the contract in
question. The Company believes that the litigation is meritless.  The Company is
defending  vigorously  and on  December  5, 2000,  filed  counterclaims  against
Madison and the  guarantors,  including  Mr.  Dickerman,  seeking  repayment  of
approximately $8.5 million that Madison owes the Company.

    Karrington  Health,  Inc. brought suit against the Company alleging that the
Company  repudiated  and  ultimately  breached a  financing  contract to provide
$95,000,000 of financing for the development of 13 assisted  living  facilities.
Karrington seeks recovery of approximately  $20,000,000 in damages it alleges to
have incurred as a result of the breach. The Company denies that it entered into
a valid and binding  contract with  Karrington  and is vigorously  defending the
litigation.

    The closing  price on December 29, 2000 was $3.75 per share.  As of December
31,  2000,  there  were  20,037,995  shares of  common  stock  outstanding  with
approximately  2,300  registered  holders and  approximately  17,700  beneficial
owners.

    On February 1, 2001,  the Company  announced  the  suspension  of common and
preferred dividends,  to preserve cash to strengthen the Company's balance sheet
in order to facilitate  the Company's  ability to obtain  financing to fund debt
maturing in 2002.

    The Company  anticipates that it will reinstate  dividends on the common and
preferred stock when the Company determines that it has sufficient  resources or

                                       11

satisfactory  plans to meet its 2002 debt  maturities.  The  Company can give no
assurance  as to when the  dividends  will be  reinstated  or the  amount of the
dividends,  if and when such  payments are  recommenced.  All accrued and unpaid
dividends  on the  Company's  outstanding  shares of Series A, B and C preferred
stock must be paid in full before  dividends on the Common Stock can be resumed.

Overview

         The long-term  care industry has  experienced  unprecedented  financial
challenges  in the recent  past that have had an adverse  impact on the  Company
during 2000. These challenges are due principally to the introduction in 1998 of
PPS for  the  reimbursement  of  skilled  nursing  facilities,  implementing  an
acuity-based reimbursement system in lieu of the cost-based reimbursement system
historically  used. The effect of PPS was to  significantly  reduce  payments to
nursing home  operators;  that reduction,  in turn, has negatively  affected the
revenues  of the  Company's  nursing  home  facilities  and the  ability  of the
Company's nursing home operators to service their capital costs to the Company.

      These  current  challenges  have forced many  nursing  home  operators  in
America into financial  distress.  A number of the Company's  large nursing home
operators  ultimately sought protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code,
including:  Allegheny  Health Systems in 1998; Sun Healthcare Group and Frontier
Group, Inc. in 1999; and Integrated Health Services,  RainTree  Healthcare Corp.
and Mariner Post-Acute Network, Inc. in 2000. Another operator,  Advocat,  Inc.,
suspended  payment  of rent to the  Company  during  the first  quarter of 2000,
reinstated  partial  payments  in April 2000,  and  negotiated  a  restructuring
arrangement with the Company in November 2000.

      These developments negatively affected the Company's financial results and
the  Company's  access to capital  sources to fund  growth as well as  refinance
existing  indebtedness.  To obtain sufficient liquidity to enable the Company to
address the maturity in July 2000 and  February  2001 of  indebtedness  totaling
$129.8 million, the Company issued $100.0 million of Series C preferred stock to
Explorer  Holdings,   L.P.  in  July,  2000.  (See  Note  10  to  the  Company's
Consolidated  Financial  Statements -  Shareholders'  Equity and Stock Options).
Simultaneously  with the  issuance of the Series C  preferred,  the Company also
refinanced its existing credit facilities.

      As a consequence of the financial difficulties  encountered by a number of
the Company's operators, the Company has recovered various long-term care assets
pledged as collateral for the operators' obligations either in connection with a
restructuring  or settlement  with certain  operators or pursuant to foreclosure
proceedings. Under normal circumstances,  the Company would classify such assets
as "assets  held for sale" and seek to  re-lease  or  otherwise  dispose of such
assets as promptly as practicable.  However,  a number of companies are actively
marketing  portfolios of similar assets and, in light of the current  conditions
in the long-term care industry  generally,  it has become more difficult both to
sell such  properties  and for potential  buyers to obtain  financing to acquire

                                       13
<PAGE>
such properties.  As a result,  during 2000, $24.3 million of assets  previously
classified as held for sale were  reclassified to "owned and operated assets" as
the timing and strategy for sale or, alternatively,  re-leasing, were revised in
light of prevailing market conditions.

         As of December 31,  2000,  the Company  owned 69  long-term  healthcare
facilities that had been recovered from customers and are currently operated for
the  Company's  own account.  During 1999 and 2000,  the Company  experienced  a
significant  increase in nursing home revenues  attributable  to the increase in
owned and operated assets. In addition,  in connection with the recovery of such
assets, the Company often funds working capital and deferred capital expenditure
needs for a  transitional  period until license  transfers and other  regulatory
matters are completed and  reimbursement  from third-party  payors  recommences.
Management  intends to sell or  re-lease  such  assets as  promptly  as possible
consistent with achieving valuations that reflect management's  estimate of fair
realizable value of such assets. There can be no assurance,  however, if or when
such  dispositions  will be  completed  or  whether  such  dispositions  will be
completed  on terms that will  enable the  Company to realize  the fair value of
such assets.

         In November 2000,  Explorer agreed to defer receipt until April 2, 2001
of $4.7 million in dividends declared in October 2000 on the Series C preferred.
The Company requested this deferral in light of the maturity in February of 2001
of $16.6  million of  subordinated  debentures.  In February  2001,  the Company
suspended  payment of all  dividends on all classes of capital  stock until such
time as  management  has  identified  alternative  sources of capital to address
indebtedness  maturing in 2002.  In light of the  prevailing  conditions  in the
long-term  care  industry  and the  capital  markets  generally  accessed by the
Company, on March 30, 2001, the Company exercised its option to pay the deferred
Series C dividend and associated  waiver fee by issuing 48,420 additional shares
of Series C to Explorer.  These shares are  convertible  into 774,722  shares of
Common  Stock at  $6.25  per  share.  This  action,  together  with the  general
suspension  of  dividends  on all classes of the  Company's  capital  stock,  is
intended to preserve cash to strengthen the Company's  balance sheet in order to
facilitate  the  Company's  ability  to obtain  financing  to fund the 2002 debt
maturities.  The Company  currently  intends to resume paying  dividends at such
time as the Company  identifies  sufficient  resources or satisfactory  plans to
address its 2002 debt maturities. There can be no assurance,  however, as to the
timing of any resumption of dividends or the amount of any dividends if and when
such  dividends are resumed.  All accrued and unpaid  dividends on the Company's
Series A, B and C preferred  stock must be paid in full before  dividends on the
Company's  Common Stock can be resumed.  (See  Liquidity  and Capital  Resources
below  and  Note  15  to  the  Company's  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  -
Subsequent Events).

     The following is a discussion of the  consolidated  results of  operations,
financial  position and  liquidity and capital  resources of the Company,  which
should be read in conjunction  with the  consolidated  financial  statements and
accompanying notes.


Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31, 2000 compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999

     Revenues for the year ended  December 31, 2000 totaled $275.8  million,  an
increase of $127.7 million over 1999 revenues.  This increase is principally due
to the  inclusion of revenue from nursing home  operations  for assets owned and
operated  for the  Company's  account  recovered  pursuant  to  foreclosure  and
settlements  with  troubled  operators  in 2000  and  revenues  associated  with
foreclosure  assets that were previously  classified as Assets Held for Sale and
reclassified  to Owned and  Operated  assets  during the third  quarter of 2000.
Excluding  nursing home  revenues of Owned and Operated  Assets,  revenues  were
$96.8 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of
$26.1 million from the comparable prior year period.

     Rental income for the year ended December 31, 2000 totaled $67.3 million, a
decrease of $9.1  million over 1999 rental  income.  The decrease is due to $8.7
million from reductions in lease revenue due to  foreclosures,  bankruptcies and
restructurings,  and $4.9 million from  reduced  investments  caused by 1999 and
2000 asset  sales.  These  decreases  are offset by $2.4  million in  additional
revenue from 1999  investments  held for a full year,  $1.3 million  relating to
contractual  increases in rents that became  effective in 2000 as defined  under
the related  agreements  and $0.8  million from a mortgage  that  converted to a
lease in 1999.

    Mortgage  interest income for the year ended December 31, 2000 totaled $24.1
million,  decreasing  $12.2  million over 1999  mortgage  interest  income.  The
decrease  is  due  to  $7.3  million  from   reductions  due  to   foreclosures,
bankruptcies and restructurings, $4.7 million from reduced investments caused by
the  payoffs of  mortgages  and $0.8  million  reduction  from a  mortgage  that
converted  to a lease  in 1999.  These  decreases  are  offset  by $0.5  million
relating to contractual  increases in interest  income that became  effective in
2000 as defined under the related agreements.

                                       14
<PAGE>

    Nursing  home  revenues  of owned and  operated  assets  for the year  ended
December 31, 2000 totaled $175.6  million,  increasing  $149.3 million over 1999
nursing home revenues. The increase is due to the increased number of facilities
classified  as owned and  operated  assets in 2000 as a result of  bankruptcies,
foreclosures and restructurings.

    Expenses  for  the year ended  December  31, 2000  totaled  $335.3  million,
increasing  approximately  $217.4  million over  expenses of $117.9  million for
1999.

    Nursing  home  expenses for owned and  operated  assets  increased to $179.0
million from $25.2  million in 1999 due to the increase in the number of nursing
homes operated for the Company's account.

    Interest  expense for the year ended  December  31,  2000 was  approximately
$42.4  million,  compared with $42.9  million for 1999.  The decrease in 2000 is
primarily due to lower average  outstanding  borrowings  during the 2000 period,
partially offset by higher average interest rates.

    The 2000 provision for  depreciation and amortization of real estate totaled
$23.3  million,  decreasing  $0.9  million  over 1999.  The  decrease  primarily
consists of $2.0 million  depreciation  expense for properties  sold or held for
sale and a reduction in amortization  of non-compete  agreements of $0.8 million
offset  by  $1.6  million  additional   depreciation   expense  from  properties
previously classified as mortgages and new investments placed in service in 1999
and 2000.

    General  and  administrative  expenses  for 2000  totaled  $6.4  million  as
compared to $5.2  million for 1999,  an increase of $1.2  million or 22.8%.  The
increase is due in part to the incremental administrative costs incurred in 2000
to manage the owned and operated assets,  $0.5 million of non-cash  compensation
expense relating to the Dividend  Equivalent  Rights granted to management,  and
increased consulting costs related to the foreclosure assets.

    Legal  expenses for 2000 totaled $2.5 million as compared to $0.4 million in
1999. The increase is largely  attributable  to legal costs  associated with the
operator  bankruptcy  filings  and  negotiations  with  the  Company's  troubled
operators.

    The Company recognized a $4.7 million charge for severance payments in 2000.
The charges are comprised of severance and consulting  payments to the Company's
former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer.

    The  Company  also  recognized a provision  for loss on mortgages  and notes
receivable of $15.3 million in 2000,  adjusting the carrying  value of mortgages
and notes receivable to their net realizable value.

    A provision  for  impairment  of $61.7  million is included in expenses  for
2000.  This provision  included $14.4 million for assets held for sale to reduce
properties  to fair value less cost to dispose,  $43.0  million  for  facilities
recovered  from  operators  and now held as owned  and  operated  assets to fair
value,  $1.9  million for other real estate  assets and $2.4 million of goodwill
which, due to the diminished value of the related real estate assets, management
has determined is impaired.

    During  2000,  the  Company  sold  certain  of  its  core and  other  assets
realizing  proceeds  of $34.7  million,  resulting  in a gain of $10.0  million.
During 1999,  the Company  completed  asset sales yielding net proceeds of $18.2
million, realizing losses of $10.5 million.

     Funds from operations (FFO) for the year ended December 31, 2000 on a fully
diluted basis totaled $19.2 million,  a decrease of $52.6 million as compared to
the $71.9 million for 1999 due to factors  mentioned above.  After adjusting for
the  non-recurring  provision  for loss on mortgages  and notes  receivable  and
severance and consulting  costs, FFO for the year was $39.3 million,  a decrease
of $32.6  million from the year ended  December  31,  1999.  FFO is net earnings
available  to common  shareholders,  excluding  any  gains or  losses  from debt
restructuring  and the  effects of asset  dispositions,  plus  depreciation  and
amortization associated with real estate investments.  The Company considers FFO
to be one  performance  measure  which is helpful to  investors  of real  estate
companies because,  along with cash flows from operating  activities,  financing
activities and investing activities,  it provides investors and understanding of
the ability of the Company to incur and service  debt and to make  expenditures.
FFO in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities
in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to
net earnings as an indication of operating  performance or to net cash flow from
operating  activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and is not
necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.

    No  provision  for  Federal  income  taxes has been made  since the  Company
continues to qualify as a real estate  investment  trust under the provisions of
Sections  856  through 860 of the  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as amended.
Accordingly, the Company has not been subject to Federal income taxes on amounts
distributed to shareholders, as it distributed at least 95% (90% in 2001) of its
real  estate   investment  trust  taxable  income  and  has  met  certain  other
conditions.


Year Ended December 31, 1999 compared to Year Ended December 31, 1998

    Revenues  for the year ended  December  31,  1999  totaled  $148.1  million,
increasing $38.8 million over 1998 revenues.

    Rental income for the year ended December 31, 1999 totaled $76.4 million, an
increase of $4.3 million over 1999 rental income.  The 1999 revenue growth stems
primarily from $11.7 million in revenue from additional  investments during 1999
and a full year of revenue from  investments made in 1998, $1.2 million relating
to contractual increases in rents that became effective in 1999 as defined under
the related agreements, and $1.3 million from mortgages that converted to leases
in 1999.  These  increases  are offset by $9.9 million from  reductions in lease
revenue due to foreclosure, bankruptcy and asset sales.

    Mortgage  interest income for the year ended December 31, 1999 totaled $36.4
million,  an increase of $6.0 million over 1999 mortgage  interest  income.  The
1999 revenue growth stems primarily from $9.3 million in revenue from additional
investments  during  1999 and a full year of revenue  from  investments  made in
1998, and $0.3 million  relating to contractual  increases in mortgage  interest
that became  effective in 1999 as defined  under the related  agreements.  These
increases are offset by $2.4 million from reductions in interest  revenue due to
the payment of  mortgages  and $1.3  million from  mortgages  that  converted to
leases in 1999.

    Nursing  home  revenues  of owned and  operated  assets  for the year  ended
December  31, 1999  totaled  $26.2  million.  This is due the  consolidation  of
nursing home revenues for owned and operated  assets as a result of foreclosures
occurring in 1999.

    Expenses  for the year  ended  December  31, 1999  totaled  $117.9  million,
increasing approximately $51.8 million over expenses of $66.1 million for 1998.

    Nursing home expenses  attributable to owned and operated  assets  increased
$25.2  million due to recovery of nursing  homes  operated for the Company's own
account.

    The 1999 provision for  depreciation and amortization of real estate totaled
$24.2  million,  increasing  $2.7 million over 1998.  This increase stems from a
full year provision for 1998 investments, plus a partial year provision for 1999
investments.

    Interest  expense for the year ended  December  31,  1999 was  approximately
$42.9  million,  compared with $32.4  million for 1998.  The increase in 1999 is
primarily due to higher average  outstanding  borrowings during the 1999 period,
partially offset by lower average interest rates.

    During  1999,  the Company  completed  asset sales  yielding net proceeds of
$18.2  million,  realizing  losses of $10.5  million.  In  addition,  management
initiated a plan in the 1999 fourth  quarter  for  additional  asset sales to be
completed in 2000. The additional  assets identified as assets held for sale had
a cost of $33.8  million,  a net carrying  value of $28.6 million and annualized
revenue of approximately  $3.4 million.  As a result of this review, the Company
recorded  a  provision  for  impairment  in 1999 of $19.5  million to adjust the
carrying  value  of  assets  held for sale to their  fair  value,  less  cost of
disposal.

    During 1998, the Company  initiated a plan to dispose of certain  properties
judged to have  limited  long-term  potential  and to  re-deploy  the  proceeds.
Following a review of the  portfolio,  assets  identified for sale in 1998 had a
cost of $95.0 million,  a net carrying  value of $83.0  million,  and annualized
revenues  of  approximately  $11.4  million.  In 1998,  the  Company  recorded a
provision for  impairment of $6.8 million to adjust the carrying  value of those
assets judged to be impaired to their fair value, less cost of disposal.  During
1998,  the  Company  completed  sales of two  groups of assets,  yielding  sales
proceeds  of  $42.0  million.  Gains  realized  in 1998  from  the  dispositions
approximated $2.8 million.

    Funds from  operations (FFO) for the year ended December 31, 1999 on a fully
diluted basis totaled $71.9 million,  an increase of $2.1 million over the $69.8
million for 1998.  The 1999 increase in FFO is primarily due to new additions to
investments, offset by early payment of mortgages and disposition of real estate
assets.

Recent Developments

    In  March 2001, the Company announced that it continues its discussions with
several of its lessees to resolve payment issues,  including Alterra  Healthcare
Corp., Lyric Healthcare, Alden Management Services Inc., and TLC Healthcare Inc.
Alterra has recently issued a press release stating that it had informed certain
of its lenders and  landlords in March,  2001 that they will not be paying their
March rents and debt service and are seeking  relief as to these  payments.  The
Company  has a  master  lease  with  Alterra  relating  to ten  assisted  living
facilities representing an investment of $34.1 million which provides for annual
rental  payments of $3.6 million.  Alterra has not made its March rental payment
to the Company, and while discussions are ongoing the Company has sent Alterra a
notice of default.

    Additionally,  during the first  quarter of 2001,  pursuant to a forbearance
agreement  between the Company and Lyric  through  April 30,  2001,  the Company
began receiving 60% of the approximately  $860,000 of monthly rent due under the
Lyric  leases.  Discussions  are  continuing  with  Lyric to  reach a  permanent
restructuring  agreement.  The Company's  total  original  investment in the ten
nursing  homes  covered  under the leases is $95.4  million,  and annual rent is
$10.3 million.

    Affiliates of Alden Management,  Inc., Chicago, IL, are delinquent in paying
their lease,  loan and escrow payments on the four facilities it leases from the
Company.  These  facilities  represent an initial  investment  by the Company of
$31.3 million, with annual rent of approximately $3.2 million.  Discussions with
Alden are ongoing.

    TLC  Healthcare  of Illinois,  Inc. has made only partial payments under its
master  lease with the Company  based on the  shutdown of one of its  facilities
having an annual rent payment of  approximately  $732,000,  and has notified the
Company  that it may not be able to make its April  payment  on its other  seven
facilities or otherwise fund operations  with annual rent and mortgage  payments
totaling approximately $2.8 million. The Company has funded $623,000 for payroll
at the  facilities to  facilitate  continued  operations  and is taking steps to
transition the operations of the facilities to qualified  operators  through new
lease or management structures.

    In several instances the Company holds security deposits that can be applied
in the event of lease and loan defaults, subject to applicable limitations under
bankruptcy law with respect to operators seeking  protection under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

    At  December  31,  2000 the  Company  had total  assets  of $948.5  million,
shareholders'  equity of $464.3  million,  and long-term debt of $451.4 million,
representing  approximately  47.6%  of total  capitalization.  The  Company  has
revolving credit facilities in place, providing up to $250 million of financing,
of which $185.6 million was drawn at year-end,  leaving $64.4 million  available
for working  capital and  acquisition  purposes.  (See Note 15 to the  Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements - Subsequent Events).

    On July 17, 2000, the Company replaced its $200 million unsecured  revolving
credit facility with a new $175 million secured  revolving  credit facility that
expires on December  31,  2002.  Borrowings  of  approximately  $129 million are
outstanding  at December 31, 2000.  LIBOR based  borrowings  under this facility
bear  interest at a  weighted-average  rate of 10.00% at  December  31, 2000 and
7.30% at December 31, 1999. Investments with a gross book value of approximately
$240 million are pledged as collateral for this credit facility.

    On August 16, 2000, the Company  replaced its $50 million secured  revolving
credit  facility with a new $75 million secured  revolving  credit facility that
expires on March 31, 2002 as to $10 million and June 30, 2005 as to $65 million.
LIBOR based borrowings  under this facility bear interest at a  weighted-average
rate of 9.77% at December 31, 2000 and 8.44% at December  31, 1999.  Investments
with a gross book value of  approximately  $90 million are pledged as collateral
for this credit facility.

    As of December  31,  2000,  the Company had an  aggregate of $312 million of
outstanding  debt which matures in 2002,  including  $125 million of 6.95% Notes
due June 2002 and $185 million on credit facilities expiring in 2002.

    The  Company  has $50  million of  funding  available  through  July 1, 2001
pursuant to an Investment  Agreement with Explorer Holdings,  L.P.  ("Explorer")
which can be used,  upon  satisfaction  of certain  conditions,  to fund growth.
Following the drawing in full or expiration  of this  commitment,  Explorer will
have the option to provide up to an additional $50 million to fund growth for an
additional  twelve-month  period.  (See  Note 10 to the  Company's  Consolidated
Financial Statements - Shareholders' Equity and Stock Options).

                                       17

    The Company has historically  distributed to shareholders a large portion of
the cash available from operations.  The Company's historical policy has been to
make  distributions on Common Stock of approximately  80% of FFO. Cash dividends
paid  totaled  $1.00 per common share for 2000,  compared  with $2.80 per common
share for the year ended December 31, 1999. The dividend  payout ratio,  that is
the ratio of per common  share  amounts  for  dividends  paid to the diluted per
common share amounts of funds from operations,  was approximately  238% for 2000
and 84.3% for 1999.  Excluding  the  provision  for loss on mortgages  and notes
receivable and severance and consulting  agreement  costs,  the dividend  payout
ratio for 2000 was approximately 73.0%.

    In light of the maturity in February 2001 of $16.6  million of  subordinated
debentures, Explorer agreed to allow the Company to defer payment until April 2,
2001 of $4.7 million of dividends on Explorer's  Series C preferred  declared in
October 2000. In exchange for this deferral,  the Company agreed to pay Explorer
a waiver fee equal to 10% per annum of the unpaid  dividend amount from November
15, 2000 until the October 2000 dividend is paid.

    On March 30, 2001 in consideration of prevailing conditions in the long-term
care  industry and the capital  markets  generally,  the Company  exercised  its
option under the dividend  deferral  agreement to pay the deferred  dividend and
related  waiver fee by issuing  48,420  additional  shares of Series C preferred
which are  convertible  into  774,722  shares of Omega common stock at $6.25 per
share.

    On February 1, 2001, the Company  announced the suspension of all common and
preferred  dividends.  This action  together with the election by the Company to
pay the deferred  Series C dividend and related  waiver in additional  shares of
Series C is intended to preserve  cash to facilitate  the  Company's  ability to
obtain financing to fund the 2002 debt maturities.  The Company anticipates that
it will reinstate  dividends on its common and preferred  stock when the Company
determines that it has sufficient  resources or  satisfactory  plans to meet its
2002 debt  maturities,  but the  Company  can give no  assurance  as to when the
dividends  will be  reinstated  or the amount of the  dividends if and when such
payments are recommenced.  Prior to recommencing the payment of dividends on the
Company's Common stock, all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Company's Series
A, B and C preferred stock must be paid in full. The Company has made sufficient
distributions to satisfy the distribution  requirements  under the REIT rules to
maintain its REIT status for 2000 and intends to satisfy such requirements under
the REIT rules for 2001.

    Management believes the Company's liquidity and various sources of available
capital are adequate to finance operations,  meet debt service  requirements and
fund  future  investments  through  the next 12 months  but is taking  immediate
steps,  including  the  announced  suspension  of  dividends  and the pursuit of
capital sources for repayment or replacement of the 2002 debt  maturities.  As a
result of the ongoing financial challenges facing long-term care operators,  the
availability of the external  capital sources  historically  used by the Company
has become extremely limited and expensive,  and, therefore, no assurance can be
given  that  the  Company  will be able to  replace  or  extend  the  2002  debt
maturities,  or that  any  refinancing  or  replacement  financing  would  be on
favorable terms to the Company.  If the Company is unable to obtain  refinancing
or  replacement  financing,  it may be  required  to  liquidate  investments  in
properties at times which may not permit  realization of the maximum recovery on
such  investments.  This could also  result in adverse tax  consequences  to the
Company (See Item 7A -  Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Disclosure  About Market
Risk.)


Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

    The Company is exposed to various market risks, including the potential loss
arising from adverse changes in interest rates.  The Company does not enter into
derivatives or other financial  instruments for trading or speculative purposes,
but the Company seeks to mitigate the effects of  fluctuations in interest rates
by matching the term of new investments  with new long-term fixed rate borrowing
to the extent possible.

    The  market  value of the  Company's  long-term  fixed rate  borrowings  and
mortgages  are subject to interest  rate risk.  Generally,  the market  value of
fixed rate  financial  instruments  will  decrease  as  interest  rates rise and
increase as interest rates fall. The estimated fair value of the Company's total
long-term  borrowings  at  December  31,  2000 was $415  million.  A one percent
increase  in  interest  rates  would  result in a decrease  in the fair value of
long-term  borrowings by approximately $5.7 million. The estimated fair value of
the Company's total mortgages portfolio at December 31, 2000 was $231 million. A
one percent  increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value
of the mortgage portfolio by approximately $8.0 million.

    The Company is subject to risks  associated  with debt or  preferred  equity
financing,  including the risk that existing  indebtedness may not be refinanced
or that the terms of such  refinancing  may not be as  favorable as the terms of
current  indebtedness.  If the Company  were unable to  refinance  its 2002 debt
maturities  or other  indebtedness  on acceptable  terms,  it might be forced to
dispose of properties on disadvantageous  terms, which might result in losses to

                                       18
<PAGE>

the Company and might  adversely  affect the cash available for  distribution to
shareholders, or to pursue dilutive equity financing. If interest rates or other
factors  at the time of the  refinancing  result in higher  interest  rates upon
refinancing,  the Company's interest expense would increase,  which might affect
the Company's ability to make distributions to its shareholders.

    The Company  utilizes  interest rate swaps to fix interest rates on variable
rate debt and  reduce  certain  exposures  to  interest  rate  fluctuations.  At
December 31, 2000, the Company had interest rate swaps with notional  amounts of
$100 million and $32 million,  based on 30-day  London  Interbank  Offered Rates
(LIBOR). Under the $100 million agreement,  the Company's LIBOR base rate cannot
exceed  7.5%.  This  agreement  expires in March,  2001.  Under the $32  million
agreement,  the Company receives payments when LIBOR interest rates exceed 6.35%
and pays the  counterparties  when  LIBOR  rates are under  6.35%.  The  amounts
exchanged are based on the notional  amounts.  The $32 million agreement expires
on  December  17,  2001  but  may be  extended  for an  additional  year  by the
counterparty. The combined fair value of the interest rate swaps at December 31,
2000 was a deficit of $351,344.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors
Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.

     We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of Omega
Healthcare  Investors,  Inc. and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
and the related consolidated statements of operations,  shareholders' equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31, 2000.
Our audit also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at
Item 14(a).  These financial  statements and schedules are the responsibility of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in  all  material  respects,   the  consolidated  financial  position  of  Omega
Healthcare  Investors,  Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and
the  consolidated  results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period  ended  December  31,  2000,  in  conformity  with
accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United  States.  Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedules,  when considered in relation
to the  basic  financial  statements  taken as a whole,  present  fairly  in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

a  self-administered  real estate  investment  trust  (REIT).  From the date the
Company  commenced  operations in 1992,  it has invested  primarily in long-term
care  facilities,  which include nursing homes,  assisted living  facilities and
rehabilitation   hospitals.   The  Company  currently  has  investments  in  264
healthcare facilities located in the United States.

Consolidation

    The  consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of all material intercompany
accounts and transactions. Due to changes in the market conditions affecting the
long-term  care  industry,  the Company has begun to operate a portfolio  of its
foreclosure  assets for its own  account  until  such time as these  facilities'
operations  are  stabilized  and are  re-leasable  or saleable at lease rates or
sales  prices  that  maximize  the value of these  assets to the  Company.  As a
result,  these  facilities  and their  respective  operations are presented on a
consolidated   basis   in   the   Company's   financial   statements.    Certain
reclassifications  have been made to the 1999 and 1998 financial  statements for
consistency with the presentation adopted for 2000. Such  reclassifications have
no effect on previously reported earnings or equity.

Real Estate Investments

    Investments in leased real estate properties and mortgage notes are recorded
at cost and original mortgage amount,  respectively.  The cost of the properties
acquired  is  allocated   between  land  and  buildings   based  generally  upon
independent   appraisals.   Depreciation   for  buildings  is  recorded  on  the
straight-line  basis,  using estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 39 years.
Leasehold interests are amortized over the initial term of the lease, with lives
ranging from four to seven years.

Owned & Operated Assets and Assets Held for Sale

    In the ordinary course of its business activities,  the Company periodically
evaluates investment  opportunities and extends credit to customers.  It also is
regularly engaged in lease and loan extensions and modifications.  Additionally,
the Company monitors and manages its investment portfolio with the objectives of
improving  credit quality and increasing  returns.  In connection with portfolio
management,  it engages in various collection and foreclosure  activities.  When
the Company  acquires real estate  pursuant to a foreclosure  proceeding,  it is
designated  as "owned and operated  assets" and is recorded at the lower of cost
or fair value.  Such  amounts are  included  in real  estate  properties  on the
Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Operating assets and operating liabilities
for the owned and operated  properties  are shown  separately on the face of the
Company's  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  and are  detailed  in Note 18 - Segment
Information.

    When a formal  plan to sell  real  estate  is  adopted,  the real  estate is
classified as "assets held for sale," with the net carrying  amount  adjusted to
the lower of cost or estimated fair value,  less cost of disposal.  Depreciation
of the facilities is excluded from operations  after management has committed to
a plan to sell the asset.

Impairment of Assets

    Provisions for impairment losses related to long-lived assets are recognized
when expected future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the assets.
If  indicators  of impairment  are present,  the Company  evaluates the carrying
value of the  related  real estate  investments  in  relationship  to the future
undiscounted  cash flows of the  underlying  facilities  and, if  impaired,  the
Company  then  adjusts the net  carrying  value of leased  properties  and other
long-lived  assets  to the lower of  discounted  present  value of its  expected
future cash flows or fair value,  if the sum of the expected future cash flow or
sales proceeds is less than carrying value.

Cash Equivalents

    Cash equivalents  consist of highly liquid  investments with a maturity date
of three months or less when  purchased.  These  investments are stated at cost,
which approximates fair value.

Accounts Receivable - Owned and Operated Assets

      Accounts  Receivable from Owned and Operated  Assets consist  primarily of
amounts due from  Medicare and Medicaid  programs,  other  government  programs,
managed  care  health  plans,  commercial  insurance  companies  and  individual
patients.  Amounts  recorded  include  estimated  provisions for loss related to
uncollectible accounts and disputed items.

Investments in Equity Securities

    Marketable  securities held as  available-for-sale  are stated at fair value
with  unrealized  gains and losses for the  securities  reported in  accumulated
other  comprehensive  income.  Realized  gains and losses and  declines in value
judged to be  other-than-temporary  on securities held as available-for-sale are
included  in  investment  income.  The cost of  securities  sold is based on the
specific   identification   method.   Interest  and   dividends  on   securities
available-for-sale are included in investment income.

Deferred Financing Costs

    Deferred  financing  costs are amortized on a  straight-line  basis over the
terms of the  related  borrowings.  Amortization  of  financing  costs  totaling
$1,930,000,  $1,342,000 and $1,042,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively,  is
classified as interest  expense in the  Consolidated  Statements of  Operations.
Unamortized  deferred  financing costs  applicable to debt which is converted to
common stock are charged to paid-in capital at the date of conversion.

Non-Compete Agreements and Goodwill

    Non-compete  agreements  and the excess of the purchase price over the value
of  tangible  net  assets   acquired   (i.e.,   goodwill)  are  amortized  on  a
straight-line  basis over periods  ranging  from five to ten years.  Non-compete
agreements,  which  have cost of  $4,982,000  became  fully  amortized  and were
eliminated  in  1999  by a  charge  to  accumulated  amortization.  Due  to  the
diminished  value of the related real estate  assets,  management has determined
that the  goodwill  is  entirely  impaired  and has  written  off the balance of
$2,356,000 in 2000. Accumulated amortization was $-0- and $3,363,000 at December
31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

    Rental  income and mortgage interest income is recognized as earned over the
terms of the related master leases and mortgage notes, respectively. Such income
includes periodic  increases based on pre-determined  formulas as defined in the
master leases and mortgage loan  agreements.  Reserves are taken against  earned
revenues  from  leases and  mortgages  when  collection  of  amounts  due become
questionable or when negotiations for  restructurings of troubled operators lead
to lower  expectations of expected  ultimate  collection  amounts.  Nursing home
revenues  from these owned and operated  assets are  recognized  as services are
provided.

Federal and State Income Taxes

    As a qualified real estate investment trust, the Company will not be subject
to Federal  income taxes on its income,  and no  provisions  for Federal  income
taxes  have  been  made.  The  reported  amounts  of the  Company's  assets  and
liabilities  as of  December  31,  2000 are less than the tax basis of assets by
approximately $21 million.

Stock Based Compensation

    The Company grants stock options to employees and directors with an exercise
price  equal  to the fair  value of the  shares  at the  date of the  grant.  In
accordance  with the  provisions  of APB  Opinion No. 25,  Accounting  for Stock
Issued to  Employees,  compensation  expense is not  recognized  for these stock
option grants.

    Expense related to Dividend Equivalent Rights is recognized as dividends are
declared, based on anticipated vesting.

Accounting Estimates

    The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with  accounting
principles  generally accepted in the United States requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities,  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Risks and Uncertainties

    The  Company is subject to certain  risks and  uncertainties  affecting  the
healthcare industry as a result of healthcare legislation and growing regulation
by federal, state and local governments. Additionally, the Company is subject to
risks and  uncertainties as a result of changes  affecting  operators of nursing
home  facilities  due to the actions of  governmental  agencies  and insurers to
limit the growth in cost of healthcare services.  (See Note 5 - Concentration of
Risk).

NOTE 2  -- PROPERTIES

Leased Property

    The Company's  leased real estate  properties,  represented by 130 long-term
care facilities and 2 rehabilitation  hospitals at December 31, 2000, are leased
under  provisions  of master  leases with  initial  terms  ranging from 10 to 16
years, plus renewal options.  Substantially all of the master leases provide for
minimum  annual  rentals  which are  subject  to  annual  increases  based  upon
increases in the Consumer Price Index or increases in revenues of the underlying
properties,  with certain  maximum  limits.  Under the terms of the leases,  the
lessee is responsible for all maintenance,  repairs,  taxes and insurance on the
leased properties.

    A summary of the Company's investment in leased real estate properties is as
follows:

care  facilities  at December  31, 2000,  of which 57 are owned  directly by the
Company and 12 are subject to third-party  leases. An impairment charge of $41.3

Assets Sold or Held For Sale

    During 1998,  management  initiated a plan to dispose of certain  properties
judged to have  limited  long-term  potential  and to  re-deploy  the  proceeds.
Following a review of the  portfolio,  assets  identified for sale in 1998 had a
cost of $95  million,  a net  carrying  value  of $83  million,  and  annualized
revenues  of  approximately  $11.4  million.  In 1998,  the  Company  recorded a
provision for impairment of $6.8 million to adjust the carrying value of certain
assets to their fair value,  less cost of  disposal.  During  1998,  the Company
completed  sales of two  groups of  assets,  yielding  sales  proceeds  of $42.0
million. Gains realized in 1998 from the dispositions approximated $2.8 million.

    During  1999,  the Company  completed  sales  yielding net proceeds of $18.2
million, realizing losses of $10.5 million. In addition,  management initiated a
plan for additional  asset sales to be completed in 2000. The additional  assets
identified as assets held for sale had a cost of $33.8  million,  a net carrying
amount of $28.6 million and annualized revenue of approximately $3.4 million. As
a result of this review,  the Company  recorded a provision  for  impairment  of
$19.5 million to adjust the carrying value of assets held for sale to their fair
value, less cost of disposal.

    During 2000, the Company  recorded a $14.4 million  provision for impairment
related to assets held for sale and  reclassified  $24.3  million of assets held
for sale to "owned and operated  assets" as the timing and strategy for sale or,
alternatively,   re-leasing  were  revised  in  light  of  prevailing  marketing
conditions.  During  2000,  the Company  realized  disposition  proceeds of $1.1
million on assets held for sale. Additionally,  the Company received proceeds of
$34.7 million from sales of certain of its core and other assets, resulting in a
gain of $9.9 million.

    Mortgage  notes  receivable  relate to 63  long-term  care  facilities.  The
mortgage notes are secured by first mortgage liens on the borrowers'  underlying
real estate and personal  property.  The  mortgage  notes  receivable  relate to
facilities located in 13 states, operated by 12 independent healthcare operating
companies.

    The Company  monitors  compliance  with  mortgages  and when  necessary  has
initiated collection,  foreclosure and other proceedings with respect to certain
outstanding loans.

    During 2000, the Company determined that a certain mortgage was impaired and
accordingly  wrote down the mortgage to its net realizable  value resulting in a
provision for loan loss of $4.9 million.  Income  recognized on the mortgage was
$745,000, $966,000, and $951,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.

    The following are the three primary  mortgage  structures  currently used by
the Company:

    Convertible  Participating  Mortgages are secured by first mortgage liens on
the  underlying  real estate and personal  property of the  mortgagor.  Interest
rates are usually subject to annual increases based upon increases in the CPI or
increases in revenues of the underlying long-term care facilities,  with certain
maximum limits. Convertible Participating Mortgages afford the Company an option
to convert its mortgage into direct  ownership of the  property,  generally at a
point six to nine years from inception;  they are then subject to a leaseback to
the operator  for the balance of the  original  agreed term and for the original
agreed participation in revenues or CPI adjustments.  This allows the Company to
capture a portion of the potential appreciation in value of the real estate.
The operator has the right to buy out the Company's option at formula prices.

    Participating   Mortgages  are  secured  by  first  mortgage  liens  on  the
underlying  real estate and personal  property of the mortgagor.  Interest rates
are  usually  subject to annual  increases  based upon  increases  in the CPI or
increases in revenues of the underlying long-term care facilities,  with certain
maximum limits.

    Fixed-Rate Mortgages,  with a fixed interest rate for the mortgage term, are
also secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying  real estate and personal
property of the mortgagor.

    Mortgage  notes are  shown net of allowances  of  $4,871,000 in 2000.  There
were no provisions recorded prior to 2000.

    On December 30, 1999, the Company  provided notice as to an Event of Default
and  acceleration  of the  due  date  to the  mortgagor  of  the  $58.8  million
participating  mortgage  note.  The total  obligation  outstanding at that time,
including deferred interest,  was $63.3 million.  At that date the mortgagor was
current with respect to principal and interest  payments due on the loan but had
failed to fully comply with certain covenants and to pay certain property taxes.
On January  13,  2000,  the Company  offset  security  deposits of $2.4  million
against unpaid current and deferred interest.  On January 18, 2000 the mortgagor
filed with the  Bankruptcy  Court of Wilmington,  Delaware for protection  under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. While the Company's  collection  actions have
been stayed as a result of the bankruptcy  filing by the mortgagor,  the Company
believes the security  for its loan will be adequate for  collection  of amounts
due. During 2000, the Company recorded  interest on this mortgage note at a rate
equal to the results expected from negotiations with the operator, and continues
to accrue  interest at this reduced rate. On February 1, 2001,  four  facilities
that were  collateral  for this  mortgage  were sold to a  third-party,  and the
Company received a separate  mortgage note in the amount of $4.5 million,  which
is secured by liens on the  underlying  real  estate.  The  Company  reduced the
amount of the participating mortgage note by $4.5 million.

    The  estimated  fair value of the Company's  mortgage  loans at December 31,
2000 is  approximately  $230.6 million.  Fair value is based on the estimates by
management using rates currently prevailing for comparable loans.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

NOTE 5 -- CONCENTRATION OF RISK

    As of December 31, 2000,  92% of the Company's real estate  investments  are
related to long-term care facilities. The Company's facilities are located in 29
states and are operated by 27 independent healthcare operating companies.

     Investing  in  long-term  healthcare   facilities  involves  certain  risks
stemming  from  government  legislation  and  regulation  of  operators  of  the
facilities. The Company's tenants/mortgagors depend on reimbursement legislation
which will provide them  adequate  payments for services  because a  significant
portion of their  revenue is  derived  from  government  programs  funded  under
Medicare and Medicaid.  The Medicare program recently  implemented a Prospective
Payment  System  for  skilled  nursing  facilities,  which  replaced  cost-based
reimbursements  and  significantly   reduced  payments  for  services  provided.
Additionally,   certain  State  Medicaid   programs  have  implemented   similar
prospective payment systems. The reduction in payments to nursing home operators
pursuant to the Medicare and Medicaid  payment  changes has negatively  affected
the revenues of the Company's nursing home facilities.

     Most of the Company's nursing home investments were designed exclusively to
provide  long-term  healthcare  services.  These  facilities are also subject to
detailed and complex specifications for the physical characteristics as mandated
by various  governmental  authorities.  If the facilities  cannot be operated as
long-term  care  facilities,  finding  alternative  uses may be  difficult.  The
Company's  triple-net  leases  require its  tenants to comply  with  regulations
affecting  its  facilities,  and the Company  regularly  monitors  compliance by
tenants with healthcare facilities' regulations.  Nevertheless,  if tenants fail
to perform their  obligations,  the Company may be required to do so in order to
maintain the value of its investments.

    Approximately  77% of the Company's real estate  investments are operated by
7 public companies,  including Sun Healthcare  Group,  Inc. (26.1%),  Integrated
Health Services,  Inc. (17.5%),  Advocat, Inc. (11.6 %), Vencor Operating,  Inc.
(5.8%), Mariner Post-Acute Network (6.4%), Genesis Health Ventures,  Inc. (5.3%)
and  Alterra  Healthcare  Corporation  (formerly  Alternative  Living  Services)
(3.7%).  Of the remaining 20 operators,  none operate  investments in facilities
representing more than 3.4% of the total real estate investments.

    Many of the nursing home companies  operating the Company's  facilities have
reported  significant  operating  losses in the last two years.  The Company has
initiated  discussions  with  all  operators  who  are  experiencing   financial
difficulties,  as well as state officials who regulate its  properties.  It also
has initiated various other actions to protect its interest under its leases and
mortgages.

NOTE 6 - LEASE AND MORTGAGE DEPOSITS

    The  Company  obtains  liquidity  deposits  and  letters of credit from most
operators  pursuant to its leases and mortgages.  These generally  represent the
monthly rental and mortgage  interest  income for periods  ranging from three to
six months with respect to certain of its investments. At December 31, 2000, the
Company held $7.6 million in such liquidity deposits and $9.6 million in letters
of credit.  Additional  security for rental and mortgage  interest  revenue from
operators is provided by covenants  regarding  minimum  working  capital and net
worth, liens on accounts receivable and other operating assets of the operators,
provisions for cross  default,  provisions  for  cross-collateralization  and by
corporate / personal guarantees.

NOTE 7 -- BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS

    On July 17, 2000, the Company replaced its $200 million unsecured  revolving
line of credit facility with a new $175 million secured revolving line of credit
facility that expires on December 31, 2002.  Borrowings bear interest at 2.5% to
3.25%  over  LIBOR,  based  on  the  Company's  leverage  ratio.  Borrowings  of
approximately  $129 million are  outstanding  at December 31, 2000.  LIBOR based
borrowings  under this  facility  bear  interest at a  weighted-average  rate of
10.00% at December 31, 2000 and 7.30% at December 31, 1999.  Investments  with a
gross book value of  approximately  $240 million are pledged as  collateral  for
this revolving line of credit facility.

    On August 16, 2000, the Company  replaced its $50 million secured  revolving
line of credit facility with a new $75 million secured  revolving line of credit
facility  that  expires on March 31, 2002 as to $10 million and June 30, 2005 as
to $65 million.  Borrowings  under the facility  bear  interest at 2.5% to 3.75%
over LIBOR, based on the Company's leverage ratio and collateral assigned. LIBOR
based borrowings under this facility bear interest at a weighted-average rate of
9.77% at December 31, 2000 and 8.44% at December 31,  1999.  Investments  with a
gross  book  value  of  approximately  $90  million  are  currently  pledged  as
collateral for this revolving line of credit facility.

</TABLE>
    The Subordinated  Convertible  Debentures  ("Debentures") are convertible at
any time into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $26.962 per share.
The Debentures are unsecured  obligations of the Company and are  subordinate in
right and payment to the Company's senior unsecured indebtedness. The balance of
the  Debentures  was repaid in full on  February 1, 2001  principally  utilizing
borrowings  under  the  Company's  revolving  lines of  credit.  (See  Note 15 -
Subsequent Events).

    On July 15, 2000 the Company repaid the 10% and 7.4% Unsecured  Notes issued
in 1995.  The effective  interest rate for the  unsecured  notes was 8.8%,  with
interest-only payments due semi-annually through July 2000.

    Real estate investments with a gross book value of approximately $41 million
are pledged as collateral for outstanding secured borrowings.  Long-term secured
borrowings  are  payable in  aggregate  monthly  installments  of  approximately
$282,300, including interest at rates ranging from 7.0% to 10.0%.

    Assuming  none  of the  Company's  borrowing  arrangements  are  refinanced,
converted or prepaid prior to maturity,  required principal payments for each of
the five years following  December 31, 2000 and the aggregate due thereafter are

    Fair value  estimates are subjective in nature and are dependent on a number
of  important  assumptions,  including  estimates  of future cash flows,  risks,
discount rates and relevant  comparable market information  associated with each
financial  instrument  (See  Note  1 -  Risks  and  Uncertainties).  The  use of
different market  assumptions and estimation  methodologies  may have a material
effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts.  Accordingly, the estimates
presented above are not necessarily  indicative of the amounts the Company would
realize in a current market exchange.

    The Company  utilizes  interest rate swaps to fix interest rates on variable
rate debt and  reduce  certain  exposures  to  interest  rate  fluctuations.  At
December 31, 2000,  the Company had an interest rate cap with a notional  amount
of $100 million and an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $32 million,
based on 30-day London Interbank  Offered Rates (LIBOR).  Under the $100 million
agreement,  the Company's  LIBOR base  interest  rate cannot  exceed 7.5%.  This
agreement expires in March, 2001. Under the $32 million  agreement,  the Company
receives   payments  when  LIBOR  interest  rates  exceed  6.35%  and  pays  the
counterparties when LIBOR rates are under 6.35%. The amounts exchanged are based
on the notional amounts. The $32 million agreement expires on December 17, 2001.
The combined  fair value of the  interest  rate swaps at December 31, 2000 was a
deficit of $351,344.

    In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No.
133,  Accounting for Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging  Activities,  which is
required  to be adopted in years  beginning  after June 15,  2000.  The  Company
expects to adopt the new Statement effective January 1, 2001. The Statement will
require the Company to recognize  all  derivatives  on the balance sheet at fair
value.  Derivatives  that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value  through
income.  If the  derivative  is a hedge,  depending  on the nature of the hedge,
changes in the fair  value of  derivatives  will  either be offset  against  the
change in fair  value of the hedged  assets,  liabilities,  or firm  commitments
through  earnings or  recognized in other  comprehensive  income until the hedge
item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change
in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.

    Based on the  Company's  derivative  positions  at December  31,  2000,  the
Company  estimates  that upon adoption it will record a loss from the cumulative
effect of an accounting  change of  approximately  $400,000 in the  consolidated
statement of operations.


NOTE 9 -- RETIREMENT ARRANGEMENTS

    The  Company  has  a  401(k)  Profit  Sharing  Plan  covering  all  eligible
employees. Under the Plan, employees are eligible to make contributions, and the
Company,  at its discretion,  may match  contributions and make a profit sharing
contribution.

    In 1993,  the Company  adopted the 1993 Deferred  Compensation  Plan,  which
covered  all  eligible   employees  and  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors.
Participation by the directors in the Deferred  Compensation Plan was terminated
effective December 31, 1997, and accumulated benefits to the Directors under the
plan were settled and paid in 1998.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

    The Deferred  Compensation  Plan is an unfunded plan under which the Company
may award units that result in  participation in the dividends and future growth
in the value of the Company's  common stock. The total number of units permitted
by the plan is 200,000,  of which  90,850 units have been awarded and 20,050 are
outstanding at December 31, 2000.  Units awarded to eligible  participants  vest
over a period of five years based on the participant's initial service date.

    Provisions   charged   to  operations  with  respect  to  these   retirement
arrangements totaled $181,000,  $123,000 and $346,000,  in 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively.


NOTE 10 -- SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND STOCK OPTIONS

Series C Preferred Stock

    On July 14, 2000,  Explorer  Holdings,  L.P.  ("Explorer"),  an affiliate of
Hampstead  Investment  Partners  III,  L.P.  ("Hampstead"),   a  private  equity
investor, completed an investment (the "Equity Investment") of $100.0 million in
the Company in exchange for 1,000,000 shares of the Company's Series C Preferred
Stock. The Company used a portion of the proceeds from the Equity  Investment to
repay $81 million of maturing debt on July 17, 2000.

    Shares of the Series C Preferred  are  convertible  into Common Stock at any
time by the holder at an initial  conversion  price of $6.25 per share of Common
Stock. The shares of Series C Preferred are entitled to receive dividends at the
greater of 10% per annum or the dividend payable on shares of Common Stock, with
the Series C Preferred  participating on an "as converted"  basis.  Dividends on
the Series C Preferred  Stock are cumulative from the date of original issue and
are payable quarterly  commencing on November 15, 2000. Explorer agreed to defer
until April 2, 2001, the accrued dividend of $4,666,667  payable on November 15,
2000 with  respect to the Series C Preferred  Stock.  (See Note 15 -  Subsequent
Events).

    The Series C preferred will vote (on an "as converted"  basis) together with
the Common Stock on all matters submitted to stockholders.  However, without the
consent of the Company's Board of Directors, no holder of Series C preferred may
vote or convert  shares of Series C preferred if the effect  thereof would be to
cause such holder to  beneficially  own more than 49.9% of the Company's  Voting
Securities.  If  dividends  on the Series C  preferred  are in arrears  for four
quarters,  the holders of the Series C preferred,  voting  separately as a class
(and  together  with the holder of Series A and Series B  preferred  if and when
dividends  on such  series are in arrears for six or more  quarters  and special
class  voting  rights  are in effect  with  respect to the Series A and Series B
preferred),  will be entitled to elect  directors  who,  together with the other
directors  designated by the holders of Series C preferred,  would  constitute a
majority of the Company's Board of Directors.

    The general terms of the Equity  Investment are set forth in the Investment
Agreement. In addition to setting forth the terms on which Explorer has acquired
the initial $100.0 million of Series C preferred,  the Investment Agreement also
contains  provisions  pursuant  to which  Explorer  will  make  available,  upon
satisfaction  of certain  conditions  up to $50.0  million to fund  growth  (the
"Growth Equity  Commitment").  Draws under the Growth Equity  Commitment will be
evidenced  by Common  Stock issued at the then fair market value less a discount
agreed to by  Explorer  and the  Company  representing  the  customary  discount
applied in rights offerings to an Issuer's existing security holders, or, if not
agreed,  6%.  Following the drawing in full of the Growth  Equity  Commitment or
upon expiration of the Initial Growth Equity Commitment,  Explorer will have the
option to  provide  up to an  additional  $50.0  million  to fund  growth for an
additional twelve month period (the "Increased Growth Equity Commitment"). Draws
under  the  Increased  Growth  Equity  Commitment  will be  subject  to the same
conditions  as applied to the Growth Equity  Commitment  and the Common Stock so
issued will be priced in the same manner described above.

    If  Explorer  exercises  its  option  to fund the  Increased  Growth  Equity
Commitment,  the Company will have the option to engage in a Rights  Offering to
all common  stockholders  other than Explorer and its affiliates.  In the Rights
Offering,  stockholders  will be entitled to acquire  their  proper share of the
Common Stock issued in connection with the Growth Equity  Commitment at the same
price paid by Explorer.  Proceeds received from the Rights Offering will be used
to repurchase Common Stock issued to Explorer under the Growth Commitment.

    Upon  the  first to occur of the  drawing  in full of the  Increased  Growth
Equity  Commitment or the expiration of the Increased Growth Equity  Commitment,
the Company  again will have the option to engage in a second  Rights  Offering,
Stockholders  (other  than  Explorer  and its  affiliates)  will be  entitled to
acquire their  proportionate share of the Common Stock issued in connection with
the  Increased  Growth  Equity  Commitment  at the same price paid by  Explorer.
Proceeds  received in connection with the second Rights Offering will be used to
repurchase   Common  Stock  issued  to  Explorer  under  the  increased   Growth
Commitment.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

    In connection with Explorer's Equity Investment,  the Company entered into a
Shareholders  Agreement  with Explorer  dated July 14, 2000 (the  "Shareholders'
Agreement")  pursuant to which  Explorer is  entitled  to  designate  up to four
members of the Company's Board of Directors depending on the percentage of total
voting securities  (consisting of Common Stock and Series C Preferred)  acquired
from time to time by Explorer  pursuant  to the  documentation  entered  into by
Explorer  in  connection  with the Equity  Investment.  Explorer  is entitled to
designate at least one director of the  Company's  Board of Directors as long as
it owns at least five  percent (5%) of the total voting power of the Company and
to approve one  "independent  director" as long as it owns at least  twenty-five
percent  (25%) of the shares it  acquired  at the time it  completed  the Equity
Investment (or Common Stock issued upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred
acquired by Explorer at such time).  Explorer's director designations  terminate
upon the tenth anniversary of the Shareholders' Agreement.

     The Company has amended its Stockholders' Right Plan to exempt Explorer and
any of its  transferees  that  become  parties to the  standstill  as  Acquiring
Persons  under such plan.  Subsequent  acquisitions  of voting  securities  by a
transferee of more than 9.9% of voting  securities  from Explorer are limited to
not more than 2% of the total amount of  outstanding  voting  securities  in any
twelve-month period.

     The  Company  has agreed to  indemnify  Explorer,  its  affiliates  and the
individuals  that will serve as directors of the Company  against any losses and
expenses  that may be incurred as a result of the  assertion of certain  claims,
provided that the conduct of the  indemnified  parties  meets  certain  required
standards.  In addition,  the Company has agreed to pay Explorer an advisory fee
if Explorer  provides  assistance to the Company in connection  with  evaluating
growth  opportunities or other financing matters. The amount of the advisory fee
will be mutually determined by the Company and Explorer at the time the services
are  rendered  based upon the nature and extent of the  services  provided.  The
Company will also reimburse Explorer for Explorer's  out-of-pocket  expenses, up
to a maximum of $2.5 million, incurred in connection with the Equity Investment.
To date,  the Company has  reimbursed  Explorer  approximately  $964,000 of such
expenses.

Series A and Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock

    On  April 28, 1998, the Company  received gross proceeds of $50 million from
the issuance of 2 million shares of 8.625% Series B Cumulative  Preferred  Stock
("Series  B  Preferred  Stock")  at $25 per  share.  Dividends  on the  Series B
Preferred  Stock are cumulative  from the date of original issue and are payable
quarterly  commencing on August 15, 1998. On April 7, 1997, the Company received
gross proceeds of $57.5 million from the issuance of 2.3 million shares of 9.25%
Series A  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  ("Series A Preferred  Stock") at $25 per
share. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are cumulative from the date of
original  issue and are payable  quarterly.  At December 31, 2000, the aggregate
liquidation  preference  of  Series A and  Series B  preferred  stock  issued is
$107,500,000.

Shareholder Rights Plan

    On May 12, 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the adoption of
a  shareholder  rights  plan.  The plan is designed to require a person or group
seeking  to  gain  control  of the  Company  to  offer a fair  price  to all the
Company's  shareholders.  The rights  plan will not  interfere  with any merger,
acquisition or business  combination that the Company's Board of Directors finds
is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.

    In  connection  with the adoption of the rights plan,  the board  declared a
dividend  distribution of one right for each common share outstanding on May 24,
1999.  The rights will not become  exercisable  unless a person  acquires 10% or
more of the Company's  common stock,  or begins a tender offer that would result
in the person  owning 10% or more of the Company's  common stock.  At that time,
each right would  entitle each  shareholder  other than the person who triggered
the rights plan to purchase  either the  Company's  common  stock or stock of an
acquiring  entity  at a  discount  to the then  market  price.  The plan was not
adopted in response to any specific attempt to acquire control of the Company.

    The Company amended its Stockholders'  Right Plan to exempt Explorer and any
of its  transferees  that become parties to the standstill as Acquiring  Persons
under such plan. Subsequent acquisitions of voting securities by a transferee of
more than 9.9% of voting  securities  from Explorer are limited to not more than
2% of the total amount of outstanding voting securities in any 12 month period.

Stock Options and Stock Purchase Assistance Plan

    In January  1998,  the Company  adopted a stock  purchase  assistance  plan,
whereby the Company  extended  credit to directors and employees to purchase the
Company's stock through the exercise of stock options.  During 2000, the Company
terminated this borrowing program and forgave the outstanding stock option loans
in exchange for the surrender of the underlying  stock  certificates and payment
of all outstanding  interest on the loans. The Company recorded a charge of $1.9
million  related to these loans,  which is included in the provision for loss on
mortgages  and notes  receivable  in the  Company's  Consolidated  Statements of
Operations.

    Under the terms of the 2000  Stock  Incentive  Plan,  the  Company  reserved
3,500,000  shares of common stock for grants to be issued  during a period of up
to 10 years.  Options are  exercisable at the market price at the date of grant,
expire  five years after date of grant for over 10% owners and 10 years from the
date of grant for less than 10% owners.  Directors' shares vest over three years
while other grants vest over five years.  Directors,  officers and employees are
eligible to  participate  in the Plan.  Options for  1,346,953  shares have been
granted to 22 eligible participants.  Additionally, 275,052 shares of restricted
stock have been granted under the  provisions  of the Plan.  The market value of
the  restricted  shares  on the  date of the  award  was  recorded  as  unearned
compensation-restricted  stock, with the unamortized balance shown as a separate
component of shareholders' equity. Unearned compensation is amortized to expense
generally  over the vesting  period,  with  charges to  operations  of $535,000,
$635,000, and $612,000 in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

    During 2000,  1,005,000 Dividend  Equivalent Rights were granted to eligible
employees.  A Dividend  Equivalent  Right  entitles the  participant  to receive
payments  from the  Company in an amount  determined  by  reference  to any cash
dividends  paid  on a  specified  number  of  shares  of  stock  to the  Company
stockholders of record during the period such rights are effective.  The Company
recorded $502,500 of expense related to the Dividend Equivalent Rights in 2000.

    At December 31, 2000, options currently exercisable (49,562) have a weighted
average  exercise price of $25.677,  with exercise prices ranging from $24.45 to
$37.20.  There are 1,877,995  shares  available for future grants as of December
31, 2000.

    The following is a summary of activity under the plan.  Exercise  prices and
all other option data for grants prior to April 2, 1998 have been adjusted based
on a  formula  reflecting  the per  share  value  of the  distribution  of Omega
Worldwide, Inc.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

    In  1995, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued the Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based
Compensation."  This standard prescribes a fair value-based method of accounting
for employee stock options or similar equity  instruments  and requires  certain
pro forma disclosures.  For purposes of the pro forma disclosures required under
Statement  123, the estimated  fair value of the options is amortized to expense
over the option's vesting period.  Based on the Company's  option activity,  net
earnings would have increased in 2000 and 1999 by  approximately  $1,064,000 and
$618,000,  respectively and decreased in 1998 by approximately $2.2 million. Net
earnings  per basic and  diluted  common  share on a pro forma  basis would have
increased in 2000 and 1999 by  approximately  $.06 and $.03,  respectively,  and
decreased  in 1998 by $.11 under APB 25. The  estimated  weighted  average  fair
value of options  granted in 2000,  1999,  and 1998 was  $407,000,  $168,000 and
$220,000, respectively. In determining the estimated fair value of the Company's
stock options as of the date of grant, a Black-Scholes  option pricing model was
used with the following weighted-average  assumptions:  risk-free interest rates
of 5.2% in 2000,  6.5% in 1999 and 6% in 1998;  a dividend  yield of 10% in 2000
and 1999 and 6.75% in 1998;  volatility  factors of the expected market price of
the Company's  common stock based on 30.0% volatility in 2000, 22.7% in 1999 and
15.0% in 1998;  and a  weighted-average  expected  life of the  options of eight
years for each of the three years.

    The  Black-Scholes   options  valuation  model  was  developed  for  use  in
estimating the fair value of traded  options which have no vesting  restrictions
and are fully  transferable.  In addition,  option  valuation models require the
input of highly  subjective  assumptions,  including  the  expected  stock price
volatility.  Because the Company's  employee stock options have  characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially  affect the fair value estimate,  in
management's  opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.


NOTE 11 -- RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     The Company has agreed to pay Explorer an advisory fee if Explorer provides
assistance to the Company in connection with the evaluating growth opportunities
or other  financing  matters.  The amount of the  advisory  fee will be mutually
determined by the Company and Explorer,  based upon the nature and the extent of
the services provided and the results achieved.  The Company will also reimburse
Explorer for Explorer's out-of-pocket expenses, up to a maximum of $2.5 million,
incurred in  connection  with the Equity  Investment.  To date,  the Company has
reimbursed Explorer for approximately $964,000 of such expenses.

    Explorer  agreed to defer  until  April 2, 2001,  the  accrued  dividend  of
$4,666,667  payable on November  15, 2000 with respect to the Series C preferred
stock.  In exchange  for this  deferral,  the Company  agreed to pay  Explorer a
waiver fee equal to 10% per annum of the unpaid  dividend from November 15, 2000
until the October dividend is paid. (See note 15 - Subsequent Events)

    In 1995,  the Company  sponsored the  organization  of Principal  Healthcare
Finance Limited  ("Principal"),  an Isle of Jersey company,  whose purpose is to
invest in nursing homes and  long-term  care  facilities in the United  Kingdom.
Prior to the April 2, 1998 contribution to Omega Worldwide,  Inc.  ("Worldwide")
as explained  below,  the Company had invested  $30.7 million in  Principal,  of
which $23.8 million was represented by a (pound)15 million subordinated note due
December 31, 2000, and $6.9 million was represented by an equity investment. The
Company  had also  provided  investment  advisory  and  management  services  to
Principal and had advanced temporary loans to Principal from time to time.

    In November  1997, the Company  formed  Worldwide,  a company which provides
asset management  services and management  advisory services,  as well as equity
and debt capital to the healthcare industry, particularly residential healthcare
services to the elderly. On April 2, 1998, the Company contributed substantially
all of its  Principal  assets to  Worldwide in exchange  for  approximately  8.5
million  shares  of  Worldwide  common  stock  and  260,000  shares  of Series B
preferred stock. Of the 8,500,000  shares of Worldwide  received by the Company,
approximately  5,200,000  were  distributed  on April 2,  1998 to the  Company's
shareholders on the basis of one Worldwide share for every 3.77 common shares of
the Company held by  shareholders  of the Company on the record date of February
1, 1998. Of the remaining 3,300,000 shares of Worldwide received by the Company,
2,300,000  shares were sold by the Company on April 3, 1998 for net  proceeds of
approximately  $16,250,000  in a secondary  offering  pursuant to a registration
statement of Worldwide.  The market value of the  distribution  to  shareholders
approximated   $39  million  or  $1.99  per  share.   The  Company   recorded  a
non-recurring gain of $30.2 million on the distribution and secondary  offerings
of Worldwide  common shares during 1998.  In April 1999, in  conjunction  with a
similar acquisition by Worldwide,  the Company acquired an interest in Principal
Healthcare Finance Trust ("the Trust"),  an Australian Unit Trust, which owns 44
nursing  home  facilities  and 483 assisted  living  units in Australia  and New
Zealand.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

    As of December 31, 2000,  the Company  holds  1,163,000  shares of Worldwide
common stock and 260,000  shares of its preferred  stock.  The carrying value of
the Company's investment in Worldwide is $5,435,000,  including the market value
of its common stock and its cost basis in its preferred  stock. The Company also
holds a $1,615,000  investment in  Principal,  represented  by 990,000  ordinary
shares of Principal, and a $1,266,000 investment in the Trust.

    The Company has guaranteed  repayment of Worldwide  borrowings pursuant to a
revolving  credit  facility  in  exchange  for an  initial  1% fee and an annual
facility fee of 25 basis points.  At December 31, 2000  borrowings of $2,850,000
were outstanding under Worldwide's revolving credit facility. Worldwide's credit
agreement  calls for  scheduled  payments to be made until fully  repaid in June
2001. Under this agreement, no further borrowings may be made by Worldwide under
its revolving credit facility.  The Company is required to provide collateral in
the amount of $8.8 million related to the guarantee of Worldwide's  obligations.
Upon  repayment by  Worldwide of the  remaining  outstanding  balance  under its
revolving credit facility, the subject collateral will be released in connection
with the termination of the Company's guarantee.

    Additionally,  the  Company had a Services  Agreement  with  Worldwide  that
provided  for the  allocation  of  indirect  costs  incurred  by the  Company to
Worldwide.  The allocation of indirect costs has been based on the  relationship
of assets under the Company's  management to the combined  total of those assets
and assets under  Worldwide's  management.  Upon expiration of this agreement on
June 30, 2000,  the Company  entered into a new  agreement  requiring  quarterly
payments  from  Worldwide  of  $37,500  for  the  use  of  offices  and  certain
administrative  and  financial  services  provided  by  the  Company.  Upon  the
reduction  of  the  Company's   accounting  staff,  the  Service  Agreement  was
renegotiated again on November 1, requiring quarterly payments from Worldwide of
$32,500.  Costs  allocated  to  Worldwide  for 2000 and 1999 were  $404,000  and
$754,000, respectively.

NOTE 14 - LITIGATION

         The Company is subject to various legal  proceedings,  claims and other
actions arising out of the normal course of business. While any legal proceeding
or claim has an element of uncertainty,  management believes that the outcome of
each lawsuit claim or legal proceeding that is pending or threatened,  or all of
them  combined,  will not have a  material  adverse  effect on its  consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

    On June 20,  2000,  the  Company  and its  chief  executive  officer,  chief
financial  officer  and chief  operating  officer  were named as  defendants  in
certain litigation brought by Ronald M. Dickerman,  in his individual  capacity,
in the United States  District  Court for the Southern  District of New York. In
the complaint,  Mr. Dickerman  contends that the Company and the named executive
officers violated Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and Rule 10b-5 promulgated  thereunder.  Mr. Dickerman  subsequently amended the
complaint to assert his claims on behalf of an unnamed class of  plaintiffs.  On
July 28, 2000,  Benjamin LeBorys commenced a class action lawsuit making similar
allegations against the Company and certain of its officers and directors in the
United States  District  Court for the Southern  District of New York. The cases
have been  consolidated,  and Mr.  LeBorys  has been named lead  plaintiff.  The
plaintiffs seek unspecified  damages. The Company has reported the litigation to
its  directors and officers  liability  insurer.  The Company  believes that the
litigation is without merit and is defending vigorously. The Company's Motion to
Dismiss was filed with the Court on February 16, 2001.

     On June  21,  2000,  the  Company  was  named  as a  defendant  in  certain
litigation  brought  against  it  by  Madison/OHI   Liquidity   Investors,   LLC
("Madison"),  a customer  that  claims  that the  Company  has  breached  and/or
anticipatorily  breached a commercial  contract.  Mr.  Dickerman is a partner of
Madison and is a guarantor of  Madison's  obligations  to the  Company.  Madison
claims  damages as a result of the  alleged  breach of  approximately  $700,000.
Madison  seeks  damages as a result of the  claimed  anticipatory  breach in the
amount of $15 million or, in the alternative, Madison seeks specific performance
of the  contract  as  modified  by a course  of  conduct  that  Madison  alleges
developed between Omega and the Company. The Company contends that Madison is in
default under the contract in question. The Company believes that the litigation
is meritless. The Company is defending vigorously and on December 5, 2000, filed
counterclaims  against  Madison and the  guarantors,  including  Mr.  Dickerman,
seeking repayment of approximately $8.5 million that Madison owes the Company.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

     Karrington Health,  Inc. brought suit against the Company alleging that the
Company  repudiated  and  ultimately  breached a  financing  contract to provide
$95,000,000 of financing for the development of 13 assisted  living  facilities.
Karrington seeks recovery of approximately  $20,000,000 in damages it alleges to
have incurred as a result of the breach. The Company denies that it entered into
a valid and binding  contract with  Karrington  and is vigorously  defending the
litigation.


NOTE 15 -- SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

    On February 1, 2001, the Company repaid the outstanding  balance of its 8.5%
Subordinated Convertible Debentures due February 1, 2001 from cash and revolving
credit line availability.

    On February 1, 2001,  the Company also  announced  suspension of payments of
common and preferred  dividends to strengthen the Company's  Balance Sheet while
it pursues alternatives for extending or repaying its 2002 debt maturities.  The
Company can give no assurance as to when the dividends will be reinstated or the
amount of the dividends, if and when such payments are recommenced.  All accrued
and unpaid  dividends on the Company's  outstanding  shares of Series A, B and C
Preferred Stock must be paid in full before dividends on the Common Stock can be
resumed.

    On March 30,  2001,  the  Company  exercised  its option to pay the  accrued
$4,666,667  Series C dividend from November 15, 2000 and the  associated  waiver
fee by  issuing  48,420  Series  C  preferred  shares  to  Explorer,  which  are
convertible  into  774,722  shares of the  Company's  common  stock at $6.25 per
share. (See "Note 11 - Related Party Transactions" for information regarding the
dividend deferral).

    In  March 2001, the Company announced that it continues its discussions with
several of its lessees to resolve payment issues,  including Alterra  Healthcare
Corp., Lyric Healthcare, Alden Management Services Inc., and TLC Healthcare Inc.
Alterra has recently issued a press release stating that it had informed certain
of its lenders and  landlords in March,  2001 that they will not be paying their
March rents and debt service and are seeking  relief as to these  payments.  The
Company  has a  master  lease  with  Alterra  relating  to ten  assisted  living
facilities representing an investment of $34.1 million which provides for annual
rental  payments of $3.6 million.  Alterra has not made its March rental payment
to the Company, and while discussions are ongoing the Company has sent Alterra a
notice of default.

    Additionally,  during the first  quarter of 2001,  pursuant to a forbearance
agreement  between the Company and Lyric  through  April 30,  2001,  the Company
began receiving 60% of the approximately  $860,000 of monthly rent due under the
Lyric  leases.  Discussions  are  continuing  with  Lyric to  reach a  permanent
restructuring  agreement.  The Company's  total  original  investment in the ten
nursing  homes  covered  under the leases is $95.4  million,  and annual rent is
$10.3 million.

    Affiliates of Alden Management,  Inc., Chicago, IL, are delinquent in paying
their lease,  loan and escrow payments on the four facilities it leases from the
Company.  These  facilities  represent an initial  investment  by the Company of
$31.3 million, with annual rent of approximately $3.2 million.  Discussions with
Alden are ongoing.

    TLC  Healthcare  of Illinois,  Inc. has made only partial payments under its
master  lease with the Company  based on the  shutdown of one of its  facilities
having an annual rent payment of  approximately  $732,000,  and has notified the
Company  that it may not be able to make its April  payment  on its other  seven
facilities or otherwise fund operations  with annual rent and mortgage  payments
totaling approximately $2.8 million. The Company has funded $623,000 for payroll
at the  facilities to  facilitate  continued  operations  and is taking steps to
transition the operations of the facilities to qualified  operators  through new
lease or management structures.

    In several instances the Company holds security deposits that can be applied
in the event of lease and loan defaults, subject to applicable limitations under
bankruptcy law with respect to operators seeking  protection under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code.

(1) Nursing home revenues from these owned and operated assets are recognized as
services are provided.


(2) EBITDA represents earnings before interest,  income taxes,  depreciation and
amortization  It is  considered  by the  Company to be a  meaningful  measure of
performance of its Owned and Operated  Assets.  EBITDA in and of itself does not
represent cash generated from operating  activities in accordance  with GAAP and
therefore  should  not  be  considered  an  alternative  to net  earnings  as an
indication  of  operating  performance  or  to  net  cash  flow  from  operating
activities  as  determined  by  GAAP  as a  measure  of  liquidity  and  is  not
necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.

                        AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO LOAN AGREEMENT


     AMENDMENT  NO. 2 TO LOAN  AGREEMENT  (this  "Second  Amendment"),  made and
executed this 20th day of November, 2000, by and among:

     OMEGA   HEALTHCARE   INVESTORS,   INC.  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries
(individually, a "Borrower" and collectively, the "Borrowers"),

     The Banks that have executed the signature  pages hereto  (individually,  a
"Bank" and collectively, the "Banks"); and

     FLEET NATIONAL BANK  (successor by merger to Fleet Bank,  N.A.), a national
banking association, as Agent for the Banks (in such capacity, together with its
successors in such capacity, the "Agent").

                             PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

     (A) The Borrowers have entered into a certain Loan Agreement dated June 15,
2000 (as amended by  Amendment  No. 1 to Loan  Agreement  dated August 15, 2000,
hereinafter  referred to as the "Loan  Agreement") with the Agent and the Banks;
and

     (B) The Borrowers have requested that the Banks and the Agent amend certain
provisions of the Loan Agreement,  and the Banks and the Agent are willing to do
so, all on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the agreements and provisions contained
herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

     1.  Definitions.  Capitalized  terms used but not otherwise  defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Loan Agreement.

     2. Certain  Amendments to the Loan Agreement.  The Loan Agreement is hereby
amended as follows:

          2.1. The definition of "Funded Indebtedness" contained in Article 1 is
     hereby deleted in its entirety and the following is substituted therefor:

          "'Funded  Indebtedness':   as  of  any  date  of  determination,   all
     Indebtedness  for  borrowed  money  (which  in any event  does not  include
     accounts payable and accrued  liabilities) of Omega on a consolidated basis
     including, in any event, the Credit Loans"

          2.2.  Section  6.9  (Financial  Covenants)  of the Loan  Agreement  is
     amended by adding the following sentence to the end of such Section:

                  "For purposes of computing the financial  covenants  contained
                  in Section 6.9,  there shall be excluded from the  calculation
                  of  "EBITDA"  and  "Adjusted  EBITDA"  a one  time  charge  of
                  $4,664,861,  incurred  by Omega  during  the third  quarter of
                  2000,  in  connection  with  severance  and  consulting  costs
                  arising  from  the   consummation   of  certain   transactions
                  contemplated by the Investment Agreement."

     3.  Representations  and  Warranties.  In order to induce the Banks and the
Agent to enter  into this  Second  Amendment,  each of the Loan  Parties  hereby
represents and warrants to the Banks and the Agent, as to itself with respect to
the Loan Documents to which it is a party, that:

          3.1 No  Default.  After  giving  effect to this Second  Amendment,  no
     Default or Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing.

          3.2 Existing Representations and Warranties. As of the date hereof and
     after  giving  effect to this Second  Amendment,  each and every one of the
     representations  and  warranties  set forth in the Loan Documents are true,
     accurate  and  complete in all  respects and with the same effect as though
     made on the date hereof, and each is hereby  incorporated herein in full by
     reference as if restated herein in its entirety,  except for changes in the
     ordinary  course of business which are not prohibited by the Loan Agreement
     (as amended  hereby) and which do not,  either singly or in the  aggregate,
     have a Material Adverse Effect.

          3.3  Authority;   Enforceability.  (i)  The  execution,  delivery  and
     performance  by each Loan  Party of this  Second  Amendment  are within its
     organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary action
     (corporate or  otherwise) on the part of each Loan Party,  (ii) this Second
     Amendment is the legal,  valid and binding  obligation  of each Loan Party,
     enforceable against each Loan Party in accordance with its terms, and (iii)
     this Second  Amendment and the execution,  delivery and performance by each
     Loan Party thereof does not: (A)  contravene  the terms of any Loan Party's
     organization  documents,  (B)  conflict  with or  result  in any  breach or
     contravention  of,  or  the  creation  of  any  Lien  under,  any  document
     evidencing any contractual obligation to which any Loan Party is a party or
     any  order,  injunction,  writ or  decree  to which  any Loan  Party or its
     property is subject, or (C) violate any requirement of law.

     4. Reference to and Effect Upon the Loan Agreement.

          4.1  Effect.  Except  as  specifically  set  forth  herein,  the  Loan
     Agreement  and the other  Loan  Documents  shall  remain in full  force and
     effect  in  accordance  with  their  terms  and  are  hereby  ratified  and
     confirmed.

          4.2 No Waiver; References.  The execution,  delivery and effectiveness
     of this Second Amendment shall not operate as a waiver of any right,  power
     or remedy of the Agent or any Bank under the Loan Agreement, nor constitute
     a waiver of any provision of the Loan Agreement, except as specifically set
     forth  herein.  Upon  the  effectiveness  of this  Second  Amendment,  each
     reference in:

               (i)  the  Loan  Agreement  to  "this   Agreement",   "hereunder",
          "hereof",  "herein"  or words of  similar  import  shall mean and be a
          reference to the Loan Agreement as amended hereby;

               (ii) the other Loan Documents to the "Loan  Agreement" shall mean
          and be a reference to the Loan Agreement as amended hereby; and

               (iii) the Loan Documents to the "Loan  Documents" shall be deemed
          to include this Second Amendment.

     5. Miscellaneous.

          5.1 Expenses.  The Loan Parties agree to pay the Agent upon demand for
     all reasonable expenses,  including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses
     of the Agent,  incurred by the Agent in  connection  with the  preparation,
     negotiation and execution of this Second Amendment.

          5.2. Law. THIS SECOND  AMENDMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
     AND GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

          5.3 Fee. In the event that the Required Banks execute and deliver this
     Second  Amendment,  the Borrowers shall pay to the Agent for the benefit of
     each Bank that  executes and delivers  this Second  Amendment no later than
     12:00 noon on Monday,  November 20, 2000 (the "Second Amendment Fee Date"),
     a  non-refundable  amendment fee equal to the product of (a) 0.05% (i.e., 5
     basis points)  multiplied by (b) the  Revolving  Credit  Commitment of such
     Lender, as of the Second Amendment Fee Date.

          5.4 Successors.  This Second  Amendment shall be binding upon the Loan
     Parties,  the  Banks and the Agent  and  their  respective  successors  and
     assigns,  and shall inure to the benefit of the Loan Parties, the Banks and
     the Agent and the successors and assigns of the Banks and the Agent.

          5.5 Execution in  Counterparts.  This Second Amendment may be executed
     in any number of counterparts  and by different  parties hereto in separate
     counterparts,  each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed
     to be an original and all of which taken together shall  constitute one and
     the same instrument.

     3.  Representations  and  Warranties.  In order to induce the Banks and the
Agent to enter  into  this  Third  Amendment,  each of the Loan  Parties  hereby
represents and warrants to the Banks and the Agent, as to itself with respect to
the Loan Documents to which it is a party, that:

          3.1 No  Default.  After  giving  effect to this  Third  Amendment,  no
     Default or Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing.

          3.2 Existing Representations and Warranties. As of the date hereof and
     after  giving  effect to this  Third  Amendment,  each and every one of the
     representations  and  warranties  set forth in the Loan Documents are true,
     accurate  and  complete in all  respects and with the same effect as though
     made on the date hereof, and each is hereby  incorporated herein in full by
     reference as if restated herein in its entirety,  except for changes in the
     ordinary  course of business which are not prohibited by the Loan Agreement
     (as amended  hereby) and which do not,  either singly or in the  aggregate,
     have a Material Adverse Effect.

          3.3  Authority;   Enforceability.  (i)  The  execution,  delivery  and
     performance  by each Loan  Party of this  Third  Amendment  are  within its
     organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary action
     (corporate or  otherwise)  on the part of each Loan Party,  (ii) this Third
     Amendment is the legal,  valid and binding  obligation  of each Loan Party,
     enforceable against each Loan Party in accordance with its terms, and (iii)
     this Third  Amendment and the execution,  delivery and  performance by each
     Loan Party thereof does not: (A)  contravene  the terms of any Loan Party's
     organization  documents,  (B)  conflict  with or  result  in any  breach or
     contravention  of,  or  the  creation  of  any  Lien  under,  any  document
     evidencing any contractual obligation to which any Loan Party is a party or
     any  order,  injunction,  writ or  decree  to which  any Loan  Party or its
     property is subject, or (C) violate any requirement of law.

     4. Reference to and Effect Upon the Loan Agreement.

          4.1  Effect.  Except  as  specifically  set  forth  herein,  the  Loan
     Agreement  and the other  Loan  Documents  shall  remain in full  force and
     effect  in  accordance  with  their  terms  and  are  hereby  ratified  and
     confirmed.

          4.2 No Waiver; References.  The execution,  delivery and effectiveness
     of this Third Amendment  shall not operate as a waiver of any right,  power
     or remedy of the Agent or any Bank under the Loan Agreement, nor constitute
     a waiver of any provision of the Loan Agreement, except as specifically set
     forth  herein.  Upon  the  effectiveness  of  this  Third  Amendment,  each
     reference in:

               (i)  the  Loan  Agreement  to  "this   Agreement",   "hereunder",
          "hereof",  "herein"  or words of  similar  import  shall mean and be a
          reference to the Loan Agreement as amended hereby;

               (ii) the other Loan Documents to the "Loan  Agreement" shall mean
          and be a reference to the Loan Agreement as amended hereby; and

               (iii) the Loan Documents to the "Loan  Documents" shall be deemed
          to include this Third Amendment.

     5. Miscellaneous.

          5.1 Expenses.  The Loan Parties agree to pay the Agent upon demand for
     all reasonable expenses,  including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses
     of the Agent,  incurred by the Agent in  connection  with the  preparation,
     negotiation and execution of this Third Amendment.

     Third  Amendment,  the Borrowers  shall pay to the Agent for the benefit of
     each Bank that  executes  and delivers  this Third  Amendment no later than
     1:00 p.m. on Tuesday,  January 30, 2001 (the "Third Amendment Fee Date"), a
     non-refundable  amendment  fee equal to the product of (a) 0.03%  (i.e.,  3
     basis points)  multiplied by (b) the  Revolving  Credit  Commitment of such
     Lender, as of the Third Amendment Fee Date.

          5.4  Successors.  This Third  Amendment shall be binding upon the Loan
     Parties,  the  Banks and the Agent  and  their  respective  successors  and
     assigns,  and shall inure to the benefit of the Loan Parties, the Banks and
     the Agent and the successors and assigns of the Banks and the Agent.

     any number of  counterparts  and by  different  parties  hereto in separate
     counterparts,  each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed

                  " (e)  For  purposes  of  computing  the  financial  covenants
                  contained  in Section  7.9,  there shall be excluded  from the
                  calculation  of  "EBITDA"  and  "Adjusted  EBITDA"  a one time
                  charge  of  $4,664,861,  incurred  by Omega  during  the third
                  quarter of 2000, in connection  with  severance and consulting
                  costs arising from the  consummation  of certain  transactions
                  contemplated by the Investment Agreement."

     3.  Representations and Warranties.  In order to induce the Lenders and the
Agent  to  enter  into  this  First  Amendment,  each  of the  Borrowers  hereby
represents and warrants to the Lenders and the Agent,  as to itself with respect
to the Loan Documents to which it is a party, that:

          3.1 No  Default.  After  giving  effect to this  First  Amendment,  no
     Default or Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing.

          3.2 Existing Representations and Warranties. As of the date hereof and
     after  giving  effect to this  First  Amendment,  each and every one of the
     representations  and  warranties  set forth in the Loan Documents are true,
     accurate  and  complete in all  respects and with the same effect as though
     made on the date hereof, and each is hereby  incorporated herein in full by
     reference as if restated herein in its entirety,  except for changes in the
     ordinary  course of business which are not prohibited by the Loan Agreement
     (as amended  hereby) and which do not,  either singly or in the  aggregate,
     have a Material Adverse Effect.

          3.3  Authority;   Enforceability.  (i)  The  execution,  delivery  and
     performance  by each  Borrower  of this  First  Amendment  are  within  its

     (corporate  or  otherwise)  on the part of each  Borrower,  (ii) this First
     Amendment  is the legal,  valid and binding  obligation  of each  Borrower,
     enforceable  against each Borrower in accordance with its terms,  and (iii)
     this First  Amendment and the execution,  delivery and  performance by each
     Borrower  hereof  does not:  (A)  contravene  the  terms of any  Borrower's
     organization  documents,  (B)  conflict  with or  result  in any  breach or
     contravention  of,  or  the  creation  of  any  Lien  under,  any  document
     evidencing any  contractual  obligation to which any Borrower is a party or
     any order, injunction, writ or decree to which any Borrower or its property
     is subject, or (C) violate any requirement of law.

          4.1  Effect.  Except  as  specifically  set  forth  herein,  the  Loan
     Agreement  and the other  Loan  Documents  shall  remain in full  force and
     effect  in  accordance  with  their  terms  and  are  hereby  ratified  and
     confirmed.

          4.2 No Waiver; References.  The execution,  delivery and effectiveness
     of this First Amendment  shall not operate as a waiver of any right,  power
     or  remedy  of the  Agent  or any  Lender  under  the Loan  Agreement,  nor
     constitute  a waiver  of any  provision  of the Loan  Agreement,  except as
     specifically  set  forth  herein.  Upon  the  effectiveness  of this  First
     Amendment, each reference in:

     breach.

     (c) "Confidential  Information" means data and information  relating to the
business of the Company or an Affiliate  (which does not rise to the status of a
Trade Secret) which is or has been disclosed to the Contractor or Erickson or of
which the  Contractor or Erickson  became aware as a  consequence  of or through
their  relationship  to the Company or an  Affiliate  and which has value to the
Company  or an  Affiliate  and  is  not  generally  known  to  its  competitors.
Confidential Information shall not include any data or information that has been
voluntarily disclosed to the public by the Company or an Affiliate (except where

authorization) or that has been independently developed and disclosed by others,
or that otherwise enters the public domain through lawful means.

     (d)  "Disability"  means the  inability of Erickson to perform the material

     Agreement  within ten (10) days  following the Company's  failure to remedy
     the breach.

     (f) "Trade  Secrets"  means  information  including,  but not  limited  to,
technical or nontechnical  data,  formulas,  patterns,  compilations,  programs,
devices, methods,  techniques,  drawings,  processes,  financial data, financial
plans,  product  plans or lists of actual or  potential  customers  or suppliers
which (i) derives economic value, actual or potential,  from not being generally
known to, and not being readily  ascertainable by proper means by, other persons
who can  obtain  economic  value  from its  disclosure  or use,  and (ii) is the

2.       Terms and Conditions of Engagement.
         -----------------------------------

     (a)  Engagement.  The  Contractor  shall make  available to the Company the
services of Erickson as interim  Chief  Executive  Officer of the  Company,  and
Erickson  shall  perform  such  services.  Erickson  shall be the interim  Chief
Executive  Officer of the Company as of the Effective  Date, and Erickson hereby
accepts   such   position,   subject  to  the  terms  and   conditions   hereof.
Notwithstanding  any other provision  hereof,  in the event the Company appoints
another person as Chief Executive  Officer during the Term, and removes Erickson
as interim Chief  Executive  Officer,  the Board of Directors of the Company may
cause Erickson to perform other management or management  advisory duties to the
Company which the Board of Directors may reasonably request for the remainder of
the Term (defined in Section 4 hereof).

     (b) Contractor Relationship. The Contractor is an independent contractor to
the Company, and Erickson is the employee of the Contractor and not the employee
of the Company.  This is also a personal  services  contract for the services of
Erickson.  The  Contractor  cannot  satisfy  the  terms and  conditions  of this
Agreement by making anyone else available to perform  Erickson's  services.  The
Company will report all payments to be made  hereunder on Forms 1099 as payments
to the Contractor for independent  contracting services, and will not report any
payments on Form W-2 to Erickson. Erickson shall not be treated for any purposes
as an employee of the  Company and shall not be entitled to  participate  in any
employee benefits plans or programs of the Company. Erickson shall report to the
Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  and  shall  have  such   authority   and
responsibilities  and perform such duties as are  consistent  with his executive
capacities hereunder as shall reasonably be assigned to him from time to time by
the Board of Directors of the Company.  Such duties may include (i) managing the
existing business of the Company,  including  directing the Company's efforts to
optimize the value of its existing  portfolio,  and (ii) assisting the Company's
efforts  to  recruit  a  chief   executive   officer.   Erickson   shall  devote
substantially  approximately  60%  of  his  business  time  and  efforts  to the
performance  of  duties  for the  Company  and its  Affiliates  and use his best
efforts in such endeavors. Erickson may perform some of his duties from a remote
location, but will perform services not less than three days per week on average
at the Company's office in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

3.       Compensation.
         -------------

     (a) Cash Compensation.  The Company shall pay to the Contractor $41,667 per
month for Erickson's services hereunder.  The Company shall pay the monthly cash
compensation in substantially equal installments semi-monthly after the services
are performed.

     (b) Stock Option.  The Company  hereby grants the Contractor a nonqualified
stock option to purchase  35,000 shares of common stock of the Company  pursuant
to the agreement attached hereto as an Exhibit.

     (c) Dividend Equivalent Rights. The Company hereby grants the
Contractor  dividend  equivalent  rights with respect to 35,000 shares of common
stock of the Company pursuant to the agreement attached hereto as an Exhibit.

     (d)  Expenses.  The  Contractor  shall  be  entitled  to be  reimbursed  in
accordance with the policies of the Company, as adopted and amended from time to
time, for all reasonable  and necessary  expenses  incurred by the Contractor or
Erickson in connection with the  performance of Erickson's  duties of employment
hereunder;  provided,  however,  the  Contractor  shall,  as a condition of such
reimbursement,  submit verification of the nature and amount of such expenses in
accordance with the reasonable  reimbursement policies from time to time adopted
by the Company. Such expense reimbursement to the Contractor:

          (i) will include,  without limitation,  Erickson's reasonable business
     travel expenses between Dallas,  Texas and Ann Arbor,  Michigan incurred in
     connection with the performance of his duties hereunder, including airfare,

</TABLE>

(1)  For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges
     and preferred stock  dividends,  net earnings  (before  gain/loss on assets
     sold) has been  added to fixed  charges,  and that sum has been  divided by
     such  fixed  charges.   Fixed  charges  consist  of  interest  expense  and
     amortization of deferred  financing  costs,  and for each of the four years
     ended December 31, 1997,  1998, 1999 and 2000,  cumulative  preferred stock
     dividends are included starting as of the dates of issuance of the Series A
     Cumulative  Preferred Stock, Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock and Series
     C Cumulative Preferred Stock.

(2)  The deficit in 2000 represents  approximately $135.8 million.  Earnings for
     2000 include  charges of $61.7  million  provision  for  impairment,  $15.3
     million  provision  for loss on mortgages  and notes  receivable,  and $4.7
