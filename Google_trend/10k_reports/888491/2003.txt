Item 1 - Business of the Company


Overview

     We were  incorporated  in the State of Maryland on March 31, 1992. We are a
self-administered   real  estate  investment   trust,  or  REIT,   investing  in
income-producing  healthcare  facilities,  principally long-term care facilities
located  in the  United  States.  We  provide  lease or  mortgage  financing  to
qualified  operators  of skilled  nursing  facilities  and, to a lesser  extent,
assisted  living  and  acute  care  facilities.  We have  historically  financed
investments  through borrowings under our revolving credit  facilities,  private
placements or public offerings of debt or equity  securities,  the assumption of
secured  indebtedness,  or a  combination  of  these  methods.

     As of December 31, 2002, our portfolio of domestic investments consisted of
222 healthcare  facilities,  located in 28 states and operated by 34 third-party
operators.  Our gross  investments in these  facilities,  net of impairments and
before reserve for uncollectible loans,  totaled $852.1 million.  This portfolio
is made up of:

     o    146 long-term healthcare  facilities and two rehabilitation  hospitals
          owned and leased to third parties;

     o    fixed rate,  participating and convertible  participating mortgages on
          63 long-term healthcare facilities;

     o    two long-term healthcare facilities that were recovered from customers
          and are currently operated through  third-party  management  contracts
          for our own account; and,

     o    eight  long-term  healthcare   facilities  that  were  recovered  from
          customers and are currently closed.

     In addition,  we have one facility subject to a leasehold interest. We also
hold miscellaneous investments and closed healthcare facilities held for sale of
approximately  $39.2  million at December  31,  2002,  including  $16.9  million
related to a non-healthcare facility leased by the United States Postal Service,
a $1.3 million  investment in Principal  Healthcare Finance Trust ("the Trust"),
and $11.4 million of notes receivable, net of allowance.

     Approximately  55.8% of our real estate  investments  were operated by five
public companies,  including Sun Healthcare  Group,  Inc. (25.7%),  Advocat Inc.
(12.5%) Integrated Health Services,  Inc. (7.3%),  Mariner  Post-Acute  Network,
Inc. (7.0%), and Alterra Healthcare  Corporation (3.3%). The two largest private
operators represent 10.1% and 3.7%, respectively,  of our investments.  No other
operator represents more than 2.7% of our investments. The three states in which
we have our highest concentration of investments are Florida (16.2%), California
(7.8%) and Illinois (7.7%).

     Our  company's  filings  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange   Commission,
including  our annual report on Form 10-K,  our quarterly  reports on Form 10-Q,
current  reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are accessible free
of charge (through a hyperlink) on our website at www.omegahealthcare.com.

Government  Healthcare  Regulation,  Reimbursements  and Industry  Concentration
Risks.  Nearly  all  of  our  properties  are  used  as  healthcare  facilities;
therefore,  we are directly  affected by the risk associated with the healthcare
industry.  Our  lessees  and  mortgagors,  as well as the  facilities  owned and
operated  for our own  account,  derive  a  substantial  portion  of  their  net
operating revenues from third-party payors,  including the Medicare and Medicaid
programs.  These programs are highly regulated by federal, state and local laws,
rules and  regulations  and  subject to frequent  and  substantial  change.  The
Balanced  Budget  Act of 1997  significantly  reduced  spending  levels  for the
Medicare and Medicaid  programs.  Due to the  implementation of the terms of the
Balanced  Budget Act,  effective July 1, 1998,  the majority of skilled  nursing
facilities  shifted from payments  based on  reimbursable  cost to a prospective
payment  system for  services  provided  to  Medicare  beneficiaries.  Under the
prospective  payment system,  skilled nursing  facilities are paid on a per diem
prospective  case  mix  adjusted   payment  basis  for  all  covered   services.
Implementation  of the  prospective  payment  system has affected each long-term
care  facility to a different  degree,  depending  upon the amount of revenue it
derives from Medicare patients. Long-term care facilities have had to attempt to
restructure  their  operations  to  operate  profitably  under the new  Medicare
prospective payment system reimbursement policies.

     Legislation adopted in 1999 and 2000 increased Medicare payments to nursing
facilities and specialty care facilities on an interim basis. Section 101 of the
Balanced Budget Relief Act of 1999 ("Balance  Budget Relief Act") included a 20%
increase for 15 patient acuity categories (known as Resource  Utilization Groups
("RUGS"))  and a 4% across the board  increase of the adjusted  federal per diem
payment rate. The 20% increase was  implemented in April 2000 and will remain in
effect  until the  implementation  of  refinements  in the current RUG  case-mix
classification  system  to more  accurately  estimate  the  cost of  non-therapy
ancillary  services.  The 4% increase was  implemented in April 2000 and expired
October 1, 2002.

     The Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 ("Benefits  Improvement
and Protection  Act") included a 16.7% increase in the nursing  component of the
case mix adjusted  federal  periodic  payment rate and a 6.7% increase in the 14
RUG  payments  for  rehabilitation  therapy  services.  The 16.7%  increase  was
implemented  in April 2000 and expired  October 1, 2002. The 6.7% increase is an
adjustment  to the 20%  increase  granted in the Balance  Budget  Relief Act and
spreads  the  funds  directed  at three of  those  15 RUGs to an  additional  11
rehabilitation  RUGs. The increase was implemented in April 2001 and will remain
in effect until the  implementation  of  refinements in the current RUG case-mix
classification system.

     In addition to the  expiration  of the 4% increase  implemented  in Balance
Budget Relief Act and the 16.7% increase implemented in Benefits Improvement and
Protection  Act,  Medicare  reimbursement  could  be  further  reduced  when CMS
completes  its  RUG  refinement  due to the  termination  of the  20%  and  6.7%
increases.  However,  the Medicare Payment  Advisory  Commission has recommended
that the 20% and 6.7% increases be folded into the base rate upon the completion
of the RUG  refinement.  The partial  expiration  of the  increases  under these
statutes as of October 1, 2002 has had an adverse  impact on the revenues of the
operators of nursing  facilities  and has  negatively  impacted some  operators'
ability to satisfy their monthly lease or debt payments to us.

     Due to the temporary nature of the remaining payment  increases,  we cannot
assure you that the federal  reimbursement  will remain at levels  comparable to
present levels and that such reimbursement will be sufficient for our lessees or
mortgagors to cover all operating and fixed costs necessary to care for Medicare
and Medicaid  patients.  We also cannot assure you that there will be any future
legislation to increase payment rates for skilled nursing facilities. If payment
rates for skilled  nursing  facilities are not increased in the future,  some of
our lessees and mortgagors may have difficulty meeting their payment obligations
to us.

     Each state has its own Medicaid program that is funded jointly by the state
and federal government.  Federal law governs how each state manages its Medicaid
program, but there is wide latitude for states to customize Medicaid programs to
fit the needs and  resources of its citizens.  The Balanced  Budget Act repealed
the federal payment standard,  also known as the Boren Amendment,  for hospitals
and nursing  facilities under Medicaid,  increasing  states' discretion over the
administration  of  Medicaid  programs.  A  number  of  states  are  considering
legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures which could result in
decreased revenues for our lessees and mortgagors.

     In  addition,   private  payors,   including   managed  care  payors,   are
increasingly   demanding   discounted  fee  structures  and  the  assumption  by
healthcare  providers of all or a portion of the  financial  risk of operating a
healthcare facility. Efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost
controls are expected to continue.  Any changes in reimbursement  policies which
reduce  reimbursement  levels could adversely affect the revenues of our lessees
and  mortgagors  and thereby  adversely  affect those  lessees' and  mortgagors'
abilities to make their monthly lease or debt payments to us.

     The  possibility  that the healthcare  facilities  will not generate income
sufficient  to meet  operating  expenses or will yield  returns lower than those
available through investments in comparable real estate or other investments are
additional  risks of investing in  healthcare-related  real estate.  Income from
properties  and yields from  investments  in such  properties may be affected by
many  factors,  including  changes in  governmental  regulation  (such as zoning
laws),  general or local economic  conditions  (such as fluctuations in interest
rates and  employment  conditions),  the  available  local supply and demand for
improved real estate, a reduction in rental income as the result of an inability
to maintain occupancy levels, natural disasters (such as earthquakes and floods)
or similar factors.

     Real estate  investments are relatively  illiquid and,  therefore,  tend to
limit our  ability to vary our  portfolio  promptly  in  response  to changes in
economic or other  conditions.  Thus, if the operation of any of our  properties
becomes  unprofitable  due to competition,  age of improvements or other factors
such that the lessee or borrower  becomes unable to meet its  obligations on the
lease  or  mortgage  loan,  the  liquidation   value  of  the  property  may  be
substantially  less,  particularly  relative to the amount  owing on any related
mortgage loan, than would be the case if the property were readily  adaptable to
other uses.

Potential Risks from  Bankruptcies.  Our lease  arrangements  with operators who
operate more than one of our  facilities are generally made pursuant to a single
master  lease  ("Master  Lease")  covering  all of that  operator's  facilities.
Although  each lease or Master Lease  provides  that we may terminate the Master
Lease upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the tenant, the Bankruptcy Reform Act
of  1978  ("Bankruptcy  Act")  provides  that  a  trustee  in  a  bankruptcy  or
reorganization proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act, or a debtor-in-possession in
a reorganization, has the power and the option to assume or reject the unexpired
lease  obligations of a debtor-lessee.  In the event that the unexpired lease is
assumed on behalf of the  debtor-lessee,  all the rental  obligations  generally
would be entitled to a priority over other unsecured claims.  However, the court
also has the power to modify a lease if a  debtor-lessee,  in a  reorganization,
were required to perform certain provisions of a lease that the court determined
to be unduly burdensome. It is not possible to determine at this time whether or
not any of our leases or Master Leases contain any such provision. If a lease is
rejected,  the lessor has a general  unsecured  claim limited to any unpaid rent
already due plus an amount equal to the rent reserved  under the lease,  without
acceleration,  for the greater of one year or 15% of the remaining  term of such
lease, not to exceed three years.

     Generally,  with  respect  to our  mortgage  loans,  the  imposition  of an
automatic stay under the Bankruptcy Act precludes us from exercising foreclosure
or other remedies against the debtor.  Pre-petition  creditors  generally do not
have rights to the cash flows from the properties underlying the mortgages.  The
timing of the collection from mortgagors in bankruptcy depends on negotiating an
acceptable  settlement  with the  mortgagor  (and  subject  to  approval  of the
bankruptcy court) or the order of the bankruptcy court in the event a negotiated
settlement  cannot be achieved.  A mortgagee also is treated  differently from a
landlord  in three key  respects.  First,  the  mortgage  loan is not subject to
assumption  or  rejection  because it is not an  executory  contract or a lease.
Second,  the  mortgagee's  loan may be divided  into (1) a secured  loan for the
portion of the mortgage  debt that does not exceed the value of the property and
(2) a general  unsecured  loan for the portion of the mortgage debt that exceeds
the value of the property.  A secured  creditor such as ourselves is entitled to
the recovery of interest and costs only if, and to the extent that, the value of
the collateral  exceeds the amount owed. If the value of the collateral  exceeds
the amount of the debt,  interest  and allowed  costs may not be paid during the
bankruptcy proceeding, but accrue until confirmation of a plan of reorganization
or such other time as the court orders. If the value of the collateral held by a
senior creditor is less than the secured debt, interest on the loan for the time
period  between  the  filing  of the case and  confirmation  may be  disallowed.
Finally, while a lease generally would either be rejected or assumed with all of
its benefits and burdens intact, the terms of a mortgage,  including the rate of
interest and timing of principal payments, may be modified if the debtor is able
to affect a "cramdown" under the Bankruptcy Act.

     The receipt of liquidation  proceeds or the replacement of an operator that
has  defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval  process of
any federal, state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the property or
the  replacement of the operator  licensed to manage the facility.  In addition,
some significant  expenditures  associated with real estate investment,  such as
real  estate  taxes and  maintenance  costs,  are  generally  not  reduced  when
circumstances  cause a  reduction  in income  from the  investment.  In order to
protect our  investments,  we may take  possession  of a property or even become
licensed  as an  operator,  which  might  expose us to  successor  liability  to
government programs or require us to indemnify  subsequent  operators to whom we
might  transfer the operating  rights and licenses.  Third party payors may also
suspend  payments to us  following  foreclosure  until we receive  the  required
licenses to operate the  facilities.  Should such events  occur,  our income and
cash flow from operations would be adversely affected.

Description of the Business

     Investment  Policies.  We maintain a  diversified  portfolio  of  long-term
healthcare  facilities  and  mortgages on healthcare  facilities  located in the
United States. In making investments,  we generally have focused on established,
creditworthy,  middle-market  healthcare  operators  that meet our standards for
quality  and  experience  of  management.   We  have  sought  to  diversify  our
investments in terms of geographic locations, operators and facility types. As a
consequence of our dividend arrearages and upcoming Fleet debt maturity, we have
not  recently  made  facility  investments  and do not  intend to make  facility
investments  unless,  and until we address  our Fleet  revolving  line of credit
facility which expires on December 31, 2003.

     In evaluating potential investments, we consider such factors as:

     o    the quality and experience of management and the  creditworthiness  of
          the operator of the facility;

     o    the facility's  historical,  current and forecasted  cash flow and its
          adequacy to meet operational needs,  capital expenditures and lease or
          debt service obligations, providing a competitive return on investment
          to us;

     o    the construction quality, condition and design of the facility;

     o    the geographic area and type of facility;

     o    the tax,  growth,  regulatory  and  reimbursement  environment  of the
          community in which the facility is located;

     o    the occupancy and demand for similar healthcare facilities in the same
          or nearby communities; and

     o    the payor mix of private, Medicare and Medicaid patients.

     One of our fundamental  investment strategies is to obtain contractual rent
escalations  under long-term,  non-cancelable,  "triple-net"  leases and revenue
participation  through  participating  mortgage loans, and to obtain substantial
liquidity  deposits.  Additional  security is  typically  provided by  covenants
regarding  minimum working capital and net worth,  liens on accounts  receivable
and  other  operating  assets,   and  various   provisions  for   cross-default,
cross-collateralization and corporate/personal guarantees, when appropriate.

     We prefer to invest in equity  ownership of properties.  Due to regulatory,
tax  or  other  considerations,   we  sometimes  pursue  alternative  investment
structures,  including  convertible  participating and participating  mortgages,
that achieve returns comparable to equity investments.  The following summarizes
the four primary investment  structures currently used by us. Average annualized
yields  reflect  existing  contractual  arrangements.  However,  in  view of the
ongoing  financial  challenges in the long-term care industry,  we cannot assure
you that the operators of our facilities will meet their payment  obligations in
full or when due.  Therefore,  the  annualized  yields as of January 1, 2003 set
forth below are not  necessarily  indicative of or a forecast of actual  yields,
which may be lower.

     Purchase/Leaseback.  In a Purchase/Leaseback  transaction,  we purchase the
     property  from the operator  and lease it back to the  operator  over terms
     typically  ranging from 10 to 16 years,  plus renewal  options.  The leases
     originated  by us generally  provide for minimum  annual  rentals which are
     subject to annual formula increases based upon such factors as increases in
     the  consumer  price index  ("CPI") or  increases  in the  revenue  streams
     generated by the  underlying  properties,  with certain  fixed  minimum and
     maximum levels.  Generally,  the operator holds an option to repurchase the
     property at set dates at prices  based on specified  formulas.  The average
     annualized yield from leases was 11.26% at January 1, 2003.

     Convertible Participating Mortgage. Convertible participating mortgages are
     secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying  real estate and personal
     property of the  mortgagor.  Interest  rates are usually  subject to annual
     increases  based upon  increases  in the CPI or  increases  in the revenues
     generated by the underlying long-term care facilities, with certain maximum
     limits. Convertible participating mortgages afford us the option to convert
     our mortgage into direct  ownership of the  property,  generally at a point
     six to nine years from inception.  If we exercise our purchase  option,  we
     are obligated to lease the property back to the operator for the balance of
     the originally agreed term and for the originally agreed  participations in
     revenues  or CPI  adjustments.  This  allows us to capture a portion of the
     potential  appreciation  in value of the real estate.  The operator has the
     right to buy out our  option at prices  based on  specified  formulas.  The
     average  annualized  yield on these mortgages was  approximately  10.39% at
     January 1, 2003.

     Participating Mortgage.  Participating mortgages are similar to convertible
     participating  mortgages  except  that we do not  have a  purchase  option.
     Interest rates are usually subject to annual increases based upon increases
     in the CPI or  increases  in  revenues  of the  underlying  long-term  care
     facilities,  with certain maximum limits.  The average  annualized yield on
     these investments was approximately 11.33% at January 1, 2003.

     Fixed-Rate  Mortgage.  These  mortgages  have a fixed interest rate for the
     mortgage  term and are secured by first  mortgage  liens on the  underlying
     real estate and personal property of the mortgagor.  The average annualized
     yield on these investments was 11.19% at January 1, 2003.


     The  following  table  identifies  the years of  expiration  of the payment
obligations  due to us under existing  contractual  obligations as of January 1,
2003. This  information is provided solely to indicate the scheduled  expiration
of payment obligations due to us, and is not a forecast of expected revenues.

</TABLE>

     The table set forth in Item 2 - Properties,  contains information regarding
our  real  estate  properties,  their  geographic  locations,  and the  types of
investment structures as of December 31, 2002.

     Borrowing  Policies.   We  may  incur  additional   indebtedness  and  have
historically sought to maintain a long-term  debt-to-total  capitalization ratio
in the range of 40% to 50%. Total  capitalization is total stockholders'  equity
plus long-term debt. We intend to periodically review our policy with respect to
our  debt-to-total  capitalization  ratio  and  to  modify  the  policy  as  our
management deems prudent in light of prevailing market conditions.  Our strategy
generally has been to match the maturity of our  indebtedness  with the maturity
of our investment assets, and to employ long-term, fixed-rate debt to the extent
practicable in view of market conditions in existence from time to time.

     We may use proceeds of any  additional  indebtedness  to provide  permanent
financing for  investments in additional  healthcare  facilities.  We may obtain
either secured or unsecured indebtedness,  and may obtain indebtedness which may
be  convertible  into capital  stock or be  accompanied  by warrants to purchase
capital  stock.  Where debt financing is present on terms deemed  favorable,  we
generally  may  invest in  properties  subject  to  existing  loans,  secured by
mortgages, deeds of trust or similar liens on properties.

     Industry turmoil and continuing adverse economic conditions have caused the
terms on which we can obtain additional borrowings to become unfavorable.  If we
need  capital  to  repay  indebtedness  as it  matures,  we may be  required  to
liquidate investments in properties at times which may not permit realization of
the maximum recovery on these investments. This could also result in adverse tax
consequences to us. We may be required to issue  additional  equity interests in
our company,  which could dilute your  investment in our company.  (See Item 7 -
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources).

     Federal  Income  Tax  Considerations.  We  intend  to make and  manage  our
investments, including the sale or disposition of property or other investments,
and to  operate  in such a manner as to  qualify  as a REIT  under the  Internal
Revenue  Code,  unless,  because of changes in  circumstances  or changes in the
Internal Revenue Code, our Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in
our best  interest to qualify as a REIT.  As a REIT,  we generally  will not pay
federal  income taxes on the portion of our taxable  income which is distributed
to stockholders.

     Securities  Or  Interest  In  Persons  Primarily  Engaged  In  Real  Estate
Activities. In November 1997, we formed Omega Worldwide,  Inc. ("Worldwide"),  a
company  which  provides  asset  management  services  and  management  advisory
services,  as well as  equity  and  debt  capital  to the  healthcare  industry,
particularly  residential  healthcare services to the elderly. On April 2, 1998,
we contributed  substantially all of our assets in Principal  Healthcare Finance
Limited ("PHFL"),  an Isle of Jersey (United Kingdom)  company,  to Worldwide in
exchange for  approximately  8.5 million  shares of  Worldwide  common stock and
260,000  shares  of  Series B  preferred  stock.  Of the 8.5  million  shares of
Worldwide common stock we received,  approximately  5.2 million were distributed
on April 2, 1998 to our stockholders, and we sold 2.3 million shares on April 3,
1998.

     During 2002,  we sold our  investment  in  Worldwide.  Pursuant to a tender
offer by Four  Seasons  Health  Care  Limited  ("Four  Seasons")  for all of the
outstanding shares of common stock of Worldwide,  we sold our investment,  which
consisted of 1.2 million  shares of common stock and 260,000 shares of preferred
stock,  to  Four  Seasons  for  cash  proceeds  of  approximately  $7.4  million
(including $3.5 million for preferred stock  liquidation  preference and accrued
preferred  dividends).  In  addition,  we sold our  investment  in  PHFL,  which
consisted of 990,000  ordinary shares and warrants to purchase  185,033 ordinary
shares, to an affiliate of Four Seasons for cash proceeds of $2.8 million.  Both
transactions  were  completed in  September  2002 and  provided  aggregate  cash
proceeds of $10.2 million.  We realized a gain from the sale of our  investments
in Worldwide and PHFL of $2.2 million. As of December 31, 2002, we no longer own
any interest in Worldwide or PHFL.

     In April 1999, in conjunction with an acquisition by Worldwide, we acquired
an interest in Principal  Healthcare  Finance Trust,  an Australian  Unit Trust,
which owns 47 nursing home facilities and 446 assisted living units in Australia
and New Zealand.  As of December 31, 2002, we hold a $1.3 million  investment in
the Trust.

     Policies  With  Respect To Certain  Activities.  If our Board of  Directors
determines that additional funding is required,  we may raise such funds through
additional equity offerings, debt financing,  retention of cash flow (subject to
provisions in the Internal  Revenue Code concerning  taxability of undistributed
REIT taxable income) or a combination of these methods.

     In the event that our Board of  Directors  determines  to raise  additional
equity capital,  it has the authority,  without stockholder  approval,  to issue
additional  common stock or preferred  stock in any manner and on such terms and
for such consideration it deems appropriate, including in exchange for property.
In July 2000, we issued shares of our Series C  Convertible  Preferred  Stock to
Explorer  Holdings,  L.P.  ("Explorer")  in exchange for an investment of $100.0
million.

     Borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings, secured or unsecured, and
publicly or privately placed debt instruments, purchase money obligations to the
sellers  of  assets,  long-term,  tax-exempt  bonds  or  financing  from  banks,
institutional  investors  or  other  lenders,  securitizations,   any  of  which
indebtedness  may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests
in the asset. Such indebtedness may be recourse to all or any part of our assets
or may be limited to the particular asset to which the indebtedness relates.

     On December 21, 2001, we reached  amended  agreements  with the bank groups
under both of our revolving credit  facilities.  As of the closing of the rights
offering  and the private  placement  to Explorer on February  21,  2002,  these
amendments became effective.

     As part of the  amendment  regarding  our $75.0  million  revolving  credit
facility, we prepaid $10.0 million originally scheduled to mature in March 2002.
This  voluntary  prepayment  resulted  in a  permanent  reduction  in the  total
commitment, thereby reducing the credit facility to $65.0 million. The agreement
regarding  our $175.0  million  revolving  credit  facility  included a one-year
extension  in  maturity  from  December  31, 2002 to December  31,  2003,  and a
reduction in the total  commitment from $175.0 million to $160.0 million.  As of
December 31, 2002,  our  borrowings  were $65.0 million and $112.0 million under
the $65.0 million and the $160.0 million credit facilities, respectively.

     We have  authority  to offer  our  common  stock or  other  equity  or debt
securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our
shares or any other  securities and may engage in such activities in the future.
Similarly,  we may offer additional interests in our operating  partnership that
are  exchangeable  into common  shares or, at our option,  cash, in exchange for
property. We also may make loans to our subsidiaries.

     Subject to the  percentage  of ownership  limitations  and gross income and
asset tests  necessary  for REIT  qualification,  we may invest in securities of
other REITs,  other entities engaged in real estate  activities or securities of
other  issuers,  including  for the  purpose  of  exercising  control  over such
entities.

     We may engage in the purchase and sale of investments. We do not underwrite
the securities of other issuers.

     Our officers and directors may change any of these policies  without a vote
of our stockholders.

     In the opinion of our management,  our properties are adequately covered by
insurance.

     Competition. We compete for additional healthcare facility investments with
other healthcare  investors,  including other real estate investment trusts. The
operators of the  facilities  compete with other  regional or local nursing care
facilities for the support of the medical  community,  including  physicians and
acute  care  hospitals,   as  well  as  the  general  public.  Some  significant
competitive factors for the placing of patients in skilled and intermediate care
nursing facilities include quality of care,  reputation,  physical appearance of
the facilities,  services offered,  family  preferences,  physician services and
price.

</TABLE>
     Our core portfolio consists of long-term lease and mortgage agreements. Our
leased real estate  properties are leased under provisions of Master Leases with
initial  terms  typically  ranging from 10 to 16 years,  plus  renewal  options.
Substantially  all of the master leases  provide for minimum annual rentals that
are subject to annual  increases based upon increases in the CPI or increases in
revenues of the underlying  properties,  with certain limits. Under the terms of
the leases,  the lessee is responsible for all maintenance,  repairs,  taxes and
insurance on the leased properties.

     Our  owned  and  operated  facilities,   like  those  of  our  lessees  and
mortgagees,  are  subject to  government  regulation  and  derive a  substantial
portion of their net operating revenues from third-party  payors,  including the
Medicare and Medicaid  programs.  These  facilities  are managed by  independent
third parties under management contracts. These managers are responsible for the
day-to-day operation of the facilities,  including,  among other things, patient
care,  staffing,  billing and collection of patient accounts and  facility-level
financial reporting. For their services, the managers are paid a management fee,
typically  based on a percentage  of nursing home  revenues.  As of December 31,
2002, we had three properties  classified as owned and operated.  (See Note 19 -
Subsequent Events to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

     As a consequence of the financial  difficulties  encountered by a number of
our  operators,  we have  recovered  various  long-term  care assets  pledged as
collateral  for  the  operators'   obligations   either  in  connection  with  a
restructuring  or settlement  with certain  operators or pursuant to foreclosure
proceedings. Under normal circumstances,  we would seek to re-lease or otherwise
dispose of such assets as promptly as practicable.  When we adopt a plan to sell
a property and hold a contract for sale,  the property is  classified  as Assets
Held for Sale.

     As of December 31, 2002, there are four properties in assets held for sale,
representing a total investment, net of impairment of $2.3 million. No assurance
can be given that the sales will be realized.

Item 3 - Legal Proceedings

     We are  subject  to various  legal  proceedings,  claims and other  actions
arising out of the normal  course of  business.  While any legal  proceeding  or
claim has an element of uncertainty, we believe that the outcome of each lawsuit
claim  or  legal  proceeding  that  is  pending  or  threatened,  or all of them
combined,  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

     On June 21,  2000,  we were  named as a  defendant  in  certain  litigation
brought  against  us in the U.S.  District  Court for the  Eastern  District  of
Michigan, Detroit Division, by Madison/OHI Liquidity Investors, LLC ("Madison"),
for the breach and/or anticipatory breach of a revolving loan commitment. Ronald
M.  Dickerman  and Bryan Gordon are  partners in Madison and limited  guarantors
("Guarantors")  of Madison's  obligations  to us.  Effective as of September 30,
2002 the parties  settled all claims in the suit in  consideration  of Madison's
payment of the sum of $5.4  million.  The payment by Madison  consists of a $0.4
million cash payment for our attorneys' fees, with the balance  evidenced by the
amendment of the existing  promissory note from Madison to us. The note reflects
a principal  balance of $5.0 million,  with  interest  accruing at 9% per annum,
payable over three years upon  liquidation of the collateral  securing the note.
The  note is also  fully  guaranteed  by the  Guarantors;  provided  that if all
accrued interest and 75% of original principal has been repaid within 18 months,
the Guarantors  will be released.  As of December 31, 2002, we have received the
$0.4 million  cash  payment and  payments of principal  and interest on the note
equal to $2.7 million.  The financial  statements  have been adjusted to reflect
the  restructuring  and  reduction  of our  investment  in  connection  with the
settlement of this matter.

     On December 29, 1998, Karrington Health, Inc.  ("Karrington")  brought suit
against us in the  Franklin  County,  Ohio,  Common  Pleas  Court  (subsequently
removed to the U.S.  District Court for the Southern  District of Ohio,  Eastern
Division)  alleging  that we  repudiated  and  ultimately  breached a  financing
contract to provide $95 million of financing for the  development of 13 assisted
living facilities.  Karrington was seeking recovery of approximately $34 million
in damages it alleged to have incurred as a result of the breach.  On August 13,
2001, we paid Karrington $10 million to settle all claims arising from the suit,
but  without  our  admission  of any  liability  or fault,  which  liability  is
expressly  denied.  Based on the  settlement,  the suit has been  dismissed with
prejudice. The settlement was recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2001.

     The closing price on December 31, 2002 was $3.74 per share.  As of December
31,  2002,  there  were  37,140,625  shares of  common  stock  outstanding  with
approximately  1,800  registered  holders and  approximately  14,350  beneficial
owners.

     We do not know when or if we will  resume  dividend  payments on our common
stock or, if  resumed,  what the amount or timing of any  dividend  will be. All
accrued and unpaid  dividends  on our Series A, B and C preferred  stock must be
paid in full before dividends on our common stock can be resumed.

Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

     This document contains  forward-looking  statements,  including  statements
regarding potential asset sales, potential future changes in reimbursement,  the
future effect of the "Medicare cliff" on our operators and plans to refinance or
extend our upcoming debt maturity.  These statements relate to our expectations,
beliefs,  intentions,  plans,  objectives,  goals,  strategies,  future  events,
performance  and  underlying   assumptions  and  other   statements  other  than
statements of historical facts. In some cases, you can identify  forward-looking
statements by the use of  forward-looking  terminology  including "may," "will,"
"anticipates," "expects," "believes," "intends," "should" or comparable terms or
the negative thereof. These statements are based on information available on the
date of this  filing and only speak as to the date hereof and no  obligation  to
update such forward-looking statements should be assumed. Our actual results may
differ  materially  from  those  reflected  in  the  forward-looking  statements
contained  herein as a result of a variety of  factors,  including,  among other
things:  (i) those items discussed in Item 1 above;  (ii) regulatory  changes in
the  healthcare  sector,  including  without  limitation,  changes  in  Medicare
reimbursement;  (iii) changes in the financial position of our operators;  ( iv)
the ability of operators in bankruptcy to reject  unexpired  lease  obligations,
modify the terms of our mortgages, and impede our ability to collect unpaid rent
or interest  during the pendency of a bankruptcy  proceeding and retain security
deposits for the debtor's obligations; (v) our ability to dispose of assets held
for  sale on a  timely  basis  and at  appropriate  prices;  (vi)  uncertainties
relating to the  operation of our owned and  operated  assets,  including  those
relating  to  reimbursement  by  third-party  payors,   regulatory  matters  and
occupancy  levels;  (vii) our  ability  to  manage,  re-lease  or sell owned and
operated  assets;  (viii)  the  availability  and  cost  of  capital;  and  (ix)
competition in the financing of healthcare facilities.

Overview

     The long-term  care industry  changed  dramatically  following the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997,  which  introduced  the  prospective  payment system for the
reimbursement of Medicare patients in skilled nursing  facilities,  implementing
an  acuity-based  reimbursement  system in lieu of the cost-based  reimbursement
system historically used. The prospective payment system  significantly  reduced
payments to nursing home  operators.  That  reduction,  in turn,  has negatively
affected  the  revenues of our nursing  home  facilities  and the ability of our
nursing home  operators to service  their capital costs to us. Many nursing home
operators,  including a number of our large nursing home operators,  have sought
protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act.

     In  response  to the  adverse  impact  of the  prospective  payment  system
reimbursement cuts, the Federal government passed the Balanced Budget Refinement
Act of 1999 ("Balanced Budget Refinement Act") and the Benefits  Improvement and
Protection Act of 2000  ("Benefits  Improvement  and Protection  Act"),  both of
which increased payments to nursing home operators on an interim basis. In prior
years these  increases  positively  affected  the  revenues of our nursing  home
facilities  and the  ability of our  nursing  home  operators  to service  their
capital  costs to us. In  addition,  the  facilities  that we own and  currently
operate  for our own  account  were  positively  affected  in prior years by the
Balanced  Budget  Refinement Act and Benefits  Improvement  and Protection  Act.
Certain  of  the  increases  in  Medicare   reimbursement  for  skilled  nursing
facilities  provided  for  under  the  Balanced  Budget  Refinement  Act and the
Benefits  Improvement  and  Protection  Act ceased in October 2002.  The partial
expiration of Balance Budget Relief Act and Benefits  Improvement and Protection
Act increases as of October 1, 2002 has had an adverse impact on the revenues of
the operators of nursing facilities and has negatively  impacted some operators'
ability to satisfy  their  monthly  lease or debt  payments  to us. For  further
discussion, see "Item 1-Overview-Government Healthcare Regulation Reimbursements
and  Industry   Concentration   Risks."  Unless   Congress   enacts   additional
legislation,  the loss of revenues associated with this occurrence will continue
to have an adverse effect on our operators.  Due to the temporary  nature of the
remaining payment increases, we cannot assure you that the federal reimbursement
will remain at levels  comparable to present levels and that such  reimbursement
will be  sufficient  for our lessees or  mortgagors  to cover all  operating and
fixed costs necessary to care for Medicare and Medicaid patients. We also cannot
assure you that there will be any future  legislation to increase  payment rates
for skilled nursing facilities.  If payment rates for skilled nursing facilities
are not  increased in the future,  some of our lessees and  mortgagors  may have
difficulty meeting their payment obligations to us.

     In addition, each state has its own Medicaid program that is funded jointly
by the state and federal government.  Federal law governs how each state manages
its  Medicaid  program,  but there is wide  latitude  for  states  to  customize
Medicaid  programs to fit the needs and resources of its citizens.  The Balanced
Budget  Act  repealed  the  federal  payment  standard,  also known as the Boren
Amendment,  for  hospitals and nursing  facilities  under  Medicaid,  increasing
states'  discretion over the  administration of Medicaid  programs.  A number of
states  are   considering   legislation   designed  to  reduce  their   Medicaid
expenditures  which  could  result in  decreased  revenues  for our  lessees and
mortgagors.

     The initial impact of the prospective  payment system  negatively  affected
our  financial  results  and our  access to capital  sources to fund  growth and
refinance existing indebtedness.  To obtain sufficient liquidity to enable us to
address the maturity in July 2000 and  February  2001 of  indebtedness  totaling
$129.8 million, we issued $100.0 million of Series C preferred stock to Explorer
Holdings,  L.P. ("Explorer") in July 2000 as described in more detail in Note 10
- - Stockholders' Equity and Stock Options to our audited  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.

     As a consequence of the financial  difficulties  encountered by a number of
our  nursing  home  operators  in the late  1990's,  we have  recovered  various
long-term  care assets  pledged as  collateral  for the  operators'  obligations
either in connection with a restructuring  or settlement with certain  operators
or pursuant to foreclosure  proceedings.  Under normal  circumstances,  we would
seek to re-lease or otherwise dispose of such assets as promptly as practicable.
However,  a number of companies  were actively  marketing  portfolios of similar
assets and, in light of the market  conditions  in the  long-term  care industry
generally,  it had become more difficult  both to sell these  properties and for
potential buyers to obtain financing to acquire them. As a result,  during 2000,
$24.3 million of assets previously classified as held for sale were reclassified
to  "owned  and  operated  assets"  as the  timing  and  strategy  for  sale or,
alternatively,   re-leasing,   were  revised  in  light  of  prevailing   market
conditions.

     At December 31, 2001, we owned 33 long-term healthcare  facilities that had
been  recovered  from  customers and were  operated for our own account.  Due to
re-leasing and asset sales, we owned three such facilities at December 31, 2002.
During 2000 and 2001,  we  experienced  a  significant  increase in nursing home
revenues attributable to the increase in owned and operated assets. During 2002,
these  increases  abated as we re-leased,  sold or closed all but three of these
facilities.  For the twelve months ended  December 31, 2002, 32% of our revenues
were from owned and operated assets as compared to 65% for the same twelve-month
period in 2001. In addition, in connection with the recovery of these assets, we
often  fund  working  capital  and  deferred  capital  expenditure  needs  for a
transitional  period until license  transfers and other  regulatory  matters are
completed and reimbursement from third-party payors recommences.  Our management
intends to sell or re-lease  these  assets as promptly as  possible,  consistent
with achieving  valuations that reflect our management's  estimate of fair value
of the assets.  We do not know,  however,  if, or when, the dispositions will be
completed  or whether  the  dispositions  will be  completed  on terms that will
enable us to realize the fair value of such assets.

     In February 2001, we suspended dividends on all common and preferred stock.
We do not know when, or if, we will resume dividend payments on our common stock
or, if  resumed,  what the amount or timing of any  dividend  will be.  Prior to
recommencing  the  payment of  dividends  on our common  stock,  all accrued and
unpaid  dividends on our Series A, B and C preferred stock must be paid in full.
We have made sufficient  distributions to satisfy the distribution  requirements
under the REIT rules of the  Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 to maintain our REIT
status for 2001.  For tax year 2002,  we are  currently  projecting  a tax loss;
therefore,  we anticipate no  distribution  will be required to satisfy the 2002
REIT rules.  However, if we have taxable income, we intend to make the necessary
distributions to satisfy the 2002 REIT requirements.

     On February 6, 2002, we refinanced our investment in a Baltimore,  Maryland
asset leased by the United States  Postal  Service  ("USPS")  resulting in $13.0
million of net cash proceeds. The new,  fully-amortizing  mortgage has a 20-year
term with a fixed interest rate of 7.26%. This transaction is cash neutral to us
on a monthly  basis,  as lease  payments due from USPS equal debt service on the
new loan.

     On February 21, 2002, we raised gross proceeds of $50.0 million through the
completion of a rights offering and simultaneous  private placement to Explorer.
The proceeds from the rights  offering and private  placement were used to repay
outstanding indebtedness and for working capital and general corporate purposes.

     During 2002,  we paid off the  remaining  $97.5  million of our 6.95% Notes
that matured in June 2002,  resulting in a loss on early  extinguishment of debt
of approximately  $49,000. In addition,  during 2002, as a result of foreclosure
proceedings,  we  relinquished  title to certain  properties with a net carrying
value  of  approximately  $5.2  million  in  satisfaction  of  certain  mortgage
obligations owed to the Department of Housing and Urban  Development  ("HUD") in
the amount of $5.2 million.

     On June 21,  2000,  we were  named as a  defendant  in  certain  litigation
brought  against  us in the U.S.  District  Court for the  Eastern  District  of
Michigan, Detroit Division, by Madison/OHI Liquidity Investors, LLC ("Madison"),
for the breach and/or anticipatory breach of a revolving loan commitment. Ronald
M.  Dickerman  and Bryan Gordon are  partners in Madison and limited  guarantors
("Guarantors")  of Madison's  obligations  to us. Madison  claimed  damages as a
result of the alleged  breach of  approximately  $0.7  million and damages in an
amount  ranging from $15 to $28 million for the  anticipatory  breach.  We filed
counterclaims   against  Madison  and  the  guarantors   seeking   repayment  of
approximately  $7.4  million  of  unpaid  principal  on the loan,  plus  accrued
interest.  Effective as of September 30, 2002, the parties settled all claims in
the suit in consideration of Madison's  payment of the sum of $5.4 million.  The
payment by Madison  consists of a $0.4 million  cash payment for our  attorneys'
fees,  with the balance  evidenced by the  amendment of the existing  promissory
note from Madison to us. The note reflects a principal  balance of $5.0 million,
with  interest  accruing  at  9%  per  annum,  payable  over  three  years  upon
liquidation  of the  collateral  securing  the  note.  The  note is  also  fully
guaranteed by the Guarantors;  provided that if all accrued  interest and 75% of
original  principal has been repaid  within 18 months,  the  Guarantors  will be
released.  Accordingly, a reserve of $1.25 million was recorded relating to this
note.

Critical Accounting Policies

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities,  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Our significant  accounting  policies are described
in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies were
followed in preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for all periods
presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     We  have  identified  six  significant   accounting  policies  as  critical
accounting policies.  These critical accounting policies are those that have the
most impact on the  reporting of our  financial  condition  and those  requiring
significant  judgments and estimates.  With respect to these critical accounting
policies,   we  believe  the   application  of  judgments  and   assessments  is
consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the
results of operations  for all periods  presented.  The six critical  accounting
policies are:

     Owned and  Operated  Assets and Assets Held for Sale.  When we acquire real
estate  pursuant to a  foreclosure  proceeding,  it is  designated as "owned and
operated  assets"  and is  recorded  at the  lower of cost or fair  value and is
included in real estate properties on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Operating
assets and operating liabilities for the owned and operated properties are shown
separately  on the face of our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet and are detailed in
Note 16--Segment Information.

     When a formal  plan to sell real  estate is adopted  and we hold a contract
for sale,  the real estate is classified as "assets held for sale," with the net
carrying amount adjusted to the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less cost
of disposal.  Depreciation of the facilities is excluded from  operations  after
management has committed to a plan to sell the asset. Upon adoption of Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") 144 as of January 1, 2002, long-lived assets
sold or  designated  as held for sale  after  January  1, 2002 are  reported  as
discontinued operations in our financial statements.

     Impairment of Assets. We periodically  evaluate our real estate investments
for impairment  indicators.  The judgment  regarding the existence of impairment
indicators are based on factors such as market conditions,  operator performance
and legal  structure.  If indicators of impairment are present,  we evaluate the
carrying  value of the related real estate  investments in  relationship  to the
future  undiscounted  cash flows of the  underlying  facilities.  Provisions for
impairment  losses  related to long-lived  assets are  recognized  when expected
future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the assets. If the sum of
the expected future cash flow,  including sales proceeds,  is less than carrying
value,  we then adjust the net  carrying  value of leased  properties  and other
long-lived assets to the present value of expected future cash flows.

     Loan  Impairment  Policy.  When  management  identifies  an  indication  of
potential  loan  impairment,  such as  non-payment  under the loan  documents or
impairment of the underlying collateral, the loan is written down to the present
value of the expected  future cash flows.  In cases where  expected  future cash
flows  cannot be  estimated,  the loan is written  down to the fair value of the
collateral.

     Accounts  Receivable.  Accounts  receivable consists primarily of lease and
mortgage interest  payments.  Amounts recorded include estimated  provisions for
loss related to  uncollectible  accounts and disputed items. On a monthly basis,
we review the  contractual  payment versus actual cash payment  received and the
contractual  payment  due date  versus  actual  receipt  date.  When  management
identifies  delinquencies,  a judgment is made as to the amount of provision, if
any, that is needed.

     Accounts  Receivable--Owned  and Operated Assets.  Accounts receivable from
owned and  operated  assets  consist of amounts due from  Medicare  and Medicaid
programs,  other  government  programs,  managed care health  plans,  commercial
insurance companies and individual patients.  Amounts recorded include estimated
provisions for loss related to uncollectible accounts and disputed items.

     Revenue  Recognition.  Rental  income  and  mortgage  interest  income  are
recognized  as earned over the terms of the related  Master  Leases and mortgage
notes,   respectively.   Such  income  includes  periodic   increases  based  on
pre-determined  formulas (i.e.,  such as increases in the CPI) as defined in the
Master Leases and mortgage loan  agreements.  Reserves are taken against  earned
revenues  from  leases and  mortgages  when  collection  of  amounts  due become
questionable or when negotiations for  restructurings of troubled operators lead
to  lower  expectations  regarding  ultimate  collection.   When  collection  is
uncertain,  lease  revenues are recorded as received,  after taking into account
application of security deposits.  Interest income on impaired mortgage loans is
recognized  as  received  after  taking  into  account  application  of security
deposits.

     Nursing home revenues from owned and operated assets  (primarily  Medicare,
Medicaid and other third party insurance) are recognized as patient services are
provided.

Results of Operations

     The following is our discussion of the consolidated  results of operations,
financial position and liquidity and capital resources,  which should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

Year Ended December 31, 2002 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001

     Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled $137.1 million, a
decrease of $120.5 million over 2001 revenues.  Excluding  nursing home revenues
of owned and operated  assets,  revenues  were $92.8  million for the year ended
December 31, 2002,  an increase of $3.4 million from the  comparable  prior year
period.

     Our rental  income for the year  ended  December  31,  2002  totaled  $64.8
million,  an increase of $3.6 million over 2001 rental  income.  The increase is
due to $8.0 million from new leases on assets previously classified as owned and
operated  and  $0.9  million  of  contractual  rent  increases  on the  existing
portfolio.  This increase is partially offset by a reduction of revenues of $5.3
million due to bankruptcies and restructurings.

     Our mortgage  interest  income for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled
$21.0 million,  increasing $0.2 million. The increase is due to $1.1 million for
new  investments  placed  during  2001 and  receipt  in 2002 of $1.6  million of
interest  due in 2001 and not received  until 2002,  offset by $1.5 million from
loans paid off, $0.9 million due to  restructurings  and  bankruptcies  and $0.1
million due to normal amortization of the portfolio.

     Our nursing home  revenues of owned and operated  assets for the year ended
December 31, 2002 totaled $44.3  million,  decreasing  $123.9  million over 2001
nursing  home  revenues.  This  decrease  is due to the  releasing,  sale and/or
closure of 30 assets in 2002.

     Our expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled  $154.3  million,
decreasing  approximately  $122.4  million over  expenses of $276.7  million for
2001.

     Our nursing home expenses for owned and operated assets  decreased to $65.7
million from $176.2 million in 2001 due to the releasing, sale and/or closure of
30 owned and operated  assets  during the year.  In 2002,  nursing home expenses
included a $5.9 million provision for uncollectible accounts receivable and $4.3
million of expenses related to leasehold buy outs. Nursing home expenses in 2001
included a $7.3 million provision for uncollectible accounts receivable.

     The 2002 provision for depreciation and amortization of real estate totaled
$21.3  million,  decreasing  $0.8  million  over  2001.  The  decrease  consists
primarily  of $0.4  million of  leasehold  amortization  expense for  leaseholds
written  down in 2001 or sold in 2002 and $0.6  million  from  properties  sold,
impaired  or  reclassified  to  held  for  sale,  offset  by $0.2  million  from
properties previously classified as mortgages.

     Our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was approximately
$27.3 million, compared with $36.3 million for 2001. The decrease in 2002 is due
to the  payoff of $97.5  million of 6.95%  Notes  that  matured in June 2002 and
lower average borrowings on our credit facilities.

     Our general and  administrative  expenses  for 2002 totaled $6.3 million as
compared to $10.4 million for 2001, a decrease of $4.1 million.  The decrease is
due to lower  consulting  costs,  primarily  related  to the owned and  operated
facilities  and cost  reductions  due to  reduced  staffing,  travel  and  other
employee-related expenses.

     Our legal  expenses  for 2002  totaled  $2.9  million as  compared  to $4.3
million in 2001.  The decrease is largely  attributable  to a reduction of legal
costs  associated  with our owned and operated  facilities due to the releasing,
sale and/or closure of 30 owned and operated assets during the year.

     In the fourth  quarter of 2002,  we  recognized a $7.0 million  refinancing
expense  as we were  unable to  complete  a planned  commercial  mortgage-backed
securities  ("CMBS")  transaction  due to the impact on our operators  resulting
from reductions in Medicare  reimbursement and concerns about potential Medicaid
rate  reductions.  We continue to actively  pursue  refinancing  alternatives in
order to extend current debt maturities.  Among other things,  we are continuing
discussions  to extend or  refinance  our $160 million  Fleet  credit  facility,
currently  scheduled to mature in December  2003. At this time,  there can be no
assurance  that we will be able to  reach  acceptable  agreements  with our bank
lenders and/or other capital sources to achieve the desired refinancing.

     A provision for impairment of $15.4 million and $9.6 million is included in
expenses for 2002 and 2001, respectively.  The 2002 provision consisted of $12.4
million to reduce the carrying  value of eight closed  facilities  to their fair
value less cost to dispose, including $2.7 million for two facilities previously
classified  as held for sale,  and $3.0  million  related to owned and  operated
assets that  management  determined were impaired.  The 2001 provision  included
$8.3 million to reduce  facilities  recovered  from  operators and classified as
held for sale  assets to fair  value  less  cost to  dispose,  and $1.2  million
related to other real estate assets that management determined were impaired.

     We recognized a provision for loss on  uncollectible  mortgages,  notes and
accounts receivable of $8.8 million in 2002. The provision included $4.9 million
associated  with the write down of two mortgage loans to bankrupt  operators and
$3.5 million related to the restructuring of debt owed by Madison/OHI  Liquidity
Investors, LLC ("Madison") as part of the compromise and settlement of a lawsuit
with Madison.  (See Note 14 - Litigation to our audited  Consolidated  Financial
Statements).  The 2002 provision  also included $0.4 million to adjust  accounts
receivable to their net realizable value. In 2001, we recognized a provision for
uncollectible mortgages, notes and accounts receivable of $0.7 million to adjust
the carrying value of accounts receivable to net realizable value.

     In 2001,  we  recorded  a $5.1  million  charge for  severance,  moving and
consulting  agreement  costs.  This  charge was  comprised  of $4.6  million for
relocation of our corporate  headquarters  and $0.5 million for  consulting  and
severance payments to a former executive.

     In 2001, we recorded a $10 million  litigation  settlement to settle a suit
brought by Karrington Health, Inc. in 1998. This settled all claims arising from
the suit, but without our admission of any liability or fault,  which  liability
is  expressly  denied.  Based on the  settlement,  the suit was  dismissed  with
prejudice.

     During 2002,  we recorded a non-cash  gain of $0.9  million  related to the
maturity and payoff of two interest  rate swaps with a notional  amount of $32.0
million each. We recorded a non-cash  charge of $1.3 million for 2001 related to
the adoption of FASB Statement No. 133,  Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging  Activities,  which was  required  to be adopted in years  beginning
after June 15, 2000.

     During 2002, we recognized a gain on assets sold of $2.5 million, primarily
from the sale of our investment in Omega Worldwide, Inc. ("Worldwide"). Pursuant
to a tender offer by Four Seasons Health Care Limited  ("Four  Seasons") for all
of the outstanding shares of common stock of Worldwide,  we sold our investment,
which  consisted  of 1.2 million  shares of common  stock and 260,000  shares of
preferred stock, to Four Seasons for cash proceeds of approximately $7.4 million
(including $3.5 million for preferred stock  liquidation  preference and accrued
preferred  dividends).   In  addition,  we  sold  our  investment  in  Principal
Healthcare Finance Limited, an Isle of Jersey company ("PHFL"),  which consisted
of 990,000 ordinary shares and warrants to purchase 185,033 ordinary shares,  to
an  affiliate  of  Four  Seasons  for  cash  proceeds  of  $2.8  million.   Both
transactions  were  completed in  September  2002 and  provided  aggregate  cash
proceeds of $10.2 million.  We realized a gain from the sale of our  investments
in  Worldwide  and  PHFL of $2.2  million.  We no  longer  own any  interest  in
Worldwide or PHFL. In addition,  we sold certain other assets in 2002  realizing
cash  proceeds  of $7.5  million,  resulting  in a net  accounting  gain of $0.3
million.  During 2001, we sold certain other assets  realizing  cash proceeds of
$3.9 million, resulting in an accounting loss of $0.7 million.

     During 2002,  we  recognized a loss of $49,000 on early  extinguishment  of
debt with the repurchase of $62.7 million of the remaining  $97.5 million of our
6.95% Notes that matured in June of 2002. For the year ending December 31, 2001,
we  repurchased  $27.5  million of the same 6.95%  Notes  maturing in June 2002,
recognizing a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $3.1 million.

     Our funds from  operations for the year ended December 31, 2002, on a fully
diluted basis  totaled $8.9 million,  an increase of $4.6 million as compared to
the $4.3 million for 2001 due to factors  mentioned  above.  After adjusting for
the  non-recurring   provision  for  loss  on  mortgages,   notes  and  accounts
receivable,  severance  and  consulting  costs,  one-time  revenue  adjustments,
refinancing expense and litigation settlement expense,  funds from operations on
a fully  diluted  basis was $27.6  million in 2002,  an increase of $2.1 million
from the year ended  December 31, 2001.  Funds from  operations  is net earnings
available  to common  stockholders,  excluding  any  gains or  losses  from debt
restructuring  and the  effects of asset  dispositions,  plus  depreciation  and
amortization  associated  with  real  estate  investments.  Diluted  funds  from
operations  is the lower of funds  from  operations  and funds  from  operations
adjusted for the assumed conversion of Series C preferred stock and the exercise
of  in-the-money  stock  options.  We consider  funds from  operations to be one
performance  measure  which is helpful to  investors  of real  estate  companies
because,  along with cash flows from operating activities,  financing activities
and investing activities,  it provides investors an understanding of our ability
to incur and service debt and to make expenditures. Funds from operations in and
of itself  does not  represent  cash  generated  from  operating  activities  in
accordance with generally  accepted  accounting  principles and therefore should
not be considered an  alternative  to net earnings as an indication of operating
performance,  or to net cash flow from  operating  activities  as  determined by
generally accepted  accounting  principles in the United States, as a measure of
liquidity  and is not  necessarily  indicative  of cash  available  to fund cash
needs.

     No provision  for federal  income taxes has been made since we qualify as a
real estate  investment  trust  ("REIT")  under the  provisions  of Sections 856
through 860 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Accordingly,  we
have not  been  subject  to  federal  income  taxes on  amounts  distributed  to
stockholders,  since we have distributed at least 90% of our REIT taxable income
for taxable year 2001 (95% prior to 2001) and have met certain other conditions.
For tax year  2002,  we are  currently  projecting  a tax  loss;  therefore,  we
anticipate  no  distribution  will be  required  to satisfy the 2002 REIT rules.
However,   if  we  have  taxable  income,   we  intend  to  make  the  necessary
distributions to satisfy the 2002 REIT requirements.

Year Ended December 31, 2001 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000

     Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled $257.6 million, a
decrease of $18.2 million over 2000 revenues. Excluding nursing home revenues of
owned and  operated  assets,  revenues  were  $89.5  million  for the year ended
December 31, 2001, a decrease of $10.8  million from the  comparable  prior year
period.

     Our rental  income for the year  ended  December  31,  2001  totaled  $61.2
million, a decrease of $6.1 million over 2000 rental income. The decrease is due
to  $6.3  million  from  reductions  in  lease  revenue  due  to   foreclosures,
bankruptcies,  restructurings and reserve for non-payment of certain leases, and
$1.8 million from reduced investments caused by 2000 and 2001 asset sales. These
decreases are offset by $1.3 million relating to contractual  increases in rents
that became  effective in 2001 as defined under the related  agreements and $0.7
million relating to assets previously classified as owned and operated.

     Our mortgage  interest  income for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled
$20.8 million,  decreasing $3.3 million over 2000 mortgage interest income.  The
decrease  is  due  to  $1.6  million  from   reductions  due  to   foreclosures,
bankruptcies,  restructurings  and reserve for non-payment of certain  mortgages
and $2.0 million from reduced  investments  caused by the payoffs of  mortgages.
These  decreases are partially  offset by $0.2 million  relating to  contractual
increases in interest income that became  effective in 2001 as defined under the
related agreements and $0.1 million relating to assets previously  classified as
owned and operated.

     Our nursing home  revenues of owned and operated  assets for the year ended
December  31, 2001 totaled  $168.1  million,  decreasing  $7.4 million over 2000
nursing home revenues. The decrease is due to the sale and re-leasing of certain
owned and operated assets during the year.

     Our expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled  $276.7  million,
decreasing approximately $58.7 million over expenses of $335.3 million for 2000.

     Our nursing home expenses for owned and operated assets decreased to $176.2
million from $179.0  million in 2000 due to the sale and  re-leasing  of certain
owned and  operated  assets  during the year.  In 2001,  nursing  home  expenses
included a $7.3 million provision for uncollectible accounts receivable versus a
$1.0 million provision for uncollectible accounts receivable in 2000.

     The 2001 provision for depreciation and amortization of real estate totaled
$22.1  million,  decreasing  $1.2  million  over 2000.  The  decrease  primarily
consists of $0.9 million  depreciation  expense for properties  sold or held for
sale and a reduction in amortization  of non-compete  agreements of $0.7 million
offset  by  $0.3  million  additional   depreciation   expense  from  properties
previously classified as mortgages and new investments placed in service in 2000
and 2001.

     Our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was approximately
$36.3 million, compared with $42.4 million for 2000. The decrease in 2001 is due
to both lower  average  interest  rates during the 2001 period and lower average
borrowings.

     Our general and  administrative  expenses for 2001 totaled $10.4 million as
compared to $6.4 million for 2000, an increase of $4.0 million.  The increase is
due  primarily to increased  consulting  costs related to the  foreclosures  and
lease restructures.

     Our legal  expenses  for 2001  totaled  $4.3  million as  compared  to $2.5
million in 2000. The increase is largely  attributable to legal costs associated
with operator bankruptcy filings and negotiations with our troubled operators.

     A provision  for  impairment  of $9.6  million is included in expenses  for
2001. This provision  included $8.3 million to reduce facilities  recovered from
operators and now  classified as held for sale assets to fair value less cost to
dispose, and $1.2 million related to other real estate assets our management has
determined is impaired.

     We  recognized  a  provision  for loss on  uncollectible  accounts  of $0.7
million in 2001,  adjusting  the carrying  value of accounts  receivable  to net
realizable  value.  In 2000, we recognized a provision for loss on mortgages and
notes receivable of $15.3 million,  adjusting the carrying value of mortgages to
the  estimated  value of their  collateral  and  notes  receivable  to their net
realizable value.

     We recorded a $10 million litigation settlement expense in 2001 to settle a
suit brought by Karrington Health, Inc. in 1998. This settled all claims arising
from the suit,  but without  our  admission  of any  liability  or fault,  which
liability is expressly denied.  Based on the settlement,  the suit was dismissed
with prejudice.

     In 2001,  we  recorded  a $5.1  million  charge for  severance,  moving and
consulting  agreement  costs.  This  charge was  comprised  of $4.6  million for
relocation of our corporate  headquarters  and $0.5 million for  consulting  and
severance  payments to our former Senior Vice President and General Counsel.  In
2000, we recognized a $4.7 million charge for severance and consulting  payments
to our former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer.

     We  recorded  a non-cash  charge of $1.3  million  for 2001  related to the
adoption of FASB Statement No. 133,  Accounting for Derivative  Instruments  and
Hedging  Activities,  which was required to be adopted in years  beginning after
June 15,  2000.  No such  charge was  recorded in 2000,  as we adopted  this new
statement effective January 1, 2001.

     During  2001,  we sold  certain  of our core  and  other  assets  realizing
proceeds of $3.9 million,  resulting in a loss of $0.7 million.  During 2000, we
completed  asset sales  yielding net proceeds of $34.7  million,  resulting in a
gain of $10.0 million.

     During 2001, we  repurchased  $27.5 million of our 6.95% Notes  maturing in
June 2002, recognizing a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $3.1 million.

     Our funds from  operations  for the year ended December 31, 2001 on a fully
diluted basis  totaled $4.3 million,  a decrease of $14.9 million as compared to
the $19.2 million for 2000 due to factors  mentioned above.  After adjusting for
the  non-recurring   provision  for  loss  on  mortgages,   notes  and  accounts
receivable,  severance and consulting  costs,  one-time revenue  adjustments and
legal settlement expense,  funds from operations for the year was $25.5 million,
a decrease of $8.9  million from the year ended  December  31, 2000.  Funds from
operations is net earnings available to common stockholders, excluding any gains
or losses from debt  restructuring and the effects of asset  dispositions,  plus
depreciation and amortization  associated with real estate investments.  Diluted
funds  from  operations  is the lower of funds  from  operations  and funds from
operations  adjusted for the assumed  conversion of Series C preferred stock and
Subordinated  Convertible  Debentures  and the  exercise of  in-the-money  stock
options.  We consider funds from operations to be one performance  measure which
is helpful to investors of real estate companies because,  along with cash flows
from operating  activities,  financing activities and investing  activities,  it
provides investors an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt and
to make expenditures.  Funds from operations in and of itself does not represent
cash generated from operating  activities in accordance with generally  accepted
accounting  principles and therefore  should not be considered an alternative to
net earnings as an indication of operating performance, or to net cash flow from
operating  activities as determined by generally accepted accounting  principles
in the  United  States,  as a  measure  of  liquidity  and  is  not  necessarily
indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.

     No provision  for federal  income taxes has been made since we qualify as a
REIT under the  provisions  of Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal  Revenue
Code of 1986,  as  amended.  Accordingly,  we have not been  subject  to federal
income taxes on amounts  distributed to stockholders,  as we have distributed at
least 95% of our REIT taxable  income for taxable years before 2001 and have met
certain other conditions.  In 2001, and future taxable years, we are required to
distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income.

Portfolio Developments

     The  partial  expiration  of certain  Medicare  rate  increases  has had an
adverse  impact on the revenues of the operators of nursing home  facilities and
has negatively  impacted some operators'  ability to satisfy their monthly lease
or debt payment to us. In several  instances we hold security  deposits that can
be  applied  in the  event of lease and loan  defaults,  subject  to  applicable
limitations  under bankruptcy law with respect to operators  seeking  protection
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy  Act. (See Item 1 - Business of the Company -
Overview).

     Alterra  Healthcare  Corporation.  On January 14, 2003, we were notified by
Alterra Healthcare Corporation ("Alterra") that it did not intend to pay January
rent and that a  restructuring  of its Master Lease was necessary.  We currently
lease eight assisted  living  facilities  (325 units) located in seven states to
subsidiaries  of  Alterra.  The Master  Lease  requires  annual rent for 2003 of
approximately  $3.2  million.  On January  14,  2003,  we  declared an "Event of
Default"  under  its  Master  Lease  and  demanded  payment  under  its  Alterra
guarantee.

     On January 22, 2003,  Alterra  announced  that, in order to facilitate  and
complete  its  on-going  restructuring  initiatives,  they had filed a voluntary
petition  with the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Court  for the  District  of  Delaware  to
reorganize  under  Chapter  11  of  the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code.  We  intend  to
aggressively  pursue all  avenues  afforded us in order to enforce the terms and
conditions under the lease.

     Integrated Health Services,  Inc. Integrated Health Services,  Inc. ("IHS")
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy  protection in February 2000. With the exception
of a small portion of prepetition interest (approximately $63,000), IHS paid its
contractual  mortgage interest from its bankruptcy filing in February 2000 until
October  2001. In November  2001,  IHS informed us that it did not intend to pay
future rent and mortgage  interest  due. In January,  2002,  IHS resumed  making
payments to us. Revenue has been recorded as payments were received. At December
31, 2002, we held three  mortgages on  properties  owned by IHS: a $35.6 million
mortgage  collateralized  by six facilities  located in Florida and Texas; a $12
million mortgage collateralized by two facilities located in Georgia; and a $4.9
million  mortgage  collateralized  by one  facility  located in Florida.  Annual
contractual  interest  income on each of the  mortgages is  approximately  $4.11
million,  $1.28 million and $0.55  million,  respectively.  We also have a lease
with IHS for one property in the state of Washington, representing an investment
of $10.0  million  and  annualized  contractual  revenue of $1.49  million.  IHS
rejected this lease on November 9, 2001.

     In December 2002, an agreement was approved by the United States Bankruptcy
Court in Wilmington,  Delaware  between IHS and us, whereby upon notice provided
by us, IHS will convey  ownership of eight skilled nursing  facilities  (five in
Florida, two in Georgia, and one in Texas) to one of our affiliates and transfer
the operations to our designee.  Current appraisals of the properties underlying
the $12.0 million and $35.6 million  mortgage  loans indicate  collateral  value
supporting our mortgage loan balances.  Accordingly,  we do not expect to record
any  reserves  relative  to these  loans at this  time.  The  amount of the $4.9
million mortgage has been fully reserved.

     On February 1, 2003, we entered into a Master Lease,  to re-lease a 130-bed
Texas facility,  formerly  operated by IHS, with Senior  Management  Services of
Treemont,  Inc.  The  initial  term is ten years with rent  culminating  at $0.4
million  annually  by the  end of  the  third  year.  We are in the  process  of
negotiating lease  arrangements on each of the remaining seven properties.  (See
Note 19 - Subsequent Events to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

     Lyric  Healthcare  LLC. We entered into a forbearance  agreement with Lyric
Healthcare LLC ("Lyric")  through August 31, 2001,  whereby we received $541,266
of the $0.9 million  monthly rent due under the Lyric  leases  through  November
2001.  On November 7, 2001, we were notified by Lyric that we would no longer be
receiving  payments.  In January,  2002,  Lyric resumed  making  payments to us.
Revenue has been  recorded  as  received.  Our  original  investment  in the ten
facilities covered under the lease is $95.4 million.

     Effective  January 1, 2003, we completed a  restructured  transaction  with
Claremont Health Care Holdings,  Inc.  (formerly Lyric Health Care, LLC) whereby
nine  facilities  formerly leased under two Master Leases were combined into one
new ten year Master Lease. Annual rent under the new lease is $6.0 million,  the
same  amount of rent  recognized  in 2002 for these  properties.  As part of the
restructure,  one  facility  located  in  Sarasota,  Florida  was  closed and is
currently  being  marketed for sale. As a result of this closure,  we recorded a
non-cash impairment of approximately $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.
In  anticipation  of  this  restructure,  on  November  1,  2002,  Trans  Health
Management  replaced  IHS as manager of these  nine  properties.  (See Note 19 -
Subsequent Events to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

     Mariner and  Professional  Healthcare  Settlement.  Effective  September 1,
2001,  we  entered  into a  comprehensive  settlement  with  Mariner  Post-Acute
Network,  Inc. ("Mariner") resolving all outstanding issues relating to our loan
to Professional  Healthcare  Management Inc. ("PHCM"),  a subsidiary of Mariner.
Pursuant to the  settlement,  the PHCM loan is secured by a first mortgage on 12
skilled  nursing  facilities  owned by PHCM  with  1,679  operating  beds.  PHCM
remained obligated on the total outstanding loan balance as of January 18, 2000,
the date Mariner filed for protection  under Chapter 11 of the  Bankruptcy  Act,
and paid us our accrued interest at a rate of  approximately  11% for the period
from the filing date until September 1, 2001.  Monthly payments with interest at
the rate of 11.57% per annum resumed October 1, 2001.

     On February 1, 2001, four Michigan facilities,  previously operated by PHCM
and subject to our  pre-petition  mortgage,  were  transferred  by PHCM to Ciena
Health Care  Management  ("Ciena") who paid for the facilities by execution of a
promissory note that was assigned to us. PHCM was given a $4.5 million credit on
February 1, 2001 and an additional  $3.5 million credit as of September 1, 2001,
both  against  the PHCM loan  balance  in  exchange  for the  assignment  of the
promissory  note to us. The $8.7 million balance of the promissory  note,  which
was secured by a first mortgage on the four facilities,  was paid in full during
2002.

     Following  the closing  under the  settlement  agreement,  the  outstanding
principal balance on the PHCM loan is approximately $59.7 million. The PHCM loan
term is nine  years,  with PHCM  having the  option to extend for an  additional
eleven  years.  PHCM has the option to prepay the PHCM loan between  February 1,
2005 and July 31, 2005.

     Sun Healthcare  Group, Inc. On February 4, 2003, Sun Healthcare Group, Inc.
("Sun")  remitted  rent of $1.6 million  versus the  contractual  amount of $2.1
million.  We have agreed with Sun to use a letter of credit  (posted by Sun as a
security  deposit) in the amount of $0.5  million to make up the  difference  in
rent and agreed to  temporarily  forebear in declaring a default under the lease
caused by Sun's failure to restore the $0.5 million letter of credit. The letter
of credit was otherwise expiring on February 28, 2003 and was not being renewed.
We hold additional security deposits (in the form of cash and letters of credit)
of $2.3 million.

     On February 7, 2003, Sun announced  "that it has opened  dialogue with many
of its  landlords  concerning  the  portfolio  of  properties  leased to Sun and
various of its  consolidated  subsidiaries  (collectively,  the `Company').  The
Company is seeking a rent  moratorium  and/or rent  concessions  with respect to
certain of its facilities and is seeking to transition its operations of certain
facilities  to new  operators  while  retaining  others."  To this end,  Sun has
initiated  conversations  with us regarding a restructure of our lease.  At this
stage, it is too early to predict the outcome of those conversations.  (See Note
19 - Subsequent Events to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

     As of December 31, 2002, we have an original  investment  balance of $219.0
million  relating to the Sun  portfolio  under  agreements  providing for annual
rental income of $25.1 million in 2002 and $25.7 million in 2003.

     Other  Operators.  In April 2001, we were informed by TLC Healthcare,  Inc.
("TLC")  that  it  could  no  longer  meet  its  payroll  and  other   operating
obligations.  We had leases and mortgages with TLC representing eight properties
with 1,049 beds and an initial investment of $27.5 million.  As a result of this
action,  one  facility in Texas with an initial  investment  of $2.5 million was
leased  to a new  operator,  Lamar  Healthcare,  Inc.  and  four  properties  in
Illinois,  Indiana and Ohio, with an initial  investment of $13.5 million,  were
taken back and placed under management  agreements.  Two of these properties are
currently  operated  for our own account and  classified  as owned and  operated
assets.  The other  two  properties  were  leased to  Hickory  Creek  Healthcare
Foundation,  Inc. on August 1, 2002. The remaining three properties,  located in
Texas,  were closed.  These three  facilities were classified as assets held for
sale and were reduced to their fair value,  less cost of disposal.  Two of these
properties  were sold in December of 2001.  The  remaining  property was sold in
June, 2002 generating a loss on sale of $0.25 million. Amounts due from TLC that
were not collected were written off as uncollectible during 2001.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     At December 31, 2002, we had total assets of $802.6 million,  stockholders'
equity of $479.7  million and  long-term  debt of $306.5  million,  representing
approximately  39.0% of total  capitalization.  In addition,  as of December 31,
2002, we had an aggregate of $113.1 million of outstanding debt which matures in
2003, including $112.0 million on our $160.0 million credit facility.

 Bank Credit Agreements

     We have two secured  revolving  credit  facilities,  providing up to $225.0
million of financing.  At December 31, 2002,  $177.0 million was outstanding and
$12.5  million  was  utilized  for the  issuance  of letters of credit,  leaving
availability of $35.5 million.

     On December 21, 2001, we reached  amended  agreements  with the bank groups
under both of our revolving credit  facilities.  The amendments became effective
as of the  closing of the rights  offering  and  private  placement  to Explorer
Holdings,  L.P. on February  21, 2002.  The  amendments  included  modifications
and/or eliminations to certain financial covenants.

     The  amendment  regarding  our $175.0  million  revolving  credit  facility
included a one-year extension in maturity from December 31, 2002 to December 31,
2003 and a  reduction  in the total  commitment  from  $175.0  million to $160.0
million.  Borrowings bear interest at 2.5% to 3.25% over LIBOR through  December
31, 2002 and 3.00% to 3.25% over LIBOR after  December  31,  2002,  based on our
leverage  ratio.  Borrowings of $112.0  million are  outstanding at December 31,
2002.  Additionally,  $12.5 million of letters of credit are outstanding against
this  credit  facility  at  December  31,  2002.  These  letters  of credit  are
collateral  for  certain  long-term  borrowings  and  collateral  for  insurance
programs  associated  with  certain  owned  and  operated  assets.   LIBOR-based
borrowings under this facility bear interest at a weighted-average rate of 4.42%
at December  31, 2002 and 5.49% at December  31,  2001.  Cost for the letters of
credit  range  from 2.5% to 3.25%,  based on our  leverage  ratio.  Real  estate
investments with a gross book value of approximately  $239.0 million are pledged
as collateral for this revolving line of credit facility at December 31, 2002.

     As part of the  amendment  regarding  our $75.0  million  revolving  credit
facility,  we prepaid $10.0 million in December  2001,  originally  scheduled to
mature  in  March  2002.  This  voluntary  prepayment  resulted  in a  permanent
reduction in the total commitment, thereby reducing the credit facility to $65.0
million.  Our $65.0  million line of credit  facility  expires on June 30, 2005.
Borrowings  under the facility bear interest at 2.5% to 3.75% over LIBOR,  based
on our leverage ratio and collateral  assigned.  Borrowings of $65.0 million are
outstanding  at December 31, 2002.  LIBOR-based  borrowings  under this facility
bear interest at a weighted-average rate of 4.66% at December 31, 2002 and 5.65%
at  December  31,  2001.  Real  estate  investments  with a gross  book value of
approximately  $117.1  million are pledged as collateral for this revolving line
of credit facility at December 31, 2002.

     We are required to meet certain financial  covenants,  including prescribed
leverage and interest coverage ratios on our long-term  borrowings.  We are also
required to fix a certain portion of our interest rate. We utilize interest rate
caps to fix interest rates on variable rate debt and reduce certain exposures to
interest rate  fluctuations  (See Note 8 - Financial  Instruments to our audited
Consolidated Financial Statements).

     Dividends.  In order to qualify as a REIT,  we are  required to  distribute
dividends  (other than capital gain dividends) to our  stockholders in an amount
at least equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our "REIT taxable income"  (computed
without  regard to the  dividends  paid  deduction and our net capital gain) and
(ii) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus
(B) the sum of certain items of non-cash income.  In addition,  if we dispose of
any built-in  gain asset  during a  recognition  period,  we will be required to
distribute at least 90% of the built-in gain (after tax), if any,  recognized on
the disposition of such asset.  Such  distributions  must be paid in the taxable
year to which they relate,  or in the following  taxable year if declared before
we timely  file our tax  return  for such  year and paid on or before  the first
regular dividend payment after such declaration. In addition, such distributions
are required to be made pro rata,  with no  preference  to any share of stock as
compared  with other  shares of the same class,  and with no  preference  to one
class of stock as compared  with  another  class  except to the extent that such
class is entitled to such a preference.  To the extent that we do not distribute
all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of
our "REIT  taxable  income," as  adjusted,  we will be subject to tax thereon at
regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates.

     On  February  1,  2001,  we  announced  the  suspension  of all  common and
preferred  dividends.  Prior to  recommencing  the payment of  dividends  on our
common  stock,  all  accrued  and  unpaid  dividends  on our  Series  A, B and C
preferred stock must be paid in full. We have made sufficient  distributions  to
satisfy the distribution  requirements under the REIT rules to maintain our REIT
status for 2001. For tax year 2002, we are projecting a tax loss; therefore,  we
anticipate  no  distribution  will be  required  to satisfy the 2002 REIT rules.
However,   if  we  have  taxable  income,   we  intend  to  make  the  necessary
distributions to satisfy the 2002 REIT requirements.  The accumulated and unpaid
dividends  relating to all series of preferred  stocks total $40.0 million as of
December 31, 2002. In aggregate,  preferred  dividends continue to accumulate at
approximately $5.0 million per quarter.

     No common cash  dividends  were paid during 2002 and 2001.  Cash  dividends
paid totaled $1.00 per common share for 2000. The dividend payout ratio, that is
the ratio of per common  share  amounts  for  dividends  paid to the diluted per
common share amounts of funds from operations,  was approximately 238% for 2000.
Excluding the provision for loss on mortgages and notes receivable and severance
and  consulting  agreement  costs,  the  dividend  payout  ratio  for  2000  was
approximately  73.0%.  We can give no assurance  as to when or if the  dividends
will be reinstated on the preferred  stock or common stock, or the amount of the
dividends if and when such payments are recommenced.

     On March 30, 2001,  we exercised  our option to pay the accrued  $4,666,667
Series C dividend  from  November  15, 2000 and the  associated  deferral fee by
issuing 48,420 Series C preferred shares to Explorer Holdings,  L.P. on April 2,
2001, which are convertible into 774,720 shares of our common stock at $6.25 per
share.  Such  election  resulted  in an increase  in the  aggregate  liquidation
preference  of Series C  preferred  stock as of April 2,  2001 to  $104,842,000.
Dividends paid in stock to a specific class of stockholders, such as our payment
of our Series C preferred stock in April 2001, constitute dividends eligible for
the 2001 dividends paid deduction.

     Since  dividends on the Series A and Series B preferred  stock have been in
arrears  for more than 18  months,  the  holders  of the  Series A and  Series B
preferred  stock (voting  together as a single class) continue to have the right
to elect two additional  directors to our Board of Directors in accordance  with
the terms of the Series A and Series B preferred stock and our Bylaws. Explorer,
the sole holder of the Series C preferred stock, also has the right to elect two
other  additional  directors to our Board of Directors  in  accordance  with the
terms of the Series C preferred stock and our Bylaws. Explorer,  without waiving
its rights under the terms of the Series C preferred  stock or the  Stockholders
Agreement,  has advised us that it is not currently  seeking the election of the
two additional  directors  resulting from the Series C dividend arrearage unless
the  holders  of the  Series  A and  Series  B  preferred  stock  seek to  elect
additional directors.

     The table below sets forth information  regarding  arrearages in payment of
preferred stock dividends:

     Liquidity.  We believe  our  liquidity  and  various  sources of  available
capital,  including funds from operations,  expected proceeds from planned asset
sales and our ability to negotiate  an extension of our current debt  maturities
are adequate to finance operations, meet recurring debt service requirements and
fund  future  investments  through the next  twelve  months.  As a result of the
October 1, 2002 Medicare  rate  reductions  and potential  reductions in certain
state Medicaid reimbursements,  refinancing our current debt maturity has become
more difficult. We continue to actively pursue refinancing alternatives in order
to extend current debt  maturities and provide  greater  financial  flexibility.
Among other  things,  we will  continue  discussions  to extend or refinance our
$160.0 million credit facility,  currently scheduled to mature in December 2003.
At this time, there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach acceptable
agreements  with our bank lenders  and/or other  capital  sources to achieve the
desired refinancing, or the terms of any such refinancing.

Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

     We are  exposed to various  market  risks,  including  the  potential  loss
arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We do not enter into derivatives
or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes,  but we seek
to mitigate the effects of  fluctuations  in interest rates by matching the term
of new  investments  with new  long-term  fixed  rate  borrowing  to the  extent
possible.

     The market value of our long-term  fixed rate  borrowings and mortgages are
subject to  interest  rate  risks.  Generally,  the  market  value of fixed rate
financial  instruments  will  decrease  as interest  rates rise and  increase as
interest rates fall. The estimated fair value of our total long-term  borrowings
at December  31,  2002 was $119.7  million.  A one percent  increase in interest
rates would  result in a decrease in the fair value of long-term  borrowings  by
approximately $4.3 million.

     We are subject to risks associated with debt or preferred equity financing,
including the risk that existing  indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the
terms of such  refinancing  may not be as  favorable  as the  terms  of  current
indebtedness.  If we were unable to refinance our debt  maturities on acceptable
terms,  we might be forced to dispose of  properties on  disadvantageous  terms,
which might result in losses to us and might adversely affect the cash available
for distribution to  stockholders,  or to pursue dilutive equity  financing.  If
interest rates or other factors at the time of the refinancing  result in higher
interest rates upon  refinancing,  our interest  expense would  increase,  which
might affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

     We utilize  interest rate swaps and caps to fix interest  rates on variable
rate debt and reduce certain exposures to interest rate fluctuations.  We do not
use  derivatives for trading or speculative  purposes.  We have a policy of only
entering  into  contracts  with major  financial  institutions  based upon their
credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying
and offsetting  exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, we have not
sustained  a  material  loss from those  instruments  nor do we  anticipate  any
material  adverse  effect on our net income or financial  position in the future
from the use of derivatives.

     To manage  interest rate risk, we may employ  options,  forwards,  interest
rate swaps, caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying
exposure. We may employ swaps, forwards or purchased options to hedge qualifying
forecasted  transactions.  Gains and losses  related to these  transactions  are
deferred and recognized in net income as interest  expense in the same period or
periods  that  the  underlying  transaction  occurs,  expires  or  is  otherwise
terminated.  In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued
Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
which was  required to be adopted in years  beginning  after June 15,  2000.  We
adopted the new Statement  effective January 1, 2001. The Statement  requires us
to recognize all  derivatives  on the balance  sheet at fair value.  Derivatives
that are not hedges  must be  adjusted  to fair  value  through  income.  If the
derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair
value of  derivatives  will either be offset against the change in fair value of
the  hedged  assets,  liabilities,  or  firm  commitments  through  earnings  or
recognized in other  comprehensive  income until the hedge item is recognized in
earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be
immediately recognized in earnings.

     In September 2002, we entered into a 61-month, $200.0 million interest rate
cap with a strike of 3.50% that has been designated as a cash flow hedge.  Under
the terms of the cap agreement,  when LIBOR exceeds 3.50%, the counterparty will
pay us $200.0 million multiplied by the difference between LIBOR and 3.50% times
the number of days when LIBOR exceeds  3.50%.  The  unrealized  gain/loss in the
fair  value  of  cash  flow  hedges  are  reported  on the  balance  sheet  with
corresponding adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income. On December
31, 2002, the $200.0 million interest rate cap was reported at its fair value as
an  Other  Asset  of $7.3  million.  An  adjustment  of $2.9  million  to  Other
Comprehensive  Income  was made for the  change in fair value of this cap during
2002.  Over the next twelve months,  $0.1 million is expected to be reclassified
to earnings from Other Comprehensive Income.

     As of September  2002, we terminated  two interest rate swaps with notional
amounts of $32.0  million  each.  Under the terms of the first  swap  agreement,
which would have  expired in December  2002,  we  received  payments  when LIBOR
exceeded 6.35% and paid the  counterparty  when LIBOR was less than 6.35%.  This
interest  rate swap was extended in December 2001 to December 2002 at the option
of the  counterparty  and therefore did not qualify for hedge  accounting  under
FASB No. 133.  The fair value of this swap at December 31, 2002 and December 31,
2001 was $0 and $1.3 million, respectively.

     Under the second swap agreement, which was scheduled to expire December 31,
2002, we received  payments when LIBOR exceeded 4.89% and paid the  counterparty
when LIBOR was less than  4.89%.  The fair value of this  interest  rate swap at
December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 was a liability of $0 and $0.8  million,
respectively.   The  change  in  fair  value  in  2001  was  included  in  Other
Comprehensive  Income as required  under FASB No. 133 for fully  effective  cash
flow hedges.

     The fair  values of these  interest  rate  swaps were  included  in accrued
expenses and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31,
2001.

Report of Independent Auditors

Board of Directors
Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.


     We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of Omega
Healthcare  Investors,  Inc. and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
and the related consolidated statements of operations,  stockholders' equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31, 2002.
Our audit also included the financial  statement  schedules  listed in the Index
under  Item  15  (a).   These   financial   statements  and  schedules  are  the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in  all  material  respects,   the  consolidated  financial  position  of  Omega
Healthcare  Investors,  Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and
the  consolidated  results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period  ended  December  31,  2002,  in  conformity  with
accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United  States.  Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedules,  when considered in relation
to the  basic  financial  statements  taken as a whole,  present  fairly  in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

                        OMEGA HEALTHCARE INVESTORS, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization

     Omega   Healthcare   Investors,   Inc.,  a  Maryland   corporation,   is  a
self-administered  real estate investment trust ("REIT").  From the date that we
commenced  operations  in 1992,  we have  invested  primarily in long-term  care
facilities,   which  include  nursing  homes,  assisted  living  facilities  and
rehabilitation   hospitals.   Our  company  currently  has  investments  in  222
healthcare facilities located in the United States.

Consolidation

     The consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of our company
and our wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of all material intercompany
accounts and transactions. Due to changes in the market conditions affecting the
long-term care industry, we have begun to operate a portfolio of our foreclosure
assets for our own account until such time as these  facilities'  operations are
stabilized  and are  re-leasable or saleable at lease rates or sales prices that
maximize  the value of these  assets to us. As a result,  these  facilities  and
their  respective  operations  are  presented  on a  consolidated  basis  in our
financial statements.

Real Estate Investments

     Investments  in  leased  real  estate  properties  and  mortgage  notes are
recorded at cost and original  mortgage  amount,  respectively.  The cost of the
properties acquired is allocated between land and buildings based generally upon
independent   appraisals.   Depreciation   for  buildings  is  recorded  on  the
straight-line  basis,  using estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 39 years.
Leasehold interests are amortized over the initial term of the lease, with lives
ranging from four to seven years.

Owned and Operated Assets and Assets Held for Sale

     When we acquire real estate  pursuant to a  foreclosure  proceeding,  it is
designated  as "owned and operated  assets" and is recorded at the lower of cost
or fair value and is  included  in real estate  properties  on our  Consolidated
Balance  Sheet.  Operating  assets and operating  liabilities  for the owned and
operated properties are shown separately on the face of our Consolidated Balance
Sheet and are detailed in Note 16--Segment Information.

     When a formal  plan to sell real  estate is adopted  and we hold a contract
for sale,  the real estate is classified as "assets held for sale," with the net
carrying amount adjusted to the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less cost
of disposal.  Depreciation of the facilities is excluded from  operations  after
management has committed to a plan to sell the asset. Upon adoption of Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") 144 as of January 1, 2002, long-lived assets
sold or  designated  as held for sale  after  January  1, 2002 are  reported  as
discontinued operations in our financial statements.

Impairment of Assets

     We  periodically  evaluate  our  real  estate  investments  for  impairment
indicators.  The judgment  regarding the existence of impairment  indicators are
based on  factors  such as market  conditions,  operator  performance  and legal
structure.  If indicators of  impairment  are present,  we evaluate the carrying
value of the  related  real estate  investments  in  relationship  to the future
undiscounted cash flows of the underlying facilities.  Provisions for impairment
losses  related to long-lived  assets are recognized  when expected  future cash
flows  are less  than  the  carrying  values  of the  assets.  If the sum of the
expected  future cash flow,  including  sales  proceeds,  is less than  carrying
value,  we then adjust the net  carrying  value of leased  properties  and other
long-lived assets to the present value of expected future cash flows.

     Upon  adoption  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, as of January 1,
2002,  long-lived  assets sold or  designated  as held for sale after January 1,
2002 are  reported  as  discontinued  operations  in our  financial  statements.
Properties  sold in 2002  were  classified  as  assets  held  for  sale in 2001.
Accordingly,  they are subject to FASB 121,  Accounting  for the  Impairment  of
Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed  and have not been
reported as discontinued operations in our financial statements.

Loan Impairment Policy

     When management identifies an indication of potential loan impairment, such
as  non-payment  under  the  loan  documents  or  impairment  of the  underlying
collateral, the loan is written down to the present value of the expected future
cash flows. In cases where expected  future cash flows cannot be estimated,  the
loan is written down to the fair value of the collateral.

Cash Equivalents

     Cash equivalents  consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity date
of three months or less when  purchased.  These  investments are stated at cost,
which approximates fair value.

Derivative Instruments

     Effective  January 1, 2001, we adopted the Financial  Accounting  Standards
Board  Statement No. 133,  Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging
Activities,  as amended,  which requires that all  derivatives are recognized on
the  balance  sheet  at fair  value.  Derivatives  that are not  hedges  must be
adjusted to fair value through income.  If the derivative is a hedge,  depending
on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will either
be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or
firm commitments  through earnings or recognized in other  comprehensive  income
until the hedge item is recognized  in earnings.  The  ineffective  portion of a
derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.

Accounts Receivable

     Accounts  receivable  consists  primarily  of lease and  mortgage  interest
payments.  Amounts  recorded  include  estimated  provisions for loss related to
uncollectible  accounts and disputed  items.  On a monthly basis,  we review the
contractual  payment  versus  actual cash payment  received and the  contractual
payment  due  date  versus  actual  receipt  date.  When  management  identifies
delinquencies, a judgment is made as to the amount of provision, if any, that is
needed.  A provision  of $0.3  million and $0.7 million was recorded in 2002 and
2001, respectively. No other activity has occurred during the periods presented.

Accounts Receivable - Owned and Operated Assets

     Accounts  receivable from owned and operated Assets consists of amounts due
from Medicare and Medicaid  programs,  other government  programs,  managed care
health plans,  commercial insurance companies and individual  patients.  Amounts
recorded include estimated provisions for loss related to uncollectible accounts
and disputed  items. A provision of $5.9 million,  $7.3 million and $1.0 million
was recorded in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Investments in Equity Securities

     Marketable securities held as  available-for-sale  are stated at fair value
with  unrealized  gains and losses for the  securities  reported in  accumulated
other  comprehensive  income.  Realized  gains and losses and  declines in value
judged to be  other-than-temporary  on securities held as available-for-sale are
included  in  investment  income.  The cost of  securities  sold is based on the
specific   identification   method.   Interest  and   dividends  on   securities
available-for-sale are included in investment income.

Deferred Financing Costs

     Deferred  financing costs are amortized on a  straight-line  basis over the
terms of the related  borrowings.  Amortization of financing costs totaling $2.8
million, $2.5 million and $1.9 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively,  is
classified as interest  expense in our  Consolidated  Statements of  Operations.
Amounts paid for financings  that are not  ultimately  completed are expensed at
the time the determination is made that such financings are not viable. In 2002,
$7.0 million of such costs were  expensed  and were  classified  as  refinancing
expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Non-Compete Agreements and Goodwill

     Non-compete  agreements and the excess of the purchase price over the value
of  tangible  net  assets   acquired   (i.e.,   goodwill)  are  amortized  on  a
straight-line  basis over  periods  ranging  from five to ten years.  Due to the
diminished value of the related real estate assets,  management  determined that
the goodwill was entirely impaired and wrote off the balance of $2.36 million in
2000.

Revenue Recognition

     Rental income and mortgage  interest  income are  recognized as earned over
the terms of the related Master Leases and mortgage  notes,  respectively.  Such
income includes periodic increases based on pre-determined  formulas (i.e., such
as  increases  in the  Consumer  Price  Index  ("CPI")) as defined in the Master
Leases and mortgage loan agreements.  Reserves are taken against earned revenues
from leases and mortgages when collection of amounts due become  questionable or
when  negotiations  for  restructurings  of  troubled  operators  lead to  lower
expectations regarding ultimate collection.  When collection is uncertain, lease
revenues  are recorded as received,  after  taking into account  application  of
security  deposits.  Interest income on impaired mortgage loans is recognized as
received after taking into account application of security deposits.

     Nursing home revenues from owned and operated assets  (primarily  Medicare,
Medicaid and other third party insurance) are recognized as patient services are
provided.

Federal and State Income Taxes

     As a qualified  REIT, we will not be subject to Federal income taxes on our
income, and no provisions for Federal income taxes have been made. To the extent
that we have  foreclosure  income from our owned and  operated  assets,  we will
incur  federal tax at a rate of 35%. To date our owned and operated  assets have
generated  losses,  and  therefore,  no  provision  for  federal  income  tax is
necessary.  The reported  amounts of our assets as of December 31, 2002 are less
than the tax basis of assets by approximately $32.1 million.

Stock Based Compensation

     Our  company  grants  stock  options to  employees  and  directors  with an
exercise  price  equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of the grant.
In accordance  with the  provisions of APB Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock
Issued to  Employees,  compensation  expense is not  recognized  for these stock
option grants.

     Expense  related to Dividend  Equivalent  Rights is recognized as dividends
are declared, based on anticipated vesting.

Accounting Estimates

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities,  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Effects of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

     In April 2002, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued  Statement
No.145:  Rescission  of FASB  Statements  No. 4, 44, and 64,  Amendment  of FASB
Statement No. 13, and  Technical  Corrections  which is generally  effective for
fiscal years  beginning  after May 15, 2002 and  requires  that gains and losses
from the  extinguishment of debt will no longer be presented as an extraordinary
item  in our  consolidated  statement  of  operations.  Upon  adoption  of  this
statement  for  calendar  year 2003,  any such gains or losses  arising from the
extinguishment of debt will be included in income from continuing operations and
the effects of  extinguishments in prior periods will be reclassified to conform
to the  prescribed  presentation.  The adoption of this  statement  will have no
effect  on  future  or  previously  reported  net  income  or loss or  financial
position.

Risks and Uncertainties

     Our company is subject to certain  risks and  uncertainties  affecting  the
healthcare industry as a result of healthcare legislation and growing regulation
by federal, state and local governments.  Additionally,  we are subject to risks
and  uncertainties  as a result of changes  affecting  operators of nursing home
facilities due to the actions of governmental agencies and insurers to limit the
growth in cost of healthcare services. (See Note 5 - Concentration of Risk).

NOTE 2 - PROPERTIES

Leased Property

     Our leased  real  estate  properties,  represented  by 146  long-term  care
facilities  and two  rehabilitation  hospitals at December 31, 2002,  are leased
under  provisions of Master Leases with initial terms typically  ranging from 10
to 16 years,  plus  renewal  options.  Substantially  all of the  Master  Leases
provide for minimum annual rentals which are subject to annual  increases  based
upon  increases  in the  Consumer  Price Index or  increases  in revenues of the
underlying  properties,  with  certain  maximum  limits.  Under the terms of the
leases,  the  lessee is  responsible  for all  maintenance,  repairs,  taxes and
insurance on the leased properties.

     A summary of our investment in leased real estate properties is as follows:

     Below is a summary of the lease transactions which occurred in 2002.

     During  the first  quarter  of 2002,  we leased 13  properties,  previously
classified  as owned and  operated  assets,  to new  operators.  We entered into
agreements to lease four Arizona  facilities to  subsidiaries  of Infinia Health
Care Companies  ("Infinia") and to sublease four other Arizona facilities to the
same party.  The terms for the four Arizona  leases and four  subleases  are ten
years and three years,  respectively,  with an initial  combined annual net rent
payment  of $1.02  million.  On March 1,  2002,  we leased  four  facilities  in
Massachusetts to subsidiaries of Harborside Healthcare Corporation.  The initial
lease term for the four  properties  is ten years with an  initial  annual  rent
payment of $1.675 million.  We leased one additional  facility on March 1, 2002,
for an initial annual rent of $0.38 million.  Additionally, on February 1, 2002,
the leasehold interest in one facility was terminated by the landlord.

     During the second quarter of 2002, we leased three  properties,  previously
classified  as owned  and  operated  assets,  to a new  operator,  Conifer  Care
Communities. The initial term for the Master Lease is for 56 months and includes
three  options  to renew for four  years  each.  The  initial  base rent is four
percent of gross revenues or  approximately  $0.4 million annually for the first
two years.  After the second  year,  the rent  increases by the greater of three
percent of the previous year's revenue or to an annual minimum of $0.4 million.

     During the third  quarter of 2002,  we leased  two  properties,  previously
classified as owned and operated assets, to Hickory Creek Healthcare Foundation,
Inc.  The  initial  term for the Master  Lease is for ten years and  includes an
option to renew for an  additional  ten years.  The initial  annual base rent is
$0.4  million.  Additionally,  we closed three  buildings  that were  previously
leased to USA Healthcare, Inc. under a Master Lease and recorded a provision for
impairment  of $1.9  million.  The Master  Lease was amended to remove the three
buildings  with no  reduction in rental  income.  We intend to sell these closed
facilities as soon as practicable; however, there can be no assurance if or when
these sales will be completed.

     During the fourth  quarter of 2002,  we leased two  facilities,  previously
classified  as owned and  operated  assets,  to two separate  limited  liability
companies for initial  annual rent of $0.54 million and  sub-leased one facility
to another limited liability  company for  approximately  $0.15 million per year
less than our rental obligation.  However,  if we are still the tenant under the
prime lease after year one, then the annual  rental  payment under the other two
leases  permanently  increases  $40,000 per annum  beginning in the second lease
year.  Also in the fourth  quarter of 2002,  we entered into an agreement to buy
out the leasehold  interest in two owned and operated assets in Colorado subject
to a change of ownership  and  licensure.  This transfer is expected to close in
March 2003.

     As a  result  of our  2002  re-leasing  efforts,  our  owned  and  operated
portfolio  has  decreased  from 33 at December 31, 2001 to three at December 31,
2002. (See Note 19-Subsequent Events).

Owned and Operated Assets

     Our owned and operated real estate  assets  include  three  long-term  care
facilities at December 31, 2002,  of which two are owned  directly by us and one
is subject to a leasehold interest. There were 33 owned and operated real estate
assets at December 31, 2001 (21 owned and 12 subject to leasehold interests) and
69 owned and operated real estate  properties at December 31, 2000 (57 owned and
12  subject  to  leasehold  interests).  Impairment  charges  of  $3.0  million,
including $2.0 million for a property that was sold,  were taken on these assets
for the year ended  December  31, 2002.  Impairment  charges of $1.3 million and
$41.3  million  were taken on these assets  during the years ended  December 31,
2001 and 2000,  respectively.

     A  summary  of our  investment  in the two and 21 owned and  operated  real
estate assets at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, is as follows:

Closed Facilities

     At  December  31,  2002,  there are eight  closed  properties  that are not
currently  under  contract for sale. We recorded a $12.4  million  provision for
impairment  on these  facilities  for the year ended  December 31,  2002.  These
properties  are included in real estate in our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  A

Assets Sold or Held For Sale

     In 2000,  management  initiated  a plan to dispose  of  certain  properties
judged to have limited long-term potential and to re-deploy the proceeds.

     During 2000, we recorded a $14.4 million  provision for impairment  related
to assets held for sale and  reclassified  $24.3 million of assets held for sale
to  "owned  and  operated  assets"  as the  timing  and  strategy  for  sale or,
alternatively, re-leasing were revised in light of prevailing market conditions.
During 2000, we realized disposition proceeds of $1.1 million on assets held for
sale. Additionally,  we received proceeds of $34.7 million from sales of certain
core and other assets, resulting in a gain of $9.9 million.

     During  2001,  we recorded a provision of $8.3  million for  impairment  of
assets transferred to assets held for sale. We realized  disposition proceeds of
$1.4 million during 2001.

     During  2002,  we  realized  gross  disposition  proceeds  of $1.7  million
associated  with  the  sale of two  facilities  and  miscellaneous  beds.  These
facilities  were classified as assets held for sale in 2001.  Accordingly,  they
are subject to FASB 121,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
for Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed and have not been reported as discontinued
operations in our financial statements. Additionally, we received gross proceeds
of $16.4 million from sales of certain  other assets,  resulting in gain of $2.6
million.

                                                     ========================

     Mortgage  notes  receivable  relate to 63 long-term  care  facilities.  The
mortgage notes are secured by first mortgage liens on the borrowers'  underlying
real estate and personal  property.  The  mortgage  notes  receivable  relate to
facilities located in 11 states, operated by 12 independent healthcare operating
companies.

     We monitor  compliance  with  mortgages and when  necessary  have initiated
collection,   foreclosure  and  other   proceedings   with  respect  to  certain
outstanding loans.

     In 2001, two  facilities,  which were to be sold, were given back to us and
re-leased.  Based on  provisions  of the new  lease,  the  initial  reserve  for
uncollectible  loans of $3.7  million  taken prior to 2001 was reversed in 2001.
Additionally,  we determined that a mortgage loan was impaired and we recorded a
reserve for uncollectible  loans of $3.7 million to reduce the carrying value of
the mortgage loan to its net realizable value. Income recognized on the loan was
$0.5 million and $0.6 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     During 2002,  we determined  two mortgages  were impaired and we recorded a
reserve for uncollectible  loans of $4.9 million to reduce the carrying value of
the mortgage loans to the estimated  value of their related  collateral.  Income
recognized  on these loans was $0.6  million,  $0.8  million and $1.0 million in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     The following are the three primary  mortgage  structures that we currently
use:

     Convertible  Participating Mortgages are secured by first mortgage liens on
the  underlying  real estate and personal  property of the  mortgagor.  Interest
rates are usually subject to annual increases based upon increases in the CPI or
increases in revenues of the underlying long-term care facilities,  with certain
maximum  limits.  Convertible  Participating  Mortgages  afford  us an option to
convert the mortgage into direct ownership of the property, generally at a point
six to nine years from  inception;  they are then  subject to a leaseback to the
operator for the balance of the original agreed term and for the original agreed
participation  in  revenues  or CPI  adjustments.  This  allows us to  capture a
portion of the potential  appreciation in value of the real estate. The operator
has the right to buy out our option at formula prices.

     Participating  Mortgages  are  secured  by  first  mortgage  liens  on  the
underlying  real estate and personal  property of the mortgagor.  Interest rates
are  usually  subject to annual  increases  based upon  increases  in the CPI or
increases in revenues of the underlying long-term care facilities,  with certain
maximum limits.

     Fixed-Rate Mortgages, with a fixed interest rate for the mortgage term, are
also secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying  real estate and personal
property of the mortgagor.

     The  outstanding  principal  amount of mortgage  notes  receivable,  net of
allowances, are as follows:

</TABLE>

     Mortgage notes are shown net of allowances of $8.7 million and $3.7 million
in 2002 and 2001, respectively.

     Effective  September 1, 2001,  we entered into a  comprehensive  settlement
with Mariner  Post-Acute  Network,  Inc.  ("Mariner")  resolving all outstanding
issues relating to our loan to Professional Healthcare Management Inc. ("PHCM"),
a subsidiary of Mariner. Pursuant to the settlement, the PHCM loan is secured by
a first  mortgage  on 12  skilled  nursing  facilities  owned by PHCM with 1,679
operating beds. PHCM remained obligated on the total outstanding loan balance as
of January 18, 2000, the date Mariner filed for  protection  under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Act, and paid us our accrued  interest at a rate of approximately
11% for the  period  from the  filing  date until  September  1,  2001.  Monthly
payments with interest at the rate of 11.57% per annum resumed October 1, 2001.

     On February 1, 2001, four Michigan facilities,  previously operated by PHCM
and subject to our  pre-petition  mortgage,  were  transferred  by PHCM to Ciena
Health Care  Management  ("Ciena") who paid for the facilities by execution of a
promissory note that was assigned to us. PHCM was given a $4.5 million credit on
February 1, 2001 and an additional  $3.5 million credit as of September 1, 2001,
both  against  the PHCM loan  balance  in  exchange  for the  assignment  of the
promissory  note to us. The $8.7 million balance of the promissory  note,  which
was secured by a first mortgage on the four facilities,  was paid in full during
2002.

     Following  the closing  under the  settlement  agreement,  the  outstanding
principal balance on the PHCM loan is approximately $59.7 million. The PHCM loan
term is nine  years,  with PHCM  having the  option to extend for an  additional
eleven  years.  PHCM has the option to prepay the PHCM loan between  February 1,
2005 and July 31, 2005.

     The  estimated  fair value of our  mortgage  loans at December  31, 2002 is
approximately $183.6 million. Fair value is based on the estimates by management
using rates currently prevailing for comparable loans.

</TABLE>

NOTE 5 - CONCENTRATION OF RISK

     As of December 31, 2002, our portfolio of domestic investments consisted of
222 healthcare  facilities,  located in 28 states and operated by 34 third-party
operators.  Our gross  investment in these  facilities,  net of impairments  and
before reserve for uncollectible  loans,  totaled $852.1 million at December 31,
2002,  with  97.2% of our real  estate  investments  related to  long-term  care
facilities. This portfolio is made up of 146 long-term healthcare facilities and
two  rehabilitation  hospitals  owned and leased to third  parties,  fixed rate,
participating and convertible participating mortgages on 63 long-term healthcare
facilities  and two long-term  healthcare  facilities  that were  recovered from
customers and are currently operated through  third-party  management  contracts
for  our own  account  and  eight  long-term  healthcare  facilities  that  were
recovered from customers and are currently closed. In addition,  one facility is
subject to a leasehold  interest  and is included  in Other  investments  in our
audited Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  At December 31, 2002, we also held
miscellaneous  investments  and  assets  held  for sale of  approximately  $39.2
million,  including $16.9 million related to a non-healthcare facility leased by
the United  States  Postal  Service,  a $1.3  million  investment  in  Principal
Healthcare  Finance  Trust,  and  $11.4  million  of  notes  receivable,  net of
allowance.

     Approximately  55.8% of our real estate  investments  are  operated by five
public companies, including Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. ("Sun") (25.7%), Advocat,
Inc.  ("Advocat")  (12.5%),  Integrated  Health  Services,  Inc. ("IHS") (7.3%),
Mariner   Post-Acute   Network   ("Mariner")   (7.0%),  and  Alterra  Healthcare
Corporation  ("Alterra")  (3.3%).  The two largest private  operators  represent
10.1% and 3.7%, respectively,  of our investments.  No other operator represents
more than 2.7% of our investments. The three states in which we have our highest
concentration of investments are Florida (16.2%), California (7.8%) and Illinois
(7.7%).

NOTE 6 - LEASE AND MORTGAGE DEPOSITS

     Our  company  obtains  liquidity  deposits  and letters of credit from most
operators  pursuant to its leases and mortgages.  These generally  represent the
monthly rental and mortgage  interest  income for periods  ranging from three to
six months with respect to certain of its  investments.  The liquidity  deposits
may be applied in the event of lease and loan  defaults,  subject to  applicable
limitations  under bankruptcy law with respect to operators filing under Chapter
11 of the United  States  Bankruptcy  Code.  At December 31, 2002,  we held $3.7
million  in such  liquidity  deposits  and $7.6  million  in  letters of credit.
Additional  security for rental and mortgage  interest revenue from operators is
provided by covenants  regarding minimum working capital and net worth, liens on
accounts receivable and other operating assets of the operators,  provisions for
cross default,  provisions for cross-collateralization and by corporate/personal
guarantees.

     On  February  4,  2003,  Sun  remitted  rent of  $1.6  million  versus  the
contractual  amount of $2.1 million.  We have agreed with Sun to use a letter of
credit  (posted by Sun as a security  deposit) in the amount of $0.5  million to
make up the difference in rent.  The letter of credit was otherwise  expiring on
February  28,  2003  and was not  being  renewed.  We hold  additional  security
deposits (in the form of cash and letters of credit) of $2.3 million.  (See Note
19 - Subsequent Events).

NOTE 7 - BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS

     We have two secured  revolving  credit  facilities,  providing up to $225.0
million of financing.  At December 31, 2002,  $177.0 million was outstanding and
$12.5  million  was  utilized  for the  issuance  of letters of credit,  leaving
availability of $35.5 million.

     On December 21, 2001, we reached  amended  agreements  with the bank groups
under both of our revolving credit  facilities.  The amendments became effective
as of the  closing of the rights  offering  and  private  placement  to Explorer
Holdings,  L.P. on February  21, 2002.  The  amendments  included  modifications
and/or eliminations to certain financial covenants.

     The  amendment  regarding  our $175.0  million  revolving  credit  facility
included a one-year extension in maturity from December 31, 2002 to December 31,
2003 and a  reduction  in the total  commitment  from  $175.0  million to $160.0
million.  Borrowings bear interest at 2.50% to 3.25% over LIBOR through December
31, 2002 and 3.00% to 3.25% over LIBOR after  December  31,  2002,  based on our
leverage  ratio.  Borrowings of $112.0  million are  outstanding at December 31,
2002.  Additionally,  $12.5 million of letters of credit are outstanding against
this  credit  facility  at  December  31,  2002.  These  letters  of credit  are
collateral  for  certain  long-term  borrowings  and  collateral  for  insurance
programs for certain owned and operated  assets.  LIBOR-based  borrowings  under
this facility bear interest at a weighted-average  rate of 4.42% at December 31,
2002 and 5.49% at December 31,  2001.  Cost for the letters of credit range from
2.50% to 3.25%,  based on our leverage  ratio.  Real estate  investments  with a
gross book value of  approximately  $239.0 million are pledged as collateral for
this revolving line of credit facility at December 31, 2002.

     As part of the  amendment  regarding  our $75.0  million  revolving  credit
facility,  we prepaid $10.0 million in December  2001,  originally  scheduled to
mature  in  March  2002.  This  voluntary  prepayment  resulted  in a  permanent
reduction in the total commitment, thereby reducing the credit facility to $65.0
million.  Our $65.0  million line of credit  facility  expires on June 30, 2005.
Borrowings under the facility bear interest at 2.50% to 3.75% over LIBOR,  based
on our leverage ratio and collateral  assigned.  Borrowings of $65.0 million are
outstanding  at December 31, 2002.  LIBOR-based  borrowings  under this facility
bear interest at a weighted-average rate of 4.66% at December 31, 2002 and 5.65%
at  December  31,  2001.  Real  estate  investments  with a gross  book value of
approximately  $117.1  million are pledged as collateral for this revolving line
of credit facility at December 31, 2002.

     We are required to meet certain financial  covenants,  including prescribed
leverage and interest coverage ratios on our long-term  borrowings.  We are also
required to fix a certain portion of our interest rate. We utilize interest rate
swaps or caps to fix  interest  rates on variable  rate debt and reduce  certain
exposures to interest rate fluctuations (See Note 8 - Financial Instruments).

     The following is a summary of our long-term borrowings:

                                                   ========================

     On February 6, 2002, we refinanced our investment in a Baltimore,  Maryland
asset leased by the United States  Postal  Service  ("USPS")  resulting in $13.0
million of net cash proceeds.  The new,  fully-amortizing  mortgage note payable
has a 20-year term with a fixed interest rate of 7.26%. This transaction is cash
neutral to us on a monthly  basis,  as lease  payments  due from USPS equal debt
service on the new loan.

     On February 21, 2002, we raised gross proceeds of $50.0 million through the
completion of a rights offering and simultaneous  private placement to Explorer.
The proceeds from the rights  offering and private  placement were used to repay
outstanding indebtedness and for working capital and general corporate purposes.

     During 2002,  we paid off the  remaining  $97.5  million of our 6.95% Notes
that matured in June 2002,  resulting in a loss on early  extinguishment of debt
of approximately  $49,000. In addition,  during 2002, as a result of foreclosure
proceedings,  we  relinquished  title to certain  properties with a net carrying
value  of  approximately  $5.2  million  in  satisfaction  of  certain  mortgage
obligations owed to the Department of Housing and Urban  Development  ("HUD") in
the amount of $5.2 million.

     During 2001, we repurchased $27.5 million of our 6.95% Notes due June 2002,
resulting in a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $3.1 million.

     The balance of our Subordinated  Convertible Debentures  ("Debentures") was
paid in full on February 1, 2001. The Debentures were convertible into shares of
common stock at a conversion  price of $26.962 per share.  The  Debentures  were
unsecured  obligations of our company and were  subordinate in right and payment
to our senior unsecured indebtedness.

     Real estate  investments  with a gross book value of  approximately  $389.8
million are pledged as collateral for outstanding secured borrowings at December
31, 2002,  including  $356.1 million for our revolving lines of credit and $33.7
million for other long-term  borrowings.  Other long-term secured borrowings are
payable in  aggregate  monthly  installments  of  approximately  $0.24  million,
including interest at rates ranging from 7.3% to 10.0%.

     Assuming none of our borrowing  arrangements  are refinanced,  converted or
prepaid  prior to  maturity,  required  principal  payments for each of the five
years following December 31, 2002 and the aggregate due thereafter are set forth
below:

     The  estimated  fair value of our  long-term  borrowings  is  approximately
$296.7  million at December  31, 2002 and $396.4  million at December  31, 2001.
Fair values are based on the  estimates  by  management  using  rates  currently
prevailing for comparable loans.

     Fair value estimates are subjective in nature and are dependent on a number
of  important  assumptions,  including  estimates  of future cash flows,  risks,
discount rates and relevant  comparable market information  associated with each
financial  instrument.  (See Note 1 - Organization  and  Significant  Accounting
Policies, Risks and Uncertainties).  The use of different market assumptions and
estimation  methodologies  may have a material effect on the reported  estimated
fair  value  amounts.   Accordingly,  the  estimates  presented  above  are  not
necessarily  indicative  of the  amounts we would  realize  in a current  market
exchange.

     We utilize  interest rate swaps and caps to fix interest  rates on variable
rate debt and reduce certain exposures to interest rate fluctuations.  We do not
use  derivatives for trading or speculative  purposes.  We have a policy of only
entering  into  contracts  with major  financial  institutions  based upon their
credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying
and offsetting  exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, we have not
sustained  a  material  loss from those  instruments  nor do we  anticipate  any
material  adverse  effect on our net income or financial  position in the future
from the use of derivatives.

     To manage  interest rate risk, we may employ  options,  forwards,  interest
rate swaps, caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying
exposure. We may employ swaps, forwards or purchased options to hedge qualifying
forecasted  transactions.  Gains and losses  related to these  transactions  are
deferred and recognized in net income as interest  expense in the same period or
periods  that  the  underlying  transaction  occurs,  expires  or  is  otherwise
terminated.  In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued
Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
which was  required to be adopted in years  beginning  after June 15,  2000.  We
adopted the new Statement  effective January 1, 2001. The Statement  requires us
to recognize all  derivatives  on the balance  sheet at fair value.  Derivatives
that are not hedges  must be  adjusted  to fair  value  through  income.  If the
derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair
value of  derivatives  will either be offset against the change in fair value of
the  hedged  assets,  liabilities,  or  firm  commitments  through  earnings  or
recognized in Other  Comprehensive  Income until the hedge item is recognized in
earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be
immediately recognized in earnings.

     In September 2002, we entered into a 61-month, $200.0 million interest rate
cap with a strike of 3.50% that has been designated as a cash flow hedge.  Under
the terms of the cap agreement,  when LIBOR exceeds 3.50%, the counterparty will
pay us $200.0 million multiplied by the difference between LIBOR and 3.50% times
the number of days when LIBOR exceeds  3.50%.  The  unrealized  gain/loss in the
fair  value  of  cash  flow  hedges  are  reported  on the  balance  sheet  with
corresponding adjustments to accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. On December
31,  2002,  the  derivative  instrument  was  reported at its fair value of $7.3
million.  An adjustment of $2.9 million to Other  Comprehensive  Income was made
for the  change  in fair  value of this cap  during  2002.  Over the term of the
interest rate cap, the $10.1 million cost will be amortized to earnings based on
the specific  portion of the total cost  attributed  to each monthly  settlement
period. Over the next twelve months, $0.1 million is expected to be reclassified
to earnings from Other Comprehensive Income.

     As of September  2002, we terminated  two interest rate swaps with notional
amounts of $32.0  million  each.  Under the terms of the first  swap  agreement,
which would have  expired on December  2002,  we  received  payments  when LIBOR
exceeded 6.35% and paid the  counterparty  when LIBOR was less than 6.35%.  This
interest  rate swap was extended in December 2001 to December 2002 at the option
of the  counterparty  and therefore did not qualify for hedge  accounting  under
FASB No. 133.  The fair value of this swap at December 31, 2002 and December 31,
2001 was a liability of $0 and $1.3 million, respectively.

     The fair value of the first swap  agreement at January 1, 2001 was recorded
as a liability and a transition  adjustment in Other Comprehensive Income, which
was amortized  over the initial term of the swap ending  December 31, 2001.  The
change in fair value,  along with the  amortization,  is included in charges for
derivative accounting in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.

     Under the second swap agreement, which was scheduled to expire December 31,
2002, we received  payments when LIBOR exceeded 4.89% and paid the  counterparty
when LIBOR was less than  4.89%.  The fair value of this  interest  rate swap at
December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 was a liability of $0 and $0.8  million,
respectively.   The  change  in  fair  value  in  2001  was  included  in  Other
Comprehensive  Income as required  under FASB No. 133 for fully  effective  cash
flow hedges.

     The fair  values of these  interest  rate  swaps are  included  in  accrued
expenses and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31,
2002 and December 31, 2001.

NOTE 9 - RETIREMENT ARRANGEMENTS

     Our  company  has a  401(k)  Profit  Sharing  Plan  covering  all  eligible
employees.  Under this plan,  employees are eligible to make contributions,  and
we,  at our  discretion,  may  match  contributions  and make a  profit  sharing
contribution.

     We have a Deferred  Compensation Plan which is an unfunded plan under which
we can award  units that result in  participation  in the  dividends  and future
growth in the value of our common stock.  There are no  outstanding  units as of
December 31, 2002.

     Provisions   charged  to  operations  with  respect  to  these   retirement
arrangements totaled approximately  $38,800,  $33,500 and $181,000 in 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively.

NOTE 10 - STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND STOCK OPTIONS

Series C Preferred Stock

     On July 14,  2000,  Explorer  Holdings,  L.P.,  an  affiliate  of Hampstead
Investment  Partners  III,  L.P.  ("Hampstead"),   a  private  equity  investor,
completed an  investment  (the  "Equity  Investment")  of $100.0  million in our
company in exchange for  1,000,000  shares of our Series C preferred  stock.  We
used a portion of the proceeds  from the Equity  Investment to repay $81 million
of maturing debt on July 17, 2000.

     Shares of the Series C preferred stock are convertible into common stock at
any time by the  holder  at an  initial  conversion  price of $6.25 per share of
common  stock.  The shares of Series C preferred  stock are  entitled to receive
dividends at the greater of 10% per annum or the  dividend  payable on shares of
common  stock,  with  the  Series  C  preferred  stock  participating  on an "as
converted" basis.  Dividends on the Series C preferred stock are cumulative from
the date of original issue and are payable quarterly.

     The Series C preferred  stock votes (on an "as converted"  basis)  together
with our common  stock on all matters  submitted to  stockholders.  The original
terms of the Series C preferred stock provided that if dividends on the Series C
preferred  stock are in arrears for four  quarters,  the holders of the Series C
preferred stock,  voting  separately as a class (and together with the holder of
Series A and Series B  preferred  if and when  dividends  on such  series are in
arrears for six or more  quarters and special  class voting rights are in effect
with respect to the Series A and Series B preferred), would be entitled to elect
directors who,  together with the other  directors  designated by the holders of
Series C preferred stock, would constitute a majority of our Board of Directors.
The  general  terms of the  Equity  Investment  are set forth in the  Investment
Agreement.

     In  connection  with  Explorer's  Equity  Investment,  we  entered  into  a
stockholders   agreement  with  Explorer  dated  July  14,  2000  ("Stockholders
Agreement") pursuant to which Explorer was initially entitled to designate up to
four members of our Board of  Directors  depending  on the  percentage  of total
voting  securities  (consisting  of common  stock and Series C preferred  stock)
acquired  from time to time by Explorer  pursuant to the  documentation  entered
into by Explorer in connection  with the Equity  Investment.  Under the original
Stockholders Agreement, Explorer was entitled to designate at least one director
of our Board of  Directors as long as it owned at least five percent (5%) of the
total voting power of our company and to approve one  "independent  director" as
long as it owned at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares it acquired at
the time it  completed  the Equity  Investment  (or common stock issued upon the
conversion of the Series C preferred  stock  acquired by Explorer at such time).
The Stockholders Agreement has been subsequently amended as described below.

     We agreed to indemnify  Explorer,  its affiliates and the individuals  that
will serve as directors of our company  against any losses and expenses that may
be incurred as a result of the  assertion of certain  claims,  provided that the
conduct  of  the  indemnified  parties  meets  certain  required  standards.  In
addition,  we agreed to pay  Explorer an advisory  fee of up to $3.1 million for
Explorer's  assistance  in  connection  with  financing  matters.  We  agreed to
reimburse  Explorer for Explorer's  out-of-pocket  expenses,  up to a maximum of
$2.5 million,  incurred in connection with the Equity Investment.  We reimbursed
Explorer approximately $1.77 million of such expenses through December 31, 2002.

February 2002 Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement

     In  February   2002,  we  completed  a  registered   rights   offering  and
simultaneous private placement to Explorer.  Stockholders exercised subscription
rights  to  purchase  a  total  of 6.4  million  shares  of  common  stock  at a
subscription price of $2.92 per share,  raising gross proceeds of $18.7 million.
In the private placement with Explorer, we issued a total of 10.7 million shares
of common stock at a price of $2.92 per share,  raising gross  proceeds of $31.3
million.  Proceeds from the rights  offering and private  placement were used to
repay  outstanding  indebtedness  and for working capital and general  corporate
purposes.

     On February 21, 2002, we filed Articles of Amendment  amending the terms of
our Series C Convertible  Preferred  Stock to: (i) remove the  restriction  that
prevents the voting or conversion  of the Series C preferred  stock in excess of
49.9% of our voting  securities  owned by Explorer;  (ii) provide that  whenever
dividends owed upon the Series C preferred stock are in arrears for four or more
dividend  periods,  the holders of the Series C preferred stock will be entitled
to  designate  two  additional  directors to our Board of  Directors;  and (iii)
provide that the subscription price in the rights offering will not result in an
adjustment to the conversion price of our Series C preferred stock.

     In connection  with  Explorer's  February 2002  investment,  we amended the
Stockholders  Agreement  with Explorer to provide that Explorer will be entitled
to  designate  to our Board of  Directors  that number of  directors  that would
generally be proportionate to Explorer's  ownership of voting  securities in our
company, not to exceed five directors (or six directors upon the increase in the
size of the Board of Directors to ten directors). The Stockholders Agreement has
been further  amended to provide that Explorer  shall be entitled to designate a
majority of the total number of directors so long as Explorer owns a majority of
our issued and outstanding  voting securities.  Explorer currently  beneficially
owns a majority  of our voting  securities  and  therefore  would be entitled to
designate a majority of our directors. Explorer has agreed to vote its shares in
favor of three independent  directors as defined under the rules of the New York
Stock Exchange who are not  affiliates of Explorer,  so long as Explorer owns at
least 15% of our voting securities.  By letter dated January 21, 2003,  Explorer
advised us that they do not currently intend to designate  additional  directors
at this time, although reserving its rights under the Stockholders Agreement and
under the  terms of the  Series C  preferred  stock to do so.  The  Stockholders
Agreement  as amended  terminates  February  20,  2007.  Amounts  reimbursed  to
Explorer as of December  31, 2002 for the  February  2002  investment  were $0.4
million.

Series A and Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock

     On April 28, 1998,  we received  gross  proceeds of $50.0  million from the
issuance  of 2 million  shares of 8.625%  Series B  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock
("Series  B  preferred  stock")  at $25 per  share.  Dividends  on the  Series B
preferred  stock are cumulative  from the date of original issue and are payable
quarterly.  On April 7, 1997, we received  gross  proceeds of $57.5 million from
the issuance of 2.3 million shares of 9.25% Series A Cumulative  Preferred Stock
("Series  A  preferred  stock")  at $25 per  share.  Dividends  on the  Series A
preferred  stock are cumulative  from the date of original issue and are payable
quarterly.  At December 31, 2002, the aggregate liquidation preference of Series
A and  Series B  preferred  stock  issued  is  $107.5  million.  (See  Note 12 -
Dividends).

Stockholder Rights Plan

     On May 12,  1999,  our Board of  Directors  authorized  the  adoption  of a
stockholder  rights plan  ("Stockholder  Rights Plan").  The plan is designed to
require a person or group seeking to gain control of our company to offer a fair
price to all our  stockholders.  The  rights  plan will not  interfere  with any
merger, acquisition or business combination that our Board of Directors finds is
in the best interest of our company and its stockholders.

     In connection  with the adoption of the rights plan, our Board of Directors
declared a dividend  distribution of one right for each common share outstanding
on May 24, 1999. The rights will not become exercisable unless a person acquires
10% or more of our common  stock,  or begins a tender offer that would result in
the  person  owning 10% or more of our common  stock.  At that time,  each right
would  entitle each  stockholder  other than the person who triggered the rights
plan to purchase  either our common stock or stock of an  acquiring  entity at a
discount to the then market  price.  The plan was not adopted in response to any
specific attempt to acquire control of our company.

     We amended our  Stockholder  Rights Plan in 2000 to exempt Explorer and any
of its  transferees  that become parties to the standstill as Acquiring  Persons
under such plan. In October 2001, we further amended our Stockholder Rights Plan
to exempt Explorer and its affiliates and transferees generally.

Stock Options and Stock Purchase Assistance Plan

     We account for stock options using the intrinsic value method as defined by
APB 25:  Accounting  for Stock Issued to Employees.  Under the terms of the 2000
Stock Incentive Plan ("Incentive  Plan"), we reserved 3,500,000 shares of common
stock for grants to be issued  during a period of up to ten years.  Options  are
exercisable  at the market  price at the date of grant,  expire five years after
date of grant for over 10%  owners and ten years from the date of grant for less
than 10% owners. Directors' shares vest over three years while other grants vest
over five years or as defined in an employee's contract. Directors, officers and
employees are eligible to  participate  in the  Incentive  Plan. At December 31,
2002,  there  were  2,374,501   outstanding   options  granted  to  19  eligible
participants. Additionally, 327,121 shares of restricted stock have been granted
under the  provisions of the Incentive  Plan. The market value of the restricted
shares on the date of the award was recorded as unearned compensation-restricted
stock,  with  the  unamortized   balance  shown  as  a  separate   component  of
stockholders  equity.  Unearned  compensation is amortized to expense  generally
over the vesting  period,  with charges to  operations of $0.15  million,  $0.37
million and $0.54 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     During 2000,  1,040,000 Dividend Equivalent Rights were granted to eligible
employees.  A Dividend  Equivalent  Right  entitles the  participant  to receive
payments from us in an amount determined by reference to any cash dividends paid
on a specified  number of shares of stock to our  stockholders  of record during
the period such rights are  effective.  We recorded  $0,  $8,750 and $502,500 of
expense  related  to the  Dividend  Equivalent  Rights  in 2002,  2001 and 2000,
respectively.  During  2001,  payments of $502,500  were made in  settlement  of
Dividend  Equivalent  Rights in  connection  with  cancellation  of  options  on
1,005,000 shares.

     At December  31,  2002,  options  currently  exercisable  (302,325)  have a
weighted-average  exercise  price of $5.208,  with exercise  prices ranging from
$2.15 to $37.20.  There are 618,489  shares  available  for future  grants as of
December 31, 2002.

     The following is a summary of activity under the plan.

     In 1995, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued the Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based
Compensation."  This standard prescribes a fair value-based method of accounting
for employee stock options or similar equity  instruments  and requires  certain
pro forma disclosures.  For purposes of the pro forma disclosures required under
Statement  123, the estimated  fair value of the options is amortized to expense
over the option's vesting period.  Based on our company's  option activity,  net
earnings would have decreased in 2002 by approximately  $70,400 and increased in
2001  and  2000 by  approximately  $16,000  and  $1,064,000,  respectively.  Net
earnings per basic and diluted common share on a pro forma basis would have been
unchanged in 2002 and 2001,  and would have  increased in 2000 by  approximately
$0.06, under SFAS No. 123. The estimated  weighted-average fair value of options
granted in 2002, 2001 and 2000 was approximately $8,600,  $998,000 and $407,000,
respectively. In determining the estimated fair value of our stock options as of
the date of  grant,  a  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  was used with the
following  assumptions:  risk-free  interest  rates of 2.5% in 2002 and 2001 and
5.2% in 2000;  a  dividend  yield  of 5.0% in 2002  and 2001 and  10.0% in 2000;
volatility factors of the expected market price of our common stock based on 30%
volatility in 2002, 2001 and 2000; and a  weighted-average  expected life of the
options of 4.0 years in 2002 and 2001 and 8.0 years for 2000.

     The  Black-Scholes  options  valuation  model  was  developed  for  use  in
estimating the fair value of traded  options which have no vesting  restrictions
and are fully  transferable.  In addition,  option  valuation models require the
input of highly  subjective  assumptions,  including  the  expected  stock price
volatility.   Because  our   employee   stock   options   have   characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially  affect the fair value estimate,  in
management's  opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

     In January 1998,  our company  adopted a stock  purchase  assistance  plan,
whereby we extended  credit to directors and employees to purchase our company's
common stock through the exercise of stock  options.  During 2000, we terminated
this  borrowing  program and  forgave  the  outstanding  stock  option  loans in
exchange for the surrender of the underlying  stock  certificates and payment of
all  outstanding  interest on the loans.  We  recorded a charge of $1.9  million
related to these loans, which is included in the provision for loss on mortgages
and notes receivable in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2000.

NOTE 11 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Explorer Holdings, L.P.

     Hampstead,  through its  affiliate  Explorer,  indirectly  owned  1,048,420
shares of Series C preferred  stock and  12,539,078  shares of our common stock,
representing  54.4% of our  outstanding  voting  power as of December  31, 2002.
Daniel A. Decker,  our Chairman of the Board, is a partner of Hampstead.  Donald
J. McNamara, the Chairman of Hampstead, is one of our directors.  Christopher W.
Mahowald is one of our directors and holds an equity investment in Explorer.

     Series C Investment  Agreement.  Under the terms of an investment agreement
dated May 11,  2000  between  us and  Explorer  in  connection  with  Explorer's
purchase of Series C preferred  stock and an investment  agreement dated October
25,  2001  between us and  Explorer in  connection  with  Explorer's  additional
investment,  we agreed to reimburse Explorer for its out-of-pocket  expenses, up
to a maximum  amount of $2.5 million,  incurred in connection  with the Series C
investment.   As  of  December  31,  2002,  we  have  reimbursed   Explorer  for
approximately  $2.2 million of these  expenses,  including  $0.4 million  during
2002.

     Advisory  Agreement.  Under the terms of an amended and  restated  advisory
agreement  dated  October  4, 2000  between us and  Hampstead,  we agreed to pay
Explorer an advisory fee if Hampstead  provided  assistance  to us in connection
with the evaluation of growth  opportunities or other financing matters. On June
1, 2001, in connection with Hampstead's  agreement to provide certain  specified
financial  advisory,  consulting  and  operational  services,  including but not
limited to  assistance  in our  efforts to  refinance,  repay or extend  certain
indebtedness and assist in efforts to manage our  capitalization  and liquidity,
we agreed to pay  Hampstead  a fee  equal to 1% of the  aggregate  amount of our
indebtedness  that was  refinanced,  repaid or  extended,  based on the  maximum
amount available to be drawn in the case of revolving credit facilities, up to a
maximum  fee of $3.1  million.  Upon the  closing  of the  rights  offering  and
Explorer's  investment  in February  2002,  Hampstead  had  fulfilled all of its
obligations under the agreement. The fee was paid in the third quarter of 2002.

     Direct  Expenses.  In  addition  to the Series C  investment  costs and the
Advisory  Fee  costs of $3.1  million,  we  agreed  to  reimburse  Explorer  for
Explorer's direct expenses. As of December 31, 2002, we have reimbursed Explorer
for approximately $0.6 million of such direct expenses, including $12,000 during
2002.

     Dividend and Governance Right Deferral. We entered into a dividend deferral
letter agreement with Explorer dated November 15, 2000 relating to the extension
of the dividend  payment payable in connection with our Series C preferred stock
for the dividend  period ended October 31, 2000. The deferral  period expired on
April 2, 2001.  The amount of the deferred  dividend  payment was $4.667 million
representing the total unpaid  preferential  cumulative dividend for the October
2000  dividend.  In exchange for the deferral,  we also agreed to pay Explorer a
fee equal to 10% of the daily unpaid  principal  balance of the unpaid  dividend
amount from  November  15, 2000 until the dividend  was paid.  We issued  48,420
shares of Series C preferred  stock to Explorer on April 2, 2001 in full payment
of our  obligations  under the dividend  deferral  letter  agreement.  Shares of
Series C preferred  stock issued  pursuant to this  agreement are valued at $100
per share, the stated per share liquidation preference, and are convertible into
our common stock at $6.25 per share.

     By letter dated  January 21,  2003,  Explorer,  without  waiving its rights
under the terms of the Series C preferred stock or the  Stockholders  Agreement,
has  advised  us  that  it is not  currently  seeking  the  election  of the two
additional  directors  resulting from the Series C dividend arrearage unless the
holders of the Series A and Series B  preferred  stock seek to elect  additional
directors.

Omega Worldwide

     In 1995,  we sponsored the  organization  of Principal  Healthcare  Finance
Limited ("Principal"),  an Isle of Jersey company, whose purpose is to invest in
nursing homes and long-term care facilities in the United  Kingdom.  In November
1997, we formed Omega Worldwide,  Inc.  ("Worldwide"),  a company which provides
asset management  services and management  advisory services,  as well as equity
and debt capital to the healthcare industry, particularly residential healthcare
services to the elderly.  On April 2, 1998, we contributed  substantially all of
our  Principal  assets to Worldwide in exchange  for  approximately  8.5 million
shares of Worldwide  common stock and 260,000 shares of Series B preferred stock
of which  approximately  5.2 million shares were distributed on April 2, 1998 to
our  stockholders  and 2.3 million  shares were sold by us on April 3, 1998.  In
April 1999, in  conjunction  with an  acquisition  by Worldwide,  we acquired an
interest in Principal Healthcare Finance Trust (the "Trust"), an Australian Unit
Trust,  which owns 47 nursing home  facilities and 446 assisted  living units in
Australia and New Zealand.

     During 2002,  we sold our  investment  in  Worldwide.  Pursuant to a tender
offer by Four  Seasons  Health  Care  Limited  ("Four  Seasons")  for all of the
outstanding shares of common stock of Worldwide,  we sold our investment,  which
consisted of 1.2 million  shares of common stock and 260,000 shares of preferred
stock,  to  Four  Seasons  for  cash  proceeds  of  approximately  $7.4  million
(including $3.5 million for preferred stock  liquidation  preference and accrued
preferred dividends).  In addition,  we sold our investment in Principal,  which
consisted of 990,000  ordinary shares and warrants to purchase  185,033 ordinary
shares, to an affiliate of Four Seasons for cash proceeds of $2.8 million.  Both
transactions  were  completed in  September  2002 and  provided  aggregate  cash
proceeds of $10.2 million.  We realized a gain from the sale of our  investments
in Worldwide  and Principal of $2.2 million which was recorded in Gain (loss) on
assets sold in our audited Consolidated  Financial Statements.  We no longer own
any interest in Worldwide or Principal.

     As of December 31, 2002, we hold a $1.3 million investment in the Trust.

     Services  Agreement.  We entered into a services  agreement  with Worldwide
which provided for the allocation of indirect costs incurred by us to Worldwide.
The allocation of indirect costs was based on the  relationship  of assets under
our  management  to  the  combined  total  of  those  assets  and  assets  under
Worldwide's  management.  Upon expiration of this agreement on June 30, 2000, we
entered into a new agreement  requiring  quarterly  payments  from  Worldwide of
$37,500  for  the use of  offices  and  administrative  and  financial  services
provided  by us.  Upon the  reduction  of our  accounting  staff,  the  services
agreement  was  renegotiated  again on  November  1,  2000  requiring  quarterly
payments from  Worldwide of $32,500.  Costs  allocated to Worldwide for 2001 and
2000 were approximately $130,000 and $404,000, respectively. The former services
agreement expired in November of 2001.

NOTE 12 - DIVIDENDS

     In order to qualify as a real estate  investment  trust, we are required to
distribute  dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to our stockholders in
an amount at least equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our "REIT taxable  income"
(computed  without  regard to the dividends  paid  deduction and our net capital
gain) and (ii) 90% of the net  income  (after  tax),  if any,  from  foreclosure
property, minus (B) the sum of certain items of non-cash income. In addition, if
we dispose of any built-in  gain asset during a recognition  period,  we will be
required to  distribute  at least 90% of the built-in  gain (after tax), if any,
recognized on the disposition of such asset. Such  distributions must be paid in
the taxable  year to which they  relate,  or in the  following  taxable  year if
declared  before  we  timely  file our tax  return  for such year and paid on or
before the first regular dividend payment after such  declaration.  In addition,
such  distributions  are required to be made pro rata, with no preference to any
share of stock as  compared  with other  shares of the same  class,  and with no
preference  to one class of stock as compared  with another  class except to the
extent that such class is entitled to such a  preference.  To the extent that we
do not distribute all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least 90%, but
less than 100% of our "REIT taxable income," as adjusted,  we will be subject to
tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates.

     On  February  1,  2001,  we  announced  the  suspension  of all  common and
preferred  dividends.  Prior to  recommencing  the payment of  dividends  on our
common  stock,  all  accrued  and  unpaid  dividends  on our  Series  A, B and C
preferred stock must be paid in full. We have made sufficient  distributions  to
satisfy the distribution  requirements under the REIT rules to maintain our REIT
status for 2001. For tax year 2002, we are projecting a tax loss; therefore,  we
anticipate  no  distribution  will be  required  to satisfy the 2002 REIT rules.
However,   if  we  have  taxable  income,   we  intend  to  make  the  necessary
distributions to satisfy the 2002 REIT requirements.  The accumulated and unpaid
dividends  relating to all series of preferred  stocks total $40.0 million as of
December 31, 2002. In aggregate,  preferred  dividends continue to accumulate at
approximately $5.0 million per quarter.

     No common cash  dividends  were paid during 2002 and 2001.  Cash  dividends
paid  totaled  $1.00 per common  share for 2000.  We can give no assurance as to
when or if the dividends  will be  reinstated  on the preferred  stock or common
stock, or the amount of the dividends if and when such payments are recommenced.

     On March 30, 2001,  we exercised  our option to pay the accrued  $4,666,667
Series C dividend  from  November  15, 2000 and the  associated  deferral fee by
issuing 48,420 Series C preferred shares to Explorer Holdings,  L.P. on April 2,
2001, which are convertible into 774,720 shares of our common stock at $6.25 per
share.  Such  election  resulted  in an increase  in the  aggregate  liquidation
preference  of Series C  preferred  stock as of April 2,  2001 to  $104,842,000.
Dividends paid in stock to a specific class of stockholders, such as our payment
of our Series C preferred stock in April 2001, constitute dividends eligible for
the 2001 dividends paid deduction.

     Since  dividends on the Series A and Series B preferred  stock have been in
arrears  for more than 18  months,  the  holders  of the  Series A and  Series B
preferred  stock (voting  together as a single class) continue to have the right
to elect two additional  directors to our Board of Directors in accordance  with
the terms of the Series A and Series B preferred stock and our Bylaws. Explorer,
the sole holder of the Series C preferred stock, also has the right to elect two
other  additional  directors to our Board of Directors  in  accordance  with the
terms of the Series C preferred stock and our Bylaws. Explorer,  without waiving
its rights under the terms of the Series C preferred  stock or the  Stockholders
Agreement,  has advised us that it is not currently  seeking the election of the
two additional  directors  resulting from the Series C dividend arrearage unless
the  holders  of the  Series  A and  Series  B  preferred  stock  seek to  elect
additional directors.

     The table below sets forth information  regarding  arrearages in payment of
preferred stock dividends:

NOTE 14 - LITIGATION

     We are  subject  to various  legal  proceedings,  claims and other  actions
arising out of the normal  course of  business.  While any legal  proceeding  or
claim has an element of  uncertainty,  management  believes  that the outcome of
each lawsuit claim or legal proceeding that is pending or threatened,  or all of
them  combined,  will not have a  material  adverse  effect on our  consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

     On June 21,  2000,  we were  named as a  defendant  in  certain  litigation
brought  against  us in the U.S.  District  Court for the  Eastern  District  of
Michigan, Detroit Division, by Madison/OHI Liquidity Investors, LLC ("Madison"),
for the breach and/or anticipatory breach of a revolving loan commitment. Ronald
M.  Dickerman  and Bryan Gordon are  partners in Madison and limited  guarantors
("Guarantors")  of Madison's  obligations  to us. Madison  claimed  damages as a
result of the alleged  breach of  approximately  $0.7  million and damages in an
amount  ranging from $15 to $28 million for the  anticipatory  breach.  We filed
counterclaims   against  Madison  and  the  guarantors   seeking   repayment  of
approximately  $7.4  million  of  unpaid  principal  on the loan,  plus  accrued
interest.  Effective as of September 30, 2002 the parties  settled all claims in
the suit in consideration of Madison's  payment of the sum of $5.4 million.  The
payment by Madison  consists of a $0.4 million  cash payment for our  attorneys'
fees,  with the balance  evidenced by the  amendment of the existing  promissory
note from Madison to us. The note reflects a principal  balance of $5.0 million,
with  interest  accruing  at  9%  per  annum,  payable  over  three  years  upon
liquidation  of the  collateral  securing  the  note.  The  note is  also  fully
guaranteed by the Guarantors;  provided that if all accrued  interest and 75% of
original  principal has been repaid  within 18 months,  the  Guarantors  will be
released.  Accordingly, a reserve of $1.25 million was recorded in 2002 relating
to this note.  As of December 31, 2002,  we have  received the $0.4 million cash
payment  and  payments  of  principal  and  interest  on the note  equal to $2.7
million.   The   financial   statements   have  been  adjusted  to  reflect  the
restructuring  and reduction of our investment in connection with the settlement
of this matter.

     On December 29, 1998, Karrington Health, Inc.  ("Karrington")  brought suit
against us in the  Franklin  County,  Ohio,  Common  Pleas  Court  (subsequently
removed to the U.S.  District Court for the Southern  District of Ohio,  Eastern
Division)  alleging  that we  repudiated  and  ultimately  breached a  financing
contract to provide $95 million of financing for the  development of 13 assisted
living facilities.  Karrington was seeking recovery of approximately $34 million
in damages it alleged to have incurred as a result of the breach.  On August 13,
2001, we paid Karrington $10 million to settle all claims arising from the suit,
but  without  our  admission  of any  liability  or fault,  which  liability  is
expressly  denied.  Based on the  settlement,  the suit has been  dismissed with
prejudice. The settlement was recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2001.

NOTE 15 - SEVERANCE, MOVING AND CONSULTING AGREEMENT COSTS

     We entered into several  consulting  and  severance  agreements in 2001 and
2000 related to the resignation of certain of our company's senior managers.  In
addition,  we incurred  certain  relocation  costs in 2001  associated  with our
corporate office move from Michigan to Maryland,  effective  January 2002. Costs
incurred for these items total $5.1 million and $4.7 million for the years ended
December  31,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  These  costs are  included  in our
Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2001 and 2000.

(1)  Nursing home revenues from these owned and operated  assets are  recognized
     as services are provided.

(2)  EBITDA represents earnings before interest,  income taxes, depreciation and
     amortization.  We consider it to be a meaningful  measure of performance of
     our owned and operated  assets.  EBITDA in and of itself does not represent
     cash  generated  from  operating  activities  in  accordance  with GAAP and
     therefore  should not be  considered an  alternative  to net earnings as an
     indication  of  operating  performance  or to net cash flow from  operating
     activities  as  determined  by GAAP as a measure  of  liquidity  and is not
     necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.


     Accounts  receivable  for owned and operated  assets is net of an allowance
for doubtful  accounts of  approximately  $12.2 million at December 31, 2002 and
$8.3 million at December 31, 2001.  The  following is a summary of allowance for
doubtful accounts:

NOTE 19 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     Effective  January 1, 2003, we completed a  restructured  transaction  with
Claremont Health Care Holdings,  Inc.  (formerly Lyric Health Care, LLC) whereby
nine  facilities  formerly leased under two Master Leases were combined into one
new ten year Master Lease. Annual rent under the new lease is $6.0 million,  the
same  amount of rent  recognized  in 2002 for these  properties.  As part of the
restructure, one facility located in Sarasota, Florida was closed in 2002 and is
currently being marketed for sale.

     Separately,  in December  2002,  an  agreement  was  approved by the United
States Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware between us and IHS, whereby upon
notice  provided  by us, IHS will  convey  ownership  of eight  skilled  nursing
facilities (five in Florida,  two in Georgia,  and one in Texas) to an affiliate
of us and transfer  the  operations  to our  designee.  On February 1, 2003,  we
entered into a Master Lease, to re-lease a 130-bed  facility,  formerly operated
by IHS, with Senior  Management  Services of Treemont,  Inc. The initial term is
ten years with rent culminating at $0.4 million annually by the end of the third
year. We are in the process of  negotiating  lease  arrangements  on each of the
remaining seven IHS properties.

     On January 14, 2003,  we were notified by Alterra that it did not intend to
pay January rent and that a restructuring of its Master Lease was necessary.  We
currently  lease eight assisted  living  facilities (325 units) located in seven
states to  subsidiaries  of Alterra.  The Master Lease requires  annual rent for
2003 of approximately  $3.2 million.  On January 14, 2003, we declared an "Event
of  Default"  under its Master  Lease and  demanded  payment  under its  Alterra
guarantee.  On January 22, 2003,  Alterra announced that, in order to facilitate
and complete its on-going restructuring initiatives,  they had filed a voluntary
petition  with the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Court  for the  District  of  Delaware  to
reorganize  under  Chapter  11  of  the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code.  We  intend  to
aggressively  pursue all  avenues  afforded us in order to enforce the terms and
conditions under the lease.

     On  February  4,  2003,  Sun  remitted  rent of  $1.6  million  versus  the
contractual  amount of $2.1 million.  We have agreed with Sun to use a letter of
credit  (posted by Sun as a security  deposit) in the amount of $0.5  million to
make up the difference in rent and agreed to temporarily forebear in declaring a
default  under the lease  caused by Sun's  failure to restore  the $0.5  million
letter of credit.  The letter of credit was  otherwise  expiring on February 28,
2003 and was not being renewed.  We hold  additional  security  deposits (in the
form of cash and letters of credit) of $2.3 million.

     On February 7, 2003, Sun announced  "that it has opened  dialogue with many
of its  landlords  concerning  the  portfolio  of  properties  leased to Sun and
various of its  consolidated  subsidiaries  (collectively,  the `Company').  The
Company is seeking a rent  moratorium  and/or rent  concessions  with respect to
certain of its facilities and is seeking to transition its operations of certain
facilities  to new  operators  while  retaining  others."  To this end,  Sun has
initiated  conversations  with us regarding a restructure of our lease.  At this
stage,  it is too early to predict  the  outcome of those  conversations.  As of
December 31, 2002, our investment balance was $219.0 million relating to the Sun
portfolio under agreements provided for annual rental income of $25.1 million in
2002 and $25.7 million in 2003.

     On February 5, 2003,  we entered  into a binding  agreement  to buy out our
last remaining  leasehold interest in one facility in Indiana for $0.35 million.
The  expected  closing  date for this  transaction  is March 1, 2003  subject to
change of ownership and  licensure  with the state of Indiana.  In addition,  we
decided  to close  one  facility  in  Illinois.  Upon  completion  of these  two
transactions,  our owned and  operated  portfolio  will be  reduced  from  three
facilities at December 31, 2002 to one facility.

     In December 2000, we filed suit against a title company (later adding a law
firm as a defendant),  seeking damages based on claims of breach of contract and
negligence,  among  other  things,  as a result of the  alleged  failure to file
certain  UCC  financing  statements  in our favor.  We filed a  subsequent  suit
seeking  recovery under title insurance  policies  written by the title company.
The defendants denied the allegations made in the lawsuits. In settlement of our
claims against the  defendants,  we agreed on February 20, 2003 to accept a lump
sum cash payment of $3.2 million, which was paid on February 28, 2003.

2.   Based on my  knowledge,  this  annual  report  does not  contain any untrue
     statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact  necessary to
     make the statements  made, in light of the  circumstances  under which such
     statements  were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by
     this annual report;

3.   Based on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and  other  financial
     information included in this annual report,  fairly present in all material
     respects the financial  condition,  results of operations and cash flows of
     the Registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this annual report;

4.   The  Registrant's  other  certifying  officers  and I are  responsible  for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14) for the Registrant and we have:

     a)   designed  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to ensure  that
          material  information  relating  to  the  Registrant,   including  its
          consolidated subsidiaries,  is made known to us by others within those
          entities,  particularly  during the period in which this annual report
          is being prepared;

     b)   evaluated the  effectiveness of the Registrant's  disclosure  controls

     equivalent function):

     a)   all  significant  deficiencies  in the design or operation of internal
          controls  which could  adversely  affect the  Registrant's  ability to
          record,  process,   summarize  and  report  financial  data  and  have
          identified for the  Registrant's  auditors any material  weaknesses in
          internal controls; and

     b)   any fraud, whether or not material,  that involves management or other
          employees who have a  significant  role in the  Registrant's  internal
          controls; and

6.   The  Registrant's  other  certifying  officers and I have indicated in this
     annual  report  whether or not there were  significant  changes in internal
     controls  or in other  factors  that could  significantly  affect  internal
     controls  subsequent to the date of our most recent  evaluation,  including
     any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material
     weaknesses.

                        AMENDMENT NO. 4 TO LOAN AGREEMENT

     AMENDMENT  NO. 4 TO LOAN  AGREEMENT  (this  "Amendment  No.  4"),  made and
executed as of this 1st day of April, 2002, by and among:

     OMEGA   HEALTHCARE   INVESTORS,   INC.  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries
(individually, a "Borrower" and collectively, the "Borrowers"),

     The lenders that have executed the signature pages hereto (individually,  a
"Lender" and collectively, the "Lenders"); and

     THE PROVIDENT BANK, an Ohio banking  corporation,  as Agent for the Lenders
(in such capacity, together with its successors in such capacity, the "Agent").

                             PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

     (A) The Borrowers have entered into a certain Loan  Agreement  dated August
11, 2000,  as amended by that certain  Amendment No. 1 to Loan  Agreement  dated
November 30, 2000, that certain Amendment No. 2 dated December 31, 2000 and that
certain Amendment No.3 dated as of December 21, 2001  (hereinafter  referred to,
as amended, as the "Loan Agreement") with the Agent and the Lenders; and

     (B) The  Borrowers  have  requested  that the Lenders and the Agent amend a
certain  provision  of the Loan  Agreement,  and the  Lenders  and the Agent are
willing to do so, all on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the agreements and provisions contained
herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

     1.  Definitions.  Capitalized  terms used but not defined herein shall have
the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Loan Agreement.

     2. Amendment to the Loan Agreement.  Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Amendment No. 4, Section 8.11(b) of the Loan Agreement shall be amended and
restated to read in its entirety as follows:

     (b) The Fleet Obligations; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything
contained  in this  Agreement or any Schedule  thereto to the  contrary,  in the
event that the Fleet  Obligations  shall be amended or modified to (i)  increase
the  amount  of the  commitment  thereunder,  (ii)  increase  the  amount of the
amortization  thereunder,  (iii) increase the rate of interest thereunder,  (iv)
change the maturity of the obligations thereunder, (v) increase the fees payable
thereunder,  (vi)  increase the amount of  collateral  securing the  obligations
thereunder  (other than any increase in the collateral  value  occasioned by the
collateral  substitution  which closed on or about March 6, 2002, which resulted
in availability  under the Fleet  Documents of  approximately  $17,300,000),  or
(vii) impose on the Borrowers  financial  covenants more  restrictive than those
set forth in the Fleet  Obligations as of the date hereof (any such amendment or
modification, the "Fleet Amendment"), the Borrowers shall execute and deliver to
the Agent an amendment or modification  of this  Agreement,  the effect of which
shall be, to the extent reasonably determined necessary by Agent and Lenders, to
negate  any  materially  adverse  impact to the  interests  of the Agent and the
Lenders under this  Agreement  which would have otherwise been the effect of the
Fleet Amendment;

     3.  Representations and Warranties.  In order to induce the Lenders and the
Agent  to  enter  into  this  Amendment  No.  4,  each of the  Borrowers  hereby
represents and warrants to the Lenders and the Agent,  as to itself with respect
to the Loan Documents to which it is a party, as of the date hereof that:

     3.1 No Default.  After giving effect to this Amendment No. 4, no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing.

     3.2 Authority;  Enforceability. (i) The execution, delivery and performance
by each Borrower of this  Amendment No. 4 are within its  organizational  powers
and have been duly authorized by all necessary  action  (corporate or otherwise)
on the part of each Borrower,  (ii) this Amendment No. 4 is the legal, valid and
binding  obligation  of each  Borrower,  enforceable  against  each  Borrower in
accordance  with its terms,  and (iii) this  Amendment No. 4 and the  execution,
delivery and  performance  by each Borrower  hereof does not: (A) contravene the
terms of any Borrower's organization  documents,  (B) conflict with or result in
any breach or contravention  of, or the creation of any Lien under, any document
evidencing  any  contractual  obligation to which any Borrower is a party or any
order,  injunction,  writ or decree to which any  Borrower  or its  property  is
subject, or (C) violate any requirement of law.

     4.  Conditions to  Effectiveness  of Amendment.  The  effectiveness  of the

of the following conditions to the satisfaction of Agent :

Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.

     4.4 As of the date of this  Amendment  No. 4, Agent  shall have  received a
