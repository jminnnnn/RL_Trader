                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1 -- BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY
 
     Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in the
state of Maryland on March 31, 1992. It is a self-administered real estate
investment trust ("REIT") which invests in income-producing healthcare
facilities, principally long-term care facilities located in the United States.
The Company anticipates providing lease or mortgage financing for healthcare
facilities to qualified operators and acquiring additional healthcare facility
types, including assisted living and acute care facilities. Financing for such
future investments may be provided by borrowings under the Company's bank line
of credit, private placements or public offerings of debt or equity, the
assumption of secured indebtedness, or a combination of these methods. The
Company also may finance acquisitions through the exchange of properties or the
issuance of shares of its capital stock, if such transactions otherwise satisfy
the Company's investment criteria.
 
     Effective September 30, 1994, the Company acquired all the outstanding
common stock of Health Equity Properties Incorporated ("HEP"), a healthcare real
estate investment trust. The total purchase consideration for HEP approximated
$180 million, comprising common stock of $143 million represented by 5,826,000
shares, long-term debt assumed of $26 million, and other obligations,
professional fees and costs incurred in the transaction.
 
     During 1995, the Company became a primary sponsor of Principal Healthcare
Finance Limited ("Principal"), an Isle of Jersey (United Kingdom) company
established to provide capital and medium-term financing on a stable, continuing
basis to the private-sector healthcare industry in the United Kingdom. The
nursing home industry in the United Kingdom, like that in the United States, is
consolidating and capital demand exists. At December 31, 1997, Principal owned
154 properties for which it has invested L215 million (approximately $354
million). The Company also provides services for the administration, marketing,
identification and evaluation of potential investments and the monitoring of the
performance of the healthcare operators financed by Principal.
 
     In November, 1997 the Company formed Omega Worldwide, Inc. (Worldwide), a
company which will provide investment advisory and management services and hold
equity and debt interests in companies engaged in providing sale/leaseback and
other capital financing to healthcare service providers throughout the world. In
connection with the formation of Worldwide, the Company will receive on or about
April 1, 1998, 8.5 million shares of Worldwide common stock and rights to
receive up to 5,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock in exchange for
substantially all of the Company's interests in Principal. The Company's
interests in Principal which will be exchanged for its ownership in Worldwide
include: (a) 3,337,500 ordinary shares of Principal and warrants to purchase 10
million ordinary shares of Principal expiring June 30, 2001 at an exercise price
of L1.50 (approximately $2.40) per share and 554,583 ordinary shares of
Principal expiring December 31, 2000 at an exercise price of L1.00
(approximately $1.60) per share; (b) the Company's right to payment of L15
million (approximately $24 million) from the Sterling denominated subordinated
loan; (c) the Company's interest in a ten-year British pound currency swap
contract under which Omega Worldwide, Inc. will have the right to exchange
L20,000,000 for $31,740,000 on October 15, 2007; (d) and the Amended and
Restated Advisory Services Agreement between the Company and Principal. The
Company will retain 900,000 Class A Voting Shares of Principal.
 
     Omega Worldwide, Inc. has filed a Registration Statement with respect to
rights to acquire 2,250,000 shares of its common stock, 500,000 shares to be
sold in a primary offering and 2.3 million shares to be sold in a secondary
offering by the Company. Each common shareholder of the Company will receive a
pro-rata share of approximately 5.2 million common shares of Omega Worldwide,
Inc. and will be eligible to receive a portion of the 2.25 million rights to
purchase Omega Worldwide, Inc. common stock. The Company will retain a 9%
interest in Omega Worldwide, Inc. The date of the distribution of Omega
Worldwide, Inc. shares has not been set since it depends upon, among other
matters, the date of approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the
Registration Statement. As of the date of the distribution, the cost of assets
transferred to Omega Worldwide, Inc., less the net proceeds of the secondary
offering received by the Company, will be charged to shareholders' equity in the
form of a special dividend. Management estimates the special dividend will
approximate $10 million.

     As of December 31, 1997, the Company's portfolio of domestic investments
consisted of 258 long-term care facilities, 3 medical office buildings and 2
rehabilitation hospitals. The Company owns and leases 178 long-term facilities,
3 medical office buildings and 2 rehabilitation hospitals, and provides
mortgages, including participating and convertible participating mortgages, on
80 long-term healthcare facilities. The facilities are located in 26 states and
operated by 29 unaffiliated operators. The Company's gross real estate
investments at December 31, 1997 totaled $779.4 million. During 1997, new
investments approximated $196 million as a result of entering into
sale/leaseback transactions and making mortgage loans and other investments.
 
     At March 6, 1998, the Company employed 26 full-time employees. The
executive offices of the Company are located at 905 West Eisenhower Circle,
Suite 110, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48103. Its telephone number is (734) 747-9790.
 
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
 
     The investment objectives of the Company are to pay regular cash dividends
to shareholders; to provide the opportunity for increased dividends from annual
increases in rental and interest income from revenue participations and from
portfolio growth; to preserve and protect shareholders' capital; and to provide
the opportunity to realize capital growth.
 
INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND POLICIES
 
     The Company maintains a diversified portfolio of income-producing
healthcare facilities or mortgages thereon, with a primary focus on long-term
care facilities located in the United States. In evaluating potential
investments, the Company considers such factors as: (i) the quality and
experience of management and the creditworthiness of the operator of the
facility; (ii) the adequacy of the facility's historical, current and forecasted
cash flow to meet operational needs, capital expenditures and lease or debt
service obligations; (iii) the construction quality, condition and design of the
facility; (iv) the geographic area and type of facility; (v) the tax, growth,
regulatory and reimbursement environment of the community in which the facility
is located; (vi) the occupancy and demand for similar healthcare facilities in
the same or nearby communities; and (vii) the payor mix of private, Medicare and
Medicaid patients.
 
     In making investments, the Company generally seeks established,
creditworthy, middle-market healthcare operators which meet the Company's
standards for quality and experience of management. Although the Company has
emphasized long-term care investments, it intends to diversify prudently into
other types of healthcare facilities or other properties. The Company actively
seeks to diversify its investments in terms of geographic location, operators
and facility types.
 
     A fundamental investment strategy of the Company is to obtain contractual
rent escalations under long-term, non-cancelable, triple-net leases (whereby the
tenant is responsible for all maintenance, repairs, taxes and insurance on the
leased properties) and revenue participation through participating mortgage
loans, and to obtain substantial security deposits. Additional security is
typically provided by covenants regarding minimum working capital and net worth,
liens on accounts receivable and other operating assets, and various provisions
for cross-default, cross-collateralization and corporate/personal guarantees,
when appropriate.
 
     The Company prefers to invest in equity ownership of properties. Due to
regulatory, tax or other considerations, the Company sometimes pursues
alternative investment structures, including Convertible Participating and
Participating Mortgages, that are intended to achieve returns comparable to
equity investments. The following summarizes the four primary structures
currently used by the Company:
 
          Purchase/Leaseback. The Company's owned properties are generally
     leased under provisions of leases for terms ranging from 5 to 17 years,
     plus renewal options. The leases originated by the Company generally
     provide for minimum annual rentals which are subject to annual formula
     increases (i.e., based upon such factors as increases in the Consumer Price
     Index ("CPI") or increases in the revenues of the underlying properties),
     with certain fixed minimum and maximum levels. Generally, the operator
     holds an option to repurchase the property at set dates at prices based on
     specified formulas. The average annualized yield from leases was 11.57% at
     January 1, 1998.
 
                                        2
<PAGE>   4
 
          Convertible Participating Mortgage. Convertible Participating
     Mortgages are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate
     and personal property of the mortgagor. Interest rates are usually subject
     to annual increases based upon increases in the CPI or increases in
     revenues of the underlying long-term care facilities, with certain maximum
     limits. Convertible Participating Mortgages afford the Company an option to
     convert its mortgage into direct ownership of the property, generally at a
     point six to nine years from inception; they are then subject to a
     leaseback to the operator for the balance of the original agreed term and
     for the original agreed participations in revenues or CPI adjustments. This
     allows the Company to capture a portion of the potential appreciation in
     value of the real estate. The operator has the right to purchase the
     Company's option at prices based on specified formulas. The average
     annualized yield on these mortgages was approximately 12.75% at January 1,
     1998.
 
          Participating Mortgage. Participating Mortgages of the Company are
     secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal
     property of the mortgagor. Interest rates are usually subject to annual
     increases based upon increases in the CPI or increases in revenues of the
     underlying long-term care facilities, with certain maximum limits. The
     average annualized yield on these investments was approximately 14.36% at
     January 1, 1998.
 
          Fixed-Rate Mortgage. These mortgages of the Company, with a fixed
     interest rate for the mortgage term, are also secured by first mortgage
     liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor.
     The average annualized yield on these investments was 11.16% at January 1,
     1998.
 
     The table set forth in Item 2 -- Properties, herein, contains information
regarding the Company's real estate properties, their locations, and the types
of investment structures as of December 31, 1997.
 
BORROWING POLICIES
 
     The Company may incur additional indebtedness, and anticipates attaining
and then maintaining a long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio of approximately
40%. The Company intends to review periodically its policy with respect to its
debt-to-equity ratio and to adapt such policy as its management deems prudent in
light of prevailing market conditions. The Company's strategy generally has been
to match the maturity of its indebtedness with the maturity of its assets, and
to employ long-term, fixed-rate debt to the extent practicable.
 
     The Company will use the proceeds of any additional indebtedness to provide
permanent financing for investments in additional healthcare facilities. The
Company may obtain either secured or unsecured indebtedness, which may be
convertible into capital stock or accompanied by warrants to purchase capital
stock. Where debt financing is present on terms deemed favorable, the Company
generally may invest in properties subject to existing loans, secured by
mortgages, deeds of trust or similar liens on properties.
 
     The Company has an unsecured acquisition line of credit which permits
borrowings of up to $200,000,000, of which approximately $129 million was used
at February 27, 1998. This credit facility provides temporary funds for new
investments in healthcare facilities. The Company expects to periodically
replace funds drawn on the acquisition line through long-term, fixed-rate
borrowings, the issuance of equity linked borrowings, or the issuance of
additional shares of capital stock.
 
COMPETITION
 
     The Company competes for additional healthcare facility investments with
other healthcare investors, including other real estate investment trusts. The
operators of the facilities compete with other regional or local nursing care
facilities for the support of the medical community, including physicians and
acute care hospitals, as well as the general public. Some significant
competitive factors for the placing of patients in skilled and intermediate care
nursing facilities include quality of care, reputation, physical appearance of
the facilities, services offered, family preferences, physician services and
price.
 
GOVERNMENT HEALTHCARE REGULATION AND REIMBURSEMENTS
 
     Healthcare is an area of extensive government regulation and dynamic
regulatory change. The Company's lessees and mortgagors are and will continue to
be subject to extensive federal, state and local
 
                                        3
<PAGE>   5
 
regulation, including facility inspections, reimbursement policies, and control
over certain expenditures. Changes in laws or regulations, or new
interpretations of existing laws or regulations, can have a dramatic effect on
methods and costs of doing business, as well as the amounts of reimbursement by
government and private third-party payors.
 
     A significant portion of the revenues of the Company's lessees and
mortgagors are and will be dependent upon reimbursement from third-party payors,
including the Medicaid and Medicare programs, post-retirement benefit plans,
private insurance companies and health maintenance organizations. Operators also
are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulations relating to their
operations, and the Company's facilities are subject to periodic inspection by
government and other authorities to assure continual compliance with mandated
procedures, licensure requirements under state law and certification standards
under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 
     Since 1976, healthcare regulation through Certificates of Need ("CON") have
tended to limit construction of new long-term care facilities in many states.
Several states in which the Company has investments have repealed CON
legislation, including Indiana, California and Texas, which may adversely affect
customers of the Company.
 
     The levels of revenues and profitability of the Company's lessees and
mortgagors will continue to be affected by the ongoing efforts of third-party
payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare. Recent legislation changes
the Medicare payment methodology for skilled nursing facilities effective for
cost reporting years commencing after July 1, 1998. The cost-based system is
replaced by a federal per diem rate that is phased in over four years. The new
per diem rate will be the sole payment for both direct nursing care ("Part A
services") and ancillary services that were previously billed separately from
the cost-based reimbursement system ("Part B services"). Capital costs are also
included in the per diem rate. Many states have also converted to a system based
on prospectively determined fixed rates.
 
     Until 1997, state Medicaid programs were required to reimburse nursing
facilities based on rates that were reasonable and adequate to meet the costs
that must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities in
order to provide services in conformity with federal and state standards and to
assure reasonable access to patients. This law restricted the ability of the
states to reduce Medicaid payments. Congress repealed this requirement in 1997.
Under the new law, states need only publish the methodology used to develop the
proposed rates, along with a justification for the methodology, and allow public
comment. This change could result in reduced Medicaid payments to facilities
operated by the Company's customers. The Company expects that there will
continue to be proposals to limit Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement for
healthcare services in an attempt to reduce the United States federal budget
deficit. Proposals have also been made to limit Medicaid reimbursement for
healthcare services in many of the states in which the Company's facilities are
located. The Company cannot at this time predict whether any of these proposals
will be adopted at the federal or state level or, if adopted and implemented,
what effect, if any, such proposals will have on the lessees or mortgagors of
the Company, and, indirectly, the Company. A significant change in coverage,
reduction in payment rates by third-party payors, or the decline in availability
of funding could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial
condition of the Company's lessees and mortgagors, and, indirectly, the
Company's financial condition.
 
     There can be no assurance that the Medicaid reimbursement programs in each
of the states where the lessees' and mortgagors' facilities are located will
reimburse rent or interest costs of the lessees and mortgagors at increased
levels recognizing the initial sales to or borrowings from the Company. Failure
by these state Medicaid programs to provide reimbursement at current or
increased levels could have an adverse effect upon the cash flow of the
facilities and, hence, on the ability of the Company's lessees and mortgagors to
meet their respective payment obligations to the Company. Additionally, Medicare
regulations provide that effective December 1, 1997, when a facility changes
ownership (by sale or under certain lease transactions), reimbursement for
depreciation and interest will be based on the cost to the owner of record as of
August 5, 1997, less depreciation allowed. Previously, the buyer would use its
cost of purchase up to the original owner's historical cost before depreciation.
Such changes could adversely affect the resale value of the Company's healthcare
facilities.

     Healthcare facilities that participate in Medicare or Medicaid must meet
extensive program requirements, including physical plant and operational
requirements, which are revised from time to time. Such requirements may include
a duty to admit Medicare and Medicaid patients, limiting the ability of the
facility to increase its private pay census beyond certain limits. Medicare and
Medicaid facilities are regularly inspected to determine compliance, and may be
excluded from the programs -- in some cases without a prior hearing -- for
failure to meet program requirements. In 1997, two facilities of the Company in
Alabama were excluded from programs for 68 and 72 days. This had no effect on
the rents received by the Company and the facilities in question have been
reinstated. Other changes in the healthcare industry include continuing trends
toward shorter lengths of hospital stay, increased use of outpatient services,
increased federal, state and third party oversight of healthcare company
operations and business practices, and increased demand for capitated healthcare
services (delivery of services at a fixed price per capita basis to a defined
group of covered parties). The entrance of insurance companies into managed care
programs is also accelerating the introduction of managed care in new
localities, and states and insurance companies continue to negotiate actively
the amounts they will pay for services. Moreover, the percentage of healthcare
services that are reimbursed under Medicare and Medicaid programs continues to
increase as the population ages and as states expand their Medicaid programs.
Continued eligibility to participate in these programs is crucial to a
provider's financial strength. As a result of the foregoing, the revenues and
margins of the operators of the Company's facilities may decrease, resulting in
a reduction of the Company's rent/interest coverage from investments.
 
CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
 
     At all times, the Company intends to make and manage its investments
(including the sale or disposition of property or other investments) and to
operate in such a manner as to be consistent with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") (or regulations
thereunder) to qualify as a REIT, unless, because of changes in circumstances or
changes in the Code (or regulations thereunder), the Board of Directors
determines that it is no longer in the best interests of the Company to qualify
as a REIT. As such, it generally will not pay federal income taxes on the
portion of its income which is distributed to shareholders.
 
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY
 
     At the date of this report, the executive officers of the Company are:
 
          Essel W. Bailey, Jr. (53) has been President, Chief Executive Officer
     and Secretary of the Company since March 1992, and Chairman of the board
     since July 1995. Prior to that he was a Managing Director of Omega Capital,
     a healthcare investment partnership, from 1986 to 1992. He was previously a
     partner in a major Michigan law firm. Mr. Bailey is also a director of
     Principal Healthcare Finance Limited and of Vitalink Pharmacy Services,
     Inc., an NYSE listed company and the fourth largest institutional pharmacy
     serving the long-term care industry in the United States.
 
          James P. Flaherty (50) joined the Company in 1996 and was appointed
     Vice President-International of the Company and Managing Director and Chief
     Executive of Omega U.K. Limited in January 1997. Before he joined the
     Company, he was Chairman of Black Rock Capital Corporation, a leasing and
     merchant banking firm he founded in 1994. From April 1991 until December of

(1) For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges
    and preferred stock dividends, net earnings (before extraordinary charge
    from prepayment of debt in 1995) has been added to fixed charges and that
    sum has been divided by such fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of
    interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs and, starting
    with the period ended December 31, 1997, preferred stock dividends for the
    Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock, which is the only series of preferred
    stock outstanding at December 31, 1997.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OMEGA HEALTHCARE INVESTORS, INC.


                        "SAFE HARBOR" STATEMENT UNDER THE
     UNITED STATES PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 

     Statements that are not historical facts contained in Management's 
Discussion and Analysis are forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from projected results.
Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
include: the financial strength of the operators of the Company's facilities as
it affects their continuing ability to meet their obligations to the Company
under the terms of the Company's agreements with such operators; changes in
operators or ownership of operators; government policy relating to the
healthcare industry, including changes in the reimbursement levels under the
Medicare and Medicaid programs; operators' continued eligibility to participate
in the Medicare and Medicaid programs; changes in reimbursement by other third
party payors; occupancy levels at the Company's facilities; the availability
and cost of capital; the strength and financial resources of the Company's
competitors; the Company's ability to make additional real estate investments
at attractive yields and changes in tax laws and regulations affecting real
estate investment trusts.

     Following is a discussion of the consolidated results of operations,
financial position and liquidity and capital resources of the Company which
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996
     Revenues for the year ended December 31, 1997 totaled $90,820,000,
increasing $17.7 million over 1996 revenues. The 1997 revenue growth stems
primarily from additional investments during 1996 and 1997. A partial year of
revenues from 1997 investments provided revenue increases of approximately $9.8
million, while a full year of revenues from 1996 investments added $5.1 million
to revenues. Additionally, approximately $1.9 million of the revenue growth
stems from participating incremental revenues which became effective during
1997.
     Real estate investments of $779.4 million as of December 31, 1997 will
provide 1998 annualized revenues of $93.1 million. Revenues will continue at
this level until additional 1998 investments are made and additional escalation
provisions commence in 1998. Annualized revenues for 1998 represent a $20.1
million increase over the 1997 annualized revenues of $73.0 million based on
real estate investments of $593.7 million as of January 1, 1997.
     The following table summarizes the years of expiration of the Company's
revenues based on the contractual maturity dates of the leases and mortgages:

                    ============================================================
</TABLE>

The total excludes approximately $5.7 million of annualized revenues from Unison
(see Note 5).

     Expenses for the year ended December 31, 1997 totaled $45,969,000,
increasing approximately $7.4 million over expenses of $38.5 million for 1996.
The 1997 provision for depreciation and amortization of real estate totaled
$16,910,000, increasing $3.2 million over 1996. This increase stems from a full
year provision for 1996 investments, plus a partial year of provision for 1997
investments.
     Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1997 was approximately
$24,423,000, compared with $20.8 million for 1996. The increase in interest
expense is primarily due to an increase in average outstanding borrowings on the
acquisition line of credit, partially offset by lower rates.

                                     F-3
<PAGE>   4

     General and administrative expenses for 1997 totaled $4.6 million or
approximately 5.1% of revenues as compared to 5.5% for 1996. The 1997 percentage
decrease stems primarily from economies of scale resulting from additional
investments made in 1997.
     No provision for Federal income taxes has been made since the Company
intends to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the
provisions of Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. Accordingly, the Company will not be subject to Federal income taxes on
amounts distributed to shareholders provided it distributes at least 95% of its
real estate investment trust taxable income and meets certain other conditions.
     Funds from operations (FFO) for the year ended December 31, 1997 totaled
$58,815,000 an increase of $9.8 million over the $49.0 million for 1996. FFO is
net earnings available to common shareholders, excluding any gains or losses
from debt restructuring and sales of property, plus depreciation and
amortization associated with real estate investments and charges to earnings for
non-cash common stock based compensation. The 1997 growth in cash flow is
primarily due to the additional investments in 1997 and 1996 and the increase in
operating earnings before provisions for depreciation and amortization.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995
     Revenues for the year ended December 31, 1996 totaled $73,127,000,
increasing $11.7 million over 1995 revenues. The 1996 revenue growth stems
primarily from additional investments during 1995 and 1996. A partial year of
revenues from 1996 investments provided revenue increases of approximately $6.1
million, while a full year of revenues from 1995 investments added $3.8 million
to revenues. Additionally, approximately $1.4 million of the revenue growth
stems from participating incremental revenues which became effective during
1996.
     Total real estate investments of $594 million as of December 31, 1996 will
provide 1997 annualized operating revenues of $73.0 million. Revenues will
continue at this level until additional 1997 investments are made and additional
escalation provisions commence in 1997. Annualized revenues for 1997 represent
an $10.5 million increase over the 1996 annualized revenues of $62.5 million
based on investments of $516 million as of January 1, 1996.
     Expenses for the year ended December 31, 1996 totaled $38,537,000,
increasing $6.6 million over expenses of $31.9 million for 1995. The 1996
provision for depreciation and amortization of real estate totaled $13,693,000,
increasing $698,000 over 1995. This increase stems from additional investments
funded in 1995 and 1996.
     Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1996 was approximately
$20,836,000, compared with $15.3 million for 1995. The increase in interest
expense is due to higher average borrowings of approximately $88 million, offset
by lower interest rates and reduced amortization of debt issue costs.
     General and administrative expenses for 1996 totaled $4,008,000 or
approximately 5.5% of revenues as compared to 5.9% for 1995. The 1996 percentage
decrease relates to economies of scale stemming from additional investments made
in 1996 and 1995.
     Funds from operations available for distribution for 1996 were $48,989,000,
an increase of $5.5 million from the $43.5 million for 1995. Funds from
operations for the year ended December 31, 1996 totaled $49,008,000, an increase
of $6.0 million over the $43.0 million for 1995. The 1996 growth in cash flow is
primarily due to the additional investments in 1996 and 1995 and the related
increase in operating earnings before provisions for depreciation and
amortization.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
     The Company continually seeks new investments in healthcare properties,
primarily long-term care facilities, with the objective of profitable growth and
further diversification of the investment portfolio. Permanent financing for
future investments is expected to be provided through a combination of private
and public offerings of debt and equity securities. Management believes the
Company's liquidity and sources of available capital are adequate to finance
operations, fund future investments, and meet debt service requirements.
     At December 31, 1997, the Company has a strong financial position with
total assets of $816.1 million, shareholders' equity of $468.2 million, and
long-term debt of $271.5 million, representing approximately 33% of total
capitalization. Long-term debt excludes funds borrowed under its acquisi-

                                     F-4
<PAGE>   5


tion credit agreement. The Company anticipates eventually attaining and then
maintaining a long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio of approximately 40%. The
Company has a $200 million acquisition credit facility, of which $58.3 million
was drawn at year end and an additional $64.8 million was subsequently drawn
through February 19, 1998.
     In February 1997, the Company filed a Form S-4 shelf registration statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering common stock totaling
$100 million to be issued in connection with future property acquisitions.
Additionally, on August 29, 1997 the Company filed a Form S-3 registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission permitting the issuance of
up to $200 million related to common stock, unspecified debt, preferred stock
and convertible securities.
     The Company has demonstrated a strong capacity to access the capital
markets, raising more than $1 billion in capital since it was organized in 1992.
The Company has raised more than $450 million in equity, including $130 million
from the initial public offering in 1992, $73 million from a follow-on common
stock offering in 1994, $165 million from the HEP acquisition in 1994 and two
additional offerings, the latest being the $57.5 million issuance of preferred
stock in April 1997. Over $600 million of debt capital has been raised, some of
which has been used to retire secured borrowing debt with higher interest rates.
In 1996, the Company completed a placement of $95 million of 8.5% Convertible
Subordinated Debentures due 2001. In August 1997 the Company completed a $100
million 10-year senior note offering priced to yield 6.99%. In September 1997
the Company executed a Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement with its banks
which provides for total borrowings of up to $200 million, reduces interest
rates from previous levels, and extends the term of the agreement to September
2000.
     The Company distributes a large portion of the cash available from
operations. Cash dividends paid totaled $2.58 per share for 1997 compared with
$2.46 per share for the year ended December 31, 1996. The dividend pay-out
ratio, that is the ratio of per share amounts for dividends paid to the diluted
per share amount of funds from operations, was approximately 86% for 1997,
compared with 89% for 1996, and 88% for 1995. The Company believes that cash
provided from quarterly operating activities at current levels will continue to
be sufficient to fund normal working capital requirements and pay 1998 dividends
at a quarterly rate of $0.67 per share as declared at the January 15, 1998 Board
of Directors meeting. Approximately 45-50% of incremental cash flow from
operations is retained annually through gradual reductions in the dividend
payout ratio, to fund additional investments and provide financial flexibility.
     New investments generally are funded from borrowings under the Company's
acquisition credit agreement. Interest cost incurred by the Company on
borrowings under the acquisition line will vary depending upon fluctuations in
prime and/or LIBOR rates, and upon changes in the Company's ratings by national
agencies. Borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.00% or, at the Company's
option at the prime rate. The Company expects to periodically replace funds
drawn on the acquisition credit agreement through fixed-rate long-term
borrowings, the placement of convertible debentures, or the issuance of
additional shares of capital stock. Historically, the Company's strategy has
been to match the maturity of its indebtedness with the maturity of its assets
and to employ fixed-rate long-term debt to the extent practicable.

YEAR 2000 IMPLICATIONS
     The Company has assessed its current computer software for proper
functioning with respect to dates in the year 2000 and thereafter. The year 2000
issue and related costs are not expected to have a material impact on the
operations of the Company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
OMEGA HEALTHCARE INVESTORS, INC.


1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION
     Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on March
31, 1992, in the State of Maryland to (a) own and lease, and (b) provide
mortgage financing secured by income-producing healthcare facilities, with a
principal focus on diversified investments in long-term care facilities located
primarily in the United States.
     The Company's operations commenced on August 14, 1992, the date of the
closing of the Company's initial public offering. It has elected to be taxed as
a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company intends to continue to qualify as
such and, therefore, will distribute at least 95% of its real estate investment
trust taxable income to its shareholders.
     In 1995, the Company began to provide advisory services to Principal
Healthcare Finance Limited, a Company which owns and leases nursing homes in the
United Kingdom. (See Note 4.)

CONSOLIDATION
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of all material intercompany
accounts and transactions.

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS
     As of December 31, 1997 the Company's real estate investments include
interests in 3 medical office buildings, 2 rehabilitation hospitals and 258
long-term care facilities, operated by 29 independent operators.
     Investments in real estate properties and mortgage notes are recorded at
cost and original mortgage amount, respectively. The cost of the properties
acquired is allocated between land and buildings based generally upon
independent appraisals. Depreciation for buildings is recorded on the
straight-line basis, using estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 39 years.
The Company considers the need to provide for reserves for potential losses on
its investments based on management's periodic review of its portfolio. On the
basis of this review to date, a provision for losses on investments has not been
deemed necessary.

CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
     Short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity
date of three months or less when purchased. These investments are stated at
cost which approximates fair value.

NON-COMPETE AGREEMENTS AND GOODWILL
     Non-compete agreements and the excess of the purchase price over the value
of tangible net assets acquired (i.e., goodwill from the purchase of Health
Equity Properties Incorporated) is amortized on a straight-line basis over
periods ranging from five to ten years. Accumulated amortization was $5,277,000
and $3,653,000 at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS
     Deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
terms of the related borrowings. Amortization of financing costs totaling
$829,000, $524,000 and $1,072,000 in 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively, is
classified as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Unamortized deferred financing costs applicable to debt which is converted to
common stock are charged to paid-in capital at the date of conversion.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
     Rental income and mortgage interest income is recognized as earned over the
terms of the related master leases and mortgage notes, respectively. Such income
includes periodic increases based on pre-determined formulas as defined in the
master leases and mortgage loan agreements. Certain mortgage agreements include
provisions for deferred interest which is not payable by the borrower until
maturity of the related note. The portion of deferred interest recognized as
earned approximates $614,000, $608,000 and $602,000 in 1997, 1996, and 1995,
respectively.

                                     F-9
<PAGE>   10
FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES
     As a qualified real estate investment trust, the Company will not be
subject to Federal income taxes on its income, and no provisions for Federal
income taxes have been made. The reported amounts of the Company's assets and
liabilities as of December 31, 1997 exceeds the tax basis of assets by
approximately $70 million.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
     Net earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the respective periods. Per share amounts for
prior periods have been restated as required by Financial Accounting Standards
Board Statement No. 128. Among the changes stemming from the new pronouncement
is a requirement to present both basic and diluted per share amounts. Diluted
earnings per share amounts reflect the dilutive effect of stock options of
52,394 shares, 44,240 shares and 9,501 shares for 1997, 1996, and 1995,
respectively. The assumed conversion of debentures is not materially dilutive.

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
     The Company grants stock options to employees and directors with an
exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of the grant.
In accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, compensation expense is not recognized for these stock
option grants.

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2. REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES
     The Company's real estate properties, represented by 178 long-term care
facilities, 3 medical office buildings and 2 rehabilitation hospitals at
December 31, 1997, are leased under provisions of master leases with initial
terms ranging from 8 to 17 years, plus renewal options. Substantially all of the
master leases provide for minimum annual rentals which are subject to annual
increases based upon increases in the Consumer Price Index or increases in
revenues of the underlying properties, with certain maximum limits. Under the
terms of the leases, the lessee is responsible for all maintenance, repairs,
taxes and insurance on the leased properties.
     A summary of the Company's investment in real estate properties is as
follows:

3. MORTGAGE NOTES RECEIVABLE
     Mortgage notes receivable relate to 80 long-term care facilities. The
mortgage notes are secured by first mortgage liens on the borrowers' underlying
real estate and personal property. On an ongoing basis, management reviews
mortgage notes for collectibility. Based on management's review, no provision
for loss is considered necessary. The following table summarizes the changes in
mortgage notes during 1997 and 1996:

     The stated interest rates indicated above for Participating Mortgages and
Convertible Participating Mortgages are subject to annual increases based upon
increases in the Consumer Price Index or increases in revenues of the underlying
long-term care facilities, with certain maximum limits. Certain of the mortgage
notes, designated as "Convertible Participating" also permit the Company to
convert the note into ownership of the related real and personal property.
Conversions would generally result in purchase/leaseback transactions with
annual economic benefit to the Company substantially the same as under the
mortgage notes.
     The estimated fair value of the Company's mortgage loans at December 31,
1997 is approximately $248,433,000. Fair value is based on the estimates of
management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans.
     On the basis of contractual provisions of the various agreements, the
principal balances of mortgage notes receivable as of December 31, 1997 are
expected to mature or to be converted to purchase/leaseback transactions
approximately as follows: $4,368,000 in 1998, $2,064,000 in 1999, $29,358,000 in
2000, $13,664,000 in 2001, $61,657,000 in 2002, and $107,242,000 thereafter.

4. INVESTMENT IN PRINCIPAL HEALTHCARE FINANCE LIMITED AND OMEGA WORLDWIDE, INC.
     In July, 1995, the Company formed and provided the initial funding for
Principal Healthcare Finance Limited ("Principal"), an Island of Jersey based
company organized to purchase and lease back nursing homes in the United
Kingdom. The Company's initial funding for Principal included approximately
$24,000,000 in the form of a Sterling denominated subordinated loan due December
31, 2000. The Company manages and provides advisory services to Principal under
a renewable contract. In October 1996, Principal completed a private placement
of equity to unaffiliated investors. Following the completion of that placement,
the Company owns directly or indirectly non-voting ordinary shares of Principal,
with total equity investment approximating $7,000,000. The Company's non-voting
ownership interest is stated on the basis of cost. At December 31, 1997,
Principal owns and leases 154 nursing homes acquired at a cost of approximately
$354 million.
     In July, 1997, the Company provided Principal a guarantee of borrowings of
up to (pound)46 million (approximately $75 million), pending its placement of
permanent financing for the purchase of nursing home facilities from a public
company which operated nursing homes in the United Kingdom. Principal has
borrowed substantially all the funds available subject to such guarantee. The
Company received a fee for this guarantee of approximately $360,000 and the
nursing home facilities have been leased to third party nursing home operators.
Principal completed permanent financing for these facilities on February 27,
1998, thereby removing the requirement for the Company's guarantee.
     In November 1997 the Company formed Omega Worldwide, Inc., a company which
will provide investment advisory services to and hold equity and debt interests
in real estate companies engaged in providing sale/leaseback and other capital
financing to healthcare providers throughout the world. In connection with the
formation of Omega Worldwide, Inc., the Company will receive 8.5 million shares
of Omega Worldwide, Inc. common stock in exchange for substantially all of the
interests which the Company now has with respect to Principal, including: (a)
3,337,500 Class A voting ordinary shares of Principal and warrants to purchase
10 million Class B non-voting ordinary shares of Principal expiring June 30,
2001 at an exercise price of (pound)1.50 (approximately $2.40) per share and
554,583 Class A ordinary shares of Principal expiring December 31, 2000 at an
exercise price of (pound)1.00 (approximately $1.60) per share; (b) the Company's
right to payment of (pound)15 million (approximately $24 million) from the
Sterling denominated subordinated loan; (c) the Company's interest in a ten-year
British pound currency swap contract under which Omega Worldwide, Inc. will have
the right to exchange (pound)20,000,000 for $31,740,000 on October 15, 2007; and
(d) the Advisory Services Agreement between the Company and Principal.
     Omega Worldwide, Inc. has filed a Registration Statement with respect to
rights to acquire 2,250,000 shares of its common stock and 2.3 million shares to
be sold in a secondary offering by the Company. Each common shareholder of the
Company will receive a pro-rata share of approximately 5.2 million common shares
of Omega Worldwide, Inc. and will be eligible to receive a portion of the 2.25
million rights to purchase Omega Worldwide, Inc. common stock. The Company will
retain a 9% interest in Omega Worldwide, Inc. The date of the distribution of
Omega Worldwide, Inc. shares has not been set since it depends upon, among other
matters, the date of approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of
the date of the distribution, the cost of assets transferred to Omega Worldwide,
Inc., less the net proceeds of the secondary offering received by the Company,
will be charged to shareholders' equity in the form of a special dividend.
Management estimates the special dividend will approximate $15 million.

5. CONCENTRATION OF RISK
     As of December 31, 1997, 94% of the Company's real estate investments
related to long-term care facilities. The Company's facilities are located in 26
states and are operated by 29 independent healthcare operating companies.
Approximately 63% of the Company's real estate investments are operated by 7
public companies: Sun Healthcare Group, Inc., (29.2%), Advocat, Inc. (14.5%),
Paragon Health Network, Inc. (formerly GranCare, Inc.) (7.5%), Unison Healthcare
Corp. (5.7%), Res-Care, Inc. (3.7%), Integrated Health Services, Inc. (1.4%) and
CMS Health South (formerly Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp.) (1.4%). Of the
remaining 22 independent operators, none operate investments in facilities
representing more than 6.2% of the total real estate investments.
     As of December 31, 1997, Unison Healthcare Corp. (Unison), was in default
of certain provisions of its lease agreements and mortgages with the Company. In
January, 1998, BritWill I and BritWill II, two subsidiaries of Unison, filed for
bankruptcy protection from creditors. The Company leased to these subsidiaries
fourteen facilities located in Indiana and Texas, and has made a mortgage loan
that is secured by first mortgages on six facilities located in Texas. The
Company's total investment approximates $45 million related to approximately
2,000 beds. Prior to bankruptcy filings by the Unison subsidiaries, the Company
terminated the leases and accelerated the mortgage loan indebtedness due to
non-payment of rents and interest totaling approximately $1.5 million. The
Company also has instituted foreclosure proceedings with respect to the
mortgages and filed suit in federal court in Texas against Unison and the
Chairman of the Board of Directors of Unison to enforce their respective
guarantees to the Company of obligations under the leases and the mortgage loan
documents. To date in the bankruptcy proceeding the parties have stipulated that
the Unison subsidiaries will pay to the Company a monthly payment for occupancy
in an amount equal to the rent that would have been payable by the BritWill
subsidiaries under the leases. In January, 1998, the Company applied $1.6
million of security deposits to the mortgage interest and principal outstanding.
The Company continues to hold approximately $2.3 million in liquidity and
security deposits to secure obligations under the leases and the mortgage loan
documents and continues to pursue its remedies against Unison and its chairman
under their respective guarantees. Annual rents and interest from the Unison
subsidiaries total approximately 5.9% of annualized revenues at December 31,
1997.

6. LIQUIDITY DEPOSITS AND ADDITIONAL SECURITY
     Liquidity deposits and letters of credit received from certain operators
pursuant to leases and mortgages total $26,835,000 at December 31, 1997. These
generally represent the initial monthly rental and mortgage interest income for
periods ranging from three to six months with respect to certain of the
investments. The deposits consist of $13,965,000 held by the company, $5,047,000
held by escrow agents, and $7,823,000 in the form of letters of credit.
     Additional security for rental and mortgage interest revenue from operators
is provided by covenants regarding minimum working capital and net worth, liens
on accounts receivable and other operating assets of the operators, provisions
for cross default, provisions for cross collateralization and by
corporate/personal guarantees.

7. BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS
     On September 30, 1997, the Company consummated an amended and restated loan
agreement for a $200,000,000 unsecured revolving line of credit facility. Under
the restated agreement, which expires in September, 2000, the Company may use
the equivalent of $50,000,000 of the commitment for Sterling denominated
borrowings. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.00% or,
at the Company's option at the prime rate. Permitted borrowings under the
agreement are based upon levels of eligible real estate investments. Borrowings
of $58,300,000 at December 31, 1997 bear interest at a rate of 7.04% and
borrowings of $6,000,000 at December 31, 1996 bear interest at 7.43%.

     In 1995, the Company exchanged 9.88% Senior Subordinated Collateralized
Mortgage Accrual Notes and 7.11% Senior Mortgage Collateralized Notes for 10%
and 7.4% Unsecured Notes due July 15, 2000. The effective interest rate for the
new unsecured notes is 8.8%, with interest-only payments due semi-annually
through July 2000.
     On January 24, 1996, the Company issued $95 million of 8.5% Convertible
Subordinated Debentures (the Debentures) due 2001. The Debentures are
convertible at any time into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of
$28.625 per share. The Debentures are unsecured obligations of the Company and
are subordinate in right and payment to the Company's senior unsecured
indebtedness. As of December 31, 1997 there were 2,182,882 shares reserved for
issuance under the Debentures.
     On August 5, 1997 the Company completed a $100 million public offering of
unsecured 6.95% notes due 2007. The notes were priced to yield 6.99% with
interest paid semi-annually.
     Real estate investments with an original cost of approximately $33,259,000
are secured by outstanding secured borrowings totaling $22,261,000 at December
31, 1997. These borrowings are payable in aggregate monthly installments of
approximately $215,000, including interest at rates ranging from 8.3% to 9.7%.
     Assuming none of the Company's borrowing arrangements are refinanced,
converted or prepaid prior to maturity, required principal payments for each of
the five years following December 31, 1997 and the aggregate due thereafter are

     Fair value estimates are subjective in nature and are dependent on a number
of important assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows, risks,
discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each
financial instrument. The use of different market assumptions and estimation
methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value
amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented above are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market
exchange.
     On October 15, 1997, the Company entered into a 10-year forward contract to
exchange (pound)20,000,000 at a rate of $1.587 per British Pound Sterling. This
contract was entered into in order to hedge the currency risk associated with
the Company's investment in Principal. The carrying value of the investment in
Principal is based on the rate established in the forward exchange contract.
Foreign exchange rate contracts mitigate the risk of currency movements because
any gain or loss on the contract offsets any losses or gains, respectively, on
the investment in Principal and other assets denominated in British Pounds
Sterling.

9. RETIREMENT ARRANGEMENTS
     The Company has a 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan covering all eligible
employees. Under the Plan, employees are eligible to make contributions, and the
Company, at its discretion, may match contributions and make a profit sharing
contribution.
     In 1993, the Company adopted the 1993 Retirement Plan for Directors, an
unfunded plan covering all members of the Board of Directors upon completion of
not less than five years service on the Board. The benefits payable upon
retirement from the Board are based on years of service and the director fees in
effect as of the date the director ceases to be a member of the Board.
     In 1993, the Company also adopted the 1993 Deferred Compensation Plan which
covers all eligible employees and members of the Board. Under this unfunded
plan, the Company may award units which result in participation in the dividends
and future growth in the value of Company's common stock. The total number of
units permitted by the plan is 200,000. Units awarded to eligible participants
(59,000 units and 63,500 at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively) vest over
a period of five years based on the participant's initial service date.
     Provisions charged to operations with respect to these retirement
arrangements totaled $667,000 in 1997, $654,000 in 1996, and $366,000 in 1995.

10. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND STOCK OPTIONS
     In April, 1997 the Company issued 2.3 million shares of 9.25% Series A
Cumulative Preferred Stock at $25 per share. Dividends on the Preferred Stock
are cumulative from the date of original issue and are payable quarterly. The
Preferred Stock, which carries a liquidation preference of $25 per share, is
redeemable on or after July 1, 2002 at the option of the Company, at a
redemption price of $25 per share plus dividends accrued and unpaid at the
redemption date. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock generally have no voting
rights.
     Under the terms of the 1993 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan as
amended in 1995, the company reserved 750,000 shares of common stock for grants
to be issued during a period of up to 10 years. Directors, officers, and key
employees are eligible to participate in the Plan. The Company


                                     F-15
<PAGE>   16


has submitted for shareholder approval an amendment to the Plan to increase the
number of shares available under the Plan to 1,100,000. Options for 739,415
shares have been granted to eligible participants, including options for
approximately 57,000 shares granted in December, 1997 subject to shareholder
approval of the 1998 amendment. Additionally, 67,263 shares of restricted stock
have been granted under the provisions of the Plan. The market value of the
restricted shares on the date of the award has been recorded as unearned
compensation-restricted stock, with the unamortized balance shown as a separate
component of shareholders' equity. Unearned compensation is amortized to expense
over the vesting period, with charges to operations of $402,000, $240,000 and
$253,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

     The following is a summary of activity under the plan.

</TABLE>

     At December 31, 1997, options currently exercisable (208,808) have a
weighted average exercise price of $24.205. There were no shares available for
future grants as of December 31, 1997. At December 31, 1996 options currently
exercisable (155,162) have a weighted average exercise price of $23.42. Shares
available for future grants as of December 31, 1996 were 426,591.
     In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation." This standard prescribes a fair value based method of accounting
for employee stock options or similar equity instruments and requires certain
pro forma disclosures. For purposes of the pro forma disclosures required under
Statement 123, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense
over the option's vesting period. Based on the Company's option activity, net
earnings and net earnings per share on a pro forma basis does not differ
significantly from that determined under APB 25. The estimated weighted average
fair value of options granted in 1997 and 1996 was $1.3 million and $0.2
million, respectively. In determining the estimated fair value of the Company's
stock options as of the date of grant, a Black-Scholes option pricing model was
used with the following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rates
of 6.5%; a dividend yield of 6.75%; volatility factors of the expected market
price of the Company's common stock at 15%; and a weighted-average expected life
of the options of 8 years.
     The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

11. DIVIDENDS
     In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, the Company must,
among other requirements, distribute at least 95% of its real estate investment
trust taxable income to its shareholders. Per share common dividend payments by
the Company were characterized in the following manner for income tax purposes:

13. EXTRAORDINARY CHARGE FOR PREPAYMENT OF DEBT
     During 1995, the Company entered into three transactions to prepay various
secured borrowings. The Company consummated a $100,000,000 unsecured line of
credit to replace a $60,000,000 secured line of credit. Also, as discussed in
Note 7, the Company redeemed its outstanding senior mortgage notes through the
issuance of unsecured notes. The prepayment of these borrowings resulted in an
extraordinary charge of $6,479,000, representing the fees and costs associated
with the prepayment and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

14. LITIGATION
     The Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims which arise
in the ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management, the amount
of ultimate liability, if any, with respect to these actions will not materially
affect the consolidated financial position.

15. COMMITMENTS
     The Company has commitments, subject to certain conditions, to provide
additional financing totaling approximately $68 million as of December 31, 1997.

16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
     A quarterly dividend of $.67 per common share was declared by the Board of
Directors on January 22, 1998, payable on February 13, 1998 to shareholders of
record on January 30, 1998. In addition, the Board declared a regular quarterly
dividend of $.578 per share to be paid on February 13, 1998 to Series A
Cumulative Preferred shareholders of record on January 30, 1998.
     On January 27, 1998 the Board of Directors set the record date of February
1, 1998 for the distribution of Omega Worldwide, Inc. shares (see Note 4).
     On January 14, 1998, the Company purchased five nursing homes containing
628 nursing beds in Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire for a
total of $44,900,000. Simultaneously, the Company entered into lease agreements
with Lyric Health Care Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lyric Health
Care LLC, an affiliate of Integrated Health Services, Inc. (NYSE: IHS). The
initial term of the lease is thirteen years, at initial rents of $4,490,000
annually.
     On February 27, 1998, Principal completed financing of (pound)61 million
related to it's acquisition of certain nursing homes during June, 1997, thereby
removing the requirement for the Company's guarantee of up to (pound)46 million
of Principal's borrowings (see Note 4).

Board of Directors
Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.



     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Omega
Healthcare Investors, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997, and 1996
and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Omega
Healthcare Investors, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1997 and 1996, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.
