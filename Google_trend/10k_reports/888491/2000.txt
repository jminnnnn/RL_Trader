                                     PART I

Item 1 -- Business of the Company

    Omega  Healthcare  Investors,  Inc. (the "Company") was  incorporated in the
state of  Maryland  on March 31,  1992.  It is a  self-administered  real estate
investment   trust  ("REIT")  which  invests  in   income-producing   healthcare
facilities,  principally long-term care facilities located in the United States.
The Company  anticipates  providing  lease or mortgage  financing for healthcare
facilities to qualified operators and acquiring  additional  healthcare facility
types,  including assisted living and acute care facilities.  Financing for such
future  investments may be provided by borrowings under the Company's  revolving
line of credit,  private  placements or public offerings of debt or equity,  the
assumption of secured  indebtedness,  or a  combination  of these  methods.  The
Company also may finance  acquisitions through the exchange of properties or the
issuance of shares of its capital stock, if such transactions  otherwise satisfy
the Company's investment criteria.

    During 1995,  the Company became a primary  sponsor of Principal  Healthcare
Finance  Limited  ("Principal"),  an Isle of  Jersey  (United  Kingdom)  company
established   to  provide   sale/leaseback   and   mortgage   financing  to  the
private-sector healthcare industry in the United Kingdom.

    In November 1997, the Company formed Omega Worldwide, Inc. ("Worldwide"),  a
company  which  provides  asset  management  services  and  management  advisory
services,  as well as  equity  and  debt  capital  to the  healthcare  industry,
particularly  residential  healthcare  services to the elderly. On April 2, 1998
the Company  contributed  substantially all of its Principal assets to Worldwide
in exchange for  approximately  8.5 million shares of Worldwide common stock and
260,000 shares of Series B preferred stock. Of the 8,500,000 shares of Worldwide
received by the Company,  approximately  5,200,000 were  distributed on April 2,
1998 to the  shareholders of the Company on the basis of one Worldwide share for
every 3.77 common shares of the Company held by  shareholders  of the Company on
the record  date of  February  1, 1998.  Of the  remaining  3,300,000  shares of
Worldwide received by the Company,  2,300,000 shares were sold by the Company on
April 3, 1998 for net  proceeds  of  approximately  $16,250,000  in a  secondary
offering pursuant to a registration statement of Worldwide.  The market value of
the distribution to shareholders  approximated $39 million or $1.99 per share. A
non-recurring  gain of  $30.2  million  was  recorded  on the  distribution  and
secondary offerings of Worldwide common shares during 1998.  (See Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements).

    As of December 31,  1999,  the Company  holds an  $8,015,000  investment  in
Worldwide  represented by 1,163,000 shares of common stock and 260,000 shares of
Preferred stock. It also holds a $1,615,000  investment in Principal represented
by 990,000 ordinary shares of Principal.

    The Company and  Worldwide  have  entered into an  Opportunity  Agreement to
provide each other with rights to participate in certain  transactions  and make
certain  investments.  The Opportunity  Agreement  provides,  subject to certain
terms,  that,  regardless of whether the following kinds of investments  (each a
"REIT Opportunity") first come to the attention of the Company or Worldwide, the
Company will have the right to: make any investment within the United States (a)
in real estate, real estate mortgages,  real estate derivatives or entities that
invest  exclusively  in or have a substantial  portion of their assets in any of
the foregoing,  so long as the Company's REIT status would not be jeopardized by
the  investment;  and (b)  that,  if made by a REIT,  would  not  result  in the
termination of the REIT's status as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the
Internal  Revenue  Code  ("Code").  However,  Worldwide  will  have  the  right,
regardless  of whether the  following  kinds of  investments  (each a "Worldwide
Opportunity")  first come to the attention of the Company or Worldwide,  to: (a)
provide  advisory  services  and/or   management   services  to  any  healthcare
investors,  wherever located; (b) acquire or make debt and/or equity investments
(through  a  joint  venture  or  otherwise)  in any  healthcare  investor  or in
healthcare  real  estate-related  assets  outside  the United  States;  (c) make
investments in any entity  conducting  healthcare  operations;  and (d) make any
other real estate,  finance or other investments not customarily undertaken by a
qualified REIT. If Worldwide declines to pursue a Worldwide Opportunity, it must
offer that  opportunity to the Company,  and if the Company declines to pursue a
REIT  Opportunity,  it must offer that  opportunity  to  Worldwide.  Each of the
Company  and  Worldwide  may  participate,   in  its  discretion,  in  any  REIT
Opportunity or Worldwide Opportunity that the other requests be pursued jointly.
The terms upon which each of the Company and Worldwide  elect to  participate in
such an  opportunity  will be  negotiated  in good  faith  and must be  mutually
acceptable to the  respective  boards of directors of the Company and Worldwide,

                                       1
<PAGE>

with  the  affirmative  votes  of the  independent  directors  of the  board  of
directors of the Company and  Worldwide.  Each of the Company and  Worldwide has
agreed  to  notify  the  other of and make  available  to the  other  investment
opportunities  developed by such party or of which such party  becomes aware but
is unable or unwilling to pursue.  The  Opportunity  Agreement has a term of ten
years and automatically renews for successive five-year terms unless terminated.
In response to an opportunity  offered to the Company by Worldwide,  the Company
acquired  the  equivalent  of up to  9.9%  of the  common  shares  of  Principal
Healthcare Finance Trust ("the Trust"),  an Australian Unit Trust, which owns 40
nursing home facilities and 475 assisted living units in New South Wales.

    As of December 31, 1999,  the  Company's  portfolio of domestic  investments
consisted of 211 long-term care  facilities,  3 medical  office  buildings and 2
rehabilitation  hospitals. The Company owns and leases 147 long-term facilities,
3  medical  office  buildings  and  2  rehabilitation  hospitals,  and  provides
mortgages, including participating and convertible participating mortgages on 64
long-term  healthcare  facilities.  The  facilities are located in 28 states and
operated  by  24  unaffiliated  operators.   The  Company's  gross  real  estate
investments at December 31, 1999 totaled $892 million.

    The Company  initiated  a plan during 1998 to dispose of certain  properties
judged to have limited incremental  potential and to re-deploy the proceeds from
sale. Following a review of the portfolio, assets identified for sale had a cost
of $95 million, a net carrying value of $83 million,  and annualized revenues of
approximately  $11.4 million.  After  consideration  of the results of sales and
other developments identified as part of the continuing evaluation of the assets
held for sale,  the Company  recorded a provision for impairment of $6.8 million
to adjust the  carrying  value of those  assets  judged to be  impaired to their
estimated fair value, less cost of disposal.  During 1998, the Company completed
sales of two groups of assets,  yielding  sales proceeds of  $42,036,000.  Gains
realized in the dispositions approximated $2.8 million.

    During  1999,  new  investments  approximated  $103  million  as a result of
entering into  sale/leaseback  transactions  and making mortgage loans and other
investments.  Also during 1999, the Company  completed  asset sales yielding net
proceeds of $18.2  million.  In 1999 a loss of $10.5  million was  recognized on
these  assets.  In the 1999  fourth  quarter,  management  initiated  a plan for
additional asset sales. The assets  identified as for sale in 1999 had a cost of
$33.8 million,  a net carrying amount of $28.6 million and annualized revenue of
approximately  $3.4 million.  As a result of this review, the Company recorded a
provision for impairment of $19.5 million to adjust the carrying value of assets
targeted for sale to their  estimated  fair value,  less cost of  disposal.  The
Company is committed to sell the remaining facilities as soon as practicable.

    At January  15,  1999 the  Company  employed  28  full-time  employees.  The
executive  offices of the Company are located at 900 Victors Way, Suite 350, Ann
Arbor, Michigan, 48108. Its telephone number is (734) 887-0200.

Investment Objectives

    The  investment  objectives of the Company are to pay regular cash dividends
to shareholders;  to provide the opportunity for increased dividends from annual
increases in rental and interest  income from  revenue  participations  and from
portfolio growth; to preserve and protect shareholders'  capital; and to provide
the opportunity to realize capital growth.

    Given  the  current  challenging  operating  environment  and the  Company's
limited  access to new equity  capital,  the  Company may invest  through  joint
ventures or partnerships with capital partners rather than directly.

Investment Strategies and Policies

    The Company maintains a diversified portfolio of income-producing healthcare
facilities  or  mortgages  thereon,  with a  primary  focus  on  long-term  care
facilities  located in the United  States.  In making  investments,  the Company
generally seeks and intends to focus on established, creditworthy, middle-market
healthcare  operators  which  meet  the  Company's  standards  for  quality  and
experience of  management.  Although the Company has  emphasized  long-term care
investments,  it intends to diversify  prudently  into other types of healthcare
facilities or other  properties.  The Company seeks to diversify its investments
in terms of geographic locations, operators and facility types.

    In evaluating potential investments,  the Company considers such factors as:
(i) the quality and  experience of management  and the credit  worthiness of the

                                       2
<PAGE>

operator of the facility; (ii) the facility's historical, current and forecasted
cash flow and its adequacy to meet operational needs,  capital  expenditures and
lease or debt  service  obligations,  while  providing a  competitive  return on
investment to the Company; (iii) the construction quality,  condition and design
of the facility;  (iv) the  geographic  area and type of facility;  (v) the tax,
growth,  regulatory and reimbursement  environment of the community in which the
facility  is  located;  (vi) the  occupancy  and demand for  similar  healthcare
facilities  in the same or  nearby  communities;  and  (vii)  the  payor  mix of
private, Medicare and Medicaid patients.

    A fundamental  investment  strategy of the Company is to obtain  contractual
rent  escalations  under  long-term,  non-cancelable,  "triple-net"  leases  and
revenue  participation  through  participating  mortgage  loans,  and to  obtain
substantial  liquidity  deposits.  Additional  security is typically provided by
covenants  regarding  minimum working  capital and net worth,  liens on accounts
receivable and other operating assets, and various provisions for cross-default,
cross-collateralization and corporate/personal guarantees, when appropriate.

    The Company  prefers to invest in equity  ownership  of  properties.  Due to
regulatory,   tax  or  other  considerations,   the  Company  sometimes  pursues
alternative  investment  structures,  including  convertible  participating  and
participating mortgages,  that achieve returns comparable to equity investments.
The  following  summarizes  the four primary  structures  currently  used by the
Company:

    Purchase/Leaseback.  The Company's  owned  properties  are generally  leased
under  provisions of leases for terms  ranging from 8 to 17 years,  plus renewal
options.  The leases  originated  by the Company  generally  provide for minimum
annual rentals which are subject to annual formula  increases (i.e.,  based upon
such factors as increases  in the Consumer  Price Index  ("CPI") or increases in
the  revenues of the  underlying  properties),  with certain  fixed  minimum and
maximum  levels.  Generally,  the operator  holds an option to repurchase at set
dates at prices based on specified  formulas.  The average annualized yield from
leases was 11.42% at January 1, 2000.

    Convertible Participating Mortgage.  Convertible Participating Mortgages are
secured by first  mortgage  liens on the  underlying  real  estate and  personal
property  of the  mortgagor.  Interest  rates  are  usually  subject  to  annual
increases  based upon  increases  in the CPI or  increases  in  revenues  of the
underlying long-term care facilities,  with certain maximum limits.  Convertible
Participating  Mortgages  afford the Company an option to convert  its  mortgage
into direct  ownership of the  property,  generally at a point six to nine years
from  inception;  they are then  subject to a leaseback  to the operator for the
balance of the original agreed term and for the original  agreed  participations
in revenues or CPI adjustments.  This allows the Company to capture a portion of
the  potential  appreciation  in value of the real estate.  The operator has the
right to buy out the Company's option at prices based on specified formulas. The
average annualized yield on these mortgages was approximately 13.08 % at January
1, 2000.

    Participating  Mortgage.   Participating  Mortgages  are  secured  by  first
mortgage  liens on the  underlying  real  estate and  personal  property  of the
mortgagor.  Interest rates are usually  subject to annual  increases  based upon
increases in the CPI or increases in revenues of the  underlying  long-term care
facilities,  with certain maximum limits.  The average annualized yield on these
investments was approximately 13.01% at January 1, 2000.

    Fixed-Rate  Mortgage.  These  Mortgages  have a fixed  interest rate for the
mortgage term and are secured by first  mortgage  liens on the  underlying  real
estate and personal property of the mortgagor.  The average  annualized yield on
these investments was 11.17% at January 1, 2000.

regarding the Company's real estate properties,  their locations,  and the types
of investment structures as of December 31, 1999.

Borrowing Policies

    The  Company  may incur  additional  indebtedness  and  anticipates  it will
generally maintain a long-term  debt-to-capitalization ratio in the range of 40%
to 45%. The Company  intends to review  periodically  its policy with respect to
its  debt-to-equity  ratio  and to adapt  such  policy as its  management  deems
prudent  in  light of  prevailing  market  conditions.  The  Company's  strategy
generally has been to match the maturity of its  indebtedness  with the maturity
of  its  assets,  and  to  employ  long-term,  fixed-rate  debt  to  the  extent
practicable.

    The Company will use the proceeds of any additional  indebtedness to provide
permanent  financing for investments in additional  healthcare  facilities.  The
Company  may obtain  either  secured  or  unsecured  indebtedness,  which may be
convertible  into capital stock or accompanied  by warrants to purchase  capital
stock.  Where debt financing is present on terms deemed  favorable,  the Company
generally  may  invest in  properties  subject  to  existing  loans,  secured by
mortgages, deeds of trust or similar liens on properties.

    The  Company has an  unsecured  acquisition  line of credit  (the  revolving
credit  facility) which permits  borrowings of up to $200,000,000  and a secured
acquisition line of credit which permits borrowings of up to $50,000,000.  These
credit  facilities  provide  temporary  funds for new  investments in healthcare
facilities.  The  Company  intends to  periodically  replace  funds drawn on the
acquisition  lines through  long-term,  fixed-rate  borrowings,  the issuance of
equity linked borrowings, or the issuance of additional shares of capital stock.

    The Company has  approximately $80 million of indebtedness that matures July
15,  2000  and the  term of its  unsecured  revolving  credit  facility  expires
September 30, 2000. The Company  intends to extend the maturity of its revolving
credit  facility  and to  refinance  the  term  indebtedness  and may  fix  debt
represented by the revolving  credit  facility and liquidate  assets to pay such
indebtedness  or implement a plan which includes a combination of the foregoing.
There can be no assurance  the Company will be able to  successfully  extend the
maturity of its unsecured line of credit or implement  other  alternatives,  and
any  failure  to do so could lead to an Event of  Default  under  certain of the
Company's  indebtedness.   Industry  turmoil  and  continuing  adverse  economic
conditions  could  cause the terms on which the  Company  can obtain  additional
borrowings to become unfavorable.  If the Company is in need of capital to repay
indebtedness as it matures, the Company may be required to liquidate investments
in properties at times which may not permit  realization of the maximum recovery
on such  investments.  This also could result in adverse tax consequences to the
Company.

    Item 7 --  Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and
Results of Operations contains additional  information  concerning liquidity and
capital resources.

Government Healthcare Regulation and Reimbursements

    The healthcare industry is highly regulated by federal, state and local law,
and is  directly  affected  by state  and  local  licensure,  fines  and loss of
certification to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid  programs,  as well as
potential  criminal  penalties.  The  Balanced  Budget Act of 1997  (Budget Act)
enacted a number of anti-fraud and abuse  provisions and contains civil monetary
penalties for an operator's  violation of the anti-kickback laws. The Budget Act
also  imposes an  affirmative  duty on operators to ensure they do not employ or
contract with persons excluded from the Medicare or other governmental programs.
It also provides a minimum  ten-year period for exclusion for  participation  in
federal  healthcare  programs  for  operators  convicted  of a prior  healthcare
offense.

    Governmental   investigations   and  enforcement  of  healthcare  laws  have
increased dramatically and are expected to continue to increase. The increase in
governmental  investigations could have adverse effects on an operator's results
of  operations,  liquidity and financial  condition  which could also  adversely
affect an  operator's  ability to make timely  rent or interest  payments to the
Company.  Additionally,  the Budget Act, future healthcare  legislation or other
changes in administration or interpretation of governmental  healthcare programs
may have a material  adverse  effect on the  liquidity,  financial  condition or
results  of  operations  of the  Company's  operators,  which  could also have a
material  adverse effect on their ability to make rent and interest  payments to
the Company.

    Potential  Reduction  in Revenues  of  Lessees/Borrowers  Due to  Healthcare
Reform. All of the Company's properties are used as healthcare  facilities,  and
therefore,  the Company is directly  affected  by the risk  associated  with the
healthcare  industry.  The Company's lessees and mortgagors derive a substantial
portion of their net operating  revenues from third party payers,  including the
Medicare and Medicaid  programs.  Such programs are highly regulated and subject
to frequent and substantial changes.  Effective January 1, 1999, the majority of
skilled nursing facilities shifted from payments based on reimbursable cost to a
prospective   payment   system   (PPS)  for   services   provided   to  Medicare
beneficiaries. Implementation of PPS will affect each long-term care facility to
a different degree depending upon the amount of revenue it derives from Medicare
patients.  Long-term care facilities may need to restructure their operations to
operate profitably under the new Medicare PPS reimbursement.

     In  addition,   private  payers,   including   managed  care  payers,   are
increasingly   demanding   discounted  fee  structures  and  the  assumption  by
healthcare  providers of all or a portion of the  financial  risk of operating a
healthcare facility. Efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost
controls are expected to continue.  Any changes in reimbursement  policies which
reduce  reimbursement  levels could  adversely  affect revenues of the Company's
lessees and borrowers and thereby adversely affect those lessees' and borrowers'
abilities to make their monthly lease or debt payments to the Company.

    The  possibility  that the healthcare  facilities  will not generate  income
sufficient  to meet  operating  expenses or will yield  returns lower than those
available through investments in comparable real estate or other investments are
additional  risks of investing in  healthcare  related real estate.  Income from
properties  and yields from  investments  in such  properties may be affected by
many  factors,  including  changes in  governmental  regulation  (such as zoning
laws),  general or local economic  conditions  (such as fluctuations in interest
rates and  employment  conditions),  the  available  local supply and demand for
improved real estate, a reduction in rental income as the result of an inability
to maintain occupancy levels, natural disasters (such as earthquakes and floods)
or similar factors.

    Real estate  investments  are relatively  illiquid and,  therefore,  tend to
limit the ability of the Company to vary its  portfolio  promptly in response to
changes in economic or other  conditions.  All of the Company's  properties  are
"special  purpose"  properties  that could not be readily  converted  to general
residential,  retail or office use.  Healthcare  facilities that  participate in
Medicare  and/or  Medicaid  programs must meet extensive  program  requirements,
including  physical plant and operational  requirements,  which are revised from
time to  time.  Such  requirements  may  include  a duty to admit  Medicare  and
Medicaid patients,  limiting the ability of the facility to increase its private
pay census beyond certain limits. Medicare and Medicaid facilities are regularly
inspected to determine  compliance  and may be excluded  from the programs -- in
some cases without a prior hearing -- for failure to meet program  requirements.
Transfers  of  nursing  homes and other  healthcare-related  facilities  between
operators  are subject to  regulatory  approvals  not required for  transfers of
other types of commercial  operations  and other types of real estate.  Thus, if
the operation of any of the Company's  properties  becomes  unprofitable  due to
competition,  age of  improvements  or other  factors  such  that the  lessee or
borrower  becomes unable to meet its  obligations on the lease or mortgage loan,

                                       5
<PAGE>

the liquidation  value of the property may be substantially  less,  particularly
relative to the amount  owing on any related  mortgage  loan,  than would be the
case if the property were readily adaptable to other uses.

    Other changes in the healthcare  industry include  continuing  trends toward
shorter  lengths  of  stay,  increased  use of  outpatient  services,  increased
federal,  state and third party  regulation and oversight of healthcare  company
operations and business practices and increased demand for capitated  healthcare
services  (delivery  of services at a fixed price per capita  basis to a defined
group of covered parties). The entrance of insurance companies into managed care
programs  is  also   accelerating  the  introduction  of  managed  care  in  new
localities,  and states and insurance  companies  continue to negotiate actively
the amounts they will pay for services.  Moreover,  the percentage of healthcare
services that are reimbursed under Medicare and Medicaid  programs  continues to
increase as the population  ages and as states expand their  Medicaid  programs.
Continued  eligibility  to  participate  in  these  programs  is  crucial  to  a
provider's   financial   strength.   Finally,   healthcare   regulation  through
Certificates  of Need ("CON") has tended to limit  construction of new long-term
care  facilities  in many  states.  Several  states  in which  the  Company  has
investments have repealed CON legislation,  including California and Texas. As a
result of the  foregoing,  the  revenues  and  margins of the  operators  of the
Company's  facilities  may  decrease,  resulting in a reduction of the Company's
rent/interest coverage from investments.

Potential Risks from Bankruptcies

    Generally,  the  Company's  lease  arrangements  with a single  operator who
operates  more than one of the  Company's  facilities  is  pursuant  to a single
master lease (a "Master Lease" or collectively,  the "Master Leases").  Although
each lease or Master Lease  provides  that the Company may  terminate the Master
Lease upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the tenant, the Bankruptcy Reform Act
of  1978  ("Bankruptcy  Code")  provides  that  a  trustee  in a  bankruptcy  or
reorganization  proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code (or debtor-in-possession in
a  reorganization  under the  Bankruptcy  Code) has the power and the  option to
assume or reject the unexpired  lease  obligations  of a  debtor-lessee.  In the
event that the unexpired  lease is assumed on behalf of the  debtor-lessee,  all
the rental obligations thereunder generally would be entitled to a priority over
other unsecured claims.  However, the court also has the power to modify a lease
if  a  debtor-lessee  in a  reorganization  were  required  to  perform  certain
provisions of a lease that the court determined to be unduly  burdensome.  It is
not  possible to determine at this time whether or not any lease or Master Lease
contains any such provisions.  If a lease is rejected,  the lessor has a general
unsecured  claim  limited to any unpaid rent already due plus an amount equal to
the rent reserved under the lease, without acceleration,  for the greater of one
year or 15% of the remaining term of such lease,  not to exceed three years.  If
any  lease  is  rejected,   the  Company  may  also  lose  the  benefit  of  any
participation interest or conversion right.

    Generally,  with respect to the Company's  mortgage loans, the imposition of
an automatic stay under the Bankruptcy  Code precludes  lenders from  exercising
foreclosure  or other remedies  against the debtor.  A mortgagee also is treated
differently  from a landlord in three key respects.  First, the mortgage loan is
not subject to assumption or rejection  because it is not an executory  contract
or a lease.  Second, the mortgagee's loan may be divided into (1) a secured loan
for the  portion  of the  mortgage  debt that does not  exceed  the value of the
property and (2) a general  unsecured  loan for the portion of the mortgage debt
that exceeds the value of the property.  A secured  creditor such as the Company
is entitled to the recovery of interest and costs only if and to the extent that
the  value of the  collateral  exceeds  the  amount  owed.  If the  value of the
collateral is less than the debt, a lender such as the Company would not receive
or be entitled  to any  interest  for the time period  between the filing of the
case and  confirmation.  If the value of the  collateral  does  exceed the debt,
interest and allowed costs may not be paid during the bankruptcy proceeding, but
accrue until  confirmation of a plan or reorganization or some other time as the
court  orders.  Finally,  while a lease  generally  would  either be rejected or
assumed with all of its benefits  and burdens  intact,  the terms of a mortgage,
including the rate of interest and timing of principal payments, may be modified
if the debtor is able to effect a "cramdown" under the Bankruptcy Code.

    The receipt of liquidation  proceeds or the  replacement of an operator that
has  defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval  process of
any federal, state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the property or
the  replacement of the operator  licensed to manage the facility.  In addition,
certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment (such as
real  estate  taxes and  maintenance  costs)  are  generally  not  reduced  when
circumstances  cause a  reduction  in income  from the  investment.  In order to
protect its  investments,  the Company may take possession of a property or even
become licensed as an operator,  which might expose the Company to successorship
liability to government programs or require indemnity of subsequent operators to
whom it might  transfer the operating  rights and  licenses.  Should such events

                                       6
<PAGE>

occur,  the Company's  income and cash flows from operations  would be adversely
affected.  See Note 3 - Mortgage Notes  Receivable and Note 4 - Concentration of
Risk to the Company's  consolidated financial statements with respect to certain
of the Company's tenants and mortgagors.


Competition

    The Company  competes for additional  healthcare  facility  investments with
other healthcare  investors,  including other real estate investment trusts. The
operators of the  facilities  compete with other  regional or local nursing care
facilities for the support of the medical  community,  including  physicians and
acute  care  hospitals,   as  well  as  the  general  public.  Some  significant
competitive factors for the placing of patients in skilled and intermediate care
nursing facilities include quality of care,  reputation,  physical appearance of
the facilities,  services offered,  family  preferences,  physician services and
price.

Possible Change of Investment Strategies and Policies and Capital Structure

    The Board of Directors, without the approval of the shareholders,  may alter
the Company's investment strategies and policies if they determine in the future
that such a change is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The methods of implementing the Company's investment strategies and policies may
vary as new investments and financing techniques are developed.

Federal Income Tax Considerations

    At all  times,  the  Company  intends  to make and  manage  its  investments
(including  the sale or  disposition  of property or other  investments)  and to
operate  in such a  manner  as to be  consistent  with the  requirements  of the
Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended  (the  "Code")  (or  regulations
thereunder) to qualify as a REIT, unless, because of changes in circumstances or
changes  in the  Code  (or  regulations  thereunder),  the  Board  of  Directors
determines  that it is no longer in the best interests of the Company to qualify
as a REIT.  As such,  it  generally  will not pay  federal  income  taxes on the
portion of its income which is distributed to shareholders.

Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
          Results of Operations

"Safe Harbor" Statement Under the United States Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995

    Statements  contained in this document that are not based on historical fact
are  "forward-looking  statements"  within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking  statements  include  statements
regarding the Company's future development activities,  the future condition and
expansion of the Company's markets,  the Company's ability to meet its liquidity
requirements  and the Company's growth  strategies,  as well as other statements
which may be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "may,"

                                       12
<PAGE>
"will,"  "expect,"  "estimate,"  "anticipate,"  or similar terms,  variations of
those terms or the negative of those terms.  Statements  that are not historical
facts  contained in  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis are  forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties  that could cause actual results
to differ from  projected  results.  Some of the factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially include: The financial strength of the operators of
the Company's  facilities as it affects their  continuing  ability to meet their
obligations to the Company under the terms of the Company's agreements with such
operators;  changes in the reimbursement  levels under the Medicare and Medicaid
programs;  operators'  continued  eligibility to participate in the Medicare and
Medicaid  programs;  changes  in  reimbursement  by other  third  party  payors;
occupancy  levels at the  Company's  facilities;  the  availability  and cost of
capital; the strength and financial resources of the Company's competitors;  the
Company's  ability to make  additional  real estate  investments  at  attractive
yields; and changes in tax laws and regulations affecting real estate investment
trusts.

    Following  is a  discussion  of  the  consolidated  results  of  operations,
financial  position and  liquidity and capital  resources of the Company,  which
should be read in conjunction  with the  consolidated  financial  statements and
accompanying notes.


Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31, 1999 compared to Year Ended December 31, 1998

    Revenues  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  1999  totaled  $122,375,000,
increasing  $13.6  million over 1998  revenues.  The 1999  revenue  growth stems
primarily from  additional  investments  during 1998 and 1999. A partial year of
revenues from 1999 investments  provided revenue increases of approximately $7.4
million, while a full year of revenues from 1998 investments added $13.5 million
to revenues.  Revenues for 1999 also include $1.1 million from assets classified
as Other Real Estate, $852,000 from prepayment penalties on mortgage payoffs and
approximately  $1.6 million of the revenue growth which stems from participating
incremental  revenues  which  became  effective  during  1999.  A $10.7  million
decrease in revenues resulted from the early payoff of mortgages, disposition of
real estate and the designation of assets as "held for sale."

    Real  estate  investments  of $892.2  million as of  December  31, 1999 will
provide 2000 annualized  revenues of $104.2 million,  which reflects no revenues
from assets  designated  as "other real estate" or as "held for sale."  Revenues
from the investment  portfolio will continue at this level until additional 2000
investments are made, if any, and additional  escalation  provisions commence in
2000.  Annualized  revenues for 2000 represent a $8.1 million  decrease from the
1999 annualized  revenues of $112.3 million based on real estate  investments of
$983.8 million as of January 1, 1999.

    Expenses  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  1999  totaled   $72,697,000,
increasing  approximately $13.9 million over expenses of $58.8 million for 1998.
The 1999  provision for  depreciation  and  amortization  of real estate totaled
$24,211,000,  increasing $2.7 million over 1998. This increase stems from a full
year  provision  for 1998  investments,  plus a partial year  provision for 1999
investments.

    Interest  expense for the year ended  December  31,  1999 was  approximately
$42,366,000,  compared  with $31.9  million  for 1998.  The  increase in 1999 is
primarily due to higher average  outstanding  borrowings  during the 1999 period
offset by lower average interest rates.

    General  and   administrative   expenses  for  1999  totaled  $6,120,000  or
approximately 5.0% of revenues as compared to 4.9% for 1998.

    No  provision  for  Federal  income  taxes has been made  since the  Company
intends to  continue  to qualify as a real  estate  investment  trust  under the
provisions of Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. Accordingly, the Company will not be subject to Federal income taxes on
amounts distributed to shareholders, provided it distributes at least 95% of its
real estate investment trust taxable income and meets certain other conditions.

    Funds from  operations  (FFO) for the year ended  December  31, 1999 totaled
$67,482,000, an increase of $2.4 million over the $65.1 million for 1998. FFO is
net earnings  available to common  shareholders,  excluding  any gains or losses
from debt restructuring and the effects of asset dispositions, plus depreciation
and amortization associated with real estate investments and charges to earnings
for non-cash common stock based compensation.  The 1999 increase in cash flow is
primarily  due to new  additions  to  investments,  offset by early  payment  of
mortgages and disposition of real estate assets.

Year Ended December 31, 1998 compared to Year Ended December 31, 1997

    Revenues  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  1998  totaled  $108,738,000,
increasing  $17.9  million over 1997  revenues.  The 1998  revenue  growth stems
primarily from  additional  investments  during 1997 and 1998. A partial year of
revenues from 1998 investments  provided revenue increases of approximately $9.5
million, while a full year of revenues from 1997 investments added $11.3 million
to revenues.  Additionally,  approximately  $2.3  million of the revenue  growth
stems from  participating  incremental  revenues which became  effective  during
1998.

    Real  estate  investments  of $983.8  million as of  December  31, 1998 will
provide 1999 annualized revenues of $112.3 million, which reflects no additional
revenues for assets held for sale.  Revenues  will  continue at this level until
additional  1999  investments  are made  and  additional  escalation  provisions
commence in 1999.  Annualized revenues for 1999, excluding assets held for sale,
represent a $19.2 million  increase over the 1998  annualized  revenues of $93.1
million  based on real  estate  investments  of $779.4  million as of January 1,
1998.

    Expenses  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  1998  totaled   $58,767,000,
increasing  approximately $12.8 million over expenses of $45.9 million for 1997.
The 1998  provision for  depreciation  and  amortization  of real estate totaled
$21,542,000,  increasing $4.6 million over 1997. This increase stems from a full
year  provision  for 1997  investments,  plus a partial year  provision for 1998
investments.

    Interest  expense for the year ended  December  31,  1998 was  approximately
$31,860,000,  compared  with $24.4  million  for 1997.  The  increase in 1998 is
primarily due to higher average outstanding  borrowings during the 1998 periods,
offset  partially  by interest  rate savings from  conversions  of  subordinated
debentures and reduced spreads on line of credit borrowings.

    General  and   administrative   expenses  for  1998  totaled  $5,365,000  or
approximately 4.9% of revenues as compared to 5.1% for 1997. The 1998 percentage
decrease  stems  primarily from  economies of scale  resulting  from  additional
investments made in 1998.

    No  provision  for  Federal  income  taxes has been made  since the  Company
intends to  continue  to qualify as a real  estate  investment  trust  under the
provisions of Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. Accordingly, the Company will not be subject to Federal income taxes on
amounts distributed to shareholders, provided it distributes at least 95% of its
real estate investment trust taxable income and meets certain other conditions.

    Funds from  operations  (FFO) for the year ended  December  31, 1998 totaled
$65,050,000, an increase of $6.3 million over the $58.8 million for 1997. FFO is
net earnings  available to common  shareholders,  excluding  any gains or losses
from debt restructuring and the effects of asset dispositions, plus depreciation
and amortization associated with real estate investments and charges to earnings
for non-cash  common stock based  compensation.  The 1998 growth in cash flow is
primarily due to net additions to investments in 1998 and 1997.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

    The  Company  expects to  continue  to seek new  investments  in  healthcare
properties,   primarily  long-term  care  facilities,   with  the  objective  of
profitable  growth and  further  diversification  of the  investment  portfolio.
Permanent  financing for future investments is expected to be provided through a
combination of private and public offerings of debt and equity securities.

    At  December  31,  1999,  the  Company  has total  assets of $1.01  billion,
shareholders'  equity of $457.1  million,  and long-term debt of $375.4 million,
representing approximately 37% of total capitalization.  Long-term debt excludes
funds borrowed under its  acquisition  credit  agreements.  The Company has $250
million available under its revolving credit facilities, of which $166.6 million
was drawn at  year-end.  Proceeds  from asset sales and  mortgage  payments  are
expected  to reduce  borrowings  on the credit  facility  by  approximately  $40
million during 2000.

    The Company has  approximately $80 million of indebtedness that matures July
15, 2000 and the term of its revolving  credit  facility  expires  September 30,
2000.  The  Company  intends  to extend the  maturity  of its  revolving  credit

                                       14
<PAGE>

facility and to refinance the term indebtedness, and may fix debt represented by
the revolving credit facility and liquidate  assets to pay such  indebtedness or
implement  a plan which  includes a  combination  of the  foregoing.  Management
believes the Company's  liquidity and various  sources of available  capital are
adequate to finance operations,  meet debt service  requirements and fund future
investments.

    On  January  14,  1999,  the  Company's  Form  S-3  registration   statement
permitting  the  issuance  of  up to  $300  million  related  to  common  stock,
unspecified  debt,  preferred  stock and  convertible  securities  was  declared
effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

    The  Company  distributes  a  large  portion  of  the  cash  available  from
operations.  The Company's  historical policy has been to make  distributions on
common stock of approximately  80% of FFO. Cash dividends paid totaled $2.80 per
share for 1999,  compared  with $2.68 per share for the year ended  December 31,
1998.  The dividend  payout  ratio,  that is the ratio of per share  amounts for
dividends  paid to the diluted per share amounts of funds from  operations,  was
approximately  84.3% for 1999 and 1998. The Company  believes that cash provided
from  quarterly  operating  activities  at current  levels  will  continue to be
sufficient  to  fund  normal  working  capital  requirements  and  common  stock
dividends.

    New  investments  generally are funded from temporary  borrowings  under the
Company's  acquisition  credit line  agreements.  Interest  cost incurred by the
Company on  borrowings  under the  revolving  credit line  facilities  will vary
depending  upon  fluctuations  in prime and/or LIBOR rates.  With respect to the
unsecured acquisition credit line, interest rates depend in part upon changes in
the  Company's  ratings  by  national  agencies.  The term of the  $200  million
unsecured facility expires on September 30, 2000.  Borrowings under the facility
bear  interest at LIBOR plus 1.125% or, at the  Company's  option,  at the prime
rate.  Borrowings  under the $50 million  facility  bear  interest at LIBOR plus
2.00% or, at the Company's  option,  at the prime rate.  The Company  expects to
periodically  replace funds drawn on the  revolving  credit  facilities  through
fixed-rate long-term borrowings, the placement of convertible debentures, or the
issuance of additional  shares of common and/or preferred  stock.  Historically,
the Company's  strategy has been to match the maturity of its indebtedness  with
the maturity of its assets and to employ fixed-rate long-term debt to the extent
practicable.


Market Risk

    The Company is exposed to various market risks, including the potential loss
arising from adverse changes in interest rates.  The Company does not enter into
derivatives or other financial  instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
The Company seeks to mitigate the effects of  fluctuations  in interest rates by
matching the term of new investments  with new long-term fixed rate borrowing to
the extent possible.

    The  market  value of the  Company's  long-term  fixed rate  borrowings  and
mortgages  are subject to interest  rate risk.  Generally,  the market  value of
fixed rate  financial  instruments  will  decrease  as  interest  rates rise and
increase as interest rates fall. The estimated fair value of the Company's total
long-term  borrowings  at December 31, 1999 was $330  million.  A 1% increase in
interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of long-term  borrowings
by approximately  $9.0 million.  The estimated fair value of the Company's total
mortgages  portfolio  at December  31, 1999 was $231  million.  A 1% increase in
interest  rates  would  result  in a  decrease  in fair  value  of the  mortgage
portfolio by approximately $9.1 million.

    The Company is subject to risks  associated  with debt or  preferred  equity
financing,  including the risk that existing  indebtedness may not be refinanced
or that the terms of such  refinancing  may not be as  favorable as the terms of
current  indebtedness.  If the Company were unable to refinance its indebtedness
on  acceptable   terms,   it  might  be  forced  to  dispose  of  properties  on
disadvantageous  terms,  which  might  result in losses to the Company and might
adversely  affect  the cash  available  for  distribution  to  shareholders.  If
interest rates or other factors at the time of the refinancing  result in higher
interest rates upon refinancing,  the Company's interest expense would increase,
which might affect the Company's  ability to make common stock  distributions to
its shareholders.

    The  majority  of  the  Company's  borrowings  were  completed  pursuant  to
indentures  which  limit the  amount of  indebtedness  the  Company  may  incur.
Accordingly,  in the event that the Company is unable to raise additional equity
or borrow money because of these  limitations,  the Company's ability to acquire

                                       15
<PAGE>

additional  properties  may be  limited.  If the  Company  is unable to  acquire
additional properties, its ability to increase the distributions with respect to
common  shares,  as it has done in the past,  will be  limited  to  management's
ability to increase  funds from  operations,  and  thereby  cash  available  for
distribution, from the existing properties in the Company's portfolio.


Year 2000 Compliance

    The Company is not aware of any significant  adverse effects of Year 2000 on
its systems and operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors
Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.

     We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of Omega
Healthcare Investors, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December  31,  1999.  Our
audits also included the financial  statement  schedules  listed in the Index at
Item 14(a).  These financial  statements and schedules are the responsibility of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
and the  consolidated  results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended  December 31, 1999,  in  conformity  with
accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United  States.  Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedules,  when considered in relation
to the  basic  financial  statements  taken as a whole,  present  fairly  in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization

    Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("the Company"), is
a  self-administered  real estate  investment  trust  (REIT).  From the date the
Company  commenced  operations in 1992,  it has invested  primarily in long-term
care  facilities,  which include nursing homes,  assisted living  facilities and
rehabilitation  hospitals.  It currently has investments in 216 income-producing
healthcare  facilities,  with a principal  focus on  diversified  investments in
long-term care facilities located in the United States.

Consolidation

    The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of all material intercompany
accounts and transactions.

Real Estate Investments

    Investments in leased real estate properties and mortgage notes are recorded
at cost and original mortgage amount,  respectively.  The cost of the properties
acquired  is  allocated   between  land  and  buildings   based  generally  upon
independent   appraisals.   Depreciation   for  buildings  is  recorded  on  the
straight-line basis, using estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 39 years.

Other Real Estate Investments and Assets Held for Sale

    In the ordinary course of its business activities,  the Company periodically
evaluates investment  opportunities and extends credit to customers.  It also is
regularly engaged in lease and loan extensions and modifications.  Additionally,
the Company  actively  monitors and manages its  investment  portfolio  with the
objectives of improving  credit  quality and increasing  returns.  In connection
with portfolio  management,  it engages in various  collection  and  foreclosure
activities.

    When the Company acquires real estate pursuant to a foreclosure  proceeding,
it is  classified as other real estate and recorded at the lower of cost or fair
value  generally  based on appraisal.  Additionally,  when a formal plan to sell
real estate is adopted, the real estate is classified as "assets held for sale,"
with the net carrying  amount  adjusted to the lower of cost or  estimated  fair
value,  less  cost  of  disposal.   Residual  income  from  the  investment  and
depreciation of the facilities are excluded from operations after management has
committed to a plan to sell the asset.

Impairment of Assets

    Provisions for impairment losses related to long-lived assets are recognized
when expected future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the assets.
If  indicators  of impairment  are present,  the Company  evaluates the carrying
value of the  related  real estate  investments  in  relationship  to the future
undiscounted  cash flows of the underlying  facilities.  The Company adjusts the
net  carrying  value of  leased  properties,  assets  held  for  sale and  other
long-lived  assets to fair value, if the sum of the expected future cash flow or
sales proceeds is less than carrying value.

Cash and Short-Term Investments

    Short-term  investments consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity
date of three months or less when  purchased.  These  investments  are stated at
cost which approximates fair value.


                                      F-6
<PAGE>


                        OMEGA HEALTHCARE INVESTORS, INC.
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Investments in Equity Securities

    Marketable  securities held as  available-for-sale  are stated at fair value
with  unrealized  gains and losses for the  securities  reported in  accumulated
other  comprehensive  income.  Realized  gains and losses and  declines in value
judged to be  other-than-temporary  on securities held as available-for-sale are
included  in  investment  income.  The cost of  securities  sold is based on the
specific   identification   method.   Interest  and   dividends  on   securities
available-for-sale are included in investment income.

Deferred Financing Costs

    Deferred  financing  costs are amortized on a  straight-line  basis over the
terms of the  related  borrowings.  Amortization  of  financing  costs  totaling
$1,342,000,  $1,042,000 and $829,000 in 1999, 1998, and 1997,  respectively,  is
classified as interest  expense in the  Consolidated  Statements of  Operations.
Unamortized  deferred  financing costs  applicable to debt which is converted to
common stock are charged to paid-in capital at the date of conversion.

Non-Compete Agreements and Goodwill

    Non-compete  agreements  and the excess of the purchase price over the value
of  tangible  net  assets   acquired   (i.e.,   goodwill)  are  amortized  on  a
straight-line  basis over periods  ranging  from five to ten years.  Non-compete
agreements,  which  have cost of  $4,982,000  became  fully  amortized  and were
eliminated  in  1999  by  a  charge  to  accumulated  amortization.  Accumulated
amortization  was  $3,363,000  and  $6,935,000  at  December  31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.

Revenue Recognition

    Rental income and mortgage  interest income is recognized as earned over the
terms of the related master leases and mortgage notes, respectively. Such income
includes periodic  increases based on pre-determined  formulas as defined in the
master leases and mortgage loan agreements.  Certain mortgage agreements include
provisions  for deferred  interest  which is not payable by the  borrower  until
maturity of the related  note.  The portion of deferred  interest  recognized as
earned  approximates  $600,000  for each of the three years in the period  ended
December 31, 1999.

Federal and State Income Taxes

    As a qualified real estate investment trust, the Company will not be subject
to Federal  income taxes on its income,  and no  provisions  for Federal  income
taxes  have  been  made.  The  reported  amounts  of the  Company's  assets  and
liabilities  as of  December  31,  1999  exceeds  the tax  basis  of  assets  by
approximately $63 million.

Earnings per Share

    Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of
common  shares  outstanding  during  the  respective  periods.   Average  shares
outstanding  for  basic  earnings  per share  were  19,877,000,  20,034,000  and
19,085,000 for 1999,  1998 and 1997,  respectively.  The  calculation of diluted
earnings per share amounts  reflects the dilutive  effect of stock options (none
for 1999,  5,999  shares for 1998 and  52,394  shares  for  1997).  The  assumed
conversion of debentures is anti-dilutive for all periods presented.

                        OMEGA HEALTHCARE INVESTORS, INC.
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Stock Based Compensation

    The Company grants stock options to employees and directors with an exercise
price  equal  to the fair  value of the  shares  at the  date of the  grant.  In
accordance  with the  provisions  of APB  Opinion No. 25,  Accounting  for Stock
Issued to  Employees,  compensation  expense is not  recognized  for these stock
option grants.

Accounting Estimates

    The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the  reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities,  the
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


Risks and Uncertainties

    The  Company is subject to certain  risks and  uncertainties  affecting  the
healthcare industry as a result of healthcare legislation and growing regulation
by federal, state and local governments. Additionally, the Company is subject to
risks and  uncertainties as a result of changes  affecting  operators of nursing
home facilities due to the desire of governmental agencies and insurers to limit
the growth in cost of healthcare services. (See Note 4 - Concentration of Risk).


NOTE 2  --  PROPERTIES

Leased Property

         The Company's real estate properties, represented by 147 long-term care
facilities,  3  medical  office  buildings  and 2  rehabilitation  hospitals  at
December 31, 1999,  are leased under  provisions  of master  leases with initial
terms ranging from 8 to 17 years, plus renewal options. Substantially all of the
master  leases  provide for minimum  annual  rentals which are subject to annual
increases  based upon  increases  in the  Consumer  Price Index or  increases in
revenues of the underlying  properties,  with certain maximum limits.  Under the
terms of the leases,  the lessee is responsible  for all  maintenance,  repairs,
taxes and insurance on the leased properties.

    A summary  of the  Company's  investment  in real  estate  properties  is as
follows:

Assets Sold or Held For Sale

    In July 1998,  management  initiated a plan to dispose of certain properties
judged to have limited incremental  potential and to re-deploy the proceeds from
sale. Following a review of the portfolio, assets identified for sale had a cost
of $95 million, a net carrying value of $83 million,  and annualized revenues of
approximately $11.4 million.  The Company recorded a provision for impairment of
$6.8 million to adjust the carrying  value of those assets judged to be impaired
to their fair value,  less cost of disposal.  During 1998, the Company completed
sales of two groups of assets,  yielding  sales proceeds of  $42,036,000.  Gains
realized in the dispositions approximated $2.8 million.

    During  1999,  the Company  completed  sales  yielding net proceeds of $18.2
million. In addition, management initiated a plan in the 1999 fourth quarter for
additional asset sales to be completed in 2000. The additional assets identified
as for sale had a cost of $33.8 million,  a net carrying amount of $28.6 million
and  annualized  revenue  of  approximately  $3.4  million.  As a result of this
review,  the Company  recorded a provision  for  impairment  of $19.5 million to
adjust the carrying value of assets targeted for sale to their fair value,  less
cost of disposal.  The Company is committed to sell the remaining  facilities as
soon as practicable. In 1999 a loss of $10.5 million was also recognized on real
estate  dispositions.  The loss stems from one tenant  exercising  its  purchase
option to acquire  three  custodial  care  facilities  and one  skilled  nursing
facility  from the Company,  as well as the sale of two  facilities  in Kentucky
that were rejected by Sun Healthcare Group,  Inc. in its comprehensive  property
agreement with the Company.

Other Real Estate

     The Company owns 10 facilities  located in  Massachusetts  and  Connecticut
with 1,052 licensed beds, which are operated for the Company's own account.  The
facilities  were acquired by the Company on July 14, 1999 in lieu of foreclosure
and are currently being managed by Genesis Health Ventures, Inc. At December 31,
1999, the Company had invested  approximately $65.8 million in these facilities.
Accumulated  depreciation  and  depreciation  expense for these  facilities  was
$898,000  for the year  ended  December  31,  1999.  The  Company  presently  is
considering negotiating a lease or leases with new operator(s) or selling one or
more of the facilities.  Income from investments classified as other real estate
approximated  $1,151,000,  including  $1,050,000  from these  facilities for the
period from July 15 through December 31, 1999.

    Mortgage  notes  receivable  relate to 64  long-term  care  facilities.  The
mortgage notes are secured by first mortgage liens on the borrowers'  underlying
real estate and personal property. Through December 31, 1999, required principal
payments  have  been  made  pursuant  to the  terms of the  underlying  mortgage
agreements.  The mortgage notes  receivable  relate to facilities  located in 13
states, operated by 12 independent healthcare operating companies.

    The Company carefully monitors  compliance with mortgages and when necessary
has initiated  collection,  foreclosure  and other  proceedings  with respect to
certain   outstanding  loans  and  expects  that  certain  mortgagors  may  seek
protection under the Bankruptcy  Code.  However,  based on management's  current
review of its outstanding mortgage loans, no provision for loss on collection is
considered necessary.

    The following are the three primary  mortgage  structures  currently used by
the Company:

    Convertible  Participating  Mortgages are secured by first mortgage liens on
the  underlying  real estate and personal  property of the  mortgagor.  Interest
rates are usually subject to annual increases based upon increases in the CPI or
increases in revenues of the underlying long-term care facilities,  with certain
maximum limits. Convertible Participating Mortgages afford the Company an option
to convert its mortgage into direct  ownership of the  property,  generally at a
point six to nine years from inception;  they are then subject to a leaseback to
the operator  for the balance of the  original  agreed term and for the original
agreed participation in revenues or CPI adjustments.  This allows the Company to
capture a portion of the potential appreciation in value of the real estate. The
operator has the right to buy out the Company's option at formula prices.

     Participating  Mortgages  are  secured  by  first  mortgage  liens  on  the
underlying  real estate and personal  property of the mortgagor.  Interest rates
are  usually  subject to annual  increases  based upon  increases  in the CPI or
increases in revenues of the underlying long-term care facilities,  with certain
maximum limits.

    Fixed-Rate Mortgages,  with a fixed interest rate for the mortgage term, are
also secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying  real estate and personal
property of the mortgagor.

    On December 30, 1999, the Company  provided notice as to an Event of Default
and   acceleration  of  the  due  date  to  the  mortgagor  of  the  $58,800,000
participating  mortgage note. The total obligation outstanding is $63.3 million.
At that date the  mortgagor  was current with respect to principal  and interest
payments due on the loan but had failed to fully  comply with certain  covenants
and to pay certain property taxes. The Company is currently pursuing  collection
and  foreclosure  to realize upon its security for the loan and has  initiated a
foreclosure  action.  Additionally,  on January 13,  2000,  the  Company  offset
security deposits of $2.4 million against unpaid current and deferred  interest.
On January 18, the  mortgagor  filed with the  Bankruptcy  Court of  Wilmington,
Delaware for  protection  under  Chapter 11 of the  Bankruptcy  Code.  While the
Company's  collection  actions  have been  stayed as a result of the  bankruptcy
filing by the mortgagor,  the Company believes the security for its loan will be
adequate for collection of amounts due.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

    The stated interest rates indicated  above for  Participating  Mortgages and
Convertible  Participating  Mortgages are subject to annual increases based upon
increases in the Consumer Price Index or increases in revenues of the underlying
long-term care facilities,  with certain maximum limits. Certain of the mortgage
notes,  designated as  "Convertible  Participating,"  also permit the Company to
convert the note into  ownership  of the  related  real and  personal  property.
Conversions  would  generally  result in  purchase/leaseback  transactions  with
annual  economic  benefit  to the  Company  substantially  the same as under the
mortgage notes.

    The  estimated  fair value of the Company's  mortgage  loans at December 31,
1999 is  approximately  $230,781,000.  Fair value is based on the  estimates  by
management using rates currently prevailing for comparable loans.


NOTE 4 -- CONCENTRATION OF RISK

    As of December 31, 1999,  92% of the Company's real estate  investments  are
related to long-term care facilities. The Company's facilities are located in 28
states and are operated by 24 independent healthcare operating companies.

     Investing  in  long-term  healthcare   facilities  involves  certain  risks
stemming  from  government  legislation  and  regulation  of  operators  of  the
facilities. The Company's tenants/mortgagors depend on reimbursement legislation
which will provide them  adequate  payments for services  because a  significant
portion of their  revenue is  derived  from  government  programs  funded  under
Medicare and Medicaid.  The Medicare program recently  implemented a Prospective
Payment  System  for  skilled  nursing  facilities,  which  replaced  cost-based
reimbursements  and  significantly   reduced  payments  for  services  provided.
Additionally,   certain  State  Medicaid   programs  have  implemented   similar
prospective payment systems. The reduction in payments to nursing home operators
pursuant to the Medicare and Medicaid  payment  changes has negatively  affected
the revenues of the Company's nursing home facilities.

     Most of the Company's nursing home investments were designed exclusively to
provide  long-term  healthcare  services.  These  facilities are also subject to
detailed and complex specifications for the physical characteristics as mandated
by various  governmental  authorities.  If the facilities  cannot be operated as
long-term  care  facilities,  finding  alternative  uses may be  difficult.  The
Company's  triple-net  leases  require its  tenants to comply  with  regulations
affecting  its  facilities  and the Company  regularly  monitors  compliance  by
tenants with healthcare facilities' regulations.  Nevertheless,  if tenants fail
to perform their  obligations,  the Company may be required to do so in order to
maintain the value of its investments.

     Approximately 80% of the Company's real estate  investments are operated by
7 public  companies,  including Sun Healthcare Group, Inc.  (27.3%),  Integrated
Health Services,  Inc.  (18.1%),  Advocat,  Inc.  (12.5%),  RainTree  Healthcare
Corporation  (8.3%),  Mariner  Post-Acute  Network  (6.6%),  Alterra  Healthcare
Corporation  (formerly Alternative Living  Services)(3.8%),and  Tenet Healthcare
Corp.(3.4%).  Of  the  remaining  17  operators,  none  operate  investments  in
facilities representing more than 5% of the total real estate investments.

     The Company's largest tenant,  Sun Healthcare  Group, Inc. (Sun),  recently
filed for  reorganization  under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Prior to the
bankruptcy  filing  by Sun,  the  Company  completed  a  comprehensive  property
agreement  with Sun related to the  facilities  leased by Sun.  This  agreement,
which has been approved by the Court,  confirmed the existing  economic terms of
lease  agreements  between  the Company  and Sun with  respect to 50  healthcare
properties, representing $219 million in investments and $23.2 million in annual
rental revenues.

believes  there are  presently no indicators of impairment on leased real estate
or losses on mortgages.


NOTE 5 - ADDITIONAL SECURITY

    The  Company  obtains   liquidity   deposits  and  letters  of  credit  from
substantially  all  operators  pursuant  to  its  leases  and  mortgages.  These
generally  represent the initial monthly rental and mortgage interest income for
periods  ranging  from  three to six  months  with  respect  to  certain  of the
investments.  Additional  security for rental and mortgage interest revenue from
operators is provided by covenants  regarding  minimum  working  capital and net
worth, liens on accounts receivable and other operating assets of the operators,
provisions for cross  default,  provisions  for  cross-collateralization  and by
corporate/personal guarantees.


NOTE 6 -- BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS

    The Company has a $200,000,000  unsecured revolving line of credit facility,
under which  borrowings  bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.125% or, at the Company's
option,  at the  prime  rate.  Borrowings  of  approximately  $117  million  are
outstanding  at December 31, 1999.  The underlying  revolving  credit  agreement
contains  various  covenants and expires on September  30, 2000.  The banks have
waived  non-compliance  with a covenant  requirement  as to  tangible  net worth
through the earlier of the date of an amendment to the existing agreement or May
31, 2000. The Company is currently in negotiations to extend the maturity of the
line of credit.  Permitted  borrowings under the agreement are based upon levels
of eligible real estate investments.  LIBOR based borrowings under this facility
bear interest at a weighted-average rate of 7.30% at December 31, 1999 and 6.63%
at December 31, 1998.

    The Company also has a $50,000,000  secured revolving line of credit,  under
which borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.00% or, at the Company's  option,
at the prime rate. This credit agreement  contains various covenants and expires
on March 31, 2002.  The agreement  permits the Company to extend the term of the
commitment for up to three  additional  years following  timely annual notice to
the bank.  LIBOR  based  borrowings  under  this  facility  bear  interest  at a
weighted-average  rate of  8.44%  at  December  31,  1999.  Investments  with an
original cost of  approximately  $78 million are pledged as collateral  for this
revolving line of credit facility.

    In 1998, the Company  completed a $125 million public  offering of unsecured
6.95%  notes.   The  notes  were  priced  to  yield  7.04%  with  interest  paid
semi-annually.  In 1997, the Company completed a $100 million public offering of
unsecured  6.95%  notes due 2007.  The notes  were  priced to yield  6.99%  with
interest paid semi-annually.

    In 1996,  the Company  issued $95 million of 8.5%  Subordinated  Convertible
Debentures (the Debentures) due January 24, 2001. The Debentures are convertible
at any time into  shares of Common  Stock at a  conversion  price of $26.962 per
share.  The  Debentures  are  unsecured  obligations  of  the  Company  and  are
subordinate in right and payment to the Company's senior unsecured indebtedness.
As of December 31, 1999, there were 1,794,107 shares reserved for issuance under
the Debentures.

    In 1995, the Company  issued 10% and 7.4% Unsecured  Notes due July 15, 2000
in exchange for certain secured borrowings.  The effective interest rate for the
unsecured notes is 8.8%, with interest-only  payments due semi-annually  through
July 2000.

    Real estate  investments with an original cost of approximately  $25 million
are pledged as collateral for outstanding secured borrowings.  Long-term secured
borrowings  are  payable in  aggregate  monthly  installments  of  approximately
$153,000, including interest at rates ranging from 6.5% to 10.0%.

    Assuming  none  of the  Company's  borrowing  arrangements  are  refinanced,
converted or prepaid prior to maturity,  required principal payments for each of
the five years following  December 31, 1999 and the aggregate due thereafter are

    Fair value  estimates are subjective in nature and are dependent on a number
of  important  assumptions,  including  estimates  of future cash flows,  risks,
discount rates and relevant  comparable market information  associated with each
financial  instrument  (See  Note  1 -  Risks  and  Uncertainties).  The  use of
different market  assumptions and estimation  methodologies  may have a material
effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts.  Accordingly, the estimates
presented above are not necessarily  indicative of the amounts the Company would
realize in a current market exchange.


NOTE 8 -- RETIREMENT ARRANGEMENTS

    The  Company  has  a  401(k)  Profit  Sharing  Plan  covering  all  eligible
employees. Under the Plan, employees are eligible to make contributions, and the
Company,  at its discretion,  may match  contributions and make a profit sharing
contribution.

     In 1993, the Company adopted the 1993 Retirement Plan for Directors,  which
covered  all  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors,   and  the  1993  Deferred
Compensation Plan, which covered all eligible employees and members of the Board
of  Directors.  The  Retirement  Plan for  Directors  and  participation  by the
directors in the Deferred  Compensation Plan was terminated  effective  December
31, 1997.  Accumulated  benefits to the Directors  under both plans were settled
and paid in 1998.

    The Deferred  Compensation  Plan is an unfunded plan under which the Company
may award units that result in  participation in the dividends and future growth
in the value of the Company's  common stock. The total number of units permitted
by the plan is 200,000,  of which  90,850 units have been awarded and 42,600 are
outstanding at December 31, 1999.  Units awarded to eligible  participants  vest
over a period of five years based on the participant's initial service date.

     Provisions   charged  to  operations  with  respect  to  these   retirement
arrangements totaled $123,000,  $346,000,  and $667,000 in 1999, 1998, and 1997,
respectively.

NOTE 9 -- SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND STOCK OPTIONS

    On May 12, 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the adoption of
a  shareholder  rights  plan.  The plan is designed to require a person or group
seeking  to  gain  control  of the  Company  to  offer a fair  price  to all the
Company's  shareholders.  The rights  plan will not  interfere  with any merger,
acquisition or business  combination that the Company's Board of Directors finds
is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.

    In  connection  with the adoption of the rights plan,  the board  declared a
dividend  distribution of one right for each common share outstanding on May 24,
1999.  The rights will not become  exercisable  unless a person  acquires 10% or
more of the Company's  common stock,  or begins a tender offer that would result
in the person  owning 10% or more of the Company's  common stock.  At that time,
each right would  entitle each  shareholder  other than the person who triggered
the rights plan to purchase  either the  Company's  common  stock or stock of an
acquiring  entity  at a  discount  to the then  market  price.  The plan was not
adopted in response to any specific attempt to acquire control of the Company.

    In January  1998,  the Company  adopted a stock  purchase  assistance  plan,
whereby the Company  extends  credit to directors  and employees to purchase the
Company's  stock through the exercise of stock options.  These loans are secured
by the shares acquired and are repayable under full recourse  promissory  notes.
The plan provides for repayment of a portion of the notes from annual  incentive
compensation.  The  notes  are  otherwise  repayable  in their  entirety  at the
earliest  to occur  of five  years  from  the date of the note or 90 days  after
termination  of  employment.  At  December  31,  1999 a total of  $2,499,337  is
outstanding, payable by participants who have loans bearing interest at 6.95% at
amounts ranging from $5,025 to $299,955.

    On April 28, 1998,  the Company  received gross proceeds of $50 million from
the issuance of 2 million shares of 8.625% Series B Cumulative  Preferred  Stock
("Preferred  Stock")  at $25 per share.  Dividends  on the  Preferred  Stock are
cumulative from the date of original issue and are payable quarterly  commencing
on August 15, 1998. On April 7, 1997,  the Company  received  gross  proceeds of
$57.5  million  from the  issuance  of 2.3  million  shares  of  9.25%  Series A
Cumulative  Preferred Stock ("Preferred  Stock") at $25 per share.  Dividends on
the Series A Preferred  Stock are cumulative from the date of original issue and
are  payable  quarterly.   At  December  31,  1999,  the  aggregate  liquidation
preference of preferred stock issued is $107,500,000.

    Under the terms of the 1993 Amended and Restated Stock Option and Restricted
Stock Plan, the Company reserved  1,100,000 shares of common stock for grants to
be issued  during a period of up to 10 years.  Options  are  exercisable  at the
market  price at the date of grant,  expire  in 10 to 11 years  from the date of
grant, and vest over 3 years. Directors,  officers and employees are eligible to
participate  in the Plan.  Options  for 545,152  shares have been  granted to 40
eligible participants. Additionally, 86,453 shares of restricted stock have been
granted  under the  provisions of the Plan.  The market value of the  restricted
shares on the date of the award was recorded as unearned compensation-restricted
stock,  with  the  unamortized   balance  shown  as  a  separate   component  of
shareholders'  equity.  Unearned  compensation is amortized to expense generally
over the vesting period, with charges to operations of $635,000,  $612,000,  and
$402,000 in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.

    At  December  31,  1999,  options  currently  exercisable  (231,590)  have a
weighted average  exercise price of $27.570.  There are 468,395 shares available
for future grants as of December 31, 1999.

    In 1995,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based
Compensation."  This standard prescribes a fair value based method of accounting
for employee stock options or similar equity  instruments  and requires  certain
pro forma disclosures.  For purposes of the pro forma disclosures required under
Statement  123, the estimated  fair value of the options is amortized to expense
over the option's vesting period.  Based on the Company's  option activity,  net
earnings  and net  earnings  per  share on a pro  forma  basis  does not  differ
significantly  from that determined under APB 25. The estimated weighted average
fair value of options granted in 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $168,000,  $220,000 and
$1.3 million,  respectively.  In  determining  the  estimated  fair value of the
Company's stock options as of the date of grant, a Black-Scholes  option pricing
model  was  used  with the  following  weighted-average  assumptions:  risk-free
interest rates of 6.5% in 1999, 6% in 1998 and 6.5% in 1997; a dividend yield of
10% in 1999 and  6.75% in 1998 and  1997;  volatility  factors  of the  expected
market price of the  Company's  common stock based on actual  volatility in 1999
and 15% in 1998 and 1997; and a weighted-average expected life of the options of
8 years for each of the three years.

    During  1999,  the Company  offered  holders of options the  opportunity  to
accelerate the expiration  date of options in  consideration  of a cash payment.
Twenty-two employees who were holders of options for 431,830 shares accepted the
offer and were paid a total of $38,000.  Options for 157,000  shares  granted in
1999 and canceled in 1999 under this  arrangement  are  excluded  from the above
table for 1999 and from the calculation  for the weighted  average fair value of
options granted in 1999.


    The  Black-Scholes   options  valuation  model  was  developed  for  use  in
estimating the fair value of traded  options which have no vesting  restrictions
and are fully  transferable.  In addition,  option  valuation models require the
input of highly  subjective  assumptions,  including  the  expected  stock price
volatility.  Because the Company's  employee stock options have  characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially  affect the fair value estimate,  in
management's  opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

NOTE 10 -- PRINCIPAL HEALTHCARE FINANCE LIMITED AND OMEGA
                    WORLDWIDE, INC.

    In 1995 the Company  sponsored  the  organization  of  Principal  Healthcare
Finance Limited  ("Principal"),  an Isle of Jersey company,  whose purpose is to
invest in nursing homes and  long-term  care  facilities in the United  Kingdom.
Prior to the April 2, 1998 contribution to Omega Worldwide,  Inc.  ("Worldwide")
as explained  below,  the Company had invested  $30.7 million in  Principal,  of
which $23.8 million was represented by a (pound)15 million subordinated note due
December 31, 2000, and $6.9 million was represented by an equity investment. The
Company  had also  provided  investment  advisory  and  management  services  to
Principal and had advanced temporary loans to Principal from time to time.

    In November  1997,  the Company  formed  Worldwide,  and on April 2, 1998 it
contributed  substantially  all of its Principal assets to Worldwide in exchange
for  approximately  8.5 million  shares of  Worldwide  common  stock and 260,000
shares  of Series B  preferred  stock.  Of the  8,500,000  shares  of  Worldwide
received by the Company,  approximately  5,200,000 were  distributed on April 2,
1998 to the Company's shareholders on the basis of one Worldwide share for every
3.77 common  shares of the Company  held by  shareholders  of the Company on the
record date of February 1, 1998. Of the remaining  3,300,000 shares of Worldwide
received by the Company,  2,300,000  shares were sold by the Company on April 3,
1998 for net  proceeds of  approximately  $16,250,000  in a  Secondary  offering
pursuant to a  registration  statement  of  Worldwide.  The market  value of the
distribution to shareholders  approximated  $39 million or $1.99 per share.  The
Company  recorded a non-recurring  gain of $30.2 million on the distribution and
secondary  offerings of Worldwide  common shares during 1998. As of December 31,
1999, the Company holds 1,163,000  shares of Worldwide  common stock and 260,000
shares of its preferred stock.  The market value of the Company's  investment in
Worldwide  is  $8,015,000.  The Company also holds a  $1,615,000  investment  in
Principal, represented by 990,000 ordinary shares of Principal.

    The Company has guaranteed repayment of Worldwide borrowings pursuant to its
$25 million revolving credit facility.  The Company receives a 1% annual fee and
an unused fee of 25 basis points in  consideration  for providing its guarantee.
At  December  31,  1999  borrowings  of $11.8  million  were  outstanding  under
Worldwide's revolving credit facility.  Additionally, the Company has a Services
Agreement  with  Worldwide,  which provides for the allocation of indirect costs
incurred by the Company to Worldwide.  The allocation of indirect costs is based
on the  relationship  of assets under the  Company's  management to the combined
total of those assets and assets under  Worldwide's  management.  Indirect costs
allocated  to  Worldwide   for  1999  and  1998  were   $754,000  and  $490,000,
respectively.

(4) At December 31, 1999 no amounts were delinquent.  However, the Company
    accelerated the due date and initiated a foreclosure action against the
    mortgagor due to failure to fully comply with certain covenants. See Note 3
    (Mortgage Notes Receivable) to the consolidated financial statements.

(5) A mortgagor with a mortgage on two facilities in Florida declared bankruptcy
    on July 8, 1999.  The bankruptcy court has ordered that all amounts owed to
    the Company (including default rate interest, late charges, attorney's fees
    and court costs), bear interest at an annual rate of 10% and that the
    mortgagor make monthly payments of $40,000 on a timely basis.  As of
    December 31, 1999, the mortgagor had complied with the court order.

                              FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT


         This  Forbearance  Agreement  ("Agreement") is made and entered into on
October 13, 1999 by and between the entities  identified on the  signature  page
hereof (each a "Lessee" and collectively "Lessees");  DELTA INVESTORS I, LLC , a
Michigan limited liability company,  DELTA INVESTORS II, LLC, a Michigan limited
liability company, OMEGA HEALTHCARE INVESTORS,  INC., a Maryland corporation and
OHI (ILLINOIS),  INC., an Illinois corporation (each a "Lessor" and collectively
"Lessors");   and  SUN   HEALTHCARE   GROUP,   INC.,   a  Delaware   corporation
("Guarantor").

                                R E C I T A L S:

         A. Lessees,  each of which is a subsidiary or second tier subsidiary of
Guarantor,  and Lessors are parties to the Leases and  Subleases  identified  on
attached Exhibit A (each a "Lease" and collectively,  the "Leases").  The Leases
relate to certain health care  facilities  also  identified on Exhibit A (each a
"Facility" and collectively,  the "Facilities").  The obligations of the Lessees
under the Leases are secured by the  Security  Agreements  and other  Agreements
identified on attached Exhibit B (each a "Security  Agreement" and collectively,
the "Security Agreements").  Guarantor has executed the Guaranty with respect to
all of the Leases except the Complete Care Lease.

         B. On or about May 28, 1999,  the Lessors  forwarded to the  respective
Lessees and other  persons  required  to receive  notices  under the  applicable
Leases ("Other Persons"),  and the Lessees and Other Persons received Notices of
Default pursuant to which the Lessors advised the Lessees and Other Persons that
the Lessees had failed to pay certain  Minimum Rent and  Additional  Charges (as
defined in the Leases),  and that the failure to cure these defaults  within the
time set forth in the  Notices of  Default  would  constitute  Events of Default
under  all  of  the  Leases,  except  the  Complete  Care  Leases.  The  Lessees
acknowledge  that on or about  September 3, 1999,  the Lessors  forwarded to the
Lessees  and to Other  Persons,  and the  Lessees  and Other  Persons  received,
Notices of  Termination  pursuant to which the  Lessors  advised the Lessees and
Other  Persons that (I) the Lessees had not cured all of the defaults  described
in the  Notices of  Default,  and (II)  pursuant  to the terms of the Leases (a)
Events of Default had occurred  under the Leases,  other than the Complete  Care
Leases, and (b) as a result of the Events of Default, the Leases, other than the
Complete Care Leases, would terminate on September 13, 1999.

         C. Lessors contend that all of the Leases, except for the Complete Care
Lease, were terminated  effective  September 13, 1999 pursuant to the Notices of
Default and Notices of  Termination  identified  in Recital B.  Lessors  further
contend  that  Lessors  are  entitled  to  immediate  possession  of the  Leased
Properties.  Lessees  and  Guarantor  contend  that the  Notices of Default  and
Notices of Termination were ineffective,  and that all of the Leases continue in
full force and effect.

         D.   Guarantor  and  Lessees  are  currently   experiencing   financial
difficulties,  and anticipate  that they will file a Case or Cases under Chapter
11  of  the  United  States  Bankruptcy  Code  on or  before  October  15,  1999
("Filing").  The date on which Guarantor and the Lessees actually file such Case
or Cases is hereinafter  referred to as the "Filing Date" and such Case or Cases
are hereinafter referred to as the "Case or Cases."

transition  of  operations  of the  Rejected  Lease  Facilities,  and  (iv)  the

2. AGREEMENT TO FORBEAR

           1.     During the Forbearance  Period, the Lessors shall forbear from
                  commencing  any  judicial  or other  action for the purpose of
                  pursuing remedies, including, without limitation, the recovery

                  default  prior to the  date of this  Agreement  by any  Lessee
                  under any Lease or any default in existence by Guarantor under
                  the  Guaranty.  This  Agreement  shall,  at the  option of the
                  Lessors, terminate upon:

                  1. The failure of any one or more of the Lessees to

                          1.       45 days after the Motion Filing Date, or

                          2.       the  entry of a final  DIP  Financing  Order
                                   which  provides  that the lender's  security
                                   interest primes any of the collateral of any
                                   of   the   Lessors    under   the   Security
                                   Agreements; or

                 4. Lessees' failure to satisfy  Lessees'  Effective Date
                    Obligations as and when required herein.

           2.     Upon  execution of this  Agreement by all parties, Lessors
                  shall  immediately  take all steps  reasonably  appropriate
                  under applicable law to withdraw any and all notices to quit
                  (or the  equivalent)  that have been served upon Lessees on or
                  prior to the date  hereof,  and shall  immediately dismiss any
                  and all  lawsuits  commenced  against  any Lessee or Guarantor
                  with respect to the Leases, and during the  Forbearance Period
                  in addition to its agreement to forbear as set forth in
                  Section  II.A.,  above,  shall  also  forbear  from  causing
                  or  permitting  any notice to quit (or the equivalent) to be
                  served upon any Lessee, provided,  however, that Guarantor and
                  each Lessee waives and agrees (which waiver and agreement
                  shall survive the termination of this Agreement
                  notwithstanding  Section II.G,  hereof) that it shall not
                  assert  such  withdrawal  or any  failure  to serve  such
                  notice to quit (or the  equivalent)  during the Forbearance
                  Period in any action brought by a Lessor as a defense to any
                  action by Lessor.



<PAGE>


           3.     During the Forbearance  Period,  Guarantor and each Lessee
                  shall forbear from commencing any judicial or other actions
                  adverse to any Lessor  with  respect to any of the  Leases,
                  other than the  Filing,  or, if  applicable,  seeking any
                  relief adverse to Lessor in any now pending action with
                  respect thereto,  provided,  however, that such agreement to
                  forbear shall not apply to (i) any default by any Lessor under
                  any Lease  occurring  after the date hereof if such default is
                  not cured within the applicable  cure or grace period set
                  forth in the Lease, or (ii) any default by any Lessor under
                  this Agreement  which is not cured within ten (10) days after
                  written notice  thereof,  each of which defaults may be  the
                  subject of a separate  legal action but shall not affect the
                  rights or  obligations  of the Lessees and Guarantor
                  hereunder.

           4.     Each party to this  Agreement  hereby  waives and agrees
                 (which waiver and  agreement  shall survive the  termination
                  of this Agreement  notwithstanding  Section  II.G,  hereof)
                  that it shall not assert at any time that the failure  during
                  the Forbearance  Period of any other party to this Agreement
                  to commence any action or proceed with any steps taken prior
                  to the Forbearance  Period that are or may be required under
                  applicable law prior to the  commencement of any action  is a
                  defense to any claim by  another  party  arising  out of or in
                  connection  with any or all of the  Leases.  The intent of the
                  parties is that compliance during the Forbearance  Period with
                  the forbearance  agreements set forth in Section II.A, Section
                  II.B and Section II.C shall not prejudice or be a waiver of
                  the rights or claims of any of the parties hereto should the
                  Forbearance Period terminate as set forth in Section II.A.

            5.    On the  Effective  Date,  Lessors'  agreement  to  forbear  as
                  provided herein shall be absolute and unconditional and cannot
                  be terminated,  provided,  however, that except as provided in
                  Section XI hereof, nothing contained herein shall be construed
                  as limiting the rights and remedies of any of the Lessors with
                  respect to any default or Event of Default  which occurs under
                  the Sun Leases or the Security Agreements,  as amended,  after
                  entry of the Assumption and Rejection Order.

            6.    Guarantor and Lessees agree (which  agreement  shall survive
                  the termination of this Agreement  notwithstanding  Section
                  II.G, hereof) that neither the acceptance  during the
                  Forbearance  Period by any Lessor of any rent or other payment
                  by any Lessee with respect to any Lease, the continued
                  possession during the Forbearance  Period of Leased Property
                  covered by a Lease by the Lessee  thereof, nor the performance
                  by a Lessee  during the  Forbearance  Period of any of the
                  obligations  set forth in any Lease  without  objection  from
                  the Lessor  thereunder,  shall  constitute  a waiver or
                  otherwise  prejudice either the contention of the Lessors that
                  such Lease has been  terminated or the contention of Guarantor
                  and the Lessees that such Lease has not been terminated and is
                  in full force and effect,  but the foregoing reservation shall
                  be null and void after the Effective Date.



<PAGE>


            7.    In the event this Agreement  terminates  pursuant to the terms
                  hereof,  from and after such termination no party hereto shall
                  have any rights or obligations arising out of or in connection
                  with  this  Agreement,  and no party  shall be  deemed to have
                  waived  any of its  rights  or been  released  from any of its
                  obligations  with  respect to the Leases or the Guaranty or in
                  any way be prejudiced by its execution of, or its  performance
                  of any of its obligations under, this Agreement.

         Facilities covered by the Leases or the rights of the Lessors under the
         Leases or this Agreement, with the orders sought on the day the Case or

                           interests  in and to the  Rejected  Lease  Assets and

                  The Lessor of each of the Rejected Lease  Facilities  shall be
                  entitled to all revenues, and shall be liable for all expenses
                  and  liabilities,  which in each  case  with  respect  to such
                  Rejected  Lease  Facility  relate to the period from and after
                  the  Effective   Date  or  such  earlier  date  on  which  the
                  applicable  Lessee transfers  operational  responsibility  for
                  such  Rejected  Lease  Facility  to the  applicable  Lessor or
                  Transferee  pursuant  to the  request  of such  Lessor and the
                  terms of the Operations Transfer Agreement as provided in this
                  Agreement.

4.       INTERIM MANAGEMENT OF REJECTED LEASE FACILITIES.

                  1.       At the request of the Lessor of a Rejected  Lease
                           Facility,  from and after the  Effective  Date,  the
                           Lessee of the Rejected Lease  Facility  shall  manage
                           the  Rejected  Lease  Facility  pursuant to an
                           interim  management  agreement ("Interim Management
                           Agreement")  reasonably  acceptable to the parties,
                           the term of which shall not exceed six (6) months,
                           provided,  however, that if an appeal is taken from
                           the Assumption and Rejection Order, the term of such
                           Interim Management  Agreement shall be extended until
                           the earlier of (i) the date on which this Agreement
                           is  terminated  or (ii) the date on which the
                           Assumption  and  Rejection  Order becomes final and
                           non-appealable.  Except as provided in Section
                           IV.D.2.  below,  the Lessee  will be paid a
                           management  fee equal to a percentage  of the gross
                           revenues of the Rejected  Lease  Facility  (net of
                           any  recoupments  or charge-backs),  which percentage
                           has been agreed upon by the parties to this
                           Agreement.  The Lessor shall have the right to
                           terminate  the  Interim  Management  Agreement  at
                           any time upon five (5) days  Notice to Lessee. The
                           Interim  Management  Agreement shall require that
                           Lessor provide Lessee with all working capital
                           required for the operation of the Rejected  Lease
                           Facility,  and shall  require that the Lessor
                           indemnify, defend,  and hold Lessee harmless from any
                           and all claims and expenses accruing with respect to
                           the Rejected Lease Facility after the Effective Date,
                           except for claims arising from willful  misconduct or
                           negligence of the Lessee.



<PAGE>


                  2.       From and after the Effective  Date,  if an Interim
                           Management  Agreement  has been entered into,  the
                           Lessee under a Rejected Lease Facility at the request
                           of the Lessor thereunder shall transfer  operational
                           responsibility  for such Facility  to  the Transferee
                           pursuant  to  a  submanagement  agreement
                           ("Submanagement Agreement") with Transferee
                           reasonably  acceptable to the parties.
                           The Submanagement  Agreement will provide that
                           Transferee will manage and perform all functions
                           relating to the operation of the Rejected Lease
                           Facility,  except for those  functions  which Lessee
                           is required to perform as the licensee of the
                           Rejected Lease Facility. If a Submanagement Agreement
                           is entered into, the management fee payable to Lessee
                           under the Interim  Management Agreement shall
                           automatically be changed to One Hundred Dollars
                           ($100.00) per month above the submanagementfee (which
                           submanagement  fee will be paid to the Lessee and
                           passed  through to the  Transferee).  Lessor   shall
                           remain  responsible  for providing  all working
                           capital  required with respect to the Rejected  Lease
                           Facility,  and the indemnification  given to Lessee
                           under the Interim Management Agreement shall be
                           expanded to include any and all acts and  omissions
                           of the  Transferee  including  operation  of the
                           Rejected  Lease Facility under the Lessee's licenses
                           and provider agreements.

                  3.       Any Interim Management  Agreement and Submanagement
                           Agreement entered into as set forth above shall
                           automatically terminate upon Transferee obtaining the
                           necessary licenses for the operation of the Rejected
                           Lease Facility,  provided that  notwithstanding  such
                           termination,  in accordance with the Operations
                           Transfer Agreement the Lessee of the Rejected  Lease
                           Facility  shall allow the Lessor or  Transferee
                           thereof to operate  under the relevant Lessees'
                           Medicare  and Medicaid  Provider  numbers (the "Prior
                           Provider  Numbers")  until such time as the Lessor or
                           Transferee,  in  accordance  with  applicable  law,
                           either (i) obtains a Medicare  and  Medicaid provider
                           number in its own name or (ii) is  authorized  by the
                           applicable  state or  federal  governmental
                           authority to bill under the Prior  Provider  Numbers
                           for services rendered by it after the Effective Date,
                           provided that in no event shall such  obligation of
                           the Lessee of such Rejected Lease Facility  require
                           that such Lessee  assume  pursuant to Section 365 of
                           the  Bankruptcy  Code any  provider  agreement to
                           which such Lessee or any of its Affiliates may be a
                           party.



<PAGE>


                  4.       Prior to the  Effective  Date,  the Lessee  under a
                           Rejected Lease  Facility at the request of the Lessor
                           thereunder shall transfer operational  responsibility
                           for such Facility to the applicable Lessor or
                           Transferee pursuant to an Operations  Transfer
                           Agreement and a management  agreement  between Lessee
                           and Transferee (the "Transferee Management
                           Agreement")  reasonably  acceptable to the parties.
                           The  Transferee  Management  Agreement will provide
                           that  Transferee  will manage and perform all
                           functions  relating to the  operation of the Rejected
                           Lease  Facility,  except for those  functions  which
                           Lessee is required  to perform as the licensee of the
                           Rejected Lease Facility.  If a Transferee  Management
                           Agreement is entered into prior to the Effective Date
                           hereafter,  the Lessor shall bear all  economic risks
                           of and be entitled to all  economic  reward from the
                           Rejected Lease Facility,  as more  particularly  set
                           forth in Subsection 4.C. hereof. Without limiting the
                           foregoing,  if a Transferee  Management  Agreement is
                           entered into prior to the Effective  Date, thereafter
                           Lessor  shall provide Lessee with all working capital
                           required for the  operation of the Rejected  Lease
                           Facility,  and Lessor shall indemnify,  defend and
                           hold Lessee harmless from any and all claims and
                           expenses accruing with respect to the Rejected Lease
                           Facility,  except for claims arising from willful
                           misconduct or negligence of the Lessee.  If a
                           Transferee  Management  Agreement is entered  into,
                           the Lessee shall permit the Lessor to make all
                           decisions required of the Lessee under the Transferee
                           Management  Agreement,  except for those  decisions
                           which Lessee is required to make as the licensee of
                           the Rejected  Lease  Facility.  If from or after the
                           Effective Date Lessor and Lessee enter into an
                           Interim  Management  Agreement pursuant to Subsection
                           4.D.1., any Transferee Management Agreement shall
                           automatically become a Submanagement  Agreement
                           governed by Subsections 4.D.2. and 4.D.3.


5.       COOPERATION WITH RESPECT TO OPERATIONS BETWEEN LESSOR AND LESSEE PRIOR
         TO EFFECTIVE DATE

               Commencing with the execution of this  Agreement,  the Lessee,
               Lessor and  Transferee  (when  identified) of a Rejected Lease
               Facility  shall work  cooperatively  with each other to design
               and implement a program

      1.       to insure  patients and employees  that the rejection of the
               Rejected  Lease and the resulting  change in management  will not
               adversely affect them,

      2.       to encourage all patients to remain patients of the Facility, and

      3.       to encourage all employees of such Facility  (whether
               employed by the Lessee or  employed  under a contract
               with an Affiliate of the Lessee) to remain  employees
               of the Facility.

               Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Lessee shall have no liability
               to Lessor or  Transferee  if  patients or  employees  leave or
               operation of the Facility is otherwise  adversely  affected by
               the Case or Cases.

6.       OPERATIONS TRANSFER AGREEMENT

                  On the  Effective  Date or such  earlier  date upon  which the
                  Lessor of a Rejected Lease  Facility  requests that the Lessee
                  thereunder  turn  over  operational  responsibility  for  such
                  Facility to a  Transferee,  such Lessee and  Transferee  shall
                  enter into an Operations Transfer Agreement.  With the support
                  of Lessors, Guarantor and Lessees shall use good faith efforts
                  to obtain timely approval of the Bankruptcy Court with respect
                  to any provisions of the Operations  Transfer  Agreement as to
                  which such approval is required.

7.       TRADE NAMES

                  The  Lessee  under a  Rejected  Lease  shall be deemed to have
                  assigned to the Lessor under such Rejected Lease the exclusive
                  right to use  without  objection  from any  Affiliate  of such
                  Lessee the Rejected Lease  Facility or Facilities'  Trade Name
                  or Trade Names, excluding the names "Sun" or "Mediplex" or any
                  derivatives  or  variations  thereof,  in  perpetuity  in  the
                  markets in which such  Rejected  Lease  Facility or Facilities
                  are located,  but without any  representation  that any Lessor
                  shall  have  the  right to use any  such  Trade  Name or Trade
                  Names, and no Lessee shall use such Rejected Lease Facility or
                  Facility  Trade Names in any business  that competes with such
                  Facility or Facilities.

                  Guarantor and Lessees agree that any and all fines,  penalties
                  as of the date hereof and any interest that may be due thereon
                  with  respect to the Manor Care Lease  applicable  to the Four
                  Seasons  Nursing  Center at  Austin,  Texas  (a/k/a  "Highland

5.  SUN LEASES

      1.    INDUCEMENT FOR OMEGA CONSENTING TO ASSUMPTION OF LEASES

                  Lessees  and  Guarantor   agree  and   acknowledge   that  the
                  willingness of the Lessors to consent to the assumption of the
                  Sun Leases and to waive their  position that all of the Leases
                  have been  terminated is specifically  conditioned  upon their
                  agreement,  and the  finding  of the  Bankruptcy  Court in the
                  Assumption and Rejection  Order,  that,  except as provided in
                  Section XI and Section XII hereof, a default by one or more of
                  the  Lessees  under any of the Sun  Leases  which is not cured
                  after any  required  notice  and within  any  applicable  cure
                  period shall, at Lessors' option, be an Event of Default under
                  each of the Sun Leases, and that the Sun Leases (i) constitute
                  true and bona fide  leases,  (ii) are each part of and subject
                  to one of the four (4) Master  Leases,  i.e.,  the Sun Liberty
                  Master Lease,  Sun Qualicorp  Lease, Sun Delta I Master Lease,
                  and  Sun  Delta  II  Master  Lease,   (iii)  are  collectively
                  integrated and cross-defaulted  pursuant to provisions therein
                  specifically found to be enforceable and (iv) on and after the
                  Effective Date the Sun Leases will  collectively be integrated
                  and the  cross-default  provisions  contained  therein will be
                  enforceable.

2.       ASSUMPTION OF LEASES

                  The  Motion to Assume  and  Reject  shall  seek,  among  other
                  things,  authorization  to assume the Sun Leases.  On the date
                  upon which Lessees are required to satisfy Lessees'  Effective
                  Date  Obligations  as set forth in Section IX hereof,  Lessors
                  and Lessees  shall  execute  appropriate  instruments  in form
                  reasonably acceptable to the parties pursuant to which Lessees
                  assume the Sun Leases and Lessors acknowledge such assumption.

                           The Assumption and Rejection Order shall provide that
                           as of the Effective  Date the Leased  Property  under
                           the  Assumed  Manor Care Leases  shall be  integrated
                           into and become  subject to the Sun Qualicorp  Lease,
                           provided,  however,  that  the  options  to  purchase
                           contained  in the  Assumed  Manor Care  Leases  shall
                           continue  in full force and  effect,  and any and all
                           obligations  and  liabilities of the Lessee under the
                           Assumed  Manor Care Leases shall  become  obligations

                  ultimate parent of Lessees upon the effective date of the
                  plan of reorganization with respect to the Case or Cases as
                  such covenants may be amended,  modified or restated from
                  time to time  during  the term of such  guaranty,  and in the
                  event  there are no such  covenants,  to  provide  that
                  Guarantor and Lessees shall in good faith negotiate reasonable
                  financial covenants applicable to the Guarantor that

                  financial  condition of Guarantor  shall be adequate to
                  enable it to  perform its obligations under the Guaranty.

                  Guarantor  under the reinstated  Guaranty is the ultimate
                  parent of all of the  Lessees  under the Sun  Leases,  if at
                  any time after the  effective  date of the plan of
                  reorganization applicable  to a Lessee  under a Sun Lease, but
                  only during the Term of such Sun Lease,  such  Lessee  shall
                  grant a security  interest in the accounts  receivable of the

                  faith  efforts  to grant the Lessor  under such Sun Lease a
                  security  interest  in the  accounts  receivable  of such
                  Facility or Facilities,  provided, however, that the security
                  interest granted to such Lessor shall be subordinate to
                  such Third Party A/R Lien and be subject to such subordination
                  and  intercreditor  agreements as the holder of such

         non-appealable   Assumption  and  Rejection   Order,   (2)  a  plan  of
         reorganization  is  confirmed  with  respect to each of the Lessees and
         Guarantor and (3) no uncured material Event of Default exists under the
         applicable  Sun Lease (s),  the Lessees of the Sun Leases  shall have a
         right of first offer on the following terms and conditions:

      1.          In the event any Lessor or Lessors (such Lessor,  or
                  collectively,  such Lessors  "Seller")  shall wish to sell a
                  Facility or Facilities  then  subject to an Sun Lease or Sun
                  Leases  ("Designated  Assets")  at any time during the Fixed
                  Term of such Sun Lease, it shall first in writing offer to
                  enter into  negotiations  for such sale with the Lessee or
                  Lessees thereof or any  Affiliate of such Lessee or Lessees
                  ("Seller's  Notice").  If such Lessee or Lessees or an
                  Affiliate thereof  ("Buyer")  shall within ten (10) days from
                  receipt of Seller's  Notice give Seller Notice (as defined in
                  the applicable  Lease)("Buyer's  Notice")  that it wishes to
                  enter into good faith  negotiations  for the purchase of the
                  Designated  Assets ("Notice of Interest") within the specified
                  time period,  Seller and Buyer shall enter into good
                  faith  negotiations  for a period of thirty (30) days from
                  Lessor's  receipt of the Notice of Interest  ("Negotiation
                  Period") for the sale and purchase of the Designated  Assets.
                  If during the Negotiation  Period a written  agreement
                  with respect to the purchase and sale of the Designated Assets
                  ("Purchase Agreement") is executed by Seller and Buyer, Seller
                  shall sell and Buyer shall purchase the Designated Assets on
                  the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase  Agreement.
                  If (i) a Notice of Interest is not given as set forth above,
                  for a period of one (1) year after the  expiration of the time
                  within which a Notice of Interest was required to be given,
                  or (ii) a Notice of Interest is given but Seller and Buyer do
                  not execute a Purchase Agreement during the Negotiation
                  Period, for a period of one (1) year from the expiration of
                  the Negotiation Period, if Seller in its sole discretion
                  continues to desire to sell the Designated  Assets,  Seller
                  shall be free to sell the Designated  Assets to any third
                  party for a Cash Price that is not less than ninety eight
                  percent (98%) of a Cash Price offered  unconditionally  by
                  written  notice to Seller by Buyer during the  Negotiation
                  Period,  free from any claim of any right to purchase the
                  Designated  Assets by Buyer, Guarantor or any Affiliate of
                  Buyer or Guarantor.  For purposes of the  preceding  sentence,
                  a "Cash Price" shall be  the  amount to be  received by Seller
                  in cash or  equivalent  upon the  closing  of the sale net of
                  prorations  and expenses  to be borne by Seller.  If the
                  Designated  Assets are not sold  within  such one (1) year
                  period,  before entering into  negotiations  with any third
                  party for the sale of the  Designated  Assets Seller shall
                  first offer to enter into  negotiations  for the sale thereof
                  to Buyer pursuant to the process  described above. Any sale to
                  a third party shall be subject to the leasehold rights of the
                  applicable Lessee(s).

       2.         The  foregoing  right of first offer is not  assignable by the
                  Lessee to which it is given  hereunder  except to an Affiliate
                  of such Lessee.

      3.          The foregoing  right of first offer shall  simultaneously  and
                  automatically  terminate  as to any Sun Lease with  respect to
                  which the right of first offer would  otherwise be applicable,
                  upon termination of such Sun Lease, and the foregoing right of
                  first offer  shall not under any  circumstances  be  extended,
                  modified or in any way altered except by a writing executed by
                  the Lessor of the Sun Lease to which such right applies.
