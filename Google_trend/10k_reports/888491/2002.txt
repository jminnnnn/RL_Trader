PART I

Item 1 -- Business of the Company


Overview

     We were  incorporated  in the State of Maryland on March 31, 1992. We are a
self-administered   real  estate  investment   trust,  or  REIT,   investing  in
income-producing  healthcare  facilities,  principally long-term care facilities
located  in the  United  States.  We  provide  lease or  mortgage  financing  to
qualified  operators  of skilled  nursing  facilities  and, to a lesser  extent,
assisted  living  and  acute  care  facilities.  We have  historically  financed
investments  through borrowings under our revolving credit  facilities,  private
placements or public offerings of debt or equity  securities,  the assumption of
secured  indebtedness,  or a  combination  of  these  methods.  We also  finance
acquisitions through the exchange of properties or the issuance of shares of our
capital stock when the transactions otherwise satisfy our investment criteria.

     As of December 31, 2001, our portfolio of domestic investments consisted of
241 healthcare  facilities,  located in 28 states and operated by 35 third-party
operators.  Our  gross  investments  in these  facilities,  before  reserve  for
uncollectible loans, totaled $885.0 million at December 31, 2001. This portfolio
is made up of:

     o    135 long-term healthcare  facilities and two rehabilitation  hospitals
          owned and leased to third parties;

     o    fixed rate,  participating and convertible  participating mortgages on
          71 long-term healthcare facilities; and

     o    21 long-term healthcare  facilities that were recovered from customers
          and are currently operated through  third-party  management  contracts
          for our own account.

     In  addition,  we have  12  facilities  subject  to  third-party  leasehold
interests.  We  also  hold  miscellaneous   investments  and  closed  healthcare
facilities  held for sale of  approximately  $58.2 million at December 31, 2001,
including $22.3 million related to two  non-healthcare  facilities leased by the
United  States Postal  Service,  a $7.4 million  investment in Omega  Worldwide,
Inc.,  Principal  Healthcare Finance Limited,  and Principal  Healthcare Finance
Trust, and $14.3 million of notes receivable.

     Approximately  72% of our real estate  investments  were  operated by seven
public  companies,  including Sun Healthcare  Group,  Inc.  (24.7%),  Integrated
Health Services,  Inc. (18.8%,  including 10.8% as the manager for and 50% owner
of Lyric Health Care LLC),  Advocat Inc. (12.2%),  Mariner  Post-Acute  Network,
Inc. (6.7%),  Alterra Healthcare  Corporation (3.9%),  Kindred Healthcare,  Inc.
(formerly known as Vencor Operating,  Inc.) (3.2%), and Genesis Health Ventures,
Inc. (2.8%).  Kindred and Genesis manage  facilities for our own account,  which
are included in Owned and Operated  Assets.  The two largest  private  operators
represent 3.5% and 2.5%,  respectively,  of our  investments.  No other operator
represents more than 2.5% of our investments.  The three states in which we have
our highest concentration of investments are Florida (16.5%),  California (7.5%)
and Illinois (7.5%).

     Government Healthcare Regulation, Reimbursements and Industry Concentration
Risks.  Nearly  all  of  our  properties  are  used  as  healthcare  facilities;
therefore,  we are directly  affected by the risk associated with the healthcare
industry.  Our  lessees  and  mortgagors,  as well as the  facilities  owned and
operated for our account,  derive a  substantial  portion of their net operating
revenues from third-party payers,  including the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
These programs are highly regulated by federal,  state and local laws, rules and
regulations and subject to frequent and substantial  change. The Balanced Budget
Act of 1997 significantly  reduced spending levels for the Medicare and Medicaid
programs.  Due to the  implementation  of the terms of the Balanced  Budget Act,
effective July 1, 1998, the majority of skilled nursing  facilities shifted from
payments based on reimbursable cost to a prospective payment system for services
provided  to  Medicare  beneficiaries.  Under the  prospective  payment  system,
skilled nursing  facilities are paid on a per diem prospective case mix adjusted
payment  basis  for all  covered  services.  Implementation  of the  prospective
payment system has affected each long-term care facility to a different  degree,
depending  upon the  amount  of  revenue  it  derives  from  Medicare  patients.
Long-term care facilities have had to attempt to restructure their operations to
operate   profitably   under  the  new  Medicare   prospective   payment  system
reimbursement policies.

                                       1

     Legislation adopted in 1999 and 2000 increased Medicare payments to nursing
facilities and specialty  care  facilities.  Section 101 of the Balanced  Budget
Relief Act of 1999  ("BBRA")  included  a 20%  increase  for 15  patient  acuity
categories  (know as Resource  Utilization  Groups ("RUGS")) and a 4% across the
board  increase of the adjusted  federal per diem payment rate. The 20% increase
was implemented in April 2000 and will remain in effect until the implementation
of  refinements  in the  current  RUG  case-mix  classification  system  to more
accurately estimate the cost of non-therapy ancillary services.  The 4% increase
was  implemented  in April 2000 and will remain in effect  until  September  30,
2002.

     The  Benefits  Improvement  and  Patient  Protection  Act of 2000  ("BIPA")
included a 16.66%  increase in the nursing  component  of the case mix  adjusted
federal  periodic  payment  rate and a 6.7%  increase in the 14 RUG payments for
rehabilitation  therapy  services.  The 16.66% increase was implemented in April
2000 and will remain in effect until September 30, 2002. The 6.7% increase is an
adjustment  to the 20%  increase  granted  in the BBRA  and  spreads  the  funds
directed at 3 of those 15 RUGs to an  additional  11  rehabilitation  RUGs.  The
increase  was  implemented  in April  2001 and will  remain in effect  until the
implementation of refinements in the current RUG case-mix classification system.

     In addition,  the Medicare  Payment  Advisory  Commission,  an  independent
federal body  established by the Balanced  Budget Act of 1997,  has  recommended
that the 4% increase  implemented in BBRA and the 16.66% increase implemented in
BIPA be allowed to expire September 30, 2002. If the 4% and 16.66% increases are
not extended  beyond their  scheduled  expiration,  the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid  Services  ("CMS")  estimates  that  the  Medicare  reimbursement  will
decrease by  approximately  10% from the amount that would  otherwise be paid in
fiscal 2003.  Reimbursement  could be further reduced when CMS completes its RUG
refinement due to the  termination of the 20% and 6.7% increases.  However,  the
Medicare  Payment  Advisory  Commission  has  recommended  that the 20% and 6.7%
increases  be  folded  into  the  base  rate  upon  the  completion  of the  RUG
refinement.  The expiration of any BBRA and BIPA increases could have an adverse
impact  on the  revenues  of the  operators  of  nursing  facilities  and  would
negatively  impact their ability to satisfy their monthly lease or debt payments
to us. The Medicare  Payment  Advisory  Commission has also recommended that the
annual  update  in  rates  for  fiscal  2003  be 0%  for  free-standing  nursing
facilities and 10% for hospital nursing facilities.

     Due to the temporary  nature of these payment  increases,  we cannot assure
you that the federal  reimbursement  will remain at levels comparable to present
levels  and that  such  reimbursement  will be  sufficient  for our  lessees  or
mortgagors to cover all operating and fixed costs necessary to care for Medicare
and Medicaid  patients.  We also cannot assure you that there will be any future
legislation to increase payment rates for skilled nursing facilities. If payment
rates for skilled  nursing  facilities are not increased in the future,  some of
our lessees and mortgagors may have difficulty meeting their payment obligations
to us.

     Each state has its own Medicaid program that is funded jointly by the state
and federal government.  Federal law governs how each state manages its Medicaid
program, but there is wide latitude for states to customize Medicaid programs to
fit the needs and  resources of its citizens.  The Balanced  Budget Act repealed
the federal payment standard,  also known as the Boren Amendment,  for hospitals
and nursing  facilities under Medicaid,  increasing  states' discretion over the
administration  of  Medicaid  programs.  A  number  of  states  are  considering
legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures which could result in
decreased revenues for our lessees and mortgagors.

     In  addition,   private  payors,   including   managed  care  payors,   are
increasingly   demanding   discounted  fee  structures  and  the  assumption  by
healthcare  providers of all or a portion of the  financial  risk of operating a
healthcare facility. Efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost
controls are expected to continue.  Any changes in reimbursement  policies which
reduce  reimbursement  levels could adversely affect the amounts we receive with
respect to our owned and operated  portfolio and the revenues of our lessees and
mortgagors and thereby adversely affect those lessees' and mortgagors' abilities
to make their monthly lease or debt payments to us.

     The  possibility  that the healthcare  facilities  will not generate income
sufficient  to meet  operating  expenses or will yield  returns lower than those
available through investments in comparable real estate or other investments are
additional  risks of investing in  healthcare-related  real estate.  Income from
properties  and yields from  investments  in such  properties may be affected by
many  factors,  including  changes in  governmental  regulation  (such as zoning
laws),  general or local economic  conditions  (such as fluctuations in interest
rates and  employment  conditions),  the  available  local supply and demand for
improved real estate, a reduction in rental income as the result of an inability
to maintain occupancy levels, natural disasters (such as earthquakes and floods)
or similar factors.

     Real estate  investments are relatively  illiquid and,  therefore,  tend to
limit our  ability to vary our  portfolio  promptly  in  response  to changes in
economic or other  conditions.  Thus, if the operation of any of our  properties
becomes  unprofitable  due to competition,  age of improvements or other factors
such that the lessee or borrower  becomes unable to meet its  obligations on the
lease  or  mortgage  loan,  the  liquidation   value  of  the  property  may  be
substantially  less,  particularly  relative to the amount  owing on any related
mortgage loan, than would be the case if the property were readily  adaptable to
other uses.

                                       2
<PAGE>

     Potential Risks from  Bankruptcies.  Our lease  arrangements with operators
who operate more than one of our  facilities  are  generally  made pursuant to a
single master lease covering all of that  operator's  facilities.  Although each
lease or master lease  provides  that we may terminate the master lease upon the
bankruptcy  or  insolvency  of the  tenant,  the  Bankruptcy  Reform Act of 1978
provides that a trustee in a bankruptcy or  reorganization  proceeding under the
Bankruptcy Act, or a debtor-in-possession in a reorganization, has the power and
the  option  to  assume  or  reject  the  unexpired   lease   obligations  of  a
debtor-lessee. In the event that the unexpired lease is assumed on behalf of the
debtor-lessee, all the rental obligations thereunder generally would be entitled
to a priority over other unsecured claims. However, the court also has the power
to  modify a lease if a  debtor-lessee  in a  reorganization  were  required  to
perform  certain  provisions  of a lease that the court  determined to be unduly
burdensome.  It is not  possible to determine at this time whether or not any of
our leases or master leases contain any such provision.  If a lease is rejected,
the lessor has a general  unsecured claim limited to any unpaid rent already due
plus an amount equal to the rent reserved under the lease, without acceleration,
for the greater of one year or 15% of the remaining  term of such lease,  not to
exceed three years.

     Generally,  with  respect  to our  mortgage  loans,  the  imposition  of an
automatic stay under the Bankruptcy Act precludes us from exercising foreclosure
or other remedies against the debtor.  Pre-petition  creditors  generally do not
have rights to the cash flows from the properties underlying the mortgages.  The
timing of the collection from mortgagors in bankruptcy depends on negotiating an
acceptable  settlement  with the  mortgagor  (and  subject  to  approval  of the
bankruptcy court) or the order of the bankruptcy court in the event a negotiated
settlement  cannot be achieved.  A mortgagee also is treated  differently from a
landlord  in three key  respects.  First,  the  mortgage  loan is not subject to
assumption  or  rejection  because it is not an  executory  contract or a lease.
Second,  the  mortgagee's  loan may be divided  into (1) a secured  loan for the
portion of the mortgage  debt that does not exceed the value of the property and
(2) a general  unsecured  loan for the portion of the mortgage debt that exceeds
the value of the property.  A secured  creditor such as ourselves is entitled to
the recovery of interest and costs only if, and to the extent that, the value of
the collateral  exceeds the amount owed. If the value of the collateral  exceeds
the amount of the debt,  interest  and allowed  costs may not be paid during the
bankruptcy  proceeding but accrue until confirmation of a plan of reorganization
or such other time as the court orders. If the value of the collateral held by a
senior creditor is less than the secured debt, interest on the loan for the time
period  between  the  filing  of the case and  confirmation  may be  disallowed.
Finally, while a lease generally would either be rejected or assumed with all of
its benefits and burdens intact, the terms of a mortgage,  including the rate of
interest and timing of principal payments, may be modified if the debtor is able
to effect a "cramdown" under the Bankruptcy Act.

     The receipt of liquidation  proceeds or the replacement of an operator that
has  defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval  process of
any federal, state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the property or
the  replacement of the operator  licensed to manage the facility.  In addition,
some significant  expenditures  associated with real estate investment,  such as
real  estate  taxes and  maintenance  costs,  are  generally  not  reduced  when
circumstances  cause a  reduction  in income  from the  investment.  In order to
protect our  investments,  we may take  possession  of a property or even become
licensed  as an  operator,  which  might  expose us to  successor  liability  to
government programs or require us to indemnify  subsequent  operators to whom we
might  transfer the operating  rights and licenses.  Third party payors may also
suspend  payments to us  following  foreclosure  until we receive  the  required
licenses to operate the  facilities.  Should such events  occur,  our income and
cash flow from operations would be adversely affected.

     Risks  Related  to Owned  and  Operated  Assets.  As a  consequence  of the
financial  difficulties  encountered  by a  number  of our  operators,  we  have
recovered  various  long-term  care  assets,   pledged  as  collateral  for  the
operators' obligations,  either in connection with a restructuring or settlement
with certain  operators  or pursuant to  foreclosure  proceedings.  During 2000,
$24.3 million of assets previously classified as held for sale were reclassified
to  "Owned  and  Operated  Assets"  as the  timing  and  strategy  for  sale or,
alternatively, re-leasing, were revised in light of prevailing market conditions
(See Item 7 - Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition and
Results of Operations - Overview).

     We are typically  required to hold applicable  licenses and are responsible
for  the  regulatory  compliance  at our  owned  and  operated  facilities.  Our
management  contracts with third party  operators for these  properties  provide
that the third-party operator is responsible for regulatory  compliance,  but we
could be sanctioned for violation of regulatory  requirements.  In addition, the
risk of third-party  claims such as patient care and personal  injury claims may
be higher with respect to our owned and operated  properties  as compared to our
leased and mortgaged assets.

Description of the Business

     Investment  Policies.  We maintain a  diversified  portfolio  of  long-term
healthcare  facilities  and  mortgages on healthcare  facilities  located in the
United States. In making investments,  we generally have focused on established,
creditworthy,  middle-market  healthcare  operators  that meet our standards for
quality  and  experience  of  management.   We  have  sought  to  diversify  our
investments in terms of geographic locations, operators and facility types. As a
consequence of our current financial condition and upcoming debt maturities,  we
have not recently made investments and do not intend to make investments unless,
and until we address,  our $98.0  million of debt  maturing in the first half of
2002.

     In evaluating potential investments, we consider such factors as:

     o    the quality and experience of management and the  creditworthiness  of
          the operator of the facility;

     o    the facility's  historical,  current and forecasted  cash flow and its
          adequacy to meet operational needs,  capital expenditures and lease or
          debt service obligations, providing a competitive return on investment
          to us;

     o    the construction quality, condition and design of the facility;

                                       4
<PAGE>

     o    the geographic area and type of facility;

     o    the tax,  growth,  regulatory  and  reimbursement  environment  of the
          community in which the facility is located;

     o    the occupancy and demand for similar healthcare facilities in the same
          or nearby communities; and

     o    the payor mix of private, Medicare and Medicaid patients.

     One of our fundamental  investment strategies is to obtain contractual rent
escalations  under long-term,  non-cancelable,  "triple-net"  leases and revenue
participation  through  participating  mortgage loans, and to obtain substantial
liquidity  deposits.  Additional  security is  typically  provided by  covenants
regarding  minimum working capital and net worth,  liens on accounts  receivable
and  other  operating  assets,   and  various   provisions  for   cross-default,
cross-collateralization and corporate/personal guarantees, when appropriate.

     We prefer to invest in equity  ownership of properties.  Due to regulatory,
tax  or  other  considerations,   we  sometimes  pursue  alternative  investment
structures,  including  convertible  participating and participating  mortgages,
that achieve returns comparable to equity investments.  The following summarizes
the four primary investment  structures currently used by us. Average annualized
yields  reflect  existing  contractual  arrangements.  However,  in  view of the
ongoing  financial  challenges in the long-term care industry,  we cannot assure
you that the operators of our facilities will meet their payment  obligations in
full or when due.  Therefore,  the  annualized  yields as of January 1, 2002 set
forth below are not  necessarily  indicative of or a forecast of actual  yields,
which may be lower.

          Purchase/Leaseback.  In a Purchase/Leaseback  transaction, we purchase
          the property  from the operator and lease it back to the operator over
          terms  ranging from 8 to 17 years,  plus renewal  options.  The leases
          originated by us generally  provide for minimum  annual  rentals which
          are subject to annual  formula  increases  based upon such  factors as
          increases  in the  consumer  price index  ("CPI") or  increases in the
          revenue streams generated by the underlying  properties,  with certain
          fixed minimum and maximum  levels.  Generally,  the operator  holds an
          option to  repurchase  the  property  at set dates at prices  based on
          specified  formulas.  The  average  annualized  yield from  leases was
          11.29% at January 1, 2002.

          Convertible   Participating   Mortgage.    Convertible   participating
          mortgages are secured by first mortgage  liens on the underlying  real
          estate and  personal  property of the  mortgagor.  Interest  rates are
          usually subject to annual increases based upon increases in the CPI or
          increases in the revenues  generated by the underlying  long-term care
          facilities,  with certain  maximum limits.  Convertible  participating
          mortgages  afford us the option to convert  our  mortgage  into direct
          ownership of the property, generally at a point six to nine years from
          inception.  If we exercise our purchase  option,  we are  obligated to
          lease  the  property  back  to the  operator  for the  balance  of the
          originally agreed term and for the originally agreed participations in
          revenues  or CPI  adjustments.  This allows us to capture a portion of
          the potential  appreciation in value of the real estate.  The operator
          has the  right to buy out our  option  at  prices  based on  specified
          formulas.   The  average  annualized  yield  on  these  mortgages  was
          approximately 10.40% at January 1, 2002.

          Participating   Mortgage.   Participating  mortgages  are  similar  to
          convertible  participating  mortgages  except  that  we do not  have a
          purchase  option.   Interest  rates  are  usually  subject  to  annual
          increases  based upon increases in the CPI or increases in revenues of
          the underlying long-term care facilities, with certain maximum limits.
          The average  annualized yield on these  investments was  approximately
          10.78% at January 1, 2002.

          Fixed-Rate  Mortgage.  These  mortgages have a fixed interest rate for
          the  mortgage  term and are  secured  by first  mortgage  liens on the
          underlying  real estate and personal  property of the  mortgagor.  The
          average annualized yield on these investments was 11.08% at January 1,
          2002.

</TABLE>

     The table set forth in Item 2 - Properties,  contains information regarding
our  real  estate  properties,  their  geographic  locations,  and the  types of
investment structures as of December 31, 2001.

     Borrowing  Policies.   We  may  incur  additional   indebtedness  and  have
historically sought to maintain a long-term  debt-to-total  capitalization ratio
in the range of 40% to 50%. Total  capitalization is total stockholders'  equity
plus long-term debt. We intend to periodically review our policy with respect to
our  debt-to-total  capitalization  ratio  and  to  modify  the  policy  as  our
management deems prudent in light of prevailing market conditions.  Our strategy
generally has been to match the maturity of our  indebtedness  with the maturity
of our investment assets, and to employ long-term, fixed-rate debt to the extent
practicable in view of market conditions in existence from time to time.

     We may use proceeds of any  additional  indebtedness  to provide  permanent
financing for  investments in additional  healthcare  facilities.  We may obtain
either secured or unsecured indebtedness,  and may obtain indebtedness which may
be  convertible  into capital  stock or be  accompanied  by warrants to purchase
capital  stock.  Where debt financing is present on terms deemed  favorable,  we
generally  may  invest in  properties  subject  to  existing  loans,  secured by
mortgages, deeds of trust or similar liens on properties.

     Industry turmoil and continuing adverse economic conditions have caused the
terms on which we can obtain additional borrowings to become unfavorable.  If we
need  capital  to  repay  indebtedness  as it  matures,  we may be  required  to
liquidate investments in properties at times which may not permit realization of
the maximum recovery on these investments. This could also result in adverse tax
consequences to us. We may be required to issue  additional  equity interests in
our company,  which could dilute your  investment in our company.  (See Item 7 -
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources).

     Federal  Income  Tax  Considerations.  We  intend  to make and  manage  our
investments, including the sale or disposition of property or other investments,
and to  operate  in such a manner as to  qualify  as a REIT  under the  Internal
Revenue  Code,  unless,  because of changes in  circumstances  or changes in the
Internal Revenue Code, our Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in
our best  interest to qualify as a REIT.  As a REIT,  we generally  will not pay
federal  income  taxes on the  portion of our  income  which is  distributed  to
stockholders.

     Securities  Or  Interest  In  Persons  Primarily  Engaged  In  Real  Estate
Activities.   In  November  1997,  we  formed  Omega  Worldwide,   Inc.  ("Omega
Worldwide"),  a company which provides asset management  services and management
advisory  services,  as  well as  equity  and  debt  capital  to the  healthcare
industry,  particularly residential healthcare services to the elderly. On April
2, 1998, we contributed  substantially all of our assets in Principal Healthcare
Finance Limited,  an Isle of Jersey (United Kingdom) company, to Omega Worldwide
in exchange for approximately 8.5 million shares of Omega Worldwide common stock
and 260,000  shares of Series B preferred  stock.  Of the 8.5 million  shares of
Omega  Worldwide  common  stock we  received,  approximately  5.2  million  were
distributed on April 2, 1998 to our stockholders, and we sold 2.3 million shares
on April 3, 1998. As of December 31, 2001,  the carrying value of our investment
in Omega  Worldwide is $4.5 million  represented  by 1,163,000  shares of common
stock and  260,000  shares of  preferred  stock.  We also  have  entered  into a
services  agreement with Omega Worldwide which provides for an allocation of the

                                       6
<PAGE>

indirect costs incurred by us to Omega Worldwide.  (See "Affiliate Relationships
and  Transactions").  We  also  hold  a $1.6  million  investment  in  Principal
Healthcare  Finance  Limited  and a $1.3  million  investment  in the  Principal
Healthcare Finance Trust, an Australian Unit Trust.

     Policies  With  Respect To Certain  Activities.  If our Board of  Directors
determines that additional funding is required,  we may raise such funds through
additional equity offerings, debt financing,  retention of cash flow (subject to
provisions in the Internal  Revenue Code concerning  taxability of undistributed
REIT taxable income) or a combination of these methods.

     In the event that our Board of  Directors  determines  to raise  additional
equity capital,  it has the authority,  without stockholder  approval,  to issue
additional  common stock or preferred  stock in any manner and on such terms and
for such consideration it deems appropriate, including in exchange for property.
In July 2000, we issued shares of our Series C  Convertible  Preferred  Stock to
Explorer  Holdings,  L.P.  ("Explorer")  in exchange for an investment of $100.0
million.

     Borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings, secured or unsecured, and
publicly or privately placed debt instruments, purchase money obligations to the
sellers  of  assets,  long-term,  tax-exempt  bonds  or  financing  from  banks,
institutional  investors  or  other  lenders,  securitizations,   any  of  which
indebtedness  may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests
in the asset. Such indebtedness may be recourse to all or any part of our assets
or may be limited to the particular asset to which the indebtedness relates.

     On December 21, 2001, we reached  amended  agreements  with the bank groups
under both of our revolving credit  facilities.  As of the closing of the rights
offering  and the private  placement  to Explorer on February  21,  2002,  these
amendments  became  effective  (See  Note  19  to  our  Consolidated   Financial
Statements - Subsequent Events).

     As part of the  amendment  regarding  our $75.0  million  revolving  credit
facility, we prepaid $10.0 million originally scheduled to mature in March 2002.
This  voluntary  prepayment  results  in a  permanent  reduction  in  the  total
commitment, thereby reducing the credit facility to $65.0 million. The agreement
regarding  our $175.0  million  revolving  credit  facility  includes a one-year
extension  in  maturity  from  December  31, 2002 to December  31,  2003,  and a
reduction in the total commitment from $175.0 million to $160.0 million. Amounts
up to $150.0  million may be drawn upon to repay the maturing 6.95% Notes due in
June 2002.

     We have  authority  to offer  our  common  stock or  other  equity  or debt
securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our
shares or any other  securities and may engage in such activities in the future.
Similarly,  we may offer additional interests in our operating  partnership that
are  exchangeable  into common  shares or, at our option,  cash, in exchange for
property. We also may make loans to our subsidiaries.

     Subject to the  percentage  of ownership  limitations  and gross income and
asset tests  necessary  for REIT  qualification,  we may invest in securities of
other REITs,  other entities engaged in real estate  activities or securities of
other  issuers,  including  for the  purpose  of  exercising  control  over such
entities.

     We may engage in the purchase and sale of investments. We do not underwrite
the securities of other issuers.

     Our officers and directors may change any of these policies  without a vote
of our stockholders.

     In the opinion of our management,  our properties are adequately covered by
insurance.

     Competition. We compete for additional healthcare facility investments with
other healthcare  investors,  including other real estate investment trusts. The
operators of the  facilities  compete with other  regional or local nursing care
facilities for the support of the medical  community,  including  physicians and
acute  care  hospitals,   as  well  as  the  general  public.  Some  significant
competitive factors for the placing of patients in skilled and intermediate care
nursing facilities include quality of care,  reputation,  physical appearance of
the facilities,  services offered,  family  preferences,  physician services and
price.

</TABLE>

     Our core portfolio consists of long-term lease and mortgage agreements. Our
leased real estate  properties are leased under provisions of master leases with
initial  terms  typically  ranging from 10 to 16 years,  plus  renewal  options.
Substantially  all of the master leases  provide for minimum annual rentals that
are subject to annual  increases based upon increases in the CPI or increases in
revenues of the underlying  properties,  with certain limits. Under the terms of
the leases,  the lessee is responsible for all maintenance,  repairs,  taxes and
insurance on the leased properties.

     Our  owned  and  operated  facilities,   like  those  of  our  lessees  and
mortgagees,  are  subject to  government  regulation  and  derive a  substantial
portion of their net operating revenues from third-party  payors,  including the
Medicare and Medicaid programs.

     Our owned and operated  facilities are managed by independent third parties
under  management  contracts.  These managers are responsible for the day-to-day
operation  of the  facilities,  including,  among other  things,  patient  care,
staffing,   billing  and  collection  of  patient  accounts  and  facility-level
financial reporting. For their services, the managers are paid a management fee,
typically  based on a percentage  of nursing home  revenues.  As of December 31,
2001, we had 33 properties  classified as owned and operated.  Due to re-leasing
and sales,  as of the date of this filing,  we have 19 properties  classified as
owned and operated. (See Note 19 - Subsequent Events to our audited Consolidated
Financial Statements).

                                       10

     As a consequence of the financial  difficulties  encountered by a number of
our  operators,  we have  recovered  various  long-term  care assets  pledged as
collateral  for  the  operators'   obligations   either  in  connection  with  a
restructuring  or settlement  with certain  operators or pursuant to foreclosure
proceedings. Under normal circumstances,  we would seek to re-lease or otherwise
dispose of such assets as promptly as practicable.  When we adopt a plan to sell
a property,  the  property is  classified  as Assets Held for Sale.  However,  a
number of companies are actively marketing  portfolios of similar assets and, in
light of the current  conditions in the long-term care industry,  generally,  it
has become more difficult both to sell such properties and for potential  buyers
to obtain financing to acquire such properties.

     As of December  31,  2001,  there are eight  properties  in assets held for
sale,  representing a total  investment,  net of impairment of $7.4 million.  Of
these eight properties, three are under contract for sale. However, no assurance
can be given that the sales will be realized,  as there are  financing and other
contingencies on these contracts.

Item 3 - Legal Proceedings

     We are  subject  to various  legal  proceedings,  claims and other  actions
arising out of the normal  course of  business.  While any legal  proceeding  or
claim has an element of uncertainty, we believe that the outcome of each lawsuit
claim  or  legal  proceeding  that  is  pending  or  threatened,  or all of them
combined,  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

     On June 21,  2000,  we were  named as a  defendant  in  certain  litigation
brought  against us by  Madison/OHI  Liquidity  Investors,  LLC  ("Madison"),  a
customer  that claims that we have  breached  and/or  anticipatorily  breached a
commercial  contract.  Ronald M.  Dickerman  and Bryan  Gordon are  partners  in
Madison and limited  guarantors of Madison's  obligations  to us. Madison claims
damages as a result of the alleged  breach of  approximately  $700,000.  Madison
seeks  damages  as a result  of the  claimed  anticipatory  breach  in an amount
ranging from $15 - $28 million or, in the  alternative,  Madison seeks  specific
performance  of the  contract as modified  by a course of conduct  that  Madison
alleges developed between Madison and our company. We contend that Madison is in
default  under the  contract in  question.  We believe  that the  litigation  is
meritless.   We  continue  to   vigorously   defend  the  case  and  have  filed
counterclaims   against  Madison  and  the  guarantors   seeking   repayment  of
approximately $10.2 million,  including default interest,  that Madison owes us,
as well as damages resulting from the conversion of the collateral  securing our
loan.  The trial in this matter is currently set for July,  2002.  The financial
statements do not contain any  adjustments  relating to the ultimate  outcome of
this uncertainty.

     On December 29, 1998,  Karrington  Health,  Inc. brought suit against us in
the Franklin County, Ohio, Common Pleas Court (subsequently  removed to the U.S.
District Court for the Southern  District of Ohio,  Eastern  Division)  alleging
that we repudiated and ultimately  breached a financing  contract to provide $95
million of  financing  for the  development  of 13 assisted  living  facilities.
Karrington  was  seeking  recovery  of  approximately  $34 million in damages it
alleged to have incurred as a result of the breach.  On August 13, 2001, we paid
Karrington  $10 million to settle all claims  arising from the suit, but without
our admission of any liability or fault,  which  liability is expressly  denied.
Based  on the  settlement,  the  suit has been  dismissed  with  prejudice.  The
settlement was recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2001.

     No matters were submitted to stockholders  during the fourth quarter of the

     The closing price on December 31, 2001 was $6.02 per share.  As of December
31,  2001,  there  were  19,998,896  shares of  common  stock  outstanding  with
approximately  2,050  registered  holders and  approximately  15,700  beneficial
owners.

     We do not know when or if we will  resume  dividend  payments on our common
stock or, if resumed,  what the amount or timing of any dividend  will be. We do
not anticipate paying dividends on any class of capital stock at least until our
$98  million of debt  maturing in the first half of 2002 has been repaid and, in
any event,  all accrued and unpaid  dividends on our Series A, B and C preferred
stock must be paid in full before dividends on our common stock can be resumed.

Overview

     The  long-term  care  industry  has  experienced   unprecedented  financial
challenges in the recent past that have had an adverse  impact on us during 2000
and 2001.  These  challenges are due  principally to the Balanced  Budget Act of
1997, which introduced the prospective  payment system for the  reimbursement of
Medicare  patients in skilled nursing  facilities,  implementing an acuity-based
reimbursement system in lieu of the cost-based reimbursement system historically
used. The prospective payment system  significantly  reduced payments to nursing
home operators. That reduction, in turn, has negatively affected the revenues of
our nursing home  facilities  and the ability of our nursing  home  operators to
service  their  capital  costs to us. Many nursing home  operators,  including a
number of our large nursing home operators, have sought protection under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Act.

     In  response  to the  adverse  impact  of the  prospective  payment  system
reimbursement cuts, the Federal government passed the Balanced Budget Refinement
Act of 1999 and the Benefits  Improvement  and Protection  Act of 2000,  both of
which  increase  payments  to  nursing  home  operators.  These  increases  have
positively  affected the revenues of our nursing home facilities and the ability
of our nursing home operators to service their capital costs to us. In addition,
the facilities  that we own and currently  operate for our own account have been
likewise  positively affected by the Balanced Budget Refinement Act and Benefits
Improvement  and Protection Act.  However,  certain of the increases in Medicare
reimbursement  for skilled  nursing  facilities  provided for under the Balanced
Budget  Refinement  Act and the Benefits  Improvement  and  Protection  Act will
sunset in October 2002. Unless Congress enacts additional legislation,  the loss
of revenues associated with this occurrence could have a material adverse effect
on our  operators,  and on us. We cannot  presently  predict  what impact  these
proposals may have, if any.

     The initial impact of the prospective  payment system  negatively  affected
our  financial  results  and our  access to capital  sources to fund  growth and
refinance existing indebtedness.  To obtain sufficient liquidity to enable us to
address the maturity in July 2000 and  February  2001 of  indebtedness  totaling
$129.8 million, we issued $100.0 million of Series C preferred stock to Explorer
Holdings,  L.P. ("Explorer") in July 2000 as described in more detail in Note 10
to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

     As a consequence of the financial  difficulties  encountered by a number of
our nursing home  operators,  we have  recovered  various  long-term care assets
pledged as collateral for the operators' obligations either in connection with a
restructuring  or settlement  with certain  operators or pursuant to foreclosure
proceedings.  Under  normal  circumstances,  we would  classify  such  assets as
"assets held for sale" and seek to re-lease or otherwise  dispose of such assets
as  promptly  as  practicable.  However,  a number of  companies  were  actively
marketing portfolios of similar assets and, in light of the market conditions in
the long-term care industry generally, it had become more difficult both to sell
these  properties and for potential  buyers to obtain financing to acquire them.
As a result,  during 2000, $24.3 million of assets previously classified as held
for sale were  reclassified  to "owned  and  operated  assets" as the timing and
strategy  for sale  or,  alternatively,  re-leasing,  were  revised  in light of
prevailing market conditions.

     At December 31, 2000, we owned 69 long-term healthcare  facilities that had
been recovered  from  customers and are currently  operated for our own account.
Due to re-leasing and asset sales,  we owned 33 such  facilities at December 31,
2001.  During 1999,  2000 and 2001, we  experienced  a  significant  increase in
nursing home revenues attributable to the increase in owned and operated assets.
In addition,  in  connection  with the recovery of these  assets,  we often fund
working capital and deferred capital expenditure needs for a transitional period
until  license  transfers  and  other  regulatory   matters  are  completed  and
reimbursement  from third-party  payors  recommences.  Our management intends to
sell or re-lease these assets as promptly as possible, consistent with achieving
valuations that reflect our  management's  estimate of fair realizable  value of
the  assets.  We do not  know,  however,  if or when  the  dispositions  will be
completed  or whether  the  dispositions  will be  completed  on terms that will
enable us to realize the fair value of such assets.

     In November 2000,  Explorer  agreed to defer receipt until April 2, 2001 of
$4.7  million in  dividends  declared in October  2000 on the Series C preferred
stock.  We requested  this deferral in light of the maturity in February 2001 of
$16.6 million of subordinated debentures. In February 2001, we suspended payment
of all dividends on all common and preferred stock.  This action was intended to
preserve  cash to  facilitate  our  ability  to  obtain  financing  to fund debt
maturing in 2002.  Additionally,  on March 30, 2001,  we exercised our option to
pay the deferred Series C preferred  stock dividend and associated  deferral fee
by issuing  48,420  additional  shares of Series C preferred  stock to Explorer.
These shares are  convertible  into 774,722  shares of our common stock at $6.25
per share.  We do not know when or if we will  resume  dividend  payments on our
common stock or, if resumed,  what the amount or timing of any dividend will be.
We do not  anticipate  paying  dividends on any class of capital  stock at least
until  our $98  million  of debt  maturing  in the  first  half of 2002 has been
repaid,  and in any event,  all accrued and unpaid  dividends on our Series A, B
and C preferred stock must be paid in full before  dividends on our common stock
can  be  resumed.   We  have  made  sufficient   distributions  to  satisfy  the
distribution  requirements  under the REIT rules of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 to maintain our REIT status.

     On October 9, 2001,  we announced  that we were  relocating  our  corporate
offices  effective  as of January  1, 2002 to  Timonium,  Maryland,  a suburb of
Baltimore.  All of our  current  employees  as of the  date of the  announcement
either had  employment  agreements or were  otherwise  entitled to incentives if
they  remained   employed  with  us  in  their  current   positions  during  the
transitional period, which was completed by January 31, 2002.

     In August 2001, we paid $10 million to settle a lawsuit  brought against us
by  Karrington  Health,  Inc.  The  recognition  of this  non-recurring  expense
associated  with the settlement has resulted in violations of certain  financial
covenants in the loan agreements relating to our revolving credit facilities. On
December 21, 2001, we reached amended agreements with the bank groups under both
of our  revolving  credit  facilities  which  included  waivers of the  covenant
violations.  As of the closing of the rights  offering and private  placement to
Explorer on February 21, 2002 these  amendments  became effective (See Note 19 -
Subsequent Events to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

Critical Accounting Policies

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities,  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     Owned and Operated  Assets and Assets Held for Sale. In the ordinary course
of our business activities,  we periodically  evaluate investment  opportunities
and extend credit to customers. We regularly engage in lease and loan extensions
and modifications.  Additionally, we monitor and manage our investment portfolio
with the  objectives of improving  credit  quality and  increasing  returns.  In
connection  with  portfolio  management,  we engage in  various  collection  and
foreclosure  activities.  When we acquire real estate  pursuant to a foreclosure
proceeding,  it is designated as "owned and operated  assets" and is recorded at
the lower of cost or fair  value.  Such  amounts  are  included  in real  estate
properties on our  Consolidated  Balance Sheet.  Operating  assets and operating
liabilities  for the owned and operated  properties are shown  separately on the
face of our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet and are  detailed in Note  16--Segment
Information.

     When a formal  plan to sell real  estate  is  adopted,  the real  estate is
classified as "assets held for sale," with the net carrying  amount  adjusted to
the lower of cost or estimated fair value,  less cost of disposal.  Depreciation
of the facilities is excluded from operations  after management has committed to
a plan to sell the asset.

     Impairment  of  Assets.   Provisions  for  impairment   losses  related  to
long-lived  assets are recognized  when expected future cash flows are less than
the carrying values of the assets.  If indicators of impairment are present,  we
evaluate  the  carrying  value  of  the  related  real  estate   investments  in
relationship to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying facilities.
If the sum of the expected future cash flow,  including sales proceeds,  is less
than carrying value, we then adjust the net carrying value of leased  properties
and other long-lived assets to the present value of expected future cash flows.

     Loan  Impairment  Policy.  When  management  identifies  an  indication  of
potential  loan  impairment,  such as  non-payment  under the loan  documents or
impairment of the underlying collateral, the loan is written down to the present
value of the expected  future cash flows.  In cases where  expected  future cash
flows  cannot be  estimated,  the loan is written down to the fair value of that
collateral.

                                       15
<PAGE>

     Accounts  Receivable.  Accounts  Receivable  consist primarily of lease and
mortgage interest  payments.  Amounts recorded include estimated  provisions for
loss related to uncollectible accounts and disputed items.

     Accounts  Receivable--Owned  and Operated Assets.  Accounts Receivable from
Owned and  Operated  Assets  consist of amounts due from  Medicare  and Medicaid
programs,  other  government  programs,  managed care health  plans,  commercial
insurance companies and individual patients.  Amounts recorded include estimated
provisions for loss related to uncollectable accounts and disputed items.

     Revenue  Recognition.   Rental  income  and  mortgage  interest  income  is
recognized  as earned over the terms of the related  master  leases and mortgage
notes,   respectively.   Such  income  includes  periodic   increases  based  on
pre-determined formulas (i.e., such as increases in the Consumer Price Index) as
defined in the master  leases and mortgage loan  agreements.  Reserves are taken
against earned revenues from leases and mortgages when collection of amounts due
become   questionable  or  when  negotiations  for  restructurings  of  troubled
operators  lead  to  lower  expectations  regarding  ultimate  collection.  When
collection is uncertain,  lease revenues are recorded as received,  after taking
into  account  application  of security  deposits.  Interest  income on impaired
mortgage loans is recognized as received  after taking into account  application
of security deposits.

     Nursing home revenues from owned and operated assets  (primarily  Medicare,
Medicaid and other third party insurance) are recognized as patient services are
provided.

Results of Operations

     The following is our discussion of the consolidated  results of operations,
financial position and liquidity and capital resources,  which should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

Year Ended December 31, 2001 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000

     Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled $257.6 million, a
decrease of $18.2 million over 2000 revenues. Excluding nursing home revenues of
owned and  operated  assets,  revenues  were  $89.5  million  for the year ended
December 31, 2001, a decrease of $10.8  million from the  comparable  prior year
period.

     Our rental  income for the year  ended  December  31,  2001  totaled  $61.2
million, a decrease of $6.1 million over 2000 rental income. The decrease is due
to  $6.3  million  from  reductions  in  lease  revenue  due  to   foreclosures,
bankruptcies,  restructurings and reserve for non-payment of certain leases, and
$1.8 million from reduced investments caused by 2000 and 2001 asset sales. These
decreases are offset by $1.3 million relating to contractual  increases in rents
that became  effective in 2001 as defined under the related  agreements and $0.7
million relating to assets previously classified as owned and operated.

     Our mortgage  interest  income for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled
$20.8 million,  decreasing $3.3 million over 2000 mortgage interest income.  The
decrease  is  due  to  $1.6  million  from   reductions  due  to   foreclosures,
bankruptcies,  restructurings  and reserve for non-payment of certain  mortgages
and $2.0 million from reduced  investments  caused by the payoffs of  mortgages.
These  decreases are partially  offset by $0.2 million  relating to  contractual
increases in interest income that became  effective in 2001 as defined under the
related agreements and $0.1 million relating to assets previously  classified as
owned and operated.

     Our nursing home  revenues of owned and operated  assets for the year ended
December  31, 2001 totaled  $168.1  million,  decreasing  $7.4 million over 2000
nursing home revenues. The decrease is due to the sale and re-leasing of certain
owned and operated assets during the year.

     Our expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled  $276.7  million,
decreasing approximately $58.7 million over expenses of $335.3 million for 2000.

     Our nursing home expenses for owned and operated assets decreased to $176.2
million from $179.0  million in 2000 due to the sale and  re-leasing  of certain
owned and operated assets during the year.

     The 2001 provision for depreciation and amortization of real estate totaled
$22.1  million,  decreasing  $1.2  million  over 2000.  The  decrease  primarily
consists of $0.9 million  depreciation  expense for properties  sold or held for
sale and a reduction in amortization  of non-compete  agreements of $0.7 million

                                       16
<PAGE>

offset  by  $0.3  million  additional   depreciation   expense  from  properties
previously classified as mortgages and new investments placed in service in 2000
and 2001.

     Our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was approximately
$36.3 million, compared with $42.4 million for 2000. The decrease in 2001 is due
to both lower  average  interest  rates during the 2001 period and lower average
borrowings.

     Our general and  administrative  expenses for 2001 totaled $10.4 million as
compared to $6.4 million for 2000, an increase of $4.0 million.  The increase is
due  primarily to increased  consulting  costs related to the  foreclosures  and
lease restructures.

     Our legal  expenses  for 2001  totaled  $4.3  million as  compared  to $2.5
million in 2000. The increase is largely  attributable to legal costs associated
with operator bankruptcy filings and negotiations with our troubled operators.

     We recorded a $10 million litigation settlement expense in 2001 to settle a
suit brought by Karrington Health, Inc. in 1998. This settled all claims arising
from the suit,  but without  our  admission  of any  liability  or fault,  which
liability is expressly denied.  Based on the settlement,  the suit was dismissed
with prejudice.

     A provision  for  impairment  of $9.6  million is included in expenses  for
2001.  This  provision  included  $8.3  million for  facilities  recovered  from
operators  and now held as held for sale assets to fair value,  and $1.2 million
related to other real estate assets our management has determined is impaired.

     We  recognized  a  provision  for loss on  uncollectible  accounts  of $0.7
million in 2001,  adjusting  the carrying  value of accounts  receivable  to net
realizable  value.  In 2000, we recognized a provision for loss on mortgages and
notes receivable of $15.3 million, adjusting the carrying value of mortgages and
notes receivable to their net realizable value.

     In 2001,  we  recorded  a $5.1  million  charge for  severance,  moving and
consulting  agreement  costs.  This  charge was  comprised  of $4.6  million for
relocation of our corporate  headquarters  and $0.5 million for  consulting  and
severance  payments to our former Senior Vice President and General Counsel.  In
2000, we recognized a $4.7 million charge for severance and consulting  payments
to our former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer.

     We  recorded  a non-cash  charge of $1.3  million  for 2001  related to the
adoption of FASB Statement No. 133,  Accounting for Derivative  Instruments  and
Hedging  Activities,  which was required to be adopted in years  beginning after
June 15,  2000.  No such  charge was  recorded in 2000,  as we adopted  this new
statement effective January 1, 2001.

     During  2001,  we sold  certain  of our core  and  other  assets  realizing
proceeds of $3.9 million,  resulting in a loss of $0.7 million.  During 2000, we
completed  asset sales  yielding net proceeds of $34.7  million,  resulting in a
gain of $10.0 million.

     During 2001, we  repurchased  $27.5 million of our 6.95% Notes  maturing in
June 2002, recognizing a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $3.1 million.

     Our funds from  operations  for the year ended December 31, 2001 on a fully
diluted basis  totaled $4.3 million,  a decrease of $14.9 million as compared to
the $19.2 million for 2000 due to factors  mentioned above.  After adjusting for
the  non-recurring  provision  for loss on mortgages  and notes  receivable  and
severance and  consulting  costs,  funds from  operations for the year was $26.7
million,  a decrease of $12.6  million  from the year ended  December  31, 2000.
Funds  from  operations  is  net  earnings  available  to  common  stockholders,
excluding any gains or losses from debt  restructuring  and the effects of asset
dispositions,  plus  depreciation and  amortization  associated with real estate
investments. Diluted funds from operations is the lower of funds from operations
and funds  from  operations  adjusted  for the  assumed  conversion  of Series C
Preferred  Stock and  Subordinated  Convertible  Debentures  and the exercise of
in-the-money  stock  options.  We  consider  funds  from  operations  to be  one
performance  measure  which is helpful to  investors  of real  estate  companies
because,  along with cash flows from operating activities,  financing activities
and investing activities,  it provides investors an understanding of our ability
to incur and service debt and to make expenditures. Funds from operations in and
of itself  does not  represent  cash  generated  from  operating  activities  in
accordance with generally  accepted  accounting  principles and therefore should
not be considered an  alternative  to net earnings as an indication of operating
performance,  or to net cash flow from  operating  activities  as  determined by
generally accepted  accounting  principles in the United States, as a measure of
liquidity  and is not  necessarily  indicative  of cash  available  to fund cash
needs.

                                       17

     No  provision  for federal  income taxes has been made since we continue to
qualify  as a REIT under the  provisions  of  Sections  856  through  860 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Accordingly, we have not been subject
to federal  income  taxes on amounts  distributed  to  stockholders,  as we have
distributed  at least 95% of our REIT  taxable  income for taxable  years before
2001 and have met certain other  conditions.  In 2001, and future taxable years,
we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income.

Year Ended December 31, 2000 compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999

     Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 totaled  $275.8  million,
an increase of $127.7 million over 1999  revenues.  This increase is principally
due to the  inclusion of revenue from nursing home  operations  for assets owned
and operated for our account  recovered  pursuant to foreclosure and settlements
with troubled operators in 2000 and revenues  associated with foreclosure assets
that were  previously  classified as "assets held for sale" and  reclassified to
"owned and operated assets" during the third quarter of 2000.  Excluding nursing
home revenues of owned and operated assets, revenues were $100.2 million for the
twelve-month  period ended  December 31, 2000, a decrease of $21.7  million from
the comparable prior year period.

     Our rental  income for the year  ended  December  31,  2000  totaled  $67.3
million, a decrease of $9.1 million over 1999 rental income. The decrease is due
to  $8.7  million  from  reductions  in  lease  revenue  due  to   foreclosures,
bankruptcies  and  restructurings,  and $4.9 million  from  reduced  investments
caused by 1999 and 2000 asset sales.  These decreases are offset by $2.4 million
in additional  revenue from 1999  investments held for a full year, $1.3 million
relating to  contractual  increases  in rents that became  effective  in 2000 as
defined  under the related  agreements  and $0.8  million  from a mortgage  that
converted to a lease in 1999.

     Our mortgage  interest  income for the year ended December 31, 2000 totaled
$24.1 million,  decreasing $12.2 million over 1999 mortgage interest income. The
decrease  is  due  to  $7.3  million  from   reductions  due  to   foreclosures,
bankruptcies and restructurings, $4.7 million from reduced investments caused by
the  payoffs of  mortgages  and $0.8  million  reduction  from a  mortgage  that
converted  to a lease  in 1999.  These  decreases  are  offset  by $0.5  million
relating to contractual  increases in interest  income that became  effective in
2000 as defined under the related agreements.

     Our nursing home  revenues of owned and operated  assets for the year ended
December 31, 2000 totaled $175.6  million,  increasing  $149.3 million over 1999
nursing home revenues. The increase is due to the increased number of facilities
classified  as owned and  operated  assets in 2000 as a result of  bankruptcies,
foreclosures and restructurings.

     Our expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000 totaled  $335.3  million,
increasing  approximately  $217.4  million over  expenses of $117.9  million for
1999.

     Our nursing home expenses for owned and operated assets increased to $179.0
million from $25.2  million in 1999 due to the increase in the number of nursing
homes operated for our account.

     The 2000 provision for depreciation and amortization of real estate totaled
$23.3  million,  decreasing  $0.9  million  over 1999.  The  decrease  primarily
consists of $2.0 million  depreciation  expense for properties  sold or held for
sale and a reduction in amortization  of non-compete  agreements of $0.8 million
offset  by  $1.6  million  additional   depreciation   expense  from  properties
previously classified as mortgages and new investments placed in service in 1999
and 2000.

     Our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 was approximately
$42.4  million,  compared with $42.9  million for 1999.  The decrease in 2000 is
primarily due to lower average  outstanding  borrowings  during the 2000 period,
partially offset by higher average interest rates.

     Our general and  administrative  expenses  for 2000 totaled $6.4 million as
compared to $5.2  million for 1999,  an increase of $1.2  million or 22.8%.  The
increase is due in part to the incremental administrative costs incurred in 2000
to manage the owned and operated assets,  $0.5 million of non-cash  compensation
expense relating to the dividend  equivalent  rights granted to management,  and
increased consulting costs related to the foreclosure assets.

     Our legal  expenses  for 2000  totaled  $2.5  million as  compared  to $0.4
million in 1999. The increase is largely  attributable to legal costs associated
with  the  operator  bankruptcy  filings  and  negotiations  with  our  troubled
operators.

                                       18
<PAGE>

     A provision  for  impairment  of $61.7  million is included in expenses for
2000.  This provision  included $14.4 million for assets held for sale to reduce
properties  to fair value less cost to dispose,  $43.0  million  for  facilities
recovered  from  operators  and now held as owned  and  operated  assets to fair
value,  $1.9  million for other real estate  assets and $2.4 million of goodwill
which,  due to the  diminished  value of the  related  real estate  assets,  our
management has determined is impaired.

     We also  recognized a provision for loss on mortgages and notes  receivable
of $15.3 million in 2000,  adjusting  the carrying  value of mortgages and notes
receivable to their net realizable value.

     We  recognized a $4.7 million  charge for severance  payments in 2000.  The
charges are comprised of severance and  consulting  payments to our former Chief
Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer.

     During  2000,  we sold  certain  of our core  and  other  assets  realizing
proceeds of $34.7 million, resulting in a gain of $10.0 million. During 1999, we
completed asset sales yielding net proceeds of $18.2 million,  realizing  losses
of $10.5 million.

     Our funds from  operations  for the year ended December 31, 2000 on a fully
diluted basis totaled $19.2 million,  a decrease of $52.6 million as compared to
the $71.9 million for 1999 due to factors  mentioned above.  After adjusting for
the  non-recurring  provision  for loss on mortgages  and notes  receivable  and
severance and  consulting  costs,  funds from  operations for the year was $39.3
million,  a decrease of $32.6  million  from the year ended  December  31, 1999.
Funds  from  operations  is  net  earnings  available  to  common  stockholders,
excluding any gains or losses from debt  restructuring  and the effects of asset
dispositions,  plus  depreciation and  amortization  associated with real estate
investments. Diluted funds from operations is the lower of funds from operations
and funds  from  operations  adjusted  for the  assumed  conversion  of Series C
Preferred  Stock and  Subordinated  Convertible  Debentures  and the exercise of
in-the-money  stock  options.  We  consider  funds  from  operations  to be  one
performance  measure  which is helpful to  investors  of real  estate  companies
because,  along with cash flows from operating activities,  financing activities
and investing activities,  it provides investors an understanding of our ability
to incur and service debt and to make expenditures. Funds from operations in and
of itself  does not  represent  cash  generated  from  operating  activities  in

not be considered an  alternative  to net earnings as an indication of operating
performance,  or to net cash flow from  operating  activities  as  determined by
generally accepted  accounting  principles in the United States, as a measure of
liquidity  and is not  necessarily  indicative  of cash  available  to fund cash
needs.

     No  provision  for federal  income taxes has been made since we continue to
qualify  as a REIT under the  provisions  of  Sections  856  through  860 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Accordingly, we have not been subject
to federal  income  taxes on amounts  distributed  to  stockholders,  as we have
distributed  at least 95% of our REIT  taxable  income for taxable  years before
2001 and have met certain other  conditions.  In 2001, and future taxable years,
we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income.

     Mariner and  Professional  Healthcare  Settlement.  We have  entered into a
comprehensive  settlement with Mariner  Post-Acute  Network,  Inc. resolving all
outstanding  issues relating to our loan to Professional  Healthcare  Management
Inc., a subsidiary  of Mariner.  Pursuant to the  settlement,  the  Professional
Healthcare loan is secured by a first mortgage on 12 skilled nursing  facilities
owned  by  Professional  Healthcare  with  1,679  operating  beds.  Professional
Healthcare  will remain  obligated on the total  outstanding  loan balance as of
January 18, 2000, the date Mariner filed for protection  under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Act, and paid us our accrued interest at a rate of approximately  11%
for the period from the filing date until  September 1, 2001.  Monthly  payments
with  interest  at the rate of 11.57% per annum  resumed  October  1, 2001.  The
settlement  agreement  was  approved by the United  States  Bankruptcy  Court in
Wilmington, Delaware on August 22, 2001, and became effective as of September 1,
2001.

     On February  1, 2001,  four  Michigan  facilities,  previously  operated by
Professional   Healthcare  and  subject  to  our  pre-petition  mortgage,   were
transferred  by  Professional  Healthcare  to a new  operator  who  paid for the
facilities  by  execution  of a  promissory  note that has been  assigned to us.
Professional  Healthcare was given a $4.5 million credit on February 1, 2001 and
an  additional  $3.5 million  credit as of  September 1, 2001,  both against the
Professional  Healthcare  loan  balance in exchange  for the  assignment  of the
promissory note to us. The promissory note is secured by a first mortgage on the
four facilities.

     Following  the closing  under the  settlement  agreement,  the  outstanding
principal  balance on the Professional  Healthcare loan is  approximately  $59.7
million.  The  Professional   Healthcare  loan  term  will  be  ten  years  with
Professional Healthcare having the option to extend for an additional ten years.

                                       19

Professional  Healthcare  will also have the option to prepay  the  Professional
Healthcare loan between February 1, 2005 and July 31, 2005.

     Other  Operators.  In Note 15 to our Form 10-K for the year ended  December
31, 2000,  we announced  continuing  discussions  with several of our lessees to
resolve payment issues,  including Alterra Healthcare Corp.  ("Alterra"),  Lyric
Healthcare LLC ("Lyric"),  Alden  Management  Services,  Inc.  ("Alden") and TLC
Healthcare, Inc. ("TLC").

     Alterra  Healthcare Corp. made reduced payments of their monthly rent since
March 2001.  Monthly rent  payments of $306,138  were not paid for March through
June;  $100,000 was paid in each of the July and August months; and $185,097 was
paid each month from September through December. All shortfalls were funded from
Alterra's  security deposit.  Accordingly,  revenues were recognized on the full
contractual  rent of  $306,138  per month.  In  February,  2002 we  completed  a
renegotiated  transaction  with Alterra whereby we will take back two facilities
in June 2002, and Alterra agreed to pay us a fee of  approximately  $0.7 million
and monthly rent payments of $187,000 in 2002,  increasing to $268,000 per month
in 2003. The total gross investment in the properties leased to Alterra is $34.1
million,  including  $6.2  million for the two  facilities  that are to be taken
back. We currently expect these two facilities to be leased to a new operator or
marketed for sale.

     Integrated  Health  Services,  Inc. ("IHS") filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection  in  February  2000.  With  the  exception  of  a  small  portion  of
prepetition interest (approximately  $63,000), IHS paid its contractual mortgage
interest  from its  bankruptcy  filing in February  2000 until  October 2001. In
November  2001,  IHS  informed  us that it did not intend to pay future rent and
mortgage  interest due. In January,  2002,  IHS resumed  making  payments to us.
Revenue is being recorded as payments are received.  We hold three  mortgages on
properties  owned  by IHS:  a $37.5  million  mortgage  collateralized  by seven
facilities  located in Florida and Texas; a $12 million mortgage  collateralized
by two facilities located in Georgia; and a $4.9 million mortgage collateralized
by one facility located in Florida.  Annual contractual  interest income on each
of the  mortgages  is  approximately  $3.96  million,  $1.25  million  and $0.55
million,  respectively.  We also have a lease with IHS for one  property  in the
state of  Washington,  representing  an investment of $10 million and annualized
contractual  revenue of $1.45  million.  IHS rejected  this lease on November 9,
2001.

     We are currently  negotiating  with IHS to reach a permanent  restructuring
agreement or to transition the  facilities to a new operator or operators.  Rent
under the lease was paid through March,  15, 2002 under a stipulation  agreement
currently  being  negotiated.  No payments  were made on the October to December
mortgage  interest.  Accordingly,  no revenue was recorded for the mortgages for
October to December.  In 2002,  revenue is being  recorded as received.  Current
appraisals of the properties  underlying the mortgage loans indicate  collateral
value in excess of the mortgage loan balances.  Accordingly, we do not expect to
record any reserves relative to these loans at this time.

     We entered into a forbearance  agreement with Lyric  Healthcare LLC through
August 31, 2001,  whereby we received  $541,266 of the $860,000 monthly rent due
under the Lyric leases through November 2001. On November 7, we were notified by
Lyric that we would no longer be receiving  payments.  In January,  2002,  Lyric
resumed making  payments to us.  Revenue has been recorded as received.  We will
continue  to record  revenue in this  manner  until a  resolution  with Lyric is
finalized.   Discussions   are  continuing  with  Lyric  to  reach  a  permanent
restructuring  agreement or to  transition  the  facilities to a new operator or
operators. Our original investment in the ten facilities covered under the lease
is $95.4 million, with annual contractual rent of $10.3 million.

     On March 30, 2001, we announced that affiliates of Alden  Management,  Inc.
were delinquent in paying their lease and escrow payments on the four facilities
they lease from us. During the month of April, Alden resumed regularly scheduled
lease payments to us, and began making payments on a schedule  designed to bring
their past due amounts current by August 2001. Alden adhered to the schedule and
is now current with their rental payments to us.

     In April 2001,  we were informed by TLC  Healthcare,  Inc. that it could no
longer  meet its  payroll  and other  operating  obligations.  We had leases and
mortgages with TLC representing  eight properties with 1,049 beds and an initial
investment of $27.5 million.  As a result of this action,  one facility in Texas
with an initial  investment of $2.5 million was leased to a new operator,  Lamar
Healthcare,  Inc. and four  properties  in Illinois,  Indiana and Ohio,  with an
initial investment of $13.5 million, were taken back and placed under management
agreements with Atrium Living Centers and Nexion Health Management, Inc. and are
now operated for our own account and  classified  as Owned and Operated  Assets.
The  remaining  three  properties,  located in Texas,  were closed and are being
marketed for sale. These three facilities are classified as Assets Held for Sale
and have been reduced to their fair value,  less cost of  disposal.  Amounts due
from TLC that were not  collected  were written off as bad debt  expense  during
2001.

                                       20
<PAGE>

     In several  instances we hold security  deposits that can be applied in the
event of lease  and loan  defaults,  subject  to  applicable  limitations  under
bankruptcy law with respect to operators seeking  protection under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Act.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     At December 31, 2001, we had total assets of $890.8 million,  stockholders'
equity of $450.7  million,  and long-term debt of $413.2  million,  representing
approximately  47.8% of total  capitalization.  In addition,  as of December 31,
2001, we had an aggregate of $99.4 million of outstanding  debt which matures in
2002, including $97.5 million of 6.95% Notes due June 2002.

 Modification of Bank Credit Agreements

     On December 21, 2001, we reached  amended  agreements  with the bank groups
under both of our revolving credit  facilities.  As of the closing of the rights
offering  and the private  placement  to  Explorer  on  February  21, 2002 these
amendments  became  effective  (See Note 19 -  Subsequent  Events to our audited
Consolidated Financial Statements).

     As  part  of the  amendment  regarding  our $75  million  revolving  credit
facility we prepaid $10 million  originally  scheduled  to mature in March 2002.
This  voluntary  prepayment  results  in a  permanent  reduction  in  the  total
commitment,  thereby reducing the credit facility to $65 million.  The agreement
regarding  our $175  million  revolving  credit  facility  includes  a  one-year
extension  in  maturity  from  December  31, 2002 to December  31,  2003,  and a
reduction in the total commitment from $175 million to $160 million.  Amounts up
to $150 million may be drawn upon to repay the maturing  6.95% Notes due in June
2002.

     Our $160  million  secured  revolving  line of credit  facility  expires on
December 31, 2003.  Borrowings bear interest at 2.5% to 3.25% over LIBOR through
December 31, 2002 and 3.00% to 3.25% over LIBOR after  December 31, 2002,  based
on our leverage ratio.  Borrowings of approximately $129 million are outstanding
at  December  31,  2001.  Additionally,  $13.4  million of letters of credit are
outstanding  against this credit facility at December 31, 2001. These letters of
credit are  collateral for certain  long-term  borrowings and Owned and Operated
insurance programs.  LIBOR based borrowings under this facility bear interest at
a weighted-average rate of 5.49% at December 31, 2001 and 10.00% at December 31,
1999.  Cost for the  letters of credit  range  from 2.5% to 3.25%,  based on our
leverage ratio. Real estate investments with a gross book value of approximately
$227.9  million  are pledged as  collateral  for this  revolving  line of credit
facility at December  31,  2001.  Some  substitution  of  collateral  under this
facility was completed in 2002,  bringing the total collateral to $239.8 million
currently.

     Our  $65  million  line of  credit  facility  expires  on  June  30,  2005.
Borrowings  under the facility bear interest at 2.5% to 3.75% over LIBOR,  based
on our leverage ratio and collateral assigned. Borrowings of approximately $64.7
million are outstanding at December 31, 2001.  LIBOR based borrowings under this
facility bear interest at a weighted-average  rate of 5.65% at December 31, 2001
and 9.77% at December 31, 2000. Real estate  investments with a gross book value
of approximately $94.9 million are pledged as collateral for this revolving line
of credit facility at December 31, 2001. Additional collateral for this facility
was added in 2002, bringing the total collateral currently to $117.1 million.

     We are required to meet certain financial  covenants,  including prescribed
leverage and interest coverage ratios on our long-term  borrowings.  We are also
required to fix a certain portion of our interest rate. We utilize interest rate
swaps to fix interest rates on variable rate debt and reduce  certain  exposures
to interest rate fluctuations (See Note 8 - Financial Instruments to our audited
Consolidated Financial Statements).

     Dividends.  In order to qualify as a REIT,  we are  required to  distribute
dividends  (other than capital gain dividends) to our  stockholders in an amount
at least equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our "REIT taxable income"  (computed
without  regard to the  dividends  paid  deduction and our net capital gain) and
(ii) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus
(B) the sum of certain items of noncash  income.  In addition,  if we dispose of
any built-in  gain asset  during a  recognition  period,  we will be required to
distribute at least 90% of the built-in gain (after tax), if any,  recognized on
the disposition of such asset.  Such  distributions  must be paid in the taxable
year to which they relate,  or in the following  taxable year if declared before
we timely  file our tax  return  for such  year and paid on or before  the first
regular dividend payment after such declaration. In addition, such distributions
are required to be made pro rata,  with no  preference  to any share of stock as
compared  with other  shares of the same class,  and with no  preference  to one
class of stock as compared  with  another  class  except to the extent that such
class is entitled to such a preference.  To the extent that we do not distribute
all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of
our "REIT  taxable  income," as  adjusted,  we will be subject to tax thereon at
regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates.

     On  February  1,  2001,  we  announced  the  suspension  of all  common and
preferred dividends.  This action is intended to preserve cash to facilitate our
ability  to  obtain  financing  to fund  the  2002  debt  maturities.  Prior  to
recommencing  the  payment of  dividends  on our common  stock,  all accrued and
unpaid  dividends on our Series A, B and C preferred stock must be paid in full.
We have made sufficient  distributions to satisfy the distribution  requirements
under the REIT rules to maintain our REIT status for 2000.

     No common  dividends  were paid during 2001.  Cash  dividends  paid totaled
$1.00 per common  share for 2000,  compared  with $2.80 per common share for the
year ended  December 31, 1999. The dividend  payout ratio,  that is the ratio of
per common  share  amounts for  dividends  paid to the diluted per common  share
amounts of funds from operations,  was approximately 238% for 2000 and 84.3% for
1999.  Excluding the provision  for loss on mortgages and notes  receivable  and
severance and consulting agreement costs, the dividend payout ratio for 2000 was
approximately 73.0%.

     On March 30, 2001,  we exercised  our option to pay the accrued  $4,666,667
Series C dividend  from  November  15, 2000 and the  associated  deferral fee by
issuing 48,420 Series C preferred shares to Explorer on April 2, 2001, which are
convertible  into 774,722  shares of our common  stock at $6.25 per share.  Such
election  resulted in an increase in the  aggregate  liquidation  preference  of
Series C Preferred Stock as of April 2, 2001 to $104,842,000,  including accrued
dividends  through  that date.  Dividends  paid in stock to a specific  class of
stockholders, such as our payment of our Series C preferred stock in April 2001,
constitute dividends eligible for the 2001 dividends paid deduction.

     The table below sets forth information  regarding  arrearages in payment of
preferred stock dividends:

     Liquidity.  In October,  2001 we  announced a rights  offering  and private
placement to Explorer.  These  transactions  were  completed in February,  2002,
raising  gross  proceeds of $50 million.  We expect to use the proceeds from the
rights offering and private placement to repay outstanding  indebtedness and for
working capital and general corporate purposes.

     Management believes our liquidity and various sources of available capital,
including funds from  operations and expected  proceeds from planned asset sales
and  refinancings,  are  adequate to finance  operations,  meet  recurring  debt
service  requirements  including  our  2002  debt  maturities  and  fund  future
investments  through the next 12 months. (See Note 19 - Subsequent Events to our
audited  Consolidated  Financial  Statements).  From  time to time,  we  explore
alternative  financing  arrangements and opportunities and may continue to do so
in the future.

Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

     We are  exposed to various  market  risks,  including  the  potential  loss
arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We do not enter into derivatives
or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes,  but we seek
to mitigate the effects of  fluctuations  in interest rates by matching the term
of new  investments  with new  long-term  fixed  rate  borrowing  to the  extent
possible.

     The market value of our long-term  fixed rate  borrowings and mortgages are
subject to  interest  rate  risks.  Generally,  the  market  value of fixed rate
financial  instruments  will  decrease  as interest  rates rise and  increase as
interest rates fall. The estimated fair value of our total long-term  borrowings
at December  31,  2001 was $396.4  million.  A one percent  increase in interest
rates would  result in a decrease in the fair value of long-term  borrowings  by
approximately $4.1 million.

                                       22
<PAGE>

     We are subject to risks associated with debt or preferred equity financing,
including the risk that existing  indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the
terms of such  refinancing  may not be as  favorable  as the  terms  of  current
indebtedness.  If we were unable to refinance our debt  maturities on acceptable
terms,  we might be forced to dispose of  properties on  disadvantageous  terms,
which might result in losses to us and might adversely affect the cash available
for distribution to  stockholders,  or to pursue dilutive equity  financing.  If
interest rates or other factors at the time of the refinancing  result in higher
interest rates upon  refinancing,  our interest  expense would  increase,  which
might affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

     We utilize  interest rate swaps to fix interest rates on variable rate debt
and reduce  certain  exposures to interest  rate  fluctuations.  At December 31,
2001, we had two interest rate swaps with notional  amounts of $32 million each,
based on  30-day  LIBOR.  Under  the first $32  million  agreement,  we  receive
payments when LIBOR interest rates exceed 6.35% and pay the counterparties  when
LIBOR rates are under  6.35%.  The amounts  exchanged  are based on the notional
amounts. Under the terms of the second agreement, we receive payments when LIBOR
rates exceed 4.89% and pay the counterparties  when LIBOR rates are under 4.89%.
Both  agreements  mature in  December,  2002.  The  combined  fair  value of the
interest rate swaps at December 31, 2001 was a deficit of $2.17 million.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


Board of Directors
Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.

     We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of Omega
Healthcare  Investors,  Inc. and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
and the related consolidated statements of operations,  stockholders' equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31, 2001.
Our audit also included the financial  statement  schedules  listed in the Index
under  Item  14  (a).   These   financial   statements  and  schedules  are  the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization

     Omega   Healthcare   Investors,   Inc.,  a  Maryland   corporation,   is  a
self-administered  real estate investment trust ("REIT").  From the date that we
commenced  operations  in 1992,  we have  invested  primarily in long-term  care
facilities,   which  include  nursing  homes,  assisted  living  facilities  and
rehabilitation   hospitals.   Our  company  currently  has  investments  in  241
healthcare facilities located in the United States.

Consolidation

     The consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of our company
and our wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of all material intercompany
accounts and transactions. Due to changes in the market conditions affecting the
long-term care industry, we have begun to operate a portfolio of our foreclosure
assets for our own account until such time as these  facilities'  operations are
stabilized  and are  re-leasable or saleable at lease rates or sales prices that
maximize  the value of these  assets to us. As a result,  these  facilities  and
their  respective  operations  are  presented  on a  consolidated  basis  in our
financial statements.

Real Estate Investments

     Investments  in  leased  real  estate  properties  and  mortgage  notes are
recorded at cost and original  mortgage  amount,  respectively.  The cost of the
properties acquired is allocated between land and buildings based generally upon
independent   appraisals.   Depreciation   for  buildings  is  recorded  on  the
straight-line  basis,  using estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 39 years.
Leasehold interests are amortized over the initial term of the lease, with lives
ranging from four to seven years.

Owned and Operated Assets and Assets Held for Sale

     In the ordinary course of our business activities, we periodically evaluate
investment  opportunities and extend credit to customers.  We also are regularly
engaged in lease and loan extensions and modifications. Additionally, we monitor
and manage our  investment  portfolio  with the  objectives of improving  credit
quality and increasing  returns.  In connection  with portfolio  management,  we
engage in various  collection and foreclosure  activities.  When we acquire real
estate  pursuant to a  foreclosure  proceeding,  it is  designated as "owned and
operated  assets"  and is  recorded  at the  lower of cost or fair  value.  Such
amounts are  included  in real estate  properties  on our  Consolidated  Balance
Sheet.  Operating  assets and operating  liabilities  for the owned and operated
properties are shown  separately on the face of our  Consolidated  Balance Sheet
and are detailed in Note 16--Segment Information.

     When a formal  plan to sell real  estate  is  adopted,  the real  estate is
classified as "assets held for sale," with the net carrying  amount  adjusted to
the lower of cost or estimated fair value,  less cost of disposal.  Depreciation
of the facilities is excluded from operations  after management has committed to
a plan to sell the asset.

Impairment of Assets

     Provisions  for  impairment   losses  related  to  long-lived   assets  are
recognized  when expected future cash flows are less than the carrying values of
the assets.  If indicators of impairment  are present,  we evaluate the carrying
value of the  related  real estate  investments  in  relationship  to the future
undiscounted cash flows of the underlying facilities. If the sum of the expected
future cash flow, including sales proceeds, is less than carrying value, we then
adjust the net carrying value of leased  properties and other long-lived  assets
to the present value of expected future cash flows.

     The  Financial   Accounting  Standards  Board  recently  issued  SFAS  144,
Accounting  for the  Impairment  or  Disposal  of  Long-Lived  Assets,  which is
applicable  to  financial  statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning  after
December 15, 2001. We expect to adopt the new pronouncement effective January 1,
2002. This pronouncement  supersedes FASB Statement No. 121,  Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed.  We do
not expect the adoption of this  pronouncement  to have a material effect on our
financial condition or results of operations.

Loan Impairment Policy

     When management identifies an indication of potential loan impairment, such
as  non-payment  under  the  loan  documents  or  impairment  of the  underlying
collateral, the loan is written down to the present value of the expected future
cash flows. In cases where expected  future cash flows cannot be estimated,  the
loan is written down to the fair value of that collateral.

Cash Equivalents

     Cash equivalents  consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity date
of three months or less when  purchased.  These  investments are stated at cost,
which approximates fair value.

Derivative Instruments

     Effective  January 1, 2001, we adopted the Financial  Accounting  Standards
Board  Statement No. 133,  Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging
Activities,  as amended,  which requires that all  derivatives are recognized on
the  balance  sheet  at fair  value.  Derivatives  that are not  hedges  must be
adjusted to fair value through income.  If the derivative is a hedge,  depending
on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will either
be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or
firm commitments  through earnings or recognized in other  comprehensive  income
until the hedge item is recognized  in earnings.  The  ineffective  portion of a
derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.

Accounts Receivable

     Accounts  Receivable  consist  primarily  of lease  and  mortgage  interest
payments.  Amounts  recorded  include  estimated  provisions for loss related to
uncollectible  accounts  and  disputed  items.  A provision  of $0.7 million was
recorded in 2001. No other activity has occurred during the periods presented.

Accounts Receivable--Owned and Operated Assets

     Accounts  Receivable  from Owned and Operated Assets consist of amounts due
from Medicare and Medicaid  programs,  other government  programs,  managed care
health plans,  commercial insurance companies and individual  patients.  Amounts
recorded include estimated provisions for loss related to uncollectable accounts
and disputed items. A provision of $7.3 million and $1.0 million was recorded in
2001 and 2000, respectively.

Investments in Equity Securities

     Marketable securities held as  available-for-sale  are stated at fair value
with  unrealized  gains and losses for the  securities  reported in  accumulated
other  comprehensive  income.  Realized  gains and losses and  declines in value
judged to be  other-than-temporary  on securities held as available-for-sale are
included  in  investment  income.  The cost of  securities  sold is based on the
specific   identification   method.   Interest  and   dividends  on   securities
available-for-sale are included in investment income.

Deferred Financing Costs

     Deferred  financing costs are amortized on a  straight-line  basis over the
terms of the related borrowings.  Amortization of financing costs totaling $2.48
million,  $1.93 million and $1.34 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,  respectively,
is classified as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Non-Compete Agreements and Goodwill

     Non-compete  agreements and the excess of the purchase price over the value
of  tangible  net  assets   acquired   (i.e.,   goodwill)  are  amortized  on  a
straight-line  basis over periods  ranging  from five to ten years.  Non-compete
agreements,  which had a cost of $4.98 million  became fully  amortized and were
eliminated  in  1999  by a  charge  to  accumulated  amortization.  Due  to  the
diminished value of the related real estate assets,  management  determined that
the goodwill was entirely impaired and wrote off the balance of $2.36 million in
2000.

Revenue Recognition

     Rental income and mortgage interest income is recognized as earned over the
terms of the related master leases and mortgage notes, respectively. Such income
includes  periodic  increases based on  pre-determined  formulas (i.e.,  such as
increases  in the  Consumer  Price  Index) as defined  in the master  leases and
mortgage loan agreements. Reserves are taken against earned revenues from leases
and  mortgages  when  collection  of  amounts  due become  questionable  or when
negotiations for restructurings of troubled operators lead to lower expectations
regarding ultimate collection.  When collection is uncertain, lease revenues are
recorded  as  received,  after  taking  into  account  application  of  security
deposits.  Interest income on impaired  mortgage loans is recognized as received
after taking into account application of security deposits.

     Nursing home revenues from owned and operated assets  (primarily  Medicare,
Medicaid and other third party insurance) are recognized as patient services are
provided.

Federal and State Income Taxes

     As a qualified  real  estate  investment  trust,  we will not be subject to
Federal  income taxes on our income,  and no provisions for Federal income taxes
have been made. To the extent that we have foreclosure income from our owned and
operated  assets,  we will incur federal tax at a rate of 35%. To date our owned
and operated  assets have  generated  losses,  and  therefore,  no provision for
federal  income  tax is  necessary.  The  reported  amounts  of our assets as of
December 31, 2001 are less than the tax basis of assets by  approximately  $12.1
million.

Stock Based Compensation

     Our  company  grants  stock  options to  employees  and  directors  with an
exercise  price  equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of the grant.
In accordance  with the  provisions of APB Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock
Issued to  Employees,  compensation  expense is not  recognized  for these stock
option grants.

     Expense  related to Dividend  Equivalent  Rights is recognized as dividends
are declared, based on anticipated vesting.

Accounting Estimates

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities,  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Risks and Uncertainties

     Our company is subject to certain  risks and  uncertainties  affecting  the
healthcare industry as a result of healthcare legislation and growing regulation
by federal, state and local governments.  Additionally,  we are subject to risks
and  uncertainties  as a result of changes  affecting  operators of nursing home
facilities due to the actions of governmental agencies and insurers to limit the
growth in cost of healthcare services. (See Note 5--Concentration of Risk).


NOTE 2--PROPERTIES

Leased Property

     Our leased  real  estate  properties,  represented  by 135  long-term  care
facilities and 2 rehabilitation hospitals at December 31, 2001, are leased under
provisions of master leases with initial terms ranging from 10 to 16 years, plus
renewal  options.  Substantially  all of the master  leases  provide for minimum
annual rentals which are subject to annual increases based upon increases in the
Consumer Price Index or increases in revenues of the underlying properties, with
certain maximum limits. Under the terms of the leases, the lessee is responsible
for all maintenance, repairs, taxes and insurance on the leased properties.

     A summary of our investment in leased real estate properties is as follows:

Owned and Operated Property

     Our owned and operated  real estate  properties  include 33 long-term  care
facilities at December 31, 2001, of which 21 are owned directly by us and 12 are
subject to  third-party  leases.  Impairment  charges of $1.3  million and $41.3

Assets Sold or Held For Sale

     Management initiated a plan to dispose of certain properties judged to have
limited  long-term  potential  and to re-deploy  the  proceeds.  During 1999, we
completed  sales  yielding net proceeds of $18.2  million,  realizing  losses of
$10.5 million.  In addition,  management  initiated a plan for additional  asset
sales to be completed in 2000. The additional  assets  identified as assets held
for sale had a cost of $33.8 million, a net carrying amount of $28.6 million and
annualized  revenue  of  approximately  $3.4  million.  In 1999,  we  recorded a
provision for impairment of $19.5 million to adjust the carrying value of assets
held for sale to their fair value, less cost of disposal.

     During 2000, we recorded a $14.4 million  provision for impairment  related
to assets held for sale and  reclassified  $24.3 million of assets held for sale
to  "owned  and  operated  assets"  as the  timing  and  strategy  for  sale or,
alternatively,   re-leasing  were  revised  in  light  of  prevailing  marketing
conditions.  During 2000,  we realized  disposition  proceeds of $1.1 million on
assets held for sale.  Additionally,  we received proceeds of $34.7 million from
sales of certain core and other assets, resulting in a gain of $9.9 million.

     During  2001,  we recorded a provision of $8.3  million for  impairment  of
assets transferred to assets held for sale. We realized  disposition proceeds of
$1.4 million during 2001.

Net mortgage notes at December 31........    $195,193      $206,710
                                             ======================

     Mortgage  notes  receivable  relate to 71 long-term  care  facilities.  The
mortgage notes are secured by first mortgage liens on the borrowers'  underlying
real estate and personal  property.  The  mortgage  notes  receivable  relate to
facilities located in 11 states, operated by 15 independent healthcare operating
companies.

     We monitor  compliance  with  mortgages and when  necessary  have initiated
collection,   foreclosure  and  other   proceedings   with  respect  to  certain
outstanding loans.

     During 2000,  we determined  that a certain  mortgage loan was impaired and
accordingly  recorded  an  impairment  provision  of $4.9  million to reduce the
carrying  value of the mortgage loan to its net realizable  value.  The impaired
mortgage was  collateralized by three skilled nursing  facilities,  one of which
was to be returned to us and included in a master lease with the same  operator.
The other two  properties  were to be sold,  with the  proceeds  applied  to the
mortgage loan. The loan was written down to the sum of the value of the facility
to be leased plus the estimated proceeds,  net of cost to dispose, from the sale
of the other two facilities. Income recognized on the mortgage was $0.75 million
and $0.97 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively.
No income was recognized after the mortgage loan was impaired.

     In 2001, the two  facilities  which were to be sold were instead given back
to us and re-leased.  Based on provisions of the new lease,  $3.7 million of the
original  impairment  provision was reversed.  Additionally,  we determined that
another mortgage loan was impaired, and recorded an impairment provision of $3.7
million to reduce the carrying  value of the mortgage loan to its net realizable
value. Income recognized on the loan was $0.46 million,  $0.55 million and $0.55
million  in 2001,  2000,  and 1999,  respectively.  No other  activity  has been
reflected in such reserve during the three-year period ended December 31, 2001.

     The following are the three primary  mortgage  structures that we currently
use:

     Convertible  Participating Mortgages are secured by first mortgage liens on
the  underlying  real estate and personal  property of the  mortgagor.  Interest
rates are usually subject to annual increases based upon increases in the CPI or
increases in revenues of the underlying long-term care facilities,  with certain
maximum  limits.  Convertible  Participating  Mortgages  afford  us an option to
convert the mortgage into direct ownership of the property, generally at a point
six to nine years from  inception;  they are then  subject to a leaseback to the
operator for the balance of the original agreed term and for the original agreed
participation  in  revenues  or CPI  adjustments.  This  allows us to  capture a
portion of the potential  appreciation in value of the real estate. The operator
has the right to buy out our option at formula prices.

     Participating  Mortgages  are  secured  by  first  mortgage  liens  on  the
underlying  real estate and personal  property of the mortgagor.  Interest rates
are  usually  subject to annual  increases  based upon  increases  in the CPI or
increases in revenues of the underlying long-term care facilities,  with certain
maximum limits.

     Fixed-Rate Mortgages, with a fixed interest rate for the mortgage term, are
also secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying  real estate and personal
property of the mortgagor.

     The  outstanding  principal  amount of mortgage  notes  receivable,  net of
allowances, are as follows:

</TABLE>

     Mortgage  notes are  shown net of  allowances  of $3.74  million  and $4.87
million in 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     During  2001,  we entered  into a  comprehensive  settlement  with  Mariner
Post-Acute Network, Inc. ("Mariner"),  resolving all outstanding issues relating
to our loan to Professional  Healthcare Management,  Inc. ("PHCM"), a subsidiary
of  Mariner.  Pursuant  to the  settlement,  the PHCM loan is secured by a first
mortgage on 12 skilled  nursing  facilities  owned by PHCM with 1,668  operating
beds.  PHCM will remain  obligated on the total  outstanding  loan balance as of
January 18, 2000, the date Mariner filed for protection  under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Act, and is to pay us accrued interest at a rate of approximately 11%
for the period from the filing date until  September 1, 2001.  Monthly  payments
with  interest  at the rate of 11.57% per annum  resumed  October  1, 2001.  The
settlement  agreement  was  approved by the United  States  Bankruptcy  Court in
Wilmington, Delaware on August 22, 2001, and became effective as of September 1,
2001.

     On February 1, 2001, four Michigan facilities,  previously operated by PHCM
and subject to our  pre-petition  mortgage,  were  transferred  by PHCM to a new
operator who paid for the facilities by execution of a promissory  note that has
been  assigned to us. PHCM was given a $4.5  million  credit on February 1, 2001
and an additional  $3.5 million credit as of September 1, 2001, both against the
PHCM loan balance in exchange for the assignment of the  promissory  note to us.
The promissory note is secured by a first mortgage on the four facilities.

     Following  the  closing  of  the  settlement  agreement,   the  outstanding
principal balance on the PHCM loan is approximately $59.7 million. The PHCM loan
term is nine  years,  with PHCM  having the  option to extend for an  additional
eleven  years.  PHCM will also have the option to prepay  the PHCM loan  between
February 1, 2005 and July 31, 2005.

     The  estimated  fair value of our  mortgage  loans at December  31, 2001 is
approximately $203.2 million. Fair value is based on the estimates by management
using rates currently prevailing for comparable loans.

</TABLE>


NOTE 5--CONCENTRATION OF RISK

     As of December 31, 2001, our portfolio of domestic investments consisted of
241 healthcare  facilities,  located in 28 states and operated by 35 third-party
operators.  Our  gross  investment  in  these  facilities,  before  reserve  for
uncollectible  loans,  totaled $885.0 million at December 31, 2001,  with 92% of
our real estate investments related to long-term care facilities. This portfolio
is made up of 135 long-term healthcare facilities and 2 rehabilitation hospitals
owned and leased to third parties,  fixed rate,  participating  and  convertible
participating  mortgages on 71 long-term healthcare  facilities and 21 long-term
healthcare  facilities  that were  recovered  from  customers  and are currently
operated  through  third-party  management  contracts  for our own  account.  In
addition,  12 facilities subject to third-party leasehold interests are included
in  Other  Investments.  We  also  hold  miscellaneous  investments  and  closed
healthcare  facilities held for sale of approximately  $58.2 million at December
31, 2001,  including  $22.3  million  related to two  non-healthcare  facilities
leased by the United States Postal Service,  a $7.4 million  investment in Omega
Worldwide, Inc., Principal Healthcare Finance Limited, an Isle of Jersey (United
Kingdom)  company and Principal  Healthcare  Finance Trust,  an Australian  Unit
Trust, and $14.3 million of notes receivable, net of allowance.

     Approximately  72% of our real  estate  investments  are  operated by seven
public  companies,  including Sun Healthcare  Group,  Inc.  (24.7%),  Integrated
Health Services,  Inc. (18.1%,  including 10.8% as the manager for and 50% owner
of Lyric Health Care LLC),  Advocat,  Inc. (12.2%),  Mariner  Post-Acute Network
(6.7%),  Alterra  Healthcare   Corporation  (3.9%),  Kindred  Healthcare,   Inc.
(formerly known as Vencor Operating,  Inc.) (3.2%), and Genesis Health Ventures,
Inc. (2.8%).  Kindred and Genesis manage  facilities for our own account,  which
are included in Owned and Operated  Assets.  The two largest  private  operators
represent  3.5% and  2.5%,  respectively,  of  investments.  No  other  operator
represents more than 2.5% of investments.  The three states in which we have our
highest concentration of investments are Florida (16.5%),  California (7.5%) and
Illinois (7.5%).

NOTE 6--LEASE AND MORTGAGE DEPOSITS

     Our  company  obtains  liquidity  deposits  and letters of credit from most
operators  pursuant to its leases and mortgages.  These generally  represent the
monthly rental and mortgage  interest  income for periods  ranging from three to
six months with respect to certain of its  investments.  The liquidity  deposits
may be applied in the event of lease and loan  defaults,  subject to  applicable
limitations  under bankruptcy law with respect to operators filing under Chapter
11 of the United  States  Bankruptcy  Code.  At December 31, 2001,  we held $2.9
million  in such  liquidity  deposits  and $6.7  million  in  letters of credit.
Additional  security for rental and mortgage  interest revenue from operators is
provided by covenants  regarding minimum working capital and net worth, liens on
accounts receivable and other operating assets of the operators,  provisions for
cross default,  provisions for cross-collateralization and by corporate/personal
guarantees.


NOTE 7--BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS

     On December 21, 2001, we reached  amended  agreements  with the bank groups
under both of our revolving credit  facilities.  As of the closing of the rights
offering and the private placement to Explorer  Holdings,  L.P.  ("Explorer") on
February 21, 2002 these  amendments  became  effective (See Note 19 - Subsequent
Events).

     As part of the  amendment  regarding  our $75.0  million  revolving  credit
facility, we prepaid $10.0 million originally scheduled to mature in March 2002.
This  voluntary  prepayment  results  in a  permanent  reduction  in  the  total
commitment, thereby reducing the credit facility to $65.0 million. The agreement
regarding  our $175.0  million  revolving  credit  facility  includes a one-year
extension  in  maturity  from  December  31, 2002 to December  31,  2003,  and a
reduction in the total commitment from $175.0 million to $160.0 million. Amounts
up to $150.0  million may be drawn upon to repay the maturing 6.95% Notes due in
June 2002.

     Our $160.0 million  secured  revolving line of credit  facility  expires on
December 31, 2003.  Borrowings bear interest at 2.5% to 3.25% over LIBOR through
December 31, 2002 and 3.00% to 3.25% over LIBOR after  December 31, 2002,  based
on  our  leverage  ratio.   Borrowings  of  approximately   $129.0  million  are
outstanding  at December 31,  2001.  Additionally,  $13.4  million of letters of
credit are outstanding  against this credit facility at December 31, 2001. These
letters of credit are collateral for certain long-term  borrowings and Owned and
Operated  insurance  programs.  LIBOR based  borrowings under this facility bear
interest at a weighted-average  rate of 5.49% at December 31, 2001 and 10.00% at
December  31,  1999.  Cost for the  letters of credit  range from 2.5% to 3.25%,
based on our leverage ratio. Real estate  investments with a gross book value of
approximately  $227.9  million are pledged as collateral for this revolving line
of credit facility at December 31, 2001. Some  substitution of collateral  under
this  facility was  completed in 2002,  bringing the total  collateral to $239.8
million currently.

     Our  $65.0  million  line of  credit  facility  expires  on June 30,  2005.
Borrowings  under the facility bear interest at 2.5% to 3.75% over LIBOR,  based
on our leverage ratio and collateral assigned. Borrowings of approximately $64.7
million are outstanding at December 31, 2001.  LIBOR based borrowings under this
facility bear interest at a weighted-average  rate of 5.65% at December 31, 2001
and 9.77% at December 31, 2000. Real estate  investments with a gross book value
of approximately $94.9 million are pledged as collateral for this revolving line
of credit facility at December 31, 2001. Additional collateral for this facility
was added in 2002, bringing the total collateral currently to $117.1 million.

     Our company is  required to meet  certain  financial  covenants,  including
prescribed leverage and interest coverage ratios on its long-term borrowings. We
are also  required to fix a certain  portion of our  interest  rate.  We utilize
interest  rate  swaps to fix  interest  rates on  variable  rate debt and reduce
certain  exposures  to  interest  rate  fluctuations  (See  Note  8 -  Financial
Instruments).

     The following is a summary of our long-term borrowings:

     During 2001, we repurchased $27.5 million of our 6.95% Notes due June 2002,
resulting in a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $3.1 million.

     The Subordinated Convertible Debentures  ("Debentures") were convertible at
any time into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $26.962 per share.
The Debentures were unsecured obligations of our company and were subordinate in
right and  payment  to our senior  unsecured  indebtedness.  The  balance of the
Debentures  was  repaid  in full  on  February  1,  2001  principally  utilizing
borrowings under our revolving lines of credit.

     On July 15, 2000, we repaid $81.4 million of 10.0% and 7.4% Unsecured Notes
issued in 1995.  The effective  interest rate for the unsecured  notes was 8.8%,
with interest-only payments due semi-annually through July 2000.

     Real estate  investments  with a gross book value of  approximately  $362.0
million are pledged as collateral for outstanding secured borrowings at December
31, 2001,  including  $322.8 million for our revolving lines of credit and $39.2
million for other long-term borrowings. Long-term secured borrowings are payable
in aggregate  monthly  installments of  approximately  $0.28 million,  including
interest at rates ranging from 7.0% to 10.0%.

     Assuming none of our borrowing  arrangements  are refinanced,  converted or
prepaid  prior to  maturity,  required  principal  payments for each of the five
years following December 31, 2001 and the aggregate due thereafter are set forth
below:

              2002...........................      $ 99,403
              2003...........................       131,026

                                                   $413,172
                                                   ========

     The  estimated  fair values of our long-term  borrowings  is  approximately
$396.4  million at December  31, 2001 and $415.0  million at December  31, 2000.
Fair values are based on the  estimates  by  management  using  rates  currently
prevailing for comparable loans.

</TABLE>

     Fair value estimates are subjective in nature and are dependent on a number
of  important  assumptions,  including  estimates  of future cash flows,  risks,
discount rates and relevant  comparable market information  associated with each
financial instrument (See Note 1--Risks and Uncertainties). The use of different
market  assumptions and estimation  methodologies  may have a material effect on
the reported estimated fair value amounts.  Accordingly, the estimates presented
above are not  necessarily  indicative  of the  amounts  we would  realize  in a
current market exchange.

     We utilize  interest rate swaps to fix interest rates on variable rate debt
and reduce certain  exposures to interest rate  fluctuations.  In June 1998, the
Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued Statement No. 133,  Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,  which was required to be adopted
in years beginning  after June 15, 2000. We adopted the new Statement  effective
January 1, 2001. The Statement  requires us to recognize all  derivatives on the
balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to
fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature
of the hedge,  changes in the fair value of  derivatives  will  either be offset
against  the  change in fair value of the hedged  assets,  liabilities,  or firm
commitments through earnings or recognized in other  comprehensive  income until
the  hedge  item  is  recognized  in  earnings.  The  ineffective  portion  of a
derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.

     At December 31, 2001, we had two interest rate swaps with notional  amounts
of $32.0  million  each,  based on  30-day  LIBOR.  Under the terms of the first
agreement,  which  expires in  December  2002,  we receive  payments  when LIBOR
exceeds  6.35%  and pay the  counterparty  when  LIBOR is less  than  6.35%.  At
December 31, 2001,  30-day LIBOR was 1.88%. This interest rate swap was extended
to  December  2002 at the  option of the  counterparty  and  therefore  does not
qualify for hedge  accounting under FASB No. 133. The fair value of this swap at
January 1, and December  31, 2001 was a liability  of $351,344  and  $1,316,566,
respectively. The liability at January 1 was recorded as a transition adjustment
in other  comprehensive  income and was recognized  over the initial term of the
swap ending December 31, 2001. Such  amortization  for the  twelve-month  period
ended  December 31, 2001 of $351,344,  together with the change in fair value of
the extended swap of $965,222,  is included in charges for derivative accounting
in the our Consolidated Statement of Operations.

     Under the second  agreement,  which  expires  December 31, 2002, we receive
payments when LIBOR exceeds  4.89% and pay the  counterparty  when LIBOR is less
than 4.89%. The fair value of this interest rate swap at December 31, 2001 was a
liability  of  $849,122,  which is  included  in other  comprehensive  income as
required under FASB No. 133 for fully effective cash flow hedges.

     The fair  values of these  interest  rate  swaps are  included  in  accrued
expenses and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31,
2001.

NOTE 9--RETIREMENT ARRANGEMENTS

     Our  company  has a  401(k)  Profit  Sharing  Plan  covering  all  eligible
employees. Under the Plan, employees are eligible to make contributions, and we,
at  our  discretion,   may  match   contributions  and  make  a  profit  sharing
contribution.

     The Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded plan under which we may award
units that result in  participation  in the  dividends  and future growth in the
value of our common  stock.  The total number of units  permitted by the plan is
200,000,  of which 90,850 units have been awarded and 9,250 are  outstanding  at
December 31, 2001. Units awarded to eligible  participants vest over a period of
five years based on the participant's initial service date.

     Provisions   charged  to  operations  with  respect  to  these   retirement
arrangements  totaled  $33,500,  $181,000 and  $123,000 in 2001,  2000 and 1999,
respectively.


NOTE 10--STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND STOCK OPTIONS

Series C Preferred Stock

     On July 14,  2000,  Explorer  Holdings,  L.P.,  an  affiliate  of Hampstead
Investment  Partners  III,  L.P.  ("Hampstead"),   a  private  equity  investor,
completed an  investment  (the  "Equity  Investment")  of $100.0  million in our
company in exchange for  1,000,000  shares of our Series C Preferred  Stock.  We
used a portion of the proceeds  from the Equity  Investment to repay $81 million
of maturing debt on July 17, 2000.

     Shares of the Series C Preferred Stock are convertible into common stock at
any time by the  holder  at an  initial  conversion  price of $6.25 per share of
common  stock.  The shares of Series C Preferred  Stock are  entitled to receive
dividends at the greater of 10% per annum or the  dividend  payable on shares of
common  stock,  with  the  Series  C  Preferred  Stock  participating  on an "as
converted" basis.  Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock are cumulative from
the date of original issue and are payable quarterly  commencing on November 15,
2000.

     The Series C Preferred  Stock votes (on an "as converted"  basis)  together
with our common stock on all matters submitted to stockholders.  If dividends on
the Series C Preferred  Stock are in arrears for four  quarters,  the holders of
the Series C Preferred  Stock,  voting  separately as a class (and together with
the  holder of Series A and Series B  preferred  if and when  dividends  on such
series are in arrears for six or more  quarters and special  class voting rights
are in effect  with  respect to the Series A and  Series B  preferred),  will be
entitled to elect directors who, together with the other directors designated by
the  holders of Series C Preferred  Stock,  would  constitute  a majority of our
Board of Directors.  The general terms of the Equity Investment are set forth in
the Investment Agreement.

     By letter  dated  January  31,  2001,  Explorer  waived  its right to elect
additional  directors  resulting from dividend  arrearages  through December 31,
2002 provided that the dividends on any shares of Series C Preferred Stock would
not be in arrears for six or more dividend periods from January 31, 2001 through
and including December 31, 2002.

     In  connection  with  Explorer's  Equity  Investment,  we  entered  into  a
Stockholders'  Agreement with Explorer  dated July 14, 2000 (the  "Stockholders'
Agreement")  pursuant to which  Explorer  was  entitled to  designate up to four
members of our Board of Directors  depending on the  percentage  of total voting
securities  (consisting of Common Stock and Series C Preferred  Stock)  acquired
from time to time by Explorer  pursuant  to the  documentation  entered  into by
Explorer  in  connection  with the Equity  Investment.  Explorer  is entitled to
designate  at least one director of our Board of Directors as long as it owns at
least five  percent (5%) of the total voting power of our company and to approve
one "independent director" as long as it owns at least twenty-five percent (25%)
of the shares it acquired at the time it  completed  the Equity  Investment  (or
Common Stock issued upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock acquired
by Explorer at such time).  Explorer's director designations  terminate upon the
tenth anniversary of the Stockholders' Agreement.

     We agreed to indemnify  Explorer,  its affiliates and the individuals  that
will serve as directors of our company  against any losses and expenses that may
be incurred as a result of the  assertion of certain  claims,  provided that the
conduct  of  the  indemnified  parties  meets  certain  required  standards.  In
addition,  we agreed to pay  Explorer an advisory  fee of up to $3.1 million for
Explorer's  assistance  in  connection  with  financing  matters.  We will  also
reimburse  Explorer for Explorer's  out-of-pocket  expenses,  up to a maximum of
$2.5 million,  incurred in connection with the Equity Investment. As of December
31,  2001,  we have  reimbursed  Explorer  approximately  $1.57  million of such
expenses.

     The terms of the  Stockholders'  Agreement and the Series C Preferred Stock
were amended in  connection  with  Explorer's  February  2002  investment in our
company (See Note 19 -- Subsequent Events).

Series A and Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock

     On April 28, 1998,  we received  gross  proceeds of $50.0  million from the
issuance  of 2 million  shares of 8.625%  Series B  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock
("Series  B  Preferred  Stock")  at $25 per  share.  Dividends  on the  Series B
Preferred  Stock are cumulative  from the date of original issue and are payable
quarterly  commencing on August 15, 1998.  On April 7, 1997,  we received  gross
proceeds of $57.5  million  from the  issuance  of 2.3  million  shares of 9.25%
Series A  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  ("Series A Preferred  Stock") at $25 per
share. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are cumulative from the date of
original  issue and are payable  quarterly.  At December 31, 2001, the aggregate
liquidation preference of Series A and Series B preferred stock issued is $107.5
million.

Stockholder Rights Plan

     On May 12,  1999,  our Board of  Directors  authorized  the  adoption  of a
stockholder  rights  plan.  The plan is  designed  to  require a person or group
seeking  to  gain  control  of our  company  to  offer a fair  price  to all our
stockholders. The rights plan will not interfere with any merger, acquisition or
business  combination  that our Board of Directors finds is in the best interest
of our company and its stockholders.

     In connection  with the adoption of the rights plan, the Board of Directors
declared a dividend  distribution of one right for each common share outstanding
on May 24, 1999. The rights will not become exercisable unless a person acquires
10% or more of our common  stock,  or begins a tender offer that would result in
the  person  owning 10% or more of our common  stock.  At that time,  each right
would  entitle each  stockholder  other than the person who triggered the rights
plan to purchase  either our common stock or stock of an  acquiring  entity at a
discount to the then market  price.  The plan was not adopted in response to any
specific attempt to acquire control of our company.

     We amended our Stockholders' Rights Plan in 2000 to exempt Explorer and any
of its  transferees  that become parties to the standstill as Acquiring  Persons
under such plan. In October,  2001, we further amended our Stockholders'  Rights
Plan to exempt Explorer and its affiliates and transferees generally.

February 2002 Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement

     On October 30,  2001,  we  announced  a plan to raise $50.0  million in new
equity capital from our current stockholders, in the form of a private placement
with  Explorer  and a rights  offering to our common  stockholders.  The private
placement and rights  offering were  completed in February,  2002 (See Note 19 -
Subsequent Events).

Stock Options and Stock Purchase Assistance Plan

     In January 1998,  our company  adopted a stock  purchase  assistance  plan,
whereby we extended  credit to directors and employees to purchase our company's
common stock through the exercise of stock  options.  During 2000, we terminated
this  borrowing  program and  forgave  the  outstanding  stock  option  loans in
exchange for the surrender of the underlying  stock  certificates and payment of
all  outstanding  interest on the loans.  We  recorded a charge of $1.9  million
related to these loans, which is included in the provision for loss on mortgages
and notes receivable in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2000.

     Under the terms of the 2000 Stock  Incentive Plan  ("Incentive  Plan"),  we
reserved  3,500,000  shares of common  stock  for  grants to be issued  during a
period of up to 10 years.  Options are  exercisable  at the market  price at the
date of grant,  expire five years after date of grant for over 10% owners and 10
years from the date of grant for less than 10%  owners.  Directors'  shares vest
over three  years  while  other  grants vest over five years or as defined in an
employee's  contract.   Directors,   officers  and  employees  are  eligible  to
participate  in the  Incentive  Plan.  Options  for  2,579,120  shares have been
granted to 24 eligible participants.  Additionally, 309,580 shares of restricted
stock have been granted under the  provisions of the Incentive  Plan. The market
value of the restricted shares on the date of the award was recorded as unearned
compensation-restricted  stock, with the unamortized balance shown as a separate
component of stockholders' equity. Unearned compensation is amortized to expense
generally over the vesting period,  with charges to operations of $0.37 million,
$0.54 million and $0.64 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     During 2000,  1,040,000 Dividend Equivalent Rights were granted to eligible
employees.  A Dividend  Equivalent  Right  entitles the  participant  to receive
payments from us in an amount determined by reference to any cash dividends paid
on a specified  number of shares of stock to our  stockholders  of record during
the period such rights are effective. We recorded $9,000 and $502,500 of expense
related to the Dividend Equivalent Rights in 2001 and 2000, respectively. During
2001, payments of $502,500 were made in settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights
in connection with cancellation of options on 1,005,000 shares.

     At  December  31,  2001,  options  currently  exercisable  (96,724)  have a
weighted-average  exercise  price of $15.88,  with exercise  prices ranging from
$5.69 to $37.20.  There are 611,300  shares  available  for future  grants as of
December 31, 2001.

     The following is a summary of activity under the plan.

</TABLE>

     During 1999, we offered  holders of options the  opportunity  to accelerate
the expiration date of options in  consideration  of a cash payment.  Twenty-two
employees who were holders of options for 431,830 shares  accepted the offer and
were paid a total of $38,000.  Options for  157,000  shares  granted in 1999 and
canceled in 1999 under this  arrangement  are excluded  from the above table for
1999 and from the  calculation  for the  weighted-average  fair value of options
granted in 1999.

     In 1995, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued the Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based
Compensation."  This standard prescribes a fair value-based method of accounting
for employee stock options or similar equity  instruments  and requires  certain
pro forma disclosures.  For purposes of the pro forma disclosures required under
Statement  123, the estimated  fair value of the options is amortized to expense
over the option's vesting period.  Based on our company's  option activity,  net
earnings would have increased in 2001, 2000 and 1999 by  approximately  $16,000,
$1,064,000 and $618,000, respectively. Net earnings per basic and diluted common
share on a pro forma basis  would have been  unchanged  in 2001,  and would have
increased in 2000 and 1999 by approximately $.06 and $.03,  respectively,  under
SFAS No. 123. The estimated  weighted-average  fair value of options  granted in
2001,  2000 and 1999 was  $998,000,  $407,000  and  $168,000,  respectively.  In
determining  the  estimated  fair  value of our stock  options as of the date of
grant,  a  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  was used  with  the  following
assumptions:  risk-free interest rates of 2.5% in 2001, 5.2% in 2000 and 6.5% in
1999; a dividend yield of 5% in 2001, 10% in 2000 and 1999;  volatility  factors
of the expected market price of our common stock based on 30% volatility in 2001
and 2000, and 22.7% in 1999; and a weighted-average expected life of the options
of 4.0 years in 2001 and 8.0 years for 2000 and 1999.

     The  Black-Scholes  options  valuation  model  was  developed  for  use  in
estimating the fair value of traded  options which have no vesting  restrictions
and are fully  transferable.  In addition,  option  valuation models require the
input of highly  subjective  assumptions,  including  the  expected  stock price
volatility.   Because  our   employee   stock   options   have   characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially  affect the fair value estimate,  in
management's  opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.


NOTE 11--RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Explorer Holdings, L.P.

     Hampstead,  through its  affiliate  Explorer,  indirectly  owned  1,048,722
shares of Series C  preferred  stock and  553,850  shares of our  common  stock,
representing  47.1% of our  outstanding  voting  power as of December  31, 2001.
Daniel A. Decker,  our Chairman of the Board, is a partner of Hampstead.  Donald
J. McNamara, the Chairman of Hampstead, is one of our directors.  Christopher W.
Mahowald is one of our  directors  and holds an equity  investment  in Explorer.
Additional  common equity was issued to Explorer pursuant to a private placement
in February, 2002. (See Note 19 - Subsequent Events).

     Series C Investment  Agreement.  Under the terms of an investment agreement
dated May 11,  2000  between  us and  Explorer  in  connection  with  Explorer's
purchase of Series C preferred  stock,  we agreed to reimburse  Explorer for its
out-of-pocket  expenses,  up to a maximum  amount of $2.5  million,  incurred in
connection  with the Series C  investment.  As of  December  31,  2001,  we have
reimbursed Explorer for approximately $1.57 million of these expenses.

     Advisory  Agreement.  Under the terms of an amended and  restated  advisory
agreement dated October 4, 2000 between us and Hampstead,  we have agreed to pay
Explorer an advisory fee if Hampstead  provides  assistance  to us in connection
with the evaluation of growth  opportunities or other financing matters. On June
1, 2001, in connection with Hampstead's  agreement to provide certain  specified
financial  advisory,  consulting  and  operational  services,  including but not
limited to  assistance  in our  efforts to  refinance,  repay or extend  certain
indebtedness and assist in efforts to manage our  capitalization  and liquidity,
we agreed to pay  Hampstead  a fee  equal to 1% of the  aggregate  amount of our
indebtedness that is refinanced, repaid or extended, based on the maximum amount
available  to be drawn  in the  case of  revolving  credit  facilities,  up to a
maximum fee of $3.1  million.  The advisory fee is payable  five  business  days
following the  completion of the  refinancing,  repayment or extension of any of
our  indebtedness,  but as amended no fee will be payable  prior to December 31,
2001.  Upon the  closing  of the  rights  offering  and  Explorer's  investment,
Hampstead will have fulfilled all of its  obligations  under the agreement,  but
the advisory fee will only be payable at such time as all of the  conditions  to
payment of the advisory fee contained in the advisory agreement are met.

     Direct  Expenses.  In  addition  to the Series C  investment  costs and the
Advisory  Fee  costs of $3.1  million,  we  agreed  to  reimburse  Explorer  for
Explorer's direct expenses. As of December 31, 2001, we have reimbursed Explorer
for approximately $0.54 million of such direct expenses.

     Dividend and  Governance  Right  Deferral.  We and Explorer  entered into a
dividend  deferral  letter  agreement  dated  November 15, 2000  relating to the
extension  of the  dividend  payment  payable  in  connection  with our Series C
preferred  stock for the dividend  period ended  October 31, 2000.  The deferral
period expired on April 2, 2001. The amount of the deferred  dividend payment is
$4.667 million  representing the total unpaid  preferential  cumulative dividend
for the October 2000 dividend.  In exchange for the deferral,  we also agreed to
pay  Explorer a fee equal to 10% of the daily  unpaid  principal  balance of the
unpaid dividend amount from November 15, 2000 until the dividend was paid. Under
certain  circumstances,  the portion of the unpaid dividend amount and fee which
is not paid in cash may be payable with additional  shares of Series C preferred
stock.  Shares of Series C preferred stock issued pursuant to this agreement are
valued at $100 per share, the stated per share liquidation  preference,  and are
convertible  into our common stock at $6.25 per share. In  consideration  of the
payment of the deferral  fee,  Explorer  agreed that the deferral of the subject
dividend  would not be  considered  an unpaid  dividend  and,  as a result,  the
October 31, 2000 dividend  period will not be included in the  determination  of
when Explorer's right to elect additional directors will vest.

     By letter  dated  January  31,  2001,  Explorer  waived  its right to elect
additional preferred stock directors through December 31, 2002 provided that the
dividends on any shares of Series C preferred  stock would not be in arrears for
six or more  dividend  periods  from  January  31, 2001  through  and  including
December 31, 2002.

     In full  payment of our  obligations  under the  dividend  deferral  letter
agreement,  we issued 48,420  shares of Series C preferred  stock to Explorer on
April 2, 2001.

Omega Worldwide

     In 1995,  we sponsored the  organization  of Principal  Healthcare  Finance
Limited ("Principal"),  an Isle of Jersey company, whose purpose is to invest in
nursing homes and long-term care facilities in the United  Kingdom.  In November
1997,  we formed Omega  Worldwide,  Inc.  ("Omega  Worldwide"),  a company which
provides asset management services and management advisory services,  as well as
equity and debt capital to the  healthcare  industry,  particularly  residential
healthcare   services  to  the  elderly.   On  April  2,  1998,  we  contributed
substantially  all of our  Principal  assets to Omega  Worldwide in exchange for
approximately  8.5 million  shares of Omega  Worldwide  common stock and 260,000
shares of Series B preferred  stock of which  approximately  5.2 million  shares
were  distributed  on April 2, 1998 to our  stockholders  and 2.3 million shares
were  sold by us on April  3,  1998.  In  April  1999,  in  conjunction  with an
acquisition by Omega Worldwide,  we acquired an interest in Principal Healthcare
Finance Trust ("the  Trust"),  an Australian  Unit Trust,  which owns 47 nursing
home facilities and 399 assisted living units in Australia and New Zealand.

     As of December 31, 2001, we hold 1,163,000 shares of Omega Worldwide common
stock and 260,000  shares of its  preferred  stock.  The  carrying  value of our
investment in Omega Worldwide is $4.5 million, including the market value of its
common stock and liquidation  preference in its preferred  stock. We also hold a
$1.6 million investment in Principal,  represented by 990,000 ordinary shares of
Principal, and a $1.3 million investment in the Trust.

     Fleet Credit  Guaranty.  We  guaranteed  repayment of  borrowings  of Omega
Worldwide,  pursuant to a revolving  credit facility with a bank group, of which
Fleet Bank,  N.A.  acts as agent in exchange for an initial 1% fee and an annual
facility fee of 0.25%.  At December 31, 2000,  borrowings  of $2.85 million were
outstanding under Omega Worldwide's revolving credit facility. Omega Worldwide's
credit agreement  required  scheduled  payments to be made until fully repaid in
June 2001.  Under this  agreement,  no further  borrowings  may be made by Omega
Worldwide  under its  revolving  credit  facility.  We were  required to provide
collateral in the amount of up to $8.8 million related to the guarantee of Omega
Worldwide's  obligations.  Upon  repayment by Omega  Worldwide of the  remaining
outstanding balance under its revolving credit facility,  the subject collateral
was released in connection with the termination of our guarantee.

     Opportunity  Agreement.  We  and  Omega  Worldwide  have  entered  into  an
opportunity  agreement  to  provide  each other with  rights to  participate  in
transactions and make investments.  The opportunity agreement provides that each
company  will  offer  the  other a right  of first  refusal  to  participate  in
transactions  or  investments  of which it  becomes  aware.  In  addition,  both
companies agree to jointly pursue certain  transactions and investments upon the
request of either company.  The terms upon which each of us elect to participate
in any  transaction  or investment  will be negotiated in good faith and must be
mutually acceptable to our respective boards of directors,  with the affirmative
votes of the  independent  directors  of each of the  boards of  directors.  The
opportunity  agreement  has a term of ten years  and  automatically  renews  for
successive five-year terms, unless terminated.

     Services  Agreement.  We and Omega  Worldwide  have entered into a services
agreement  which provides for the allocation of indirect costs incurred by us to
Omega  Worldwide.  The  allocation  of  indirect  costs  has  been  based on the
relationship  of assets  under our  management  to the  combined  total of those
assets and assets under Omega  Worldwide's  management.  Upon expiration of this
agreement on June 30, 2000, we entered into a new agreement  requiring quarterly
payments   from  Omega   Worldwide  of  $37,500  for  the  use  of  offices  and
administrative  and financial services provided by us. Upon the reduction of our
accounting  staff, the service  agreement was renegotiated  again on November 1,
2000  requiring  quarterly  payments  from Omega  Worldwide  of  $32,500.  Costs
allocated to Omega Worldwide for 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $130,000, $404,000 and
$754,000  respectively.  The former  services  agreement  has  expired and Omega
Worldwide is paying monthly invoices for services rendered.

Other

     On December 30, 1998, we made a $6.0 million loan to Oakwood Living Centers
of Massachusetts,  Inc., an affiliate of Oakwood Living Centers,  Inc., of which
James E. Eden,  a former  director of our  company,  also is Chairman  and Chief
Executive Officer.  The loan bears interest at 14% per annum and is secured by a
first  mortgage lien on accounts  receivable  and a second  mortgage lien on six
skilled nursing facilities located in Massachusetts.

NOTE 12--DIVIDENDS

     In order to qualify as a REIT,  we are  required  to  distribute  dividends
(other than capital gain  dividends) to our  stockholders  in an amount at least
equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our "REIT taxable income"  (computed  without
regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of
the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (B) the sum
of certain items of non-cash income. In addition,  if we dispose of any built-in
gain asset during a  recognition  period,  we will be required to  distribute at
least  90%  of  the  built-in  gain  (after  tax),  if  any,  recognized  on the
disposition of such asset. Such  distributions  must be paid in the taxable year
to which they relate,  or in the  following  taxable year if declared  before we
timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular
dividend payment after such  declaration.  In addition,  such  distributions are
required  to be made  pro  rata,  with no  preference  to any  share of stock as
compared  with other  shares of the same class,  and with no  preference  to one
class of stock as compared  with  another  class  except to the extent that such
class is entitled to such a preference.  To the extent that we do not distribute
all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of
our "REIT  taxable  income," as  adjusted,  we will be subject to tax thereon at
regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates.

     On  February  1,  2001,  we  announced  the  suspension  of all  common and
preferred dividends.  This action is intended to preserve cash to facilitate our
ability  to  obtain  financing  to fund  the  2002  debt  maturities.  Prior  to
recommencing  the  payment of  dividends  on our common  stock,  all accrued and
unpaid  dividends on our Series A, B and C preferred stock must be paid in full.
We have made sufficient  distributions to satisfy the distribution  requirements
under the REIT rules to maintain our REIT status for 2000.

     On March 30, 2001,  we exercised  our option to pay the accrued  $4,666,667
Series C dividend  from  November  15, 2000 and the  associated  deferral fee by
issuing 48,420 Series C preferred shares to Explorer on April 2, 2001, which are
convertible  into 774,722  shares of our common  stock at $6.25 per share.  Such
election  resulted in an increase in the  aggregate  liquidation  preference  of
Series C Preferred Stock as of April 2, 2001 to $104,842,000,  including accrued
dividends  through  that date.  Dividends  paid in stock to a specific  class of
stockholders, such as our payment of our Series C preferred stock in April 2001,
constitute dividends eligible for the 2001 dividends paid deduction.

     The table below sets forth information  regarding  arrearages in payment of
preferred stock dividends:

NOTE 14--LITIGATION

     We are  subject  to various  legal  proceedings,  claims and other  actions
arising out of the normal  course of  business.  While any legal  proceeding  or
claim has an element of  uncertainty,  management  believes  that the outcome of
each lawsuit claim or legal proceeding that is pending or threatened,  or all of
them  combined,  will not have a  material  adverse  effect on our  consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

     On June 21,  2000,  we were  named as a  defendant  in  certain  litigation
brought  against it by  Madison/OHI  Liquidity  Investors,  LLC  ("Madison"),  a
customer  that claims that we have  breached  and/or  anticipatorily  breached a
commercial  contract.  Ronald M.  Dickerman  and Bryan  Gordon are  partners  in
Madison and limited  guarantors of Madison's  obligations  to us. Madison claims
damages as a result of the alleged  breach of  approximately  $700,000.  Madison
seeks  damages  as a result  of the  claimed  anticipatory  breach  in an amount
ranging from $15 - $28 million or, in the  alternative,  Madison seeks  specific
performance  of the  contract as modified  by a course of conduct  that  Madison
alleges developed between Madison and our company. We contend that Madison is in
default  under the  contract in  question.  We believe  that the  litigation  is
meritless.   We  continue  to   vigorously   defend  the  case  and  have  filed
counterclaims   against  Madison  and  the  guarantors   seeking   repayment  of
approximately $10.2 million,  including default interest,  that Madison owes us,
as well as damages resulting from the conversion of the collateral  securing our
loan.  The trial in this matter is currently set for July,  2002.  The financial
statements do not contain any  adjustments  relating to the ultimate  outcome of
this uncertainty.

     On December 29, 1998,  Karrington  Health,  Inc. brought suit against us in
the Franklin County, Ohio, Common Pleas Court (subsequently  removed to the U.S.
District Court for the Southern  District of Ohio,  Eastern  Division)  alleging
that we repudiated and ultimately  breached a financing  contract to provide $95
million of  financing  for the  development  of 13 assisted  living  facilities.
Karrington  was  seeking  recovery  of  approximately  $34 million in damages it
alleged to have incurred as a result of the breach.  On August 13, 2001, we paid
Karrington  $10 million to settle all claims  arising from the suit, but without
our admission of any liability or fault,  which  liability is expressly  denied.
Based  on the  settlement,  the  suit has been  dismissed  with  prejudice.  The
settlement was recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2001.

NOTE 15--SEVERANCE, MOVING AND CONSULTING AGREEMENT COSTS

     We entered into several  consulting  and  severance  agreements in 2001 and
2000 related to the resignation of certain of our company's senior managers.  In
addition,  we incurred  certain  relocation  costs in 2001  associated  with our
corporate office move from Michigan to Maryland,  effective January, 2002. Costs
incurred  for these items total  $5.07  million and $4.67  million for the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  These costs are included in our
Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2001 and 2000.

(1)  Nursing home revenues from these owned and operated  assets are  recognized
     as services are provided.

(2)  EBITDA represents earnings before interest,  income taxes, depreciation and
     amortization.  We consider it to be a meaningful  measure of performance of
     our Owned and Operated  Assets.  EBITDA in and of itself does not represent
     cash  generated  from  operating  activities  in  accordance  with GAAP and
     therefore  should not be  considered an  alternative  to net earnings as an
     indication  of  operating  performance  or to net cash flow from  operating
     activities  as  determined  by GAAP as a measure  of  liquidity  and is not
     necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.

and 2000 and the effects of converting the 1996 convertible debentures have been
excluded as all such effects are antidilutive.


NOTE 19 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     In January,  2002,  Integrated  Health  Services,  Inc., and its affiliate,
Lyric Health Care LLC,  resumed payment of rents and mortgage  interest to us at
reduced  rates.  We are  currently  negotiating  with IHS to  reach a  permanent
restructuring  agreement or to  transition  the  facilities to a new operator or
operators.

     In February,  2002, we completed a rights offering and private placement to
Explorer.  Stockholders exercised subscription rights to purchase a total of 6.4
million  shares  of common  stock at a  subscription  price of $2.92 per  share,
raising gross proceeds of $18.7 million. In a related  transaction,  we closed a
private  placement  with  Explorer,  issuing a total of 10.7  million  shares of
common  stock at a price of $2.92 per share,  raising  gross  proceeds  of $31.3
million.  We expect to use the  proceeds  from the rights  offering  and private
placement to repay outstanding  indebtedness and for working capital and general
corporate purposes.

     Amendments under both of our revolving credit  facilities  became effective
concurrently  with the completion of the rights offering and private  placement.
The amendments included  modifications  and/or eliminations to certain financial
covenants.  The amendment  regarding our $175 million  revolving credit facility
included a one-year extension in maturity from December 31, 2002 to December 31,
2003 and a reduction in the total  commitment from $175 million to $160 million.
As part of the amendment regarding our $75 million revolving credit facility, we
prepaid $10 million originally scheduled to mature in March 2002.

     In connection  with  Explorer's  February 2002  investment,  we amended the
stockholders  agreement  with Explorer to provide that Explorer will be entitled
to  designate  to our Board of  Directors  that number of  directors  that would
generally be proportionate to Explorer's  ownership of voting  securities in our
company,  not to exceed five  directors  (or six directors in the event that the
size  of the  Board  of  Directors  is  increased  to ten  directors).  Explorer
currently  beneficially  owns a majority of our voting  securities and therefore
would be entitled to designate a majority of our  directors.  Explorer  will, so
long as it owns at least 15% of our voting securities,  vote its shares in favor
of three independent  directors as defined under the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange who are not affiliates of Explorer.

     Also in connection with Explorer's  February 2002 investment,  the terms of
the  outstanding  Series C Preferred  Stock,  all of which is owned by Explorer,
were amended (1) to remove the restriction that previously prohibited the voting
or conversion of Series C Preferred  Stock in excess of 49.9% of our outstanding
voting  securities  and (2) to provide  that if we fail to pay  dividends on the
Series C  Preferred  Stock  for  four  quarters,  the  holders  of the  Series C
Preferred Stock will be entitled to designate two additional directors. However,
by letter dated January 31, 2001,  Explorer waived its right to elect additional
directors  resulting from dividend arrearages through December 31, 2002 provided
that the  dividends  on any shares of Series C  Preferred  Stock would not be in
arrears for six or more  dividend  periods  from  January  31, 2001  through and
including December 31, 2002.

     In February,  2002, we  refinanced  an investment in a Baltimore,  Maryland
asset leased by United States Postal Service ("USPS") resulting in $13.0 million
of net cash proceeds. The new, fully amortizing mortgage has a 20-year term with
a fixed  interest rate of 7.26%.  This  transaction is cash neutral on a monthly
basis, as lease payments due from USPS equal debt service on the loan.

     During  the first  quarter  of 2002,  we leased  13  properties  previously
classified  as Owned and Operated  Assets.  We entered into  agreements to lease
four Arizona  facilities to subsidiaries of Infinia Health Care Companies and to
sublease  four  other  Arizona  facilities  to the same  party.  The  agreements
initially began as management arrangements, effective March 1, 2002, and convert
into leases upon Infinia and us obtaining various  approvals.  The terms for the
four Arizona leases and four  subleases are 10 years and 3 years,  respectively,
with an initial combined annual net rent payment of $1.02 million. Also on March
1,  2002,  we  leased  four  facilities  in  Massachusetts  to  subsidiaries  of
Harborside  Healthcare  Corporation.   The  initial  lease  term  for  the  four
properties is 10 years with an initial annual rent payment of $1.675 million. We
leased one  additional  facility on March 1, 2002, for an initial annual rent of
$0.38 million.  Additionally, on February 1, 2002, the leasehold interest in one
facility was terminated by the landlord,  bringing the total number of Owned and
Operated Assets down from 33 at December 31, 2001 to 19 as of March 1, 2002.

     From January 1 to March 27, 2002,  we purchased  $35.6 million of our 6.95%
bonds due in June 2002, leaving an outstanding balance of $61.9 million.
