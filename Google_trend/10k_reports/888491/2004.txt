ITEM 1 - BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY

OVERVIEW

     We were  incorporated  in the State of Maryland on March 31, 1992. We are a
self-administered   real  estate  investment   trust,  or  REIT,   investing  in
income-producing  healthcare  facilities,  principally long-term care facilities
located  in the  United  States.  We  provide  lease or  mortgage  financing  to
qualified  operators  of skilled  nursing  facilities  and, to a lesser  extent,
assisted  living  and  acute  care  facilities.  We have  historically  financed
investments  through borrowings under our revolving credit  facilities,  private
placements or public offerings of debt or equity  securities,  the assumption of
secured indebtedness, or a combination of these methods.

     As of December 31, 2003,  our  portfolio  of  investments  consisted of 211
healthcare  facilities,  located in 28 states  and  operated  by 39  third-party
operators.  Our gross  investments in these  facilities,  net of impairments and
before reserve for uncollectible loans,  totaled $812.3 million.  This portfolio
is made up of:

     o    151 long-term healthcare  facilities and two rehabilitation  hospitals
          owned and leased to third parties;

     o    fixed rate mortgages on 51 long-term healthcare facilities;

     o    one long-term  healthcare  facility that was recovered  from customers
          and is currently operated through third-party management contracts for
          our own account; and

     o    six long-term healthcare facilities that were recovered from customers
          and are currently closed.

     In addition,  we hold  miscellaneous  investments  of  approximately  $29.8
million at December 31, 2003,  including $22.7 million of notes receivable,  net
of allowance,  consisting primarily of secured loans to third-party operators to
our facilities.

     Our filings with the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission,  including  our
annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,  current reports
on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are accessible free of charge on our
website at www.omegahealthcare.com.

DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS

     INVESTMENT  POLICIES.  We maintain a  diversified  portfolio  of  long-term
healthcare  facilities  and  mortgages on healthcare  facilities  located in the
United States. In making investments,  we generally have focused on established,
creditworthy,  middle-market  healthcare  operators  that meet our standards for
quality  and  experience  of  management.   We  have  sought  to  diversify  our
investments in terms of geographic locations, operators and facility types.

     In evaluating potential investments, we consider such factors as:

     o    the quality and experience of management and the  creditworthiness  of
          the operator of the facility;

     o    the facility's  historical,  current and forecasted  cash flow and its
          ability to meet operational needs,  capital  expenditures and lease or
          debt service obligations, providing a competitive return on investment
          to us;

     o    the construction quality, condition and design of the facility;

     o    the geographic area and type of facility;

     o    the tax,  growth,  regulatory  and  reimbursement  environment  of the
          jurisdiction in which the facility is located;

     o    the occupancy and demand for similar healthcare facilities in the same
          or nearby communities; and

     o    the payor mix of private, Medicare and Medicaid patients.

     One of our fundamental  investment strategies is to obtain contractual rent
escalations under long-term, non-cancelable,  "triple-net" leases and fixed-rate
mortgage  loans,  and  to  obtain  substantial  liquidity  deposits.  Additional
security is typically  provided by covenants  regarding  minimum working capital
and net worth,  liens on accounts  receivable and other  operating  assets,  and
various    provisions    for    cross-default,    cross-collateralization    and
corporate/personal guarantees, when appropriate.

     We prefer to invest in equity  ownership of properties.  Due to regulatory,
tax  or  other  considerations,   we  sometimes  pursue  alternative  investment
structures,  including  convertible  participating and participating  mortgages,
that achieve returns comparable to equity investments.  The following summarizes
the primary  investment  structures we typically use. Average  annualized yields
reflect  existing  contractual  arrangements.  However,  in view of the  ongoing
financial  challenges in the long-term care industry,  we cannot assure you that
the operators of our facilities  will meet their payment  obligations in full or
when due. Therefore, the annualized yields as of January 1, 2004 set forth below
are not necessarily  indicative of or a forecast of actual yields,  which may be
lower.

     PURCHASE/LEASEBACK.  In a Purchase/Leaseback  transaction,  we purchase the
     property  from the operator  and lease it back to the  operator  over terms
     typically  ranging  from 5 to 15 years,  plus renewal  options.  The leases
     originated  by us generally  provide for minimum  annual  rentals which are
     subject to annual formula increases based upon such factors as increases in
     the  Consumer  Price Index  ("CPI") or  increases  in the  revenue  streams
     generated by the  underlying  properties,  with certain  fixed  minimum and
     maximum  levels.  The  average  annualized  yield from  leases was 10.1% at
     January 1, 2004.

     CONVERTIBLE PARTICIPATING MORTGAGE. Convertible participating mortgages are
     secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying  real estate and personal
     property of the  mortgagor.  Interest  rates are usually  subject to annual
     increases  based upon  increases  in the CPI or  increases  in the revenues
     generated by the underlying long-term care facilities, with certain maximum
     limits. Convertible participating mortgages afford us the option to convert
     our mortgage into direct  ownership of the  property,  generally at a point
     six to nine years from inception.  If we exercise our purchase  option,  we
     are obligated to lease the property back to the operator for the balance of
     the originally agreed term and for the originally agreed  participations in
     revenues  or CPI  adjustments.  This  allows us to capture a portion of the
     potential  appreciation  in value of the real estate.  The operator has the
     right to buy out our  option  at prices  based on  specified  formulas.  At
     December 31, 2003, we did not have any convertible participating mortgages.

     PARTICIPATING MORTGAGE.  Participating mortgages are similar to convertible
     participating  mortgages  except  that we do not  have a  purchase  option.
     Interest rates are usually subject to annual increases based upon increases
     in the CPI or  increases  in  revenues  of the  underlying  long-term  care
     facilities,  with certain maximum limits.  At December 31, 2003, we did not
     have any participating mortgages.

     FIXED-RATE  MORTGAGE.  These  mortgages  have a fixed interest rate for the
     mortgage  term and are secured by first  mortgage  liens on the  underlying

     The table set forth in Item 2 - Properties,  contains information regarding
our  real  estate  properties,  their  geographic  locations,  and the  types of
investment structures as of December 31, 2003.

     BORROWING  POLICIES.   We  may  incur  additional   indebtedness  and  have
historically sought to maintain a long-term  debt-to-total  capitalization ratio
in the range of 40% to 50%. Total  capitalization is total  stockholders  equity
plus long-term debt. We intend to periodically review our policy with respect to
our  debt-to-total  capitalization  ratio  and  to  modify  the  policy  as  our
management deems prudent in light of prevailing market conditions.  Our strategy
generally has been to match the maturity of our  indebtedness  with the maturity
of our investment assets, and to employ long-term, fixed-rate debt to the extent
practicable in view of market conditions in existence from time to time.

     We may use proceeds of any  additional  indebtedness  to provide  permanent
financing for  investments in additional  healthcare  facilities.  We may obtain
either secured or unsecured indebtedness,  and may obtain indebtedness which may
be  convertible  into capital  stock or be  accompanied  by warrants to purchase
capital stock.  Where debt financing is available on terms deemed favorable,  we
generally  may  invest in  properties  subject  to  existing  loans,  secured by
mortgages, deeds of trust or similar liens on properties.

     If we need capital to repay indebtedness as it matures,  we may be required
to liquidate investments in properties at times which may not permit realization
of the maximum recovery on these investments.  This could also result in adverse
tax consequences to us. We may be required to issue additional  equity interests
in our company, which could dilute your investment in our company. (See Item 7 -
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources).

     FEDERAL  INCOME  TAX  CONSIDERATIONS.  We  intend  to make and  manage  our
investments, including the sale or disposition of property or other investments,
and to  operate  in such a manner as to  qualify  as a REIT  under the  Internal
Revenue  Code,  unless,  because of changes in  circumstances  or changes in the
Internal Revenue Code, our Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in
our best  interest to qualify as a REIT.  As a REIT,  we generally  will not pay
federal  income taxes on the portion of our taxable  income which is distributed
to stockholders.

     POLICIES  WITH  RESPECT TO CERTAIN  ACTIVITIES.  If our Board of  Directors
determines that additional funding is required,  we may raise such funds through
additional equity offerings, debt financing,  retention of cash flow (subject to
provisions in the Internal  Revenue Code concerning  taxability of undistributed
REIT taxable income) or a combination of these methods.

     Borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings, secured or unsecured, and
publicly or privately placed debt instruments, purchase money obligations to the
sellers  of  assets,  long-term,  tax-exempt  bonds  or  financing  from  banks,
institutional  investors  or other  lenders,  or  securitizations,  any of which
indebtedness  may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests
in our  assets.  Such  indebtedness  may be  recourse  to all or any part of our
assets or may be  limited  to the  particular  asset to which  the  indebtedness
relates.

     We have  authority  to offer  our  common  stock or  other  equity  or debt
securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our
shares or any other securities and may engage in such activities in the future.

     Subject to the  percentage  of ownership  limitations  and gross income and
asset tests  necessary  for REIT  qualification,  we may invest in securities of
other REITs,  other entities engaged in real estate  activities or securities of
other  issuers,  including  for the  purpose  of  exercising  control  over such
entities.

     We may engage in the purchase and sale of investments. We do not underwrite
the securities of other issuers.

     Our officers and directors may change any of these policies  without a vote
of our stockholders.

     In the opinion of our management,  our properties are adequately covered by
insurance.

RISK FACTORS

        You should carefully consider the risks described below. These risks are
not the only ones that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we
are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important
factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occurs, our business,
financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely
affected.

RISKS RELATED TO THE OPERATORS OF OUR FACILITIES

     Our financial  position  could be weakened and our ability to pay dividends
could be  limited  if any of our  major  operators  were  unable  to meet  their
obligations  to us or failed to renew or extend  their  relationship  with us as
their  lease  terms  expire,  or if we were  unable  to  lease or  re-lease  our
facilities or make mortgage loans on economically favorable terms. These adverse
developments  could arise due to a number of  factors,  including  those  listed
below.

OUR RECENT EFFORTS TO  RESTRUCTURE  AND STABILIZE OUR PORTFOLIO MAY NOT PROVE TO
BE SUCCESSFUL.

     In large part as a result of the 1997 changes in Medicare  reimbursement of
services provided by skilled nursing  facilities and reimbursement  cuts imposed
under state  Medicaid  programs,  a number of operators of our  properties  have
encountered significant financial difficulties during the last several years. In
1999,  our  investment  portfolio  consisted of 216  properties  and our largest
public  operators (by  investment)  were Sun  Healthcare  Group,  Inc.  ("Sun"),
Integrated Health Services,  Advocat,  Inc.  ("Advocat") and Mariner Health Care
Inc.  ("Mariner").  Some of these operators,  including Sun,  Integrated  Health
Services and Mariner, subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection. Other of our
operators were required to undertake significant  restructuring efforts. We have
restructured  our  arrangements  with  many  of our  operators  whereby  we have
renegotiated lease and mortgage terms, re-leased properties to new operators and
have closed and/or disposed of properties.  At December 31, 2003, our investment
portfolio  consisted of 211  properties  and our largest  public  operators  (by
investment)  were Sun (20.7%),  Advocat (12.8%) and Mariner (7.4%).  Our largest
private company  operators (by investment) were Seacrest  Healthcare  (6.8%) and
Claremont Healthcare Holdings,  Inc. ("Claremont") (5.7%). We have a non-binding
agreement in principle with Sun, our largest operator (by investment)  regarding
our 51 properties that were leased to various affiliates of Sun. Finalization of
our  agreement  with Sun is subject to  negotiation  and execution of definitive
documentation.   In  addition,   we  continue  to  have  ongoing   restructuring
discussions with Claremont regarding five facilities  Claremont currently leases
from us. We might not be successful in reaching  definitive  agreements with Sun
or Claremont.  We are also aware of four properties in our portfolio  located in
Illinois where facility  operations  are currently  insufficient  to meet rental
payments due to us under our leases for these  facilities.  These lease payments
are currently  being paid by the lessee from funds other than those generated by
the  facilities.  It is possible that we will need to take steps to  restructure
this portion of our portfolio, or other properties in our portfolio with respect
to which our operators encounter financial difficulty. We cannot assure you that
our recent efforts to restructure  and stabilize our property  portfolio will be
successful.

THE  BANKRUPTCY,  INSOLVENCY OR FINANCIAL  DETERIORATION  OF OUR OPERATORS COULD
DELAY OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT  UNPAID  RENTS OR REQUIRE US TO FIND NEW  OPERATORS
FOR REJECTED FACILITIES.

     We are exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to meet their
obligations,  which may result in their  bankruptcy or insolvency.  Although our
leases  and loans  provide us the right to  terminate  an  investment,  evict an
operator,  demand  immediate  repayment and other remedies,  the bankruptcy laws
afford certain  protections  to a party that has filed for  bankruptcy  that may
render these remedies unenforceable.  In addition, an operator in bankruptcy may
be able to  restrict  our ability to collect  unpaid  rent or mortgage  payments
during the bankruptcy case.

     If one of our lessees seeks bankruptcy  protection,  title 11 of the United
States Code  ("Bankruptcy  Code"),  provides that a trustee in a liquidation  or
reorganization  case under the Bankruptcy Code, or a  debtor-in-possession  in a
reorganization  case  under the  Bankruptcy  Code,  has the  option to assume or
reject the unexpired lease  obligations of a debtor-lessee.  However,  our lease
arrangements  with  operators  who operate more than one of our  facilities  are
generally made pursuant to a single master lease covering all of that operator's
facilities  leased from us.  Subject to certain  restrictions,  a debtor- lessee
under a master lease agreement would generally be required to assume or reject a
master  lease as a whole,  rather  than  making the  decision  on a facility  by
facility  basis,  thereby  preventing the  debtor-lessee  from assuming only the
better  performing  facilities  and  terminating  the leasing  arrangement  with
respect  to the  poorer  performing  facilities.  Whether  or not a court  would
require a master  lease  agreement  to be assumed or  rejected  as a whole would
depend on a number of  factors,  including  applicable  state law,  the  parties
intent,  whether the master lease agreement and related  documents were executed
contemporaneously,  the nature and purpose of the  relevant  documents,  whether
there was separate and distinct consideration for each lease, and the provisions
contained in the relevant  documents,  including whether the relevant  documents
are  interrelated  and  contain  ample  cross-references.  Therefore,  it is not
possible to predict how a bankruptcy court would decide this issue.

     o    ASSUMPTION OF LEASES.  In the event that an unexpired lease is assumed
          by or on behalf of the debtor-lessee,  any defaults,  other than those
          created  by  the  financial   condition  of  the  debtor-lessee,   the
          commencement  of its bankruptcy  case or the appointment of a trustee,
          would  have to be  cured  and all the  rental  obligations  thereunder
          generally would be entitled to a priority over other unsecured claims.
          Generally,  unexpired  leases  must  be  assumed  in  their  totality,
          however, a bankruptcy court has the power to refuse to enforce certain
          provisions  of a lease,  such as  cross-default  provisions or penalty
          provisions,  that would  otherwise  prevent or limit the  ability of a
          debtor-lessee from assuming or assuming and assigning to another party
          the unexpired lease.

     o    REJECTION OF LEASES.  Generally, the debtor-lessee is required to make
          rent payments to us during its bankruptcy  unless and until it rejects
          the lease.  The  rejection  of a lease is deemed to be a  pre-petition
          breach of the  lease and the  lessor  will be  allowed a  pre-petition
          general  unsecured  claim  that will be  limited  to any  unpaid  rent
          already due plus an amount equal to the rent reserved under the lease,
          without acceleration,  for the greater of (a) one year and (b) fifteen
          percent  (15%),  not to exceed three years,  of the remaining  term of
          such lease,  following  the earlier of (i) the petition  date and (ii)
          repossession or surrender of the leased property.  Although the amount
          of a lease  rejection  claim is subject to the statutory cap described
          above,  the lessor  should  receive  the same  percentage  recovery on
          account  of  its  claim  as  other  holders  of  allowed  pre-petition
          unsecured   claims  receive  from  the  bankruptcy   estate.   If  the
          debtor-lessee rejects the lease, the facility would be returned to us.
          In that event,  if we were unable to  re-lease  the  facility to a new
          operator on  favorable  terms or only after a  significant  delay,  we
          could lose some or all of the  associated  revenue from that  facility
          for an extended period of time.

     If an operator  defaults  under one of our mortgage  loans,  we may have to
foreclose  on the  mortgage or protect our  interest by  acquiring  title to the
property and thereafter making  substantial  improvements or repairs in order to
maximize the facility's investment potential.  Operators may contest enforcement
of  foreclosure  or other  remedies,  seek  bankruptcy  protection  against  our
exercise  of  enforcement  or other  remedies  and/or  bring  claims  for lender
liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations. If an operator
seeks  bankruptcy  protection,  the  automatic  stay  provisions  of the federal
bankruptcy law would  preclude us from  enforcing  foreclosure or other remedies
against the operator  unless  relief is obtained  from the court.  High "loan to
value"  ratios or  declines  in the value of the  facility  may  prevent us from
realizing an amount equal to our mortgage loan upon foreclosure.

     The receipt of liquidation  proceeds or the replacement of an operator that
has  defaulted  on its  lease  or loan  could be  delayed  by the  approval  and
licensure  process  of any  federal,  state or local  agency  necessary  for the
replacement of the previous  operator  licensed to manage the facility.  In some
instances,  we may take possession of a property and such action could expose us
to successor liabilities.  These events, if they were to occur, could reduce our
revenue and operating cash flow.

OPERATORS THAT FAIL TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENTAL  REIMBURSEMENT  PROGRAMS SUCH AS
MEDICARE OR MEDICAID, LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS,  FRAUD AND ABUSE
REGULATIONS  OR  NEW  LEGISLATIVE  DEVELOPMENTS  MAY BE  UNABLE  TO  MEET  THEIR
OBLIGATIONS TO US.

     Our  operators  are subject to numerous  federal,  state and local laws and
regulations  that are subject to frequent  and  substantial  changes  (sometimes
applied  retroactively)  resulting  from  legislation,  adoption  of  rules  and
regulations,  and administrative  and judicial  interpretations of existing law.
The  ultimate  timing or  effect of these  changes  cannot be  predicted.  These
changes may have a dramatic effect on our operators' costs of doing business and
the amount of reimbursement by both government and other third-party payors. The
failure of any of our  operators  to comply  with these laws,  requirements  and
regulations  could adversely  affect their ability to meet their  obligations to
us. In particular:

     o    MEDICARE AND MEDICAID.  A significant  portion of our skilled  nursing
          facility  operators'  revenue  is derived  from  governmentally-funded
          reimbursement  programs,  primarily Medicare and Medicaid, and failure
          to maintain  certification  and  accreditation in these programs would
          result in a loss of funding from such programs.  Loss of certification
          or accreditation could cause the revenues of our operators to decline,
          potentially  jeopardizing  their ability to meet their  obligations to
          us.  In that  event,  our  revenues  from  those  facilities  could be
          reduced,  which  could  in  turn  cause  the  value  of  our  affected
          properties to decline.  State licensing and Medicare and Medicaid laws
          also require operators of nursing homes and assisted living facilities
          to comply with extensive standards governing  operations.  Federal and
          state  agencies   administering  those  laws  regularly  inspect  such
          facilities  and  investigate  complaints.   Our  operators  and  their
          managers receive notices of potential sanctions and remedies from time
          to time,  and such  sanctions  have been  imposed from time to time on
          facilities  operated by them. If they are unable to cure  deficiencies
          which have been identified or which are identified in the future, such
          sanctions  may be imposed  and if  imposed  may  adversely  affect our
          operators'  revenues,  potentially  jeopardizing their ability to meet
          their obligations to us.

     o    LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION.  Our operators and facilities are subject
          to regulatory and licensing  requirements of federal,  state and local
          authorities   and  are   periodically   audited  by  them  to  confirm
          compliance.  Failure  to obtain  licensure  or loss or  suspension  of
          licensure  would  prevent a  facility  from  operating  or result in a
          suspension of  reimbursement  payments until all licensure issues have
          been resolved and the necessary  licenses obtained or reinstated.  Our
          skilled nursing facilities require governmental  approval, in the form
          of a certificate of need that generally varies by state and is subject
          to change,  prior to the  addition or  construction  of new beds,  the
          addition  of  services or certain  capital  expenditures.  Some of our
          facilities may be unable to satisfy current and future  certificate of
          need  requirements  and may for this  reason  be  unable  to  continue
          operating  in the  future.  In such  event,  our  revenues  from those
          facilities  could be reduced or eliminated  for an extended  period of
          time.

     o    FRAUD AND ABUSE  REGULATIONS.  There are various extremely complex and
          largely uninterpreted federal and state laws governing a wide array of
          referrals,  relationships  and arrangements  and prohibiting  fraud by
          healthcare  providers,  including  criminal  provisions  that prohibit
          filing false claims or making false  statements to receive  payment or
          certification  under  Medicare  and  Medicaid,  or  failing  to refund
          overpayments or improper payments. Governments are devoting increasing
          attention and resources to anti-fraud  initiatives  against healthcare
          providers.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
          1996 and the Balanced  Budget Act of 1997  expanded the  penalties for
          healthcare fraud,  including  broader  provisions for the exclusion of
          providers from the Medicare and Medicaid  programs.  Furthermore,  the
          Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
          Services,  or  OIG,  in  cooperation  with  other  federal  and  state
          agencies,  continues  to focus on the  activities  of skilled  nursing
          facilities in certain states in which we have properties. In addition,
          the  federal  False  Claims  Act  allows  a  private  individual  with
          knowledge  of  fraud  to  bring  a  claim  on  behalf  of the  federal
          government and earn a percentage of the federal government's recovery.
          Because of these  incentives,  these so-called  "whistleblower"  suits
          have become more frequent.  The violation of any of these  regulations
          by an  operator  may  result  in the  imposition  of  fines  or  other
          penalties that could jeopardize that operator's  ability to make lease
          or mortgage payments to us or to continue operating its facility.

     o    LEGISLATIVE  AND  REGULATORY  DEVELOPMENTS.   Each  year,  legislative
          proposals  are  introduced  or proposed in Congress  and in some state
          legislatures that would affect major changes in the healthcare system,
          either  nationally  or at the state level.  The Medicare  Prescription
          Drug,  Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, P.Law 108-173, which
          is one  example of such  legislation,  was  enacted in late 2003.  The
          Medicare  reimbursement  changes for the long term care industry under
          this Act are  limited to a  temporary  increase in the per diem amount
          paid to skilled  nursing  facilities  for residents who have AIDS. The
          significant  expansion of other  benefits  for Medicare  beneficiaries
          under this Act, such as the expanded prescription drug benefit,  could
          result in  financial  pressures  on the  Medicare  program  that might
          result in future  legislative and regulatory  changes with impacts for
          our operators.  Other proposals under consideration include efforts by
          individual  states  to  control  costs by  decreasing  state  Medicaid
          reimbursements,   a  federal  "Patient   Protection  Act"  to  protect
          consumers  in managed care plans,  efforts to improve  quality of care
          and reduce  medical  errors  throughout  the health care  industry and
          hospital cost-containment initiatives by public and private payors. We
          cannot accurately predict whether any proposals will be adopted or, if
          adopted,  what effect, if any, these proposals would have on operators
          and, thus, our business.

     Regulatory  proposals  and rules are released on an ongoing  basis that may
have major impact on the healthcare system generally and the skilled nursing and
long-term care industries in particular.

OUR OPERATORS DEPEND ON REIMBURSEMENT  FROM  GOVERNMENTAL AND OTHER  THIRD-PARTY
PAYORS AND REIMBURSEMENT RATES FROM SUCH PAYORS MAY BE REDUCED.

     Changes in the  reimbursement  rate or methods of payment from  third-party
payors,  including the Medicare and Medicaid programs,  or the implementation of
other measures to reduce  reimbursements  for services provided by our operators
has in the past, and could in the future,  result in a substantial  reduction in
our  operators'  revenues  and  operating  margins.  Additionally,  net  revenue
realizable under  third-party  payor agreements can change after examination and
retroactive  adjustment by payors during the claims settlement processes or as a
result of post-payment  audits.  Payors may disallow  requests for reimbursement
based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable or
because  additional  documentation is necessary or because certain services were
not  covered or were not  medically  necessary.  There also  continue  to be new
legislative  and regulatory  proposals that could impose further  limitations on
government and private payments to healthcare  providers.  In some cases, states
have  enacted or are  considering  enacting  measures  designed to reduce  their
Medicaid  expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare  insurance.  We
cannot  assure  you that  adequate  reimbursement  levels  will  continue  to be
available for the services provided by our operators,  which are currently being
reimbursed by Medicare,  Medicaid or private third-party payors.  Further limits
on the scope of  services  reimbursed  and on  reimbursement  rates could have a
material  adverse effect on our operators'  liquidity,  financial  condition and
results of operations which could cause the revenues of our operators to decline
and potentially jeopardize their ability to meet their obligations to us.

OUR  OPERATORS  MAY BE SUBJECT TO  SIGNIFICANT  LEGAL ACTIONS THAT COULD SUBJECT
THEM TO INCREASED OPERATING COSTS AND SUBSTANTIAL UNINSURED  LIABILITIES,  WHICH
MAY AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO PAY THEIR LEASE AND MORTGAGE PAYMENTS TO US.

     As is typical in the healthcare  industry,  our operators are often subject
to claims that their services have resulted in resident  injury or other adverse
effects.  Many of these  operators have  experienced an increasing  trend in the
frequency and severity of professional liability and general liability insurance
claims and litigation  asserted against them. The insurance coverage  maintained
by our  operators  may not cover all claims made against them nor continue to be
available at a reasonable  cost, if at all. In some states,  insurance  coverage
for the risk of punitive damages arising from professional liability and general
liability  claims and/or  litigation may not, in certain cases,  be available to
operators due to state law  prohibitions  or limitations of  availability.  As a
result,  our  operators  operating  in these  states may be liable for  punitive
damage  awards that are either not  covered or are in excess of their  insurance
policy limits.  We also believe that there has been, and will continue to be, an
increase  in   governmental   investigations   of  long-term   care   providers,
particularly  in the  area  of  Medicare/Medicaid  false  claims,  as well as an
increase in enforcement actions resulting from these  investigations.  Insurance
is not  available to cover such  losses.  Any adverse  determination  in a legal
proceeding or governmental investigation,  whether currently asserted or arising
in the future,  could have a material adverse effect on an operator's  financial
condition. If an operator is unable to obtain or maintain insurance coverage, if
judgments  are obtained in excess of the insurance  coverage,  if an operator is
required to pay uninsured  punitive damages,  or if an operator is subject to an
uninsurable  government  enforcement  action,  the operator  could be exposed to
substantial additional liabilities.

ONE OF OUR LARGEST  OPERATORS WAS RECENTLY SERVED WITH SIX LAWSUITS BY THE STATE
OF ARKANSAS  SEEKING  SUBSTANTIAL  DAMAGES  RELATING TO PATIENT  CARE ISSUES AND
ALLEGED MEDICAID FALSE CLAIMS.

     On February 19, 2004,  Advocat  announced  that it had been served with six
lawsuits by the State of Arkansas alleging  violations by Advocat and certain of
its  subsidiaries of the Arkansas Abuse of Adults Act and the Arkansas  Medicaid
False Claims Act. In its announcement,  Advocat stated that the complaints seek,
in the  aggregate,  actual  damages  of  approximately  $250,000  and  fines and
penalties in excess of $45 million.  Although  Advocat  stated its  intention to
vigorously defend itself against the subject allegations, Advocat further stated
that it cannot predict the outcome of the subject  lawsuits or the impact of the
ultimate  outcome on  Advocat's  financial  condition,  cash flows or results of
operations. Advocat accounts for approximately 13.4% of our 2003 total revenues.
In the event that there is an adverse outcome to Advocat in these  lawsuits,  or
in the event that Advocat's business is otherwise adversely affected as a result
of the lawsuits  (for  example,  as a result of penalties  imposed in connection
with  a  settlement  of the  lawsuits,  as a  result  of  licensure  revocation,
admission  holds or  similar  restrictions  being  imposed  or as a result  of a
decline in business due to  reputational  issues),  and Advocat is unable to pay
its full monthly rental obligation to us, then we will experience a reduction of
our rental  income.  Should  such events  occur,  our income and cash flows from
operations would be adversely  affected.  We are unable currently to predict how
this matter may ultimately affect us.

INCREASED  COMPETITION  AS WELL AS INCREASED  OPERATING  COSTS HAVE  RESULTED IN
LOWER  REVENUES  FOR SOME OF OUR  OPERATORS  AND MAY AFFECT  THE  ABILITY OF OUR
TENANTS TO MEET THEIR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US.

     The  healthcare  industry is highly  competitive  and we expect that it may
become more competitive in the future. Our operators are competing with numerous
other companies  providing similar  healthcare  services or alternatives such as
home  health  agencies,  life care at home,  community-based  service  programs,
retirement  communities  and  convalescent  centers.  We cannot be  certain  the
operators of all of our  facilities  will be able to achieve  occupancy and rate
levels  that  will  enable  them to meet all of  their  obligations  to us.  Our
operators may  encounter  increased  competition  in the future that could limit
their  ability to attract  residents or expand their  businesses  and  therefore
affect their ability to pay their lease or mortgage payments.

     The market for qualified  nurses,  healthcare  professionals  and other key
personnel is highly competitive and our operators may experience difficulties in
attracting and retaining  qualified  personnel.  Increases in labor costs due to
higher  wages and greater  benefits  required  to attract  and retain  qualified
healthcare personnel incurred by our operators could affect their ability to pay
their lease or mortgage payments.  This situation could be particularly acute in
certain  states that have  enacted  legislation  establishing  minimum  staffing
requirements.

RISKS RELATED TO US AND OUR OPERATIONS

     In addition to the operator  related  risks  discussed  above,  there are a
number of risks directly associated with us and our operations.

WE RELY ON EXTERNAL  SOURCES OF CAPITAL TO FUND FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS,  AND IF WE
ENCOUNTER  DIFFICULTY  IN  OBTAINING  SUCH  CAPITAL,  WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE
FUTURE INVESTMENTS NECESSARY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS OR MEET MATURING COMMITMENTS.

     In order to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code,
we are required, among other things, to distribute each year to our stockholders
at  least  90%  of  our  REIT  taxable  income.  Because  of  this  distribution
requirement, we may not be able to fund, from cash retained from operations, all
future capital needs, including capital needs to make investments and to satisfy
or refinance maturing commitments.  As a result, we may rely on external sources
of  capital.  If we are  unable  to  obtain  needed  capital  at all or  only on
unfavorable  terms  from  these  sources,  we  might  not be able  to  make  the
investments  needed  to grow  our  business,  or to  meet  our  obligations  and
commitments  as they mature,  which could  negatively  affect the ratings of our
debt and  even,  in  extreme  circumstances,  affect  our  ability  to  continue
operations. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we
have little or no control,  including general market conditions and the market's
perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings
and cash  distributions and the market price of the shares of our capital stock.
Generally  speaking,  difficult capital market conditions in our industry during
the past several years and our need to stabilize our portfolio  have limited our
access to capital.  Our potential  capital sources include,  but are not limited
to:

EQUITY FINANCING. As with other publicly-traded  companies,  the availability of
equity  capital  will depend,  in part,  on the market price of our common stock
which,  in turn,  will depend upon various  market  conditions and other factors
that may change from time to time including:

     o    the extent of investor interest;

     o    the general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of their equity
          securities  in  comparison  to  other  equity  securities,   including
          securities issued by other real estate-based companies;

     o    our financial performance and that of our operators;

     o    the contents of analyst reports about us and the REIT industry;

     o    general  stock  and  bond  market  conditions,  including  changes  in
          interest rates on fixed income securities,  which may lead prospective
          purchasers  of our common  stock to demand a higher  annual yield from
          future distributions;

     o    our failure to maintain or increase our dividend,  which is dependent,
          to a large  part,  on growth of funds  from  operations  which in turn
          depends upon increased revenues from additional investments and rental
          increases; and

     o    other factors such as  governmental  regulatory  action and changes in
          REIT tax laws.

     The market value of the equity securities of a REIT is generally based upon
the  market's  perception  of the REIT's  growth  potential  and its current and
potential  future  earnings  and cash  distributions.  Our  failure  to meet the
market's expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would
likely  adversely  affect  the market  price of our common  stock and reduce the
value of your investment.

DEBT  FINANCING/LEVERAGE.  Financing  for future  investments  and our  maturing
commitments may be provided by borrowings under our bank line of credit, private
or public  offerings of debt, the assumption of secured  indebtedness,  mortgage
financing on a portion of our owned portfolio or through joint ventures.  We are
subject to risks normally  associated with debt  financing,  including the risks
that our cash flow will be  insufficient  to make timely  payments of  interest,
that we will be unable to refinance existing  indebtedness and that the terms of
refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing  indebtedness.  If
we are unable to refinance or extend  principal  payments due at maturity or pay
them with  proceeds from other  capital  transactions,  our cash flow may not be
sufficient in all years to pay  distributions  to our  stockholders and to repay
all maturing debt.  Furthermore,  if prevailing  interest rates,  changes in our
debt  ratings  or other  factors  at the time of  refinancing  result  in higher
interest  rates  upon  refinancing,   the  interest  expense  relating  to  that
refinanced indebtedness would increase, which could reduce our profitability and
the amount of dividends we are able to pay. Moreover,  additional debt financing
increases  the  amount of our  leverage.  Our  degree  of  leverage  could  have
important consequences to stockholders, including affecting our investment grade
ratings,  affecting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for
working  capital,  capital  expenditures,  acquisitions,  development  or  other
general  corporate  purposes  and making us more  vulnerable  to a  downturn  in
business or the economy generally.

CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATORS ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR REVENUES.

     Based  on  existing  contractual  rent and  lease  payments  regarding  the
restructuring of certain existing investments,  Advocat and Sun each account for
over 10% of our current  contractual  monthly revenues,  with Sun accounting for
slightly over 20% of our current contractual monthly revenues. Additionally, our
top five  operators  account  for over 55% of our  current  contractual  monthly
revenues.  The  failure  or  inability  of any of these  operators  to pay their
obligations  to us could  materially  reduce our revenues and net income,  which
could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay and cause our stock price to
decline. For information  regarding our non-binding  agreement in principle with
Sun, see "Portfolio Developments; Sun Healthcare Group, Inc."

UNFORESEEN  COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF NEW PROPERTIES COULD REDUCE
OUR PROFITABILITY.

     Our business strategy  contemplates  future acquisitions that may not prove
to be successful. For example, we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and
expenditures   relating  to  any  acquired   properties,   including  contingent
liabilities,  or newly acquired properties might require significant  management
attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing  business.  If we agree
to provide funding to enable healthcare  operators to build,  expand or renovate
facilities  on our  properties  and the  project is not  completed,  we could be
forced to become  involved in the  development to ensure  completion or we could
lose the property. These costs may negatively affect our results of operations.

OUR ASSETS MAY BE SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

     We  periodically  but not less  than  annually  evaluate  our  real  estate
investments and other assets for impairment  indicators.  The judgment regarding
the  existence  of  impairment  indicators  is based on  factors  such as market
conditions,  operator  performance and legal  structure.  If we determine that a
significant  impairment has occurred, we would be required to make an adjustment
to the net  carrying  value of the asset,  which  could have a material  adverse
affect on our results of operations  and funds from  operations in the period in
which the write-off occurs.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL CERTAIN CLOSED FACILITIES FOR THEIR BOOK VALUE.

     From time to time, we close  facilities and actively market such facilities
for sale.  To the  extent we are unable to sell  these  properties  for our book
value,  we may be  required  to take an  impairment  charge or loss on the sale,
either of which would reduce our net income.

OUR SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

     We have  substantial  indebtedness  and we may increase our indebtedness in
the future.  As of December 31, 2003, our debt was $280.6 million,  the majority
of which  currently  comes due in 2007.  Our level of  indebtedness  could  have
important consequences to our stockholders. For example, it could:

     o    limit our ability to satisfy our  obligations  with respect to holders
          of our capital stock;

     o    potentially  cause us to violate a  cross-default  provision under our
          various long-term debt obligations;

     o    make us more vulnerable to economic downturns;

     o    potentially limit our ability to withstand  competitive  pressures if,
          as a result of a decline in our  rating  agency  ratings,  our cost of
          capital increases as compared to our competitors' cost of capital thus
          reducing the spread on our investments; and

     o    impair our ability to obtain  additional  financing  in the future for
          working  capital,   capital  expenditures,   acquisitions  or  general
          corporate purposes.

OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS ARE RELATIVELY ILLIQUID.

     Real estate  investments are relatively  illiquid and,  therefore,  tend to
limit our  ability to vary our  portfolio  promptly  in  response  to changes in
economic  or other  conditions.  All of our  properties  are  "special  purpose"
properties that could not be readily converted to general residential, retail or
office use. Healthcare  facilities that participate in Medicare or Medicaid must
meet extensive program  requirements,  including  physical plant and operational
requirements, which are revised from time to time. Such requirements may include
a duty to admit  Medicare  and  Medicaid  patients,  limiting the ability of the
facility to increase its private pay census beyond certain limits.  Medicare and
Medicaid facilities are regularly inspected to determine compliance,  and may be
excluded from the programs--in some cases without a prior  hearing--for  failure
to meet program requirements. Transfers of operations of nursing homes and other
healthcare-related  facilities are subject to regulatory  approvals not required
for  transfers of other types of commercial  operations  and other types of real
estate. Thus, if the operation of any of our properties becomes unprofitable due
to  competition,  age of  improvements  or other factors such that our lessee or
mortgagor  becomes unable to meet its obligations on the lease or mortgage loan,
the liquidation  value of the property may be substantially  less,  particularly
relative to the amount  owing on any related  mortgage  loan,  than would be the
case if the  property  were  readily  adaptable  to other  uses.  The receipt of
liquidation proceeds or the replacement of an operator that has defaulted on its
lease or loan could be delayed by the approval process of any federal,  state or
local agency  necessary for the transfer of the property or the  replacement  of
the operator with a new operator  licensed to manage the facility.  In addition,
certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment, such as
real  estate  taxes and  maintenance  costs,  are  generally  not  reduced  when
circumstances  cause a  reduction  in income  from the  investment.  Should such
events  occur,  our income and cash flows  from  operations  would be  adversely
affected.

AS AN OWNER OR LENDER  WITH  RESPECT  TO REAL  PROPERTY,  WE MAY BE  EXPOSED  TO
POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

     Under various federal,  state and local environmental laws,  ordinances and
regulations,  an owner of real property or a secured lender,  such as us, may be
liable in  certain  circumstances  for the costs of removal  or  remediation  of
certain  hazardous or toxic  substances  at, under or disposed of in  connection
with such  property,  as well as  certain  other  potential  costs  relating  to
hazardous  or toxic  substances,  including  government  fines and  damages  for
injuries to persons and  adjacent  property.  Such laws often  impose  liability
without  regard to  whether  the  owner  knew of, or was  responsible  for,  the
presence or  disposal of such  substances  and  liability  may be imposed on the
owner in connection with the activities of an operator of the property. The cost
of any required remediation,  removal, fines or personal or property damages and
the owner's liability  therefore could exceed the value of the property,  and/or
the assets of the owner. In addition,  the presence of such  substances,  or the
failure to properly  dispose of or  remediate  such  substances,  may  adversely
affect the owner's ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such
property as collateral which, in turn, would reduce the owner's revenues.

     Although our leases and mortgage loans require the lessee and the mortgagor
to  indemnify  us for  certain  environmental  liabilities,  the  scope  of such
obligations may be limited,  and we cannot assure you that any such mortgagor or
lessee would be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations.

THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE IS HIGHLY  COMPETITIVE.  THIS  COMPETITION  MAY
PREVENT US FROM RAISING PRICES AT THE SAME PACE AS OUR COSTS INCREASE.

     We  compete  for  additional  healthcare  facility  investments  with other
healthcare  investors,  including  other REITs.  The operators of the facilities
compete with other regional or local nursing care  facilities for the support of
the medical community, including physicians and acute care hospitals, as well as
the general  public.  Some  significant  competitive  factors for the placing of
patients in skilled and intermediate care nursing  facilities include quality of
care,  reputation,  physical  appearance of the  facilities,  services  offered,
family preferences,  physician services and price. If our cost of capital should
increase relative to the cost of capital of our competitors,  the spread that we
realize on our investments may decline if competitive pressures limit or prevent
us from charging higher lease or mortgage rates.

WE ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN LITIGATION  ARISING OUT OF PROFESSIONAL  LIABILITY
AND GENERAL  LIABILITY  CLAIMS  RELATING TO OUR  PREVIOUSLY  OWNED AND  OPERATED
FACILITIES  WHICH IF DECIDED  AGAINST US, COULD  ADVERSELY  AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL
CONDITION.

     We  and  several  of our  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  have  been  named  as
defendants in professional liability and general liability claims related to our
owned and operated  facilities.  Other third-party  managers responsible for the
day-to-day  operations of these facilities have also been named as defendants in
these claims. In these suits,  patients of certain previously owned and operated
facilities have alleged significant damages, including punitive damages, against
the  defendants.  The  lawsuits are in various  stages of  discovery  and we are
unable to predict the likely  outcome at this time.  We  continue to  vigorously
defend  these  claims and pursue all rights we may have  against the managers of
the facilities,  under the terms of the management  agreements.  We have insured
these matters,  subject to self-insured retentions of various amounts. There can
be no assurance that we will be successful in our defense of these matters or in
asserting our claims against various managers of the subject  facilities or that
the  amount of any  settlement  or  judgment  will be  substantially  covered by
insurance or that any punitive damages will be covered by insurance.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS.

     Our articles of  incorporation  and bylaws contain  various  procedural and
other  requirements  which could make it difficult  for  stockholders  to effect
certain corporate actions.  Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes
and our Board  members are elected  for terms that are  staggered.  Our Board of
Directors also has the authority to issue  additional  shares of preferred stock
and to fix the  preferences,  rights  and  limitations  of the  preferred  stock
without  stockholder  approval.  We have also adopted a stockholders rights plan
which provides for share purchase rights to become  exercisable at a discount if
a person or group  acquires  more than 9.9% of our common  stock or  announces a
tender  or  exchange  offer  for  more  than  9.9% of our  common  stock.  These
provisions could discourage  unsolicited  acquisition  proposals or make it more
difficult for a third party to gain control of us, which could adversely  affect
the market price of our securities.

WE MAY CHANGE OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND POLICIES AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE.

     Our Board of Directors, without the approval of our stockholders, may alter
our  investment  strategies  and policies if it  determines in the future that a
change  is  in  our  and  our  stockholders'  best  interests.  The  methods  of
implementing our investment  strategies and policies may vary as new investments
and financing techniques are developed.

IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN OUR REIT STATUS, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL INCOME TAX
ON OUR TAXABLE INCOME AT REGULAR CORPORATE RATES.

     We were  organized  to qualify for  taxation  as a real  estate  investment
trust, or REIT,  under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. We
believe we have conducted,  and we intend to continue to conduct, our operations
so as to qualify as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT involves the satisfaction of
numerous  requirements,  some  on an  annual  and  some  on a  quarterly  basis,
established  under  highly  technical  and complex  provisions  of the  Internal
Revenue  Code for  which  there are only  limited  judicial  and  administrative
interpretations  and involve the  determination  of various  factual matters and
circumstances not entirely within our control.  For example, in order to qualify
as a REIT, each year we must distribute to our  stockholders at least 90% of our
REIT  taxable  income.  We cannot  assure you that we will at all times  satisfy
these rules and tests.

     If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, as a result of
a determination  that we failed to meet the annual  distribution  requirement or
otherwise,  we would be subject to federal income tax,  including any applicable
alternative  minimum  tax, on our  taxable  income at regular  corporate  rates.
Moreover,  unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we also
would be  disqualified  from  treatment  as a REIT for the  four  taxable  years
following the year during which  qualification  is lost.  This  treatment  would
reduce our net earnings and cash flow available for investment,  debt service or
distribution  to  stockholders  because of our  additional tax liability for the
years involved.  In addition,  distributions to stockholders  would no longer be
required to be made.

WE HEDGE  FLOATING RATE DEBT WITH AN INTEREST  RATE CAP, AND MAY RECORD  CHARGES
ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE CAP.

     We utilize one interest  rate cap to reduce  certain  exposures to interest
rate  fluctuations.  We do  not  use  derivatives  for  trading  or  speculative
purposes.  We have a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial
institutions  based upon their credit ratings and other factors.  We will assess
the  probability  that our expected  future floating rate debt is sufficient for
our cap and may  recognize a charge to earnings  to reverse  amounts  previously
recorded as a component of comprehensive income.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR STOCK

THE  MARKET  VALUE OF OUR  STOCK  COULD BE  SUBSTANTIALLY  AFFECTED  BY  VARIOUS
FACTORS.

     The share price of our stock will depend on many factors,  which may change
from time to time, including:

     o    the market for similar securities issued by REITs;

     o    changes in estimates by analysts;

     o    our ability to meet analysts' estimates;

     o    general economic and financial market conditions; and

     o    our financial condition, performance and prospects.

OUR ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL STOCK,  WARRANTS OR DEBT SECURITIES,  WHETHER
OR NOT CONVERTIBLE, MAY REDUCE THE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR SHARES.

     We cannot  predict the  effect,  if any,  that future  sales of our capital
stock,  warrants or debt  securities,  or the availability of our securities for
future sale,  will have on the market price of our shares,  including our common
stock.  Sales of  substantial  amounts of our common stock or preferred  shares,
warrants or debt securities  convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
common stock in the public market or the perception  that such sales might occur
could  reduce  the  market  price of our stock and the terms  upon  which we may
obtain additional equity financing in the future.

     In addition,  we may issue additional  capital stock in the future to raise
capital or as a result of the following:

     o    The issuance and exercise of options to purchase our common stock.  As
          of  December  31,  2003,  we  had   outstanding   options  to  acquire
          approximately 2.3 million shares of our common stock. In addition,  we
          may in  the  future  issue  additional  options  or  other  securities
          convertible  into or  exercisable  for our common stock under our 2000
          Stock Incentive Plan, as amended,  or other remuneration plans. We may
          also issue options or convertible  securities to our employees in lieu
          of cash bonuses or to our directors in lieu of director's fees.

     o    The issuance of debt securities  exchangeable  for our common stock.

     o    The exercise of warrants we may issue in the future.

     o    Lenders  sometimes ask for warrants or other rights to acquire  shares
          in connection with providing financing.  We cannot assure you that our
          lenders will not request such rights.

THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES OF OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE.

     In 2001, our Board of Directors suspended dividends on our common stock and
all series of  preferred  stock in an effort to  generate  cash to address  then
impending debt maturities.  In 2003, we paid all accrued but unpaid dividends on
all series of preferred  stock and reinstated  dividends on our common stock and
all series of preferred  stock.  However,  our ability to pay  dividends  may be
adversely  affected  if any of the risks  described  above  were to  occur.  Our
payment of dividends is subject to compliance with restrictions contained in our
bank credit  facilities and our preferred  stock.  All dividends will be paid at
the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our earnings,  our
financial  condition,  maintenance  of our REIT status and such other factors as
our Board may deem  relevant  from time to time.  There are no assurances of our
ability to pay dividends in the future.  In addition,  our dividends in the past
have included, and may in the future include, a return of capital.

HOLDERS OF OUR  OUTSTANDING  PREFERRED  STOCK HAVE  LIQUIDATION AND OTHER RIGHTS
THAT ARE SENIOR TO THE RIGHTS OF THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

     Our Board of Directors has the  authority to designate and issue  preferred
stock that may have  dividend,  liquidation  and other rights that are senior to
those of our common  stock.  As of February  11, 2004,  2,300,000  shares of our
9.25% Series A cumulative preferred stock, 2,000,000 shares of our 8.625% Series
B  cumulative  preferred  stock  and  4,739,500  shares of our  8.375%  Series D
cumulative  redeemable  preferred stock were issued and outstanding.  Holders of
our preferred stock are generally  entitled to cumulative  dividends  before any
dividends may be declared or set aside on our common  stock.  Upon our voluntary
or  involuntary  liquidation,  dissolution  or winding up, before any payment is
made to holders of our common stock, holders of our preferred stock are entitled
to receive a liquidation  preference of $25 per share with respect to the Series
A,  Series  B and  Series  D  preferred  stock,  plus  any  accrued  and  unpaid
distributions.  This will reduce the  remaining  amount of our  assets,  if any,
available to distribute to holders of our common stock. In addition,  holders of
our  preferred  stock have the right to elect two  additional  directors  to our
Board of Directors if six quarterly preferred dividends are in arrears.

LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PURCHASERS OF OUR STOCK.

     In recent years, numerous legislative,  judicial and administrative changes
have been made in the  provisions of the federal  income tax laws  applicable to
investments  similar  to an  investment  in our  stock.  Changes  are  likely to
continue  to occur in the  future,  and we cannot  assure  you that any of these
changes will not adversely affect our stockholder's  stock. Any of these changes
could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on market value or
resale  potential.  Stockholders  are urged to consult with your own tax advisor
with respect to the impact that recent  legislation  may have on your investment
and the status of  legislative  regulatory or  administrative  developments  and
proposals and their potential effect.

RECENT CHANGES IN TAXATION OF CORPORATE DIVIDENDS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE
OF OUR STOCK.

     The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief  Reconciliation Act of 2003 that was enacted
into law on May 28,  2003,  among  other  things,  generally  reduces to 15% the
maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from a
regular  C  corporation.  This  reduced  tax  rate,  however,  will not apply to
dividends  paid to  individuals  by a REIT on its  shares,  except  for  certain
limited  amounts.  While  the  earnings  of a REIT that are  distributed  to its
stockholders  still  generally  will be subject to less combined  federal income
taxation than earnings of a non-REIT C corporation  that are  distributed to its
stockholders net of corporate-level tax, this legislation could cause individual
investors  to view the  stock  of  regular  C  corporations  as more  attractive
relative to the shares of a REIT than was the case prior to the enactment of the
legislation.  Individual  investors  could hold this view because the  dividends
from  regular C  corporations  will  generally  be taxed at a lower  rate  while
dividends  from  REITs  will  generally  be  taxed  at  the  same  rate  as  the
individual's  other ordinary income.  We cannot predict what effect, if any, the
enactment  of this  legislation  may have on the value of the shares of REITs in
general or on the value of our stock in particular,  either in terms of price or
relative to other investments.

plus renewal options. Substantially all of the Master Leases provide for minimum
annual rentals that are subject to annual  increases based upon increases in the
CPI or increases in revenues of the underlying properties,  with certain limits.
Under the terms of the leases,  the lessee is responsible  for all  maintenance,
repairs, taxes and insurance on the leased properties.

     At December  31,  2003,  we had one owned and  operated  facility  which is
subject to governmental  regulation and derives a substantial portion of its net
operating revenues from third-party payors,  including the Medicare and Medicaid
programs.  This  facility  is  managed by an  independent  third  party  under a
management contract. The manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of
the facility, including, among other things, patient care, staffing, billing and
collection of patient accounts and facility-level  financial reporting.  For its
services,  the manager is paid a management fee based on a percentage of nursing
home revenues.  We leased this facility to an operator effective January 1, 2004
and, as of the date of this report, we have no owned and operated  facilities in
our portfolio.  (See Note 3 - Properties to our audited  consolidated  financial
statements).

ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     We are  subject  to various  legal  proceedings,  claims and other  actions
arising out of the normal  course of  business.  While any legal  proceeding  or
claim has an element of  uncertainty,  management  believes  that the outcome of
each lawsuit claim or legal proceeding that is pending or threatened,  or all of
them  combined,  will not have a  material  adverse  effect on our  consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

     On June 21,  2000,  we were  named as a  defendant  in  certain  litigation
brought  against  us in the U.S.  District  Court for the  Eastern  District  of
Michigan, Detroit Division, by Madison/OHI Liquidity Investors, LLC ("Madison"),
for the breach and/or anticipatory breach of a revolving loan commitment. Ronald
M.  Dickerman  and Bryan Gordon are  partners in Madison and limited  guarantors
("Guarantors")  of Madison's  obligations  to us.  Effective as of September 30,
2002, the parties settled all claims in the suit in  consideration  of Madison's
payment of the sum of $5.4 million consisting of a $0.4 million cash payment for
our attorneys' fees, with the balance evidenced by the amendment of the existing
promissory  note from  Madison to us. The note  reflects a principal  balance of
$5.0 million,  with interest accruing at 9% per annum,  payable over three years
upon  liquidation  of the  collateral  securing the note. The note is also fully
guaranteed by the Guarantors;  provided that if all accrued  interest and 75% of
original  principal has been repaid  within 18 months,  the  Guarantors  will be
released.  Accordingly, a reserve of $1.26 million was recorded in 2002 relating
to this note. As of December 31, 2003,  the  principal  balance on this note was
$2.2 million prior to reserves.

     In 2000, we filed suit against a title company  (later adding a law firm as
a  defendant),  seeking  damages  based on  claims of  breach  of  contract  and
negligence,  among  other  things,  as a result of the  alleged  failure to file
certain Uniform  Commercial Code ("UCC")  financing  statements in our favor. We
filed a subsequent suit seeking recovery under title insurance  policies written
by the  title  company.  The  defendants  denied  the  allegations  made  in the
lawsuits.  In settlement of our claims against the defendants,  we agreed in the
first  quarter of 2003 to accept a lump sum cash  payment of $3.2  million.  The
cash proceeds were offset by related expenses incurred of $1.0 million resulting
in a net gain of $2.2 million.

     We  and  several  of our  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  have  been  named  as
defendants in  professional  liability  claims related to our formerly owned and
operated  facilities.  Other third-party managers responsible for the day-to-day
operations  of these  facilities  have also been  named as  defendants  in these
claims.  In these  suits,  patients  of certain  previously  owned and  operated
facilities have alleged significant damages,  including punitive damages against
the  defendants.  The  lawsuits are in various  stages of  discovery  and we are
unable to predict the likely  outcome at this time.  We  continue to  vigorously
defend  these  claims and pursue all rights we may have  against the managers of
the  facilities,  under the terms of the management  agreements,  which include,
among other matters, the requirement that the operators indemnify us against all
losses,  cost, fines and related  expenses arising out of such matters.  We also
maintain  insurance against such claims,  subject to self-insured  retentions of
various amounts. There can be no assurance that the operators will fulfill their
obligations to indemnify us or that such insurance will be available to fund any
losses or settlements arising as a result of such claims.

ITEM 4 - SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     No matters were submitted to stockholders  during the fourth quarter of the

some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of
forward-looking terminology including "may," "will," "anticipates," "expects,"
"believes," "intends," "should" or comparable terms or the negative thereof.
These statements are based on information available on the date of this filing
and only speak as to the date hereof and no obligation to update such
forward-looking statements should be assumed. Our actual results may differ
materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements contained

     (ii) uncertainties  relating to the business operations of the operators of
          our assets,  including those relating to  reimbursement by third-party
          payors, regulatory matters and occupancy levels;

     (iii)the ability of any operators in bankruptcy to reject  unexpired  lease
          obligations,  modify the terms of our mortgages and impede our ability
          to collect unpaid rent or interest  during the process of a bankruptcy
          proceeding and retain security deposits for the debtors' obligations;

     (iv) our ability to sell closed  assets on a timely basis and at terms that
          allow us to realize the carrying value of these assets;

     (v)  our ability to negotiate appropriate modifications to the terms of our
          credit facilities;

     (vi) our ability to complete the proposed  refinancing  with respect to our
          existing credit facilities;

     (vii)our  ability  to  manage,  re-lease  or sell any  owned  and  operated
          facilities;

     (viii) the availability and cost of capital

     (ix) competition in the financing of healthcare facilities;

     (x)  regulatory and other changes in the healthcare sector

     (xi) the  effect  of  economic  and  market   conditions   generally   and,
          particularly, in the healthcare industry;

     (xii) changes in interest rates;

     (xiii) the amount and yield of any additional investments;

     (xiv)changes in tax laws and regulations  affecting real estate  investment
          trusts; and

     (xv) changes in the ratings of our debt and preferred securities.

OVERVIEW

     As of  December  31,  2003,  our  portfolio  consisted  of  211  healthcare
facilities,  located in 28 states and operated by 39 third-party operators.  Our
gross investment in these facilities, net of impairments, totaled $812.3 million
at  December  31,  2003,  with 97.1% of our real estate  investments  related to
long-term care facilities.  Our portfolio is made up of 151 long-term healthcare
facilities and two  rehabilitation  hospitals owned and leased to third parties,
fixed rate  mortgages  on 51  long-term  healthcare  facilities,  one  long-term
healthcare  facility that was recovered from a customer and was operated through
a  third-party  management  contract  for our  own  account  and  six  long-term
healthcare  facilities  that were  recovered  from  customers  and are currently
closed.  At  December  31,  2003,  we also  held  miscellaneous  investments  of
approximately $29.8 million.

     Nearly all of our properties are used as healthcare facilities;  therefore,
we are directly  affected by the risk associated  with the healthcare  industry.
Our lessees and mortgagors, as well as any facilities owned and operated for our
own account,  derive a substantial  portion of their net operating revenues from
third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These programs
are highly regulated by federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations and
subject to frequent and  substantial  change.  The  Balanced  Budget Act of 1997
("Balanced Budget Act")  significantly  reduced spending levels for the Medicare
and Medicaid  programs.  Due to the  implementation of the terms of the Balanced
Budget Act,  effective July 1, 1998, the majority of skilled nursing  facilities
shifted from payments based on reasonable  cost to a prospective  payment system
for services provided to Medicare  beneficiaries.  Under the prospective payment
system,  skilled nursing facilities are paid on a per diem prospective  case-mix
adjusted  basis for all  covered  services.  Implementation  of the  prospective
payment system has affected each long-term care facility to a different  degree,
depending upon the amount of revenue it derives from Medicare patients.

     Legislation adopted in 1999 and 2000 increased Medicare payments to nursing
facilities and specialty care facilities on an interim basis. Section 101 of the
Balanced Budget Relief Act of 1999 ("Balanced Budget Relief Act") included a 20%
increase for 15 patient acuity categories (known as Resource  Utilization Groups
("RUGS"))  and a 4% across the board  increase of the adjusted  federal per diem
payment rate. The 20% increase was  implemented in April 2000 and will remain in
effect  until the  implementation  of  refinements  in the current RUG  case-mix
classification  system  to more  accurately  estimate  the  cost of  non-therapy
ancillary  services.  The 4% increase was  implemented in April 2000 and expired
October 1, 2002.

     The Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 ("Benefits  Improvement
and Protection  Act") included a 16.7% increase in the nursing  component of the
case-mix  adjusted  federal  periodic payment rate and a 6.7% increase in the 14
RUG  payments  for  rehabilitation  therapy  services.  The 16.7%  increase  was
implemented  in April 2000 and expired  October 1, 2002. The 6.7% increase is an
adjustment  to the 20%  increase  granted in the Balance  Budget  Relief Act and
spreads  the  funds  directed  at three of  those  15 RUGs to an  additional  11
rehabilitation  RUGs. The increase was implemented in April 2001 and will remain
in effect until the  implementation  of  refinements in the current RUG case-mix
classification system.

     The  expiration of the 4% and 16.7%  increases  under these  statutes as of
October 1, 2002 has had an adverse  impact on the  revenues of the  operators of
nursing  facilities  and has  negatively  impacted  some  operators'  ability to
satisfy their monthly lease or debt payments to us. Medicare reimbursement could
be further  reduced  when the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services  ("CMS")
completes its RUG refinement, thereby triggering the sunset of the temporary 20%
and 6.7% increases also established under these statutes.

     On August 4, 2003,  CMS  published  the payment  rates for SNFs for federal
fiscal year 2004  (effective  on October 1, 2003).  CMS  announced  that the SNF
update would be a 3.0%  increase in Medicare  payments  for federal  fiscal year
2004. In addition,  CMS announced that the two temporary payment increases - the
20% and 6.7%  add-ons  for  certain  payment  categories  - will  continue to be
effective for federal fiscal year 2004.

     Also in the August 4, 2003  announcement,  CMS  confirmed  its intention to
incorporate a forecast error  adjustment that takes into account previous years'
update errors.  According to CMS,  there was a cumulative SNF market basket,  or
inflation  adjustment,  forecast  error of 3.26% for federal  fiscal  years 2000
through  2002. As a result,  CMS has  increased the national  payment rate by an
additional 3.26% above the 3.0% increase for federal fiscal year 2004.

     Due to  the  temporary  nature  of  the  20%  and  6.7%  payment  increases
established  under the Balanced  Budget Relief Act and Benefits  Improvement and
Protection Act, we cannot be assured that the federal  reimbursement will remain
at levels  comparable  to  present  levels and that such  reimbursement  will be
sufficient  for our lessees or mortgagors to cover all operating and fixed costs
necessary to care for Medicare and Medicaid patients.  We also cannot be assured
that there will be any future  legislation to increase payment rates for skilled
nursing  facilities.  If payment rates for skilled  nursing  facilities  are not
increased in the future,  some of our lessees and mortgagors may have difficulty
meeting their payment obligations to us.

     In addition, each state has its own Medicaid program that is funded jointly
by the state and federal government.  Federal law governs how each state manages
its  Medicaid  program,  but there is wide  latitude  for  states  to  customize
Medicaid  programs  to fit the  needs  and  resources  of its  citizens.  Rising
Medicaid  costs  and  decreasing  state  revenues  caused  by  current  economic
conditions  have  prompted  an  increasing  number of states to cut or  consider
reductions in Medicaid  funding as a means of balancing their  respective  state
budgets.  Existing and future initiatives  affecting Medicaid  reimbursement may
reduce  utilization of (and reimbursement for) services offered by the operators
of our  properties.  In early 2003,  many states  announced  actual or potential
budget  shortfalls.  As a result of these  budget  shortfalls,  many states have
announced that they are  implementing or considering  implementing  "freezes" or
cuts in Medicaid reimbursement rates, including rates paid to SNF providers,  or
reductions in Medicaid enrollee benefits,  including long-term care benefits. We
cannot  predict  the extent to which  Medicaid  rate  freezes or cuts or benefit
reductions will ultimately be adopted, the number of states that will adopt them
nor the impact of such adoption on our operators.  However,  extensive  Medicaid
rate cuts or freezes or benefit  reductions could have a material adverse effect
on our  operators'  liquidity,  financial  condition and results of  operations,
which could affect adversely their ability to make lease or mortgage payments to
us.

     On May 28, 2003, the federal Jobs and Growth Tax Relief  Reconciliation Act
("Tax Relief Act") was signed into law,  which  included an increase in Medicaid
federal  funding for five fiscal quarters (April 1, 2003 through June 30, 2004).
In addition,  the Tax Relief Act provides state fiscal relief for federal fiscal
years 2003 and 2004 to assist states with funding shortfalls.  It is anticipated
that these temporary  federal funding  provisions  could mitigate state Medicaid
funding reductions through federal fiscal year 2004.

     In  addition,   private  payors,   including   managed  care  payors,   are
increasingly   demanding   discounted  fee  structures  and  the  assumption  by
healthcare  providers of all or a portion of the  financial  risk of operating a
healthcare facility. Efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost
controls are expected to continue.  Any changes in reimbursement  policies which
reduce  reimbursement  levels could adversely affect the revenues of our lessees
and  mortgagors  and thereby  adversely  affect those  lessees' and  mortgagors'
abilities to make their monthly lease or debt payments to us.

     At December 31, 2002, we owned three long-term  healthcare  facilities that
had been recovered from customers and were operated for our own account.  During
2001 and 2002, we  experienced  a significant  increase in nursing home revenues
attributable to the increase in owned and operated  assets.  During 2003,  these
increases  abated  as we  re-leased,  sold  or  closed  all  but  one  of  these
facilities.  In addition,  in connection  with the recovery of these assets,  we
often  fund  working  capital  and  deferred  capital  expenditure  needs  for a
transitional  period until license  transfers and other  regulatory  matters are
completed and reimbursement from third-party payors  recommences.  As of January
1, 2004,  we had sold or re-leased  all of the owned and operated  facilities in
our  portfolio and had six closed  facilities  in our  portfolio Our  management
intends to sell these assets as promptly as possible,  consistent with achieving
valuations that reflect our  management's  estimate of fair value of the assets.
We do not know,  however,  if, or when,  the  dispositions  will be completed or
whether  the  dispositions  will be  completed  on terms that will  enable us to
realize the fair value of such assets.

     The  following  significant  highlights  occurred  during the  twelve-month
period ended December 31, 2003.

     FINANCING

     o    In June  2003,  we  obtained  a $225  million  Senior  Secured  Credit
          Facility  ("Credit  Facility")  to  repay  borrowings  under  our  two
          previous  credit  facilities,   replace  letters  of  credit  and  pay
          cumulative unpaid preferred dividends.

     o    In  December  2003,  we  secured  a  $50  million  acquisition  credit
          facility,  which we believe,  combined  with the $225  million  Credit
          Facility and cash on hand, will provide us the flexibility to initiate
          a growth strategy in 2004.

     DIVIDENDS

     o    In July  2003,  our Board of  Directors  declared a full  catch-up  of
          cumulative,  unpaid dividends and regular quarterly  dividends for all
          classes of preferred  stock and such dividends were paid on August 15,
          2003 to preferred stockholders of record on August 5, 2003.

     o    In September 2003, our Board of Directors  reinstated our common stock
          dividend and a dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock was paid on
          November  17,  2003 to common  stockholders  of record on October  31,
          2003.

     RE-LEASING

     o    In March 2003, we re-leased nine skilled nursing  facilities  ("SNFs")
          formerly  operated  by  Integrated  Health  Services,   Inc.  to  four
          unaffiliated third-party operators.

     o    In July 2003, we amended our Master Lease with a subsidiary of Alterra
          Healthcare  Corporation  ("Alterra")  whereby  the  number  of  leased
          facilities was reduced from eight to five.

     o    In November  2003, we re-leased two SNFs formerly  leased by Claremont
          Healthcare  Holdings,   Inc.   ("Claremont"),   located  in  Ohio  and
          representing 270 beds, to a new operator under a Master Lease.

     o    Throughout 2003, we re-leased 12 SNFs formerly  operated by Sun to six
          unaffiliated third-party operators.

        ASSET SALES

     o    In May 2003,  we sold an investment  in a Baltimore,  Maryland  asset,
          leased by the United States Postal Service ("USPS"), for approximately
          $19.6  million.  The  purchaser  paid us proceeds of $1.8  million and
          assumed the first mortgage of approximately $17.6 million.

     o    In  December  2003,  we sold one SNF  formerly  leased  by  Claremont,
          located in Illinois and  representing  150 beds, for $9.0 million.  We
          received net proceeds of approximately $6.0 million in cash and a $3.0
          million,  five-year,  10.5% secured note for the balance. We also sold
          our investment in Principal  Healthcare  Finance Trust for proceeds of
          approximately $1.6 million.

     o    Throughout 2003, we sold eight closed  facilities and four assets held
          for sale for proceeds of approximately $9.0 million.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities,  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Our significant  accounting  policies are described
in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements.  These policies were
followed in preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for all periods
presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     We have identified six significant accounting policies which we believe are
critical accounting policies.  These critical accounting policies are those that
have the most  impact on the  reporting  of our  financial  condition  and those
requiring  significant  judgments and estimates.  With respect to these critical
accounting policies,  we believe the application of judgments and assessments is
consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the
results of operations  for all periods  presented.  The six critical  accounting
policies are:

REVENUE RECOGNITION

     Rental income and mortgage  interest  income are  recognized as earned over
the terms of the related Master Leases and mortgage  notes,  respectively.  Such
income includes periodic increases based on pre-determined  formulas (i.e., such
as  increases  in the  Consumer  Price  Index  ("CPI")) as defined in the Master
Leases and mortgage loan agreements.  Reserves are taken against earned revenues
from leases and mortgages when collection of amounts due become  questionable or
when  negotiations  for  restructurings  of  troubled  operators  lead to  lower
expectations regarding ultimate collection.  When collection is uncertain, lease
revenues  are recorded as received,  after  taking into account  application  of
security  deposits.  Interest income on impaired mortgage loans is recognized as
received after taking into account application of security deposits.

     Nursing home revenues from owned and operated assets  (primarily  Medicare,
Medicaid and other third-party insurance) are recognized as patient services are
provided.

ASSET IMPAIRMENT

     Management  periodically  but not less  than  annually  evaluates  the real
estate  investments  for  impairment  indicators.  The  judgment  regarding  the
existence  of  impairment   indicators  is  based  on  factors  such  as  market
conditions,   operator  performance  and  legal  structure.   If  indicators  of
impairment are present,  management  evaluates the carrying value of the related
real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the
underlying  facilities.  Provisions for impairment  losses related to long-lived
assets are recognized when expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than
the  carrying  values  of  the  assets.  If  the  sum  of  the  expected  future
undiscounted cash flow,  including sales proceeds,  is less than carrying value,
then an  adjustment is made to the net carrying  value of the leased  properties
and other long-lived assets to the present value of expected future undiscounted
cash flows. The fair value of the real estate investment is determined by market
research, which includes valuing the property as a nursing home as well as other
alternative uses.

LOAN IMPAIRMENT

     Management   periodically   but  not  less  than  annually   evaluates  the
outstanding loans and notes  receivable.  When management  identifies  potential
loan  impairment  indicators,  such as  non-payment  under  the loan  documents,
impairment of the underlying collateral, financial difficulty of the operator or
other  circumstances that may impair full execution of the loan documents,  then
the loan is written down to the present value of the expected future cash flows.
In cases where  expected  future  cash flows  cannot be  estimated,  the loan is
written down to the fair value of the collateral.  The fair value of the loan is
determined by market research,  which includes valuing the property as a nursing
home as well as other alternative uses.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

     Accounts  receivable  consists  primarily  of lease and  mortgage  interest
payments.  Amounts  recorded  include  estimated  provisions for loss related to
uncollectible  accounts and disputed  items.  On a monthly basis,  we review the
contractual  payment  versus  actual cash payment  received and the  contractual
payment  due  date  versus  actual  receipt  date.  When  management  identifies
delinquencies, a judgment is made as to the amount of provision, if any, that is
needed.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE - OWNED AND OPERATED ASSETS

     Accounts  receivable  from owned and operated assets consist of amounts due
from Medicare and Medicaid  programs,  other government  programs,  managed care
health plans,  commercial insurance companies and individual  patients.  Amounts
recorded include estimated provisions for loss related to uncollectible accounts
and disputed items.

OWNED AND OPERATED ASSETS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

     When we acquire real estate  pursuant to a  foreclosure  proceeding,  it is
designated  as "owned and operated  assets" and is recorded at the lower of cost
or  fair  value  and is  included  in  real  estate  properties  on our  audited
consolidated balance sheet. For 2003, operating assets and operating liabilities
for our owned and  operated  properties  are shown on a net basis on the face of
our audited consolidated Balance Sheet. For 2002, operating assets and operating
liabilities for our owned and operated  properties are shown on a gross basis on
the face of our audited consolidated balance sheet and are detailed in Note 16 -
Segment  Information.  The net basis presentation in 2003 is due to the decrease
in the size of the owned and operated  portfolio  (one  facility at December 31,
2003).

     When a formal  plan to sell real  estate is adopted  and we hold a contract
for sale,  the real estate is classified as "assets held for sale," with the net
carrying amount adjusted to the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less cost
of disposal.  Depreciation of the facilities is excluded from  operations  after
management has committed to a plan to sell the asset.  Upon adoption of SFAS 144
as of January 1, 2002,  long-lived  assets sold or  designated  as held for sale
after January 1, 2002 are reported as  discontinued  operations in our financial
statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following is our discussion of the consolidated  results of operations,
financial position and liquidity and capital resources,  which should be read in
conjunction with our audited consolidated  financial statements and accompanying
notes.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002

REVENUES

     Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $86.3 million,  a
decrease of $47.3  million  from 2002  revenues.  When  excluding  nursing  home
revenues of owned and operated assets,  revenues were $86.3 million for the year
ended  December 31, 2003, a decrease of $4.4 million from the  comparable  prior
year period.  The decrease  during the year was primarily the result of operator
restructurings, the sale of our investment in a Baltimore, Maryland asset leased
by the USPS, partially offset by a legal settlement.

        Detail changes in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2003 are
as follows:

     o    Rental  income for the year ended  December  31,  2003  totaled  $65.1
          million, an increase of $2.4 million over 2002 rental income.

     o    Mortgage  interest income for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled
          $14.7 million, decreasing $6.2 million.

     o    Other  investment  income for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled
          $3.0 million, decreasing $2.3 million.

     o    In 2000,  we filed suit against a title  company  (later  adding a law
          firm as a  defendant),  seeking  damages  based on claims of breach of
          contract  and  negligence,  among  other  things,  as a result  of the
          alleged  failure to file certain  Uniform  Commercial  Code  financing
          statements in our favor. We filed a subsequent  suit seeking  recovery
          under  title  insurance  policies  written by the title  company.  The
          defendants denied the allegations made in the lawsuits.  In settlement
          of our claims against the  defendants,  we agreed in the first quarter
          of 2003 to accept a lump sum cash  payment of $3.2  million.  The cash
          proceeds  were offset by related  expenses  incurred  of $1.0  million
          resulting in a net gain of $2.2 million.

     We believe that the  presentation  of our revenues and expenses,  excluding
nursing  home  owned and  operated  assets,  provides  a useful  measure  of the
operating  performance of our core portfolio as a real estate  investment  trust
("REIT")  in view of the  disposition  of all but one of our owned and  operated
assets as of December 31, 2003.

EXPENSES

     Our expenses for the year ended  December 31, 2003 totaled  $63.6  million,
decreasing  approximately  $76.3 million from expenses of $139.9  million during
2002.  When  excluding  nursing  home  expenses  of owned and  operated  assets,
expenses were $62.1 million for the year ended  December 31, 2003, a decrease of
$14.0 million from the  comparable  prior year period.  The decrease  during the
year was primarily the result of $4.0 million of lower  interest  expense,  $0.9
million favorable  reduction in general and  administrative  and legal expenses,
$8.8 million favorable reduction in provision for uncollectible mortgages, notes
and accounts receivable, off set by an increase of $5.2 million in provision for
impairment and $0.9 million in adjustments of derivatives to fair value.

     Our nursing  home  expenses,  net of nursing home  revenues,  for owned and
operated assets decreased to $19.4 million from $20.9 million in 2002 due to the
releasing efforts,  sales and/or closures during the year. In 2002, nursing home
expenses included a $5.9 million provision for uncollectible accounts receivable
and $4.3 million of expenses related to leasehold buy outs.

     Effective  January 1, 2004,  our  remaining  owned and  operated  asset was
re-leased to an existing  operator.  This  facility,  located in  Illinois,  was
re-leased under a new Master Lease which encompasses four additional facilities.

     An analysis of significant  changes in our expenses  during the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002 is as follows:

     o    Our general and administrative  expenses for 2003 totaled $5.9 million
          as compared to $6.3 million for 2002, a decrease of $0.4 million.  The
          decrease is due to lower consulting  costs,  primarily  related to the
          owned and  operated  facilities  and cost  reductions  due to  reduced
          staffing, travel and other employee-related expenses.

     o    Our legal  expenses  for 2003 totaled $2.3 million as compared to $2.9
          million in 2002. The decrease is largely  attributable  to a reduction
          of legal costs  associated with our owned and operated  facilities due
          to the  releasing  efforts,  sales  and/or  closures  of 32 owned  and
          operated assets since December 31, 2001.

     o    Our  interest  expense  for the  year  ended  December  31,  2003  was
          approximately $23.4 million, compared with $27.4 million for 2002. The
          decrease  in 2003 is due to lower  average  borrowings  on our  credit
          facilities as well as the impact of our current year  refinancings and
          the  payoff in 2002 of $97.5  million of 6.95%  Notes that  matured in
          June 2002.

     o    In 2002, we recognized a $7.0 million  refinancing  expense as we were
          unable to  complete a planned  commercial  mortgage-backed  securities
          transaction  due  to  the  impact  on  our  operators  resulting  from
          reductions  in Medicare  reimbursement  and concerns  about  potential
          Medicaid rate reductions.

     o    Provisions  for  impairment  of $8.9  million  and  $3.7  million  are
          included  in  expenses  for  2003  and  2002,  respectively.  The 2003
          provision  of $8.9  million  was to reduce the  carrying  value of two
          closed  facilities to their fair value less cost to dispose.  The 2002
          provision of $3.7 million  reduced the carrying  value of three closed
          facilities to their fair value less cost to dispose.

     o    We recognized a provision for loss on uncollectible  mortgages,  notes
          and  accounts  receivable  of $8.8  million  in  2002.  The  provision
          included $4.9 million  associated  with the write down of two mortgage
          loans  to  bankrupt   operators  and  $3.5  million   related  to  the
          restructuring  of debt owed by Madison/OHI  Liquidity  Investors,  LLC
          ("Madison") as part of the compromise and settlement of a lawsuit with
          Madison. (See Note 14 - Litigation).  The 2002 provision also included
          $0.4 million to adjust  accounts  receivable  to their net  realizable
          value.

     o    During 2002,  we recorded a non-cash  gain of $0.9 million  related to
          the  maturity  and payoff of two  interest  rate swaps with a notional
          amount of $32.0 million each.

OTHER

     During 2003, we recognized a gain on assets sold of $0.7 million, primarily
a result of the following transactions:

     o    The sale of our investment in a Baltimore,  Maryland asset,  leased by
          the USPS,  for  approximately  $19.6  million.  The purchaser  paid us
          proceeds  of  $1.8   million   and  assumed  the  first   mortgage  of
          approximately  $17.6 million.  As a result, we recorded a gain of $1.3
          million, net of closing costs and other expenses.

     o    The sale of four closed  buildings,  which were  classified  as assets
          held  for  sale in  2001,  in four  separate  transactions,  realizing
          proceeds,  net of closing costs,  of $2.0 million,  resulting in a net
          loss of approximately $0.7 million.

     o    The sale of our  investment  in  Principal  Healthcare  Finance  Trust
          realizing  proceeds  of  approximately  $1.6  million,  net of closing
          costs, resulting in an accounting gain of approximately $0.1 million

LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

     Discontinued  operations  relates to properties we disposed of in 2003 that
are accounted  for as  discontinued  operations  under SFAS No. 144. The loss of
$0.3 million in 2003 versus the loss of $10.9  million in 2002 was primarily due
to provisions  for  impairment  of $11.7 million on seven  facilities in 2002 as
compared to none in 2003.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

     Our funds from operations  ("FFO") for the year ended December 31, 2003, on
a diluted basis was $35.0 million, an increase of $41.5 million as compared to a
deficit of $6.5  million  for 2002 due to factors  mentioned  above.  Funds from
operations is net earnings available to common stockholders, excluding any gains
or losses from debt  restructuring and the effects of asset  dispositions,  plus
depreciation and amortization  associated with real estate investments.  Diluted
funds  from  operations  is the lower of funds  from  operations  and funds from
operations  adjusted for the assumed  conversion of Series C preferred stock and
the exercise of in-the-money stock options. We consider funds from operations to
be one  performance  measure  which  is  helpful  to  investors  of real  estate
companies because,  along with cash flows from operating  activities,  financing
activities and investing  activities,  it provides investors an understanding of
our  ability  to incur and  service  debt and to make  expenditures.  Funds from
operations in and of itself does not represent  cash  generated  from  operating
activities  in accordance  with GAAP and  therefore  should not be considered an
alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance, or to net
cash flow from operating  activities as determined by GAAP in the United States,
as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to
fund cash needs.

     In October 2003, the National  Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts
("NAREIT")  informed  its member  companies  that the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission  ("SEC") has taken the position that asset impairment  charges should
not be excluded in calculating FFO. The SEC's  interpretation  is that recurring
impairments  on real property are not an appropriate  adjustment.  In the tables
below, we have applied the SEC's  interpretation  of FFO and have not added back
asset impairment  charges.  As a result, our basic FFO and diluted FFO set forth
in the tables below are not comparable to similar measures  reported in previous
disclosures.

     The following table presents our FFO results reflecting the impact of asset
impairment charges (the SEC's  interpretation)  for the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002:

     $0.4  million  and  $0.7  million,  respectively,   related  to  facilities

TAXES

     No provision  for federal  income taxes has been made since we qualify as a
REIT under the  provisions  of Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal  Revenue
Code of 1986,  as  amended.  For tax year 2003,  preferred  and common  dividend
payments  of  $65.5  million  made   throughout   2003  satisfy  the  2003  REIT
requirements  (must  distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable  income for the
taxable year and meet certain other conditions).

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001

REVENUES

     Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled $133.6 million, a
decrease of $116.5 million from 2001 revenues.  Excluding  nursing home revenues
of owned and operated  assets,  revenues  were $90.7  million for the year ended
December 31, 2002,  an increase of $2.6 million from the  comparable  prior year
period.

     Detail  changes in revenues  during the year ended December 31, 2002 are as
follows:

     o    Our rental  income for the year ended  December 31, 2002 totaled $62.7
          million,  an increase of $2.6  million  from 2001 rental  income.  The
          increase is due to $8.0 million  from new leases on assets  previously
          classified as owned and operated and $0.9 million of contractual  rent
          increases on the existing portfolio. This increase is partially offset
          by a  reduction  of  revenues  of $6.3  million  due to  bankruptcies,
          restructurings and other.

     o    Our  mortgage  interest  income for the year ended  December  31, 2002
          totaled  $20.9  million,  increasing  $0.4 million over 2001  mortgage
          interest.  The  increase is due to $1.1  million  for new  investments
          placed during 2001 and receipt in 2002 of $1.6 million of interest due
          in 2001 and not received until 2002, offset by $1.5 million from loans
          paid off, $0.7 million due to restructurings and bankruptcies and $0.1
          million due to normal amortization of the portfolio.

     o    Our nursing home  revenues of owned and  operated  assets for the year
          ended  December  31, 2002 totaled  $42.9  million,  decreasing  $119.1
          million over 2001 nursing home  revenues.  This decrease is due to the
          re-leasing, sale and/or closure of 30 assets in 2002.

EXPENSES

     Our expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled  $139.9  million,
decreasing  approximately  $125.1  million over  expenses of $265.0  million for
2001.

     Our nursing home expenses for owned and operated assets  decreased to $63.8
million from $169.9 million in 2001 due to the  re-leasing,  sale and/or closure
of 30 owned and operated assets during the year. In 2002,  nursing home expenses
included a $5.9 million provision for uncollectible accounts receivable and $4.3
million of expenses related to leasehold buy outs. Nursing home expenses in 2001
included a $7.3 million provision for uncollectible accounts receivable.

     An analysis of significant  changes in our expenses  during the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001 is as follows:

     o    Our general and administrative  expenses for 2002 totaled $6.3 million
          as compared to $10.4 million for 2001, a decrease of $4.1 million. The
          decrease is due to lower consulting  costs,  primarily  related to the
          owned and  operated  facilities  and cost  reductions  due to  reduced
          staffing, travel and other employee-related expenses.

     o    Our legal  expenses  for 2002 totaled $2.9 million as compared to $4.3
          million in 2001. The decrease is largely  attributable  to a reduction
          of legal costs  associated with our owned and operated  facilities due
          to the re-leasing, sale and/or closure of 30 owned and operated assets
          during 2002.

     o    Depreciation  and amortization of real estate totaled $20.5 million in
          2002,  decreasing  $0.8  million  from  2001.  The  decrease  consists
          primarily  of $0.4  million  of  leasehold  amortization  expense  for
          leaseholds  written down in 2001 or sold in 2002 and $0.6 million from
          properties sold,  impaired or reclassified to held for sale, offset by
          $0.2 million from properties previously classified as mortgages.

     o    Our  interest  expense  for the  year  ended  December  31,  2002  was
          approximately $27.4 million, compared with $33.2 million for 2001. The
          decrease in 2002 is due to the payoff of $97.5  million of 6.95% Notes
          that matured in June 2002 and lower  average  borrowings on our credit
          facilities.

     o    In 2002, we recognized a $7.0 million  refinancing  expense as we were
          unable to  complete a planned  commercial  mortgage-backed  securities
          transaction  due  to  the  impact  on  our  operators  resulting  from
          reductions  in Medicare  reimbursement  and concerns  about  potential
          Medicaid rate reductions.

     o    Provisions  for  impairment  of $3.7  million  and  $8.1  million  are
          included  in  expenses  for  2002  and  2001,  respectively.  The 2002
          provision of $3.7 million  reduced the carrying  value of three closed
          facilities  to  their  fair  value  less  cost to  dispose.  The  2001
          provision  of  $8.1  million  related  to  facilities  recovered  from
          operators  and  classified  as held for sale assets to fair value less
          cost to dispose.

     o    We recognized a provision for loss on uncollectible  mortgages,  notes
          and  accounts  receivable  of $8.8  million  in 2002.  The  provisions
          included $4.9 million  associated  with the write down of two mortgage
          loans  to  bankrupt   operators  and  $3.5  million   related  to  the
          restructuring  of debt owed by Madison/OHI  Liquidity  Investors,  LLC
          ("Madison") as part of the compromise and settlement of a lawsuit with
          Madison.  (See  Note  14 -  Litigation  to  our  audited  consolidated
          financial statements).  The 2002 provisions also included $0.4 million
          to adjust accounts  receivable to their net realizable value. In 2001,
          we  recognized  a provision  for  uncollectible  mortgages,  notes and
          accounts  receivable  of $0.7 million to adjust the carrying  value of
          accounts receivable to net realizable value.

     o    In 2001, we recorded a $5.1 million charge for  severance,  moving and
          consulting  agreement costs. This charge was comprised of $4.6 million
          for  relocation  of our  corporate  headquarters  and $0.5 million for
          consulting and severance payments to a former executive.

     o    In 2001, we recorded a $10 million  litigation  settlement to settle a
          suit  brought by  Karrington  Health,  Inc. in 1998.  This settled all
          claims  arising  from the  suit,  but  without  our  admission  of any
          liability or fault, which liability is expressly denied.  Based on the
          settlement, the suit was dismissed with prejudice.

     o    During 2002,  we recorded a non-cash  gain of $0.9 million  related to
          the  maturity  and payoff of two  interest  rate swaps with a notional
          amount of $32.0 million  each.  We recorded a non-cash  charge of $1.3
          million for 2001  related to the  adoption of  Statement  of Financial
          Account   Standard   ("SFAS")  No.  133,   Accounting  for  Derivative
          Instruments and Hedging Activities.

OTHER

     During 2002, we recognized a gain on assets sold of $2.5 million, primarily
a result of the following transactions.

     o    The sale of our  investment in Omega  Worldwide,  Inc.  ("Worldwide").
          Pursuant to a tender offer by Four Seasons  Health Care Limited ("Four
          Seasons")  for  all of the  outstanding  shares  of  common  stock  of
          Worldwide,  we sold our  investment,  which  consisted  of 1.2 million
          shares of common stock and 260,000 shares of preferred  stock, to Four
          Seasons for cash  proceeds of  approximately  $7.4 million  (including
          $3.5 million for preferred  stock  liquidation  preference and accrued
          preferred dividends).

     o    The sale of our investment in Principal Healthcare Finance Limited, an
          Isle of Jersey company  ("PHFL"),  which consisted of 990,000 ordinary
          shares  and  warrants  to  purchase  185,033  ordinary  shares,  to an
          affiliate of Four Seasons for cash proceeds of $2.8 million.

     o    In addition,  we sold  certain  other  assets in 2002  realizing  cash
          proceeds of $7.5 million,  resulting in a net accounting  gain of $0.3
          million.

LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

     Discontinued  operations  relates to properties we disposed of in 2003 that
are accounted  for as  discontinued  operations  under SFAS No. 144. The loss of
$10.9  million in 2002 versus the loss of $1.1 million in 2001 was primarily due
to provisions  for  impairment  of $11.7 million on seven  facilities in 2002 as
compared to $1.5 million on one facility in 2001.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

     Our FFO for the year ended  December  31,  2002,  on a diluted  basis was a
deficit of $6.5 million,  an increase in the deficit of $4.3 million as compared
to a deficit of $2.2 million for 2001 due to factors mentioned above. Funds from
operations is net earnings available to common stockholders, excluding any gains
or losses from debt  restructuring and the effects of asset  dispositions,  plus
depreciation and amortization  associated with real estate investments.  Diluted
funds  from  operations  is the lower of funds  from  operations  and funds from
operations  adjusted for the assumed  conversion of Series C preferred stock and
the exercise of in-the-money stock options. We consider funds from operations to
be one  performance  measure  which  is  helpful  to  investors  of real  estate
companies because,  along with cash flows from operating  activities,  financing
activities and investing  activities,  it provides investors an understanding of
our  ability  to incur and  service  debt and to make  expenditures.  Funds from
operations in and of itself does not represent  cash  generated  from  operating
activities  in accordance  with GAAP and  therefore  should not be considered an
alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance, or to net
cash flow from operating  activities as determined by GAAP in the United States,
as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to
fund cash needs.

     In October  2003,  NAREIT  informed its member  companies  that the SEC has
taken the  position  that asset  impairment  charges  should not be  excluded in
calculating FFO. The SEC's interpretation is that recurring  impairments on real
property are not an appropriate adjustment. In the tables below, we have applied
the  SEC's  interpretation  of FFO and  have not  added  back  asset  impairment
charges.  As a result,  our basic FFO and  diluted  FFO set forth in the  tables
below are not comparable to similar measures reported in previous disclosures.

     The following table presents our FFO results reflecting the impact of asset
impairment charges (the SEC's  interpretation)  for the years ended December 31,
2002 and 2001:

(1)  The add back of  depreciation  and  amortization  includes  the  facilities
     classified  as  discontinued   operations  in  our  consolidated  financial
     statements.  The 2002 and 2001 includes  depreciation  and  amortization of
     $0.7  million  and  $0.8  million,  respectively,   related  to  facilities
     classified as discontinued operations.

PORTFOLIO DEVELOPMENTS

     The  partial  expiration  of certain  Medicare  rate  increases  has had an
adverse  impact on the revenues of the operators of nursing home  facilities and
has negatively  impacted some operators'  ability to satisfy their monthly lease
or debt payment to us. In several  instances we hold security  deposits that can
be  applied  in the  event of lease and loan  defaults,  subject  to  applicable
limitations  under bankruptcy law with respect to operators  seeking  protection
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy  Act. (See Item 1 - Business of the Company -
Overview).

ALTERRA HEALTHCARE CORPORATION

     Alterra  announced  during  the first  quarter of 2003,  that,  in order to
facilitate and complete its on-going restructuring initiatives, they had filed a
voluntary  petition with the U.S.  Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware
to  reorganize  under Chapter 11 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code. At that time, we
leased eight assisted  living  facilities (325 units) located in seven states to
subsidiaries of Alterra.

     Effective  July 7, 2003,  we amended our Master Lease with a subsidiary  of
Alterra whereby the number of leased  facilities was reduced from eight to five.
The amended Master Lease has a remaining term of approximately ten years with an
annual rent requirement of approximately $1.5 million. This compares to the 2002
annualized  revenue of $2.6  million.  On November  1, 2003,  we  re-leased  one
assisted living facility  formerly leased by Alterra,  located in Washington and
representing 52 beds, to a new operator under a lease, which has a ten-year term
and has an initial  annual lease rate of $0.2 million.  We are in the process of
negotiating  terms  and  conditions  for  the  re-lease  of  the  remaining  two
properties. In the interim, Alterra will continue to operate the two facilities.
The  Amended  Master  Lease was  approved  by the U.S.  Bankruptcy  Court in the
District of Delaware.

CLAREMONT HEALTHCARE HOLDINGS, INC.

     Effective  December 1, 2003, we sold one SNF formerly  leased by Claremont,
located in Illinois and representing 150 beds, for $9.0 million. We received net
proceeds of  approximately  $6.0 million in cash and a $3.0 million,  five-year,
10.5%  secured note for the  balance.  This  transaction  results in a non-cash,
non-FFO accounting loss of approximately $3.8 million, which was recorded in the
fourth quarter of 2003.

     On November 7, 2003, we re-leased  two SNFs  formerly  leased by Claremont,
located in Ohio and  representing  270 beds,  to a new  operator  under a Master
Lease,  which has a ten-year  term and has an initial  annual lease rate of $1.1
million.

     Separately,   we  continue  our  ongoing  restructuring   discussions  with
Claremont  regarding the five facilities  Claremont currently leases from us. At
the time of this  filing,  we cannot  determine  the  timing or outcome of these
discussions.  Claremont failed to pay base rent due during the fourth quarter of
2003 in the  amount of $1.5  million.  During the  fourth  quarter  of 2003,  we
applied security  deposits in the amount of $1.0 million to pay Claremont's rent
payments  and the Company  demanded  that  Claremont  restore  the $1.5  million
security deposit.  At December 31, 2003, we had no additional  security deposits
with Claremont.  Due to the significant uncertainty of collection,  we recognize
revenue from Claremont on a cash-basis as it is received.

SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC.

     On February 7, 2003, Sun announced  "that it has opened  dialogue with many
of its  landlords  concerning  the  portfolio  of  properties  leased to Sun and
various of its  consolidated  subsidiaries  (collectively,  the 'Company').  The
Company is seeking a rent  moratorium  and/or rent  concessions  with respect to
certain of its facilities and is seeking to transition its operations of certain
facilities  to new  operators  while  retaining  others."  To this end,  Sun has
initiated  conversations  with us  regarding a  restructure  of our lease.  As a
result,  during  2003,  we  re-leased  12 SNFs,  formerly  leased by Sun, in the
following transactions:

     o    On July 1, 2003, we re-leased  one SNF in Louisiana  and  representing
          131 beds, to an existing  operator  under a Master Lease,  which lease
          has an  eight-year  term and requires an initial  annual lease rate of
          $400,000;

     o    On  July  1,  2003,  we  re-leased  two  SNFs  located  in  Texas  and
          representing  256 beds, to an existing  operator under a Master Lease,
          which has a  ten-year  term and has an  initial  annual  lease rate of
          $800,000;

     o    On July 1,  2003,  we  re-leased  two  SNFs  located  in  Florida  and
          representing  350 beds, to an existing  operator under a Master Lease,
          which has a ten-year term and has an initial annual lease rate of $1.3
          million;

     o    On October 1, 2003, we re-leased  three SNFs located in California and
          representing  271 beds, to a new operator under a Master Lease,  which
          has a  15-year  term and has an  initial  annual  lease  rate of $1.25
          million;

     o    On November 1, 2003, we re-leased  two SNFs located in California  and
          representing  185 beds, to a new operator under a Master Lease,  which
          has a  ten-year  term and has an  initial  annual  lease  rate of $0.6
          million;

     o    On December 1, 2003, we re-leased  one SNF located in  California  and
          representing  59 beds,  to a new operator  under a lease,  which has a
          ten-year term and has an initial  annual lease rate of $0.12  million;
          and

     o    On  December  1, 2003,  we  re-leased  one SNF  located in Indiana and
          representing 99 beds, to an existing operator under a lease, which has
          a five-year term.

     As a  result  of the  above-mentioned  transitions  of the  12  former  Sun
facilities, Sun operated 38 of our facilities at December 31, 2003.

     Effective  January 1, 2004, we re-leased four SNFs to an existing  operator
under a new Master Lease,  which has a five-year  term and has an initial annual
lease rate of $0.75  million.  Three  SNFs  formerly  leased by Sun,  located in
Illinois, representing 350 total beds, were part of this transaction. The fourth
SNF in the transaction, located in Illinois, representing 128 beds, was the last
remaining owned and operated facility in our portfolio. A fifth facility, leased
in December 2003, was incorporated in this Master Lease.

     On January 26, 2004, we announced  the signing of a non-binding  term sheet
representing an agreement in principle with Sun regarding properties we own that
were leased to various affiliates of Sun prior to the impact of the transactions
above.  Under the arrangement  contemplated by the non-binding  term sheet,  Sun
would  continue  to  operate  and  occupy 23  long-term  care  facilities,  five
behavioral properties and two hospital properties.  One property in the State of
Washington,  formerly  operated by a Sun affiliate,  has already been closed and
the lease  relating to that  property  will be  terminated.  With respect to the
remaining 20 facilities,  15 have already been transitioned to new operators and
five are in the process of being transferred to new operators.

     The  non-binding  term sheet  contemplates  execution and delivery of a new
master lease with the following  general  terms:

     o    Term: Through December 31, 2013.

     o    Base Rent:  Commencing  February 1, 2004,  monthly  base rent would be
          $1.56  million,  subject to annual  increases  not to exceed  2.5% per
          year.

     o    Deferred Base Rent:  $7.76 million would be deferred and bear interest
          at a floating rate with a floor of 6% per year.  That  interest  would
          accrue  but  would not be  payable  to us  through  January  3,  2008.
          Interest  thereafter  accruing would be paid monthly. We are releasing
          all other claims for base rent which  otherwise would be due under the
          current leases.

     o    Conversion  of Deferred Base Rent: We would have the right at any time
          to convert the deferred base rent into 800,000  shares of Sun's common
          stock, subject to certain non-dilution provisions and the right of Sun
          to pay cash in an amount  equal to the value of that  stock in lieu of
          issuing stock to Omega.  If the value of the common stock exceeds 140%
          of the  deferred  base rent,  Sun can  require  Omega to  convert  the
          deferred base rent into Sun's common stock. We would have the right to
          require Sun to prepare and file a registration statement to facilitate
          resale of the Sun stock.


     The terms  described  above are subject to the negotiation and execution of
definitive  documents  satisfactory to us and Sun.  Separately,  we continue our
ongoing  restructuring  discussions  with Sun. We cannot determine the timing or
outcome  of  these  discussions  at the  time of this  filing.  There  can be no
assurance that Sun will continue to pay rent at the current level,  although, we
believe  that  alternative  operators  would  be  available  to lease or buy the
remaining Sun facilities if an appropriate agreement is not completed with Sun.

ASSET DISPOSITIONS IN 2003

OTHER ASSETS

     o    We sold an investment in a Baltimore,  Maryland  asset,  leased by the
          USPS, for  approximately  $19.6  million.  The purchaser paid us gross
          proceeds  of  $1.8   million   and  assumed  the  first   mortgage  of
          approximately  $17.6 million.  As a result, we recorded a gain of $1.3
          million,  net of  closing  costs  and  other  expenses.  (See Note 3 -
          Properties; Other Non-Core Assets).

     o    We sold our investment in Principal Healthcare Finance Trust realizing
          proceeds  of  approximately  $1.6  million,   net  of  closing  costs,
          resulting in an accounting gain of  approximately  $0.1 million.  (See
          Note 3 - Properties; Other Non-Core Assets).

CLOSED FACILITIES

     o    We sold eight closed  facilities  realizing  proceeds of approximately
          $7.0  million,  net of  closing  costs,  resulting  in a net  gain  of
          approximately $3.0 million.  In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the $3.0
          million  realized net gain is  reflected  in our audited  consolidated
          statements  of operations as  discontinued  operations.  (See Note 3 -
          Properties; Closed Facilities and Note 19 - Discontinued Operations).

ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

     o    We sold the four remaining facilities, which were classified as assets
          held for sale in 2001,  realizing  proceeds  of $2.0  million,  net of
          closing costs,  resulting in a net loss of approximately $0.7 million.
          (See Note 3 - Properties; Assets Held for Sale).

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     At December 31, 2003, we had total assets of $725.1  million,  stockholders
equity of $436.2  million and  long-term  debt of $280.6  million,  representing
approximately  39.1% of total  capitalization.  In addition,  as of December 31,
2003,  we had an aggregate of $2.3  million of scheduled  principal  payments in
2004.

     The  following   table  shows  the  amounts  due  in  connection  with  the
contractual obligations described below as of December 31, 2003.

</TABLE>
     (1)  The $276.3  million  includes  the $100.0  million  6.95% Note,  which
          matures in August 2007, and the $170.1 million of credit  facility and
          term  loan  borrowings,   which  mature  in  June  2007.  BANK  CREDIT
          AGREEMENTS

     We have two secured credit facilities totaling $275 million,  consisting of
a $225 million  Senior  Secured  Credit  Facility and a $50 million  acquisition
credit facility  ("Acquisition  Line"). At December 31, 2003, $177.1 million was
outstanding  under the Credit  Facility  and $12.1  million was utilized for the
issuance of letters of credit, leaving availability of $85.0 million. The $177.1
million of outstanding  borrowings had an interest rate of 6.00% at December 31,
2003; however, no funds have been drawn under the Acquisition Line. In addition,
during 2003, we paid off four  Industrial  Revenue  Bonds  totaling $7.8 million
with a fixed blended rate of approximately 9.66%.

     In 2003,  we  completed  the $225  million  Credit  Facility  arranged  and
syndicated by GE Healthcare  Financial  Services,  with General Electric Capital
Corporation  ("GECC") as agent and lender.  At the closing,  we borrowed  $187.1
million  under the Credit  Facility to repay  borrowings  under our two previous
credit  facilities and replace  letters of credit  totaling  $12.5  million.  In
addition,  proceeds  from the loan were  permitted to be used to pay  cumulative
unpaid preferred dividends and for general corporate purposes.

     The Credit  Facility  includes a $125 million term loan ("Term Loan") and a
$100  million  revolving  line  of  credit  ("Revolver")  collateralized  by our
interests  in 121  facilities  representing  approximately  half of our invested
assets. In addition, we are the guarantor of our subsidiaries' obligations under
the  Credit  Facility  and have  pledged  to the  lenders  the  shares  of these
subsidiaries.  Both the Term Loan and Revolver have a four-year  maturity with a
one-year extension at our option. The Term Loan amortizes on a 25-year basis and
is priced at London  Interbank  Offered Rate  ("LIBOR")  plus a spread of 3.75%,
with a floor of 6.00%. The Revolver is also priced at LIBOR plus a 3.75% spread,
with a 6.00% floor.

     Borrowings  under our old $160.0 million  secured  revolving line of credit
facility  of $112.0  million  were paid in full upon the  closing  of the Credit
Facility and the  agreements  were  terminated.  Additionally,  $12.5 million of
letters of credit  previously  outstanding  against  this credit  facility  were
reissued  under the new  Credit  Facility.  LIBOR-based  borrowings  under  this
previous credit facility had a  weighted-average  interest rate of approximately
4.5% at the payoff date.

     Borrowings under our old $65.0 million line of credit  facility,  which was
fully  drawn,  were  paid in full  upon  the  closing  of our  Credit  Facility.
LIBOR-based   borrowings   under   this   previous   credit   facility   had   a
weighted-average interest rate of approximately 4.6% at the payoff date.

     As a result of the new Credit Facility,  for the twelve-month  period ended
December  31,  2003,  our  interest  expense  includes  $2.6 million of non-cash
interest  expense  (financing  costs)  related  to the  termination  of our  two
previous credit facilities mentioned above.

     In  December  2003,  we  closed  on  a  four-year,  $50  million  revolving
acquisition  line of credit arranged by GE Healthcare  Financial  Services.  The
Acquisition  Line will be  secured  by first  liens on  facilities  acquired  or
assignments  of mortgages made on new  acquisitions.  The interest rate of LIBOR
plus  3.75%  with a 6% floor on the  revolving  acquisition  line of  credit  is
identical to our existing Credit Facility.

     We are required to meet certain  property  level  financial  covenants  and
corporate  financial  covenants,  including  prescribed  leverage,  fixed charge
coverage,   minimum  net  worth,   limitation  on  additional  indebtedness  and
limitations on dividend payout on our long-term borrowings. We are also required
to fix a certain portion of our interest rate. We utilize  interest rate caps to
fix  interest  rates on  variable  rate debt and  reduce  certain  exposures  to
interest rate fluctuations. (See Note 9 - Financial Instruments).

DIVIDENDS

     In order to qualify as a REIT,  we are  required  to  distribute  dividends
(other than capital gain  dividends) to our  stockholders  in an amount at least
equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our "REIT taxable income"  (computed  without
regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of
the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (B) the sum
of certain items of non-cash income. In addition,  if we dispose of any built-in
gain asset during a  recognition  period,  we will be required to  distribute at
least  90%  of  the  built-in  gain  (after  tax),  if  any,  recognized  on the
disposition of such asset. Such  distributions  must be paid in the taxable year
to which they relate,  or in the  following  taxable year if declared  before we
timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular
dividend payment after such  declaration.  In addition,  such  distributions are
required  to be made  pro  rata,  with no  preference  to any  share of stock as
compared  with other  shares of the same class,  and with no  preference  to one
class of stock as compared  with  another  class  except to the extent that such
class is entitled to such a preference.  To the extent that we do not distribute
all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of
our "REIT  taxable  income," as  adjusted,  we will be subject to tax thereon at
regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates.

     On  February  1,  2001,  we  announced  the  suspension  of all  common and
preferred  dividends.  Prior to  recommencing  the payment of  dividends  on our
common  stock,  all  accrued  and  unpaid  dividends  on our  Series  A, B and C
preferred  stock  must  be  paid in  full.  Due to our  2002  taxable  loss,  no
distribution was necessary to maintain our REIT status for 2002.

     In  September  2003,  our Board of  Directors  reinstated  our common stock
dividend that was paid on November 17, 2003 to common  stockholders of record on
October 31, 2003 in the amount of $0.15 per common  share.  Total  common  stock
cash  dividends  were  approximately  $5.6  million for the twelve  months ended
December 31, 2003.

     In  addition,  our  Board  of  Directors  declared  its  regular  quarterly
dividends for all classes of preferred  stock that was paid on November 17, 2003
to preferred  stockholders of record on October 31, 2003.  Series A and Series B
preferred  stockholders of record on October 31, 2003 were paid dividends in the
amount of approximately $0.578 and $0.539 per preferred share, respectively,  on
November  17, 2003.  Our Series C preferred  stockholder  was paid  dividends of
$2.50 per  Series C  preferred  share on  November  17,  2003.  The  liquidation
preference  for our  Series A, B and C  preferred  stock is  $25.00,  $25.00 and
$100.00  per  share,  respectively.   Regular  quarterly  dividends  represented
dividends  for the  period  August 1,  2003  through  October  31,  2003.  Total
preferred  cash  dividend  payments for all classes of preferred  stock  totaled
approximately $59.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003.

     In  July  2003,  our  Board  of  Directors  declared  a  full  catch-up  of
cumulative,  unpaid  dividends  for all  classes  of  preferred  stock  and such
dividends  were paid on August 15, 2003 to preferred  stockholders  of record on
August 5,  2003.  In  addition,  our Board of  Directors  declared  the  regular
quarterly  dividend  for all  classes of  preferred  stock that also was paid on
August 15, 2003 to preferred  stockholders of record on August 5, 2003. Series A
and  Series B  preferred  stockholders  of  record  on  August 5, 2003 were paid
dividends in the amount of  approximately  $6.36 and $5.93 per preferred  share,
respectively,  on August 15, 2003. Our Series C preferred  stockholder  was paid
dividends  of  approximately  $27.31 per Series C preferred  share on August 15,
2003.

LIQUIDITY

     We  believe  our  liquidity  and  various  sources  of  available  capital,
including  funds from  operations,  our existing  availability  under our Credit
Facility and expected  proceeds from planned asset sales are adequate to finance
operations, meet recurring debt service requirements and fund future investments
through the next twelve months.

SERIES D PREFERRED OFFERING; SERIES C PREFERRED REPURCHASE AND CONVERSION

     On February 5, 2004, we entered into a Repurchase and Conversion  Agreement
with Explorer Holdings,  L.P. ("Explorer") pursuant to which Explorer granted us
an option to  repurchase  up to 700,000  shares of Series C  preferred  stock at
$145.92 per share (or $9.12 per share of common stock on an as converted basis),
provided  we  purchased a minimum of $100  million on or prior to  February  27,
2004.  Explorer also agreed to convert all of its  remaining  shares of Series C
preferred  stock into shares of our common stock upon exercise of the repurchase
option.  At the  time  Explorer  entered  into  the  Repurchase  and  Conversion
Agreement,  Explorer held all of our outstanding Series C preferred stock, which
had an aggregate liquidation preference of $104,842,000,  and was convertible at
the holder's  option into our common  stock at a  conversion  price of $6.25 per
share.

     On February 10, 2004, we sold in a registered  direct  placement  4,739,500
shares of our 8.375% Series D cumulative  redeemable  preferred stock at $25 per
share  for net  proceeds,  after  fees and  expenses,  of  approximately  $114.9
million.  The Series D preferred stock may be redeemed at par at our election on
or after the fifth anniversary of the original issue date. These securities rank
pari  passu  with  the  Series  A and  Series  B  preferred  stock  and  are not
convertible into any other Omega securities. The Series D preferred stock has no
stated  maturity  and  will  not be  subject  to a  sinking  fund  or  mandatory
redemption.

     We used  approximately  $102.1  million of the net proceeds of the Series D
preferred  stock  offering to  repurchase  700,000  shares of Series C preferred
stock from Explorer as of February 10, 2004 pursuant to the  repurchase  option.
In connection with the  transaction,  Explorer  converted its remaining  348,420
shares of Series C preferred stock into 5,574,720 shares of common stock.

     As a result of the offering of Series D preferred stock, the application of
$102.1  million of the net proceeds  received to  repurchase  700,000  shares of
Series C preferred, and the conversion of the remaining Series C preferred stock
into shares of our common stock, (i) no Series C preferred stock is outstanding,
and we plan to re-classify the remaining authorized shares of Series C preferred
stock as authorized  but unissued  preferred  stock,  without  designation as to
class;  (ii)  4,739,500  shares of our  8.375%  Series D  cumulative  redeemable
preferred stock, with an aggregate liquidation preference of $118,487,500,  have
been issued;  and (iii)  Explorer  holds,  as of February  20, 2004,  18,118,246
shares of our common stock, representing  approximately 41.5% of our outstanding
common stock. Under the stockholders agreement between Explorer and us, Explorer
continues to be entitled to designate four of our ten directors.

     In  connection  with our  repurchase  of a portion of  Explorer's  Series C
preferred  stock,  our  results  for the first  quarter  of 2004 will  include a
non-recurring  reduction in net income  attributable  to common  stockholders of
approximately  $39 million.  This amount  reflects the sum of (i) the difference
between  the  deemed  redemption  price of  $145.92  per  share of our  Series C
preferred  stock and the carrying amount of $100 per share of Series C preferred
stock multiplied by the number of shares of Series C preferred stock repurchased
upon  exercise of our option to repurchase  shares of Series C preferred  stock,
and  (ii)  the  cost  associated  with the  original  issuance  of our  Series C
preferred  stock that was previously  classified as additional  paid in capital,
pro  rated  for  the   repurchase.   On  July  31,  2003,  the  SEC  issued  its
interpretation  of  FASB-EITF  Issue  D-42,  "The Effect on the  Calculation  of
Earnings per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock."
Under the SEC's  interpretation  relating to the redemption of preferred  stock,
the  difference  between the  carrying  amount of the shares and the  redemption
price must be  recorded  as a  reduction  in net income  attributable  to common
stockholders.  The SEC's  interpretation  also included a statement  that,  upon
conversion or redemption,  all costs  associated  with the original  issuance of
such  preferred   stock  should  be  recorded  as  a  reduction  of  net  income
attributable  to common  stockholders.  These  non-recurring  reductions  in net
income  attributable to common  stockholders  will reduce our earnings per share
and funds from operations for the first quarter of 2004.

     In June 2003,  we  provided a guaranty  of the  obligations  of our various
subsidiaries that are the borrowers under a loan agreement with GECC, on its own
behalf and as agent for certain other banks who are  participating in our Credit
Facility.  Our guaranty  contains  various  affirmative  and negative  covenants
typical for such transactions  including a limitation on the amount of dividends
that we can pay that is equal to 95% of our "Funds from  Operations"  as defined
in the White Paper on Funds from  Operations  approved by the Board of Governors
of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts in April 2002. GECC
and  certain  of the other  banks  participating  in our  Credit  Facility  have
confirmed that the non-recurring  reduction in net income attributable to common
stockholders  resulting from our repurchase of a portion of Explorer's  Series C
preferred stock and the cost associated with the original issuance of our Series
C  preferred  stock will not be  included  in the  calculation  pursuant  to our
guaranty of the maximum amount of dividends that we can pay.

ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

     We are  exposed to various  market  risks,  including  the  potential  loss
arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We do not enter into derivatives
or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes,  but we seek
to mitigate the effects of  fluctuations  in interest rates by matching the term
of new  investments  with new  long-term  fixed  rate  borrowing  to the  extent
possible.

     The market value of our long-term  fixed rate  borrowings and mortgages are
subject to  interest  rate  risks.  Generally,  the  market  value of fixed rate
financial  instruments  will  decrease  as interest  rates rise and  increase as
interest rates fall. The estimated fair value of our total long-term  borrowings
at December  31,  2003 was $272.4  million.  A one percent  increase in interest
rates would  result in a decrease in the fair value of long-term  borrowings  by
approximately $2.1 million.

     We utilize  interest rate swaps and caps to fix interest  rates on variable
rate debt and reduce certain exposures to interest rate fluctuations.  We do not
use  derivatives for trading or speculative  purposes.  We have a policy of only
entering  into  contracts  with major  financial  institutions  based upon their
credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying
and offsetting  exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, we have not
sustained  a  material  loss from those  instruments  nor do we  anticipate  any
material  adverse  effect on our net income or financial  position in the future
from the use of derivatives.

     To manage  interest rate risk, we may employ  options,  forwards,  interest
rate swaps, caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying
exposure. We may employ swaps, forwards or purchased options to hedge qualifying
forecasted  transactions.  Gains and losses  related to these  transactions  are
deferred and recognized in net income as interest  expense in the same period or
periods  that  the  underlying  transaction  occurs,  expires  or  is  otherwise
terminated.  GAAP requires us to recognize all  derivatives on the balance sheet
at fair  value.  Derivatives  that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value
through  income.  If the  derivative is a hedge,  depending on the nature of the
hedge,  changes in the fair value of  derivatives  will either be offset against
the change in fair value of the hedged assets,  liabilities, or firm commitments
through  earnings or  recognized in other  comprehensive  income until the hedge
item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change
in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.

     In September 2002, we entered into a 61-month, $200.0 million interest rate
cap with a strike of 3.50% that has been designated as a cash flow hedge.  Under
the terms of the cap agreement,  when LIBOR exceeds 3.50%, the counterparty will
pay us $200.0 million multiplied by the difference between LIBOR and 3.50% times
the number of days when LIBOR exceeds  3.50%.  The  unrealized  gain/loss in the
fair  value  of  cash  flow  hedges  are  reported  on the  balance  sheet  with
corresponding adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income. On December
31,  2003,  the  derivative  instrument  was  reported at its fair value of $5.5
million.  An adjustment of $1.6 million to other  comprehensive  income was made
for the  change  in fair  value of this cap  during  2003.  Over the term of the
interest rate cap, the $10.1 million cost will be amortized to earnings based on
the specific  portion of the total cost  attributed  to each monthly  settlement
period. Over the next twelve months, $1.2 million is expected to be reclassified
to earnings from other comprehensive income.

     In September  2002,  we  terminated  two interest  rate swaps with notional
amounts of $32.0  million  each.  Under the terms of the first  swap  agreement,
which would have  expired in December  2002,  we  received  payments  when LIBOR
exceeded 6.35% and paid the counterparty  when LIBOR was less than 6.35%.  Under
the second swap  agreement,  which was scheduled to expire December 31, 2002, we
received payments when LIBOR exceeded 4.89% and paid the counterparty when LIBOR
was less than 4.89%.  During 2002,  we recorded a non-cash  gain of $0.9 million
related to the maturity  and payoff of two  interest  rate swaps with a notional
amount of $32.0 million each.

COMPENSATION AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS

C. TAYLOR PICKETT EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

     We entered into an employment  agreement with C. Taylor Pickett dated as of
June 12, 2001,  to be our Chief  Executive  Officer.  The term of the  agreement
expires on June 12, 2005.

     Mr.  Pickett's base salary is $450,000 per year,  subject to increase by us
and  provides  that he will be eligible for an annual bonus of up to 100% of his
base salary based on criteria  determined by the  Compensation  Committee of our
Board of Directors.  In connection with this employment agreement, we issued Mr.
Pickett  50,000 shares of our  restricted  common stock on June 12, 2001,  which
vested during 2003. In connection with the employment agreement, Mr. Pickett was
granted an incentive stock option to purchase 172,413 shares of our common stock
and a nonqualified  stock option to purchase 627,587 shares of our common stock.
The  incentive  stock  option has vested as to 25% of the shares on December 31,
2002; as to an additional 25% after Mr. Pickett  completes two years of service;
as to an additional  25% ratably on a monthly basis in 2004; and as to the final
25%  ratably on a monthly  basis in the first six  months of 2005,  in each case
provided Mr. Pickett  continues to work for us on the  applicable  vesting date.
The  nonqualified  stock option will become vested as to 50% of the shares after
Mr. Pickett  completes two years of service and will become ratably vested as to
the  remainder  of the  shares  on a  monthly  basis  over the next 24 months of
service following that two year anniversary.

     If we terminate Mr. Pickett's employment without cause or if he resigns for
good  reason,  he will be entitled to payment of his base salary for a period of
12 months  or,  if  shorter,  for the  remainder  of the term of the  agreement.
Additionally,  Mr. Pickett will be entitled to payment of an amount equal to the
bonus paid in the prior year, payable in 12 monthly installments. Mr. Pickett is
required to execute a release of claims against us as a condition to the payment
of severance  benefits.  The vesting of Mr. Pickett's  options may be subject to
acceleration  upon the occurrence of certain events such as termination  without
cause or resignation for good reason and will become fully vested if, within one
year  following a change of control,  he is terminated  without cause or resigns
for good reason.

     Mr. Pickett is restricted  from using any of our  confidential  information
during  his  employment  and for two years  thereafter  or from  using any trade
secrets  during  his  employment  and for as long  thereafter  as  permitted  by
applicable  law.  Mr.  Pickett is subject to covenants  which  prohibit him from
competing  with us and from  soliciting  our customers or employees  while he is
employed by us and for 12 months following his termination of employment.

     We entered into an employment  agreement with Daniel J. Booth  effective as
of  October  15,  2001,  to be our  Chief  Operating  Officer.  The  term of the
agreement expires on January 1, 2006.

     Mr.  Booth's base salary is $275,000  per year,  subject to increase by us,
and he is eligible  for an annual bonus of up to 50% of his base salary based on
criteria  determined  by the  Compensation  Committee.  In  connection  with his
employment  agreement,  Mr.  Booth was  granted  an  incentive  stock  option to
purchase  166,666 shares of our common stock and a nonqualified  stock option to
purchase  83,334  shares of our common  stock.  The  incentive  stock option has
vested as to 40% of the shares on December 31, 2003;  and will vest as to 20% of
the shares on each of October 1, 2004,  October 1, 2005 and January 1, 2006, and
the nonqualified stock option vested on October 1, 2003, provided that Mr. Booth
continues to work for us on the applicable vesting date.

     Our agreement  with Mr. Booth  contains  severance and  accelerated  option
vesting provisions similar to those in Mr. Pickett's  agreement described above.
Mr.  Booth is required to execute a release of claims  against us as a condition
to the payment of severance benefits.  He is also subject to restrictions on his

in our agreement with Mr. Pickett described above.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

     For the year ended December 31, 2003, each non-employee director received a
cash payment  equal to $15,000 per year,  payable in quarterly  installments  of
$3,750. Each non-employee  director also received a quarterly grant of shares of
common  stock equal to the number of shares  determined  by dividing  the sum of
$3,750  by the  fair  market  value  of the  common  stock  on the  date of each
quarterly  grant,  currently set at February 15, May 15, August 15, and November
15. At the director's  option, the quarterly cash payment of director's fees may
be payable in shares of common stock. In addition,  each  non-employee  director
was entitled to receive fees equal to $1,500 per meeting for  attendance at each
regularly  scheduled meeting of our Board of Directors.  For each teleconference
or called special meeting of our Board of Directors,  each non-employee director
received  $1,500 for  meetings  with a duration in excess of 15 minutes and $750
for meetings with a duration of less than 15 minutes. In addition, we reimbursed
the directors for travel  expenses  incurred in connection  with their duties as
directors. Employee directors received no compensation for service as directors.

     The cash compensation, not including reimbursement for expenses, paid by us
in  consideration  of Mr.  Decker's and Mr.  McNamara's  service on our Board of
Directors  as  Explorer  designees  was paid  directly  to  Hampstead  under the
advisory agreement.

     Each  non-employee  director  was awarded  options  with  respect to 10,000
shares at the date the plan was  adopted or upon  their  initial  election  as a
director.  Each non-employee director is also awarded an additional option grant
with respect to 1,000 shares on January 1 of each year they serve as a director.
All grants have been and will be at an exercise  price equal to 100% of the fair
market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. Non-employee director
options vest one-third after each year for three years.

ITEM 13 - CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

EXPLORER HOLDINGS, L.P.

     Hampstead,  through its affiliate  Explorer,  indirectly  owned  18,118,246
shares of our common stock,  representing  41.5% of our outstanding voting power
as of  February  5,  2004.  Daniel  A.  Decker,  our  Chairman  of the  Board of
Directors,  is a principal of  Hampstead.  Donald J.  McNamara,  the Chairman of
Hampstead,  is one of  our  directors.  Christopher  W.  Mahowald  is one of our
directors and holds an equity  investment  in Explorer.  Explorer is entitled to
designate a majority of the  members of our Board of  Directors  pursuant to our
Stockholders Agreement with Explorer. See "Stockholders  Agreement with Explorer
Holdings, L.P."

REPURCHASE AND CONVERSION  AGREEMENT.  Pursuant to our Repurchase and Conversion
Agreement  with  Explorer,  we  used  approximately  $102.1  million  of the net
proceeds of our Series D preferred  stock offering to repurchase  700,000 shares
of Series C preferred stock and Explorer  converted its remaining 348,420 shares
of Series C preferred  stock into  5,574,720  shares of common stock,  all as of
February 10,2004. (See Item 7 - Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Results
of Operation  and Financial  Condition;  Series D Preferred  Offering;  Series C
Preferred Purchase and Conversion).

     Pursuant to our  Repurchase  and  Conversion  Agreement,  we paid  Explorer
$150,000 in settlement of all outstanding  claims by Explorer for  reimbursement
of expenses (other than travel and related expenses incurred by  representatives
of Explorer on behalf of us) and in consideration of Explorer's agreement to pay
all expenses incurred by it in connection with the transactions.

ADVISORY  AGREEMENT.  Under  the  terms  of an  amended  and  restated  advisory
agreement dated October 4, 2000 between us and Hampstead,  we have agreed to pay
Explorer an advisory fee if Hampstead  provides  assistance  to us in connection
with the evaluation of growth  opportunities or other financing matters. We have
also agreed to reimburse  Explorer for certain direct  expenses.  As of December
31, 2003, we reimbursed  Explorer for approximately  $0.6 million of such direct
expenses. (See Note 12 - Related Party Transactions).

REGISTRATION  OF EXPLORER'S  SHARES.  On February 5, 2004, we received a request
from Explorer  pursuant to its registration  rights agreement with us requesting
that we file a registration statement with the SEC registering Explorer's shares
of our  common  stock on a shelf  basis  permitting  sales  from time to time as
determined by Explorer, and we have filed such a registration  statement.  Under
the registration  rights  agreement,  we bear the expenses  associated with such
registration,  other than fees and expenses of Explorer's  counsel and excluding
underwriting  discounts  and  commissions  relating  to the  offer  and  sale of
Explorer's shares.

STOCKHOLDERS  AGREEMENT WITH EXPLORER HOLDINGS,  L.P. On July 14, 2000, Explorer
Holdings, L.P. completed a Series C investment of $100.0 million in exchange for
1,000,000  shares of  Omega's  Series C  preferred  stock.  In  connection  with
Explorer's Series C investment, Omega entered into a Stockholders Agreement with
Explorer  dated July 14,  2000.  As a  condition  to the  closing of  Explorer's
additional   $31.3  million   investment  in  February   2002,  we  amended  the
Stockholders  Agreement with Explorer to provide that Explorer would be entitled
to  designate  to our Board of  Directors  that number of  directors  that would
generally be proportionate to Explorer's ownership of voting securities,  not to
exceed five  directors  (or six  directors  upon the increase in the size of the
Board of Directors to ten directors).  Explorer has agreed to vote its shares in
favor of three independent  directors as defined under the rules of the New York
Stock Exchange who are not  affiliates of Explorer,  so long as Explorer owns at
least 15% of our  voting  securities.  The  Stockholders  Agreement  as  amended
terminates February 20, 2007.

ITEM 14 - PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES

     Ernst & Young LLP audited our  financial  statements  for each of the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003.

AUDIT FEES

     The aggregate  fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP for  professional  services
rendered  to our  company  for  the  audit  of the  Company's  annual  financial
statements  for  fiscal  year  2002 and 2003 and the  reviews  of the  financial
statements  included in the Company's  Forms 10-Q for fiscal years 2002 and 2003
were approximately $216,000 and $167,000, respectively.

AUDIT RELATED FEES

     There were no fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP for professional services to
our company  relating to  employee  benefit  audits,  due  diligence  related to
mergers and acquisitions, accounting consultations and audits in connection with
acquisitions, internal control reviews, attest services that are not required by
statute or regulation  and  consultation  concerning  financial  accounting  and
reporting standards for fiscal years 2002 and 2003.

TAX FEES

     The aggregate fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP for professional services to
our company  relating to tax compliance,  tax planning and tax advice taken as a
whole were  approximately  $149,000  and $33,000 for fiscal years 2002 and 2003,
respectively.

OTHER FEES

     The aggregate fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP for professional services to
our company  rendered  other than as stated  under the  captions  "Audit  Fees,"
"Audit-Related  Fees" and "Tax Fees"  above for fiscal  years 2002 and 2003 were
approximately  $71,000 and $0,  respectively.  We  reimbursed  certain  fees and
expenses of an  investment  banking firm  selected to act as placement  agent in
connection  with  a  planned  commercial   mortgage-backed  securities  ("CMBS")
transaction pursuant to our agreement with the placement agent. In 2002, we were
unable to  complete  the  proposed  CMBS  transaction  due to the  impact on our
operators resulting from reductions in Medicare reimbursement and concerns about
potential Medicaid rate reductions.  The placement agent engaged the transaction
support  group based in a  different  office of Ernst & Young LLP to provide the
placement agent with certain procedures agreed upon by Ernst & Young LLP and the
placement  agent.  Among the placement agent expenses that were reimbursed by us
were $1.2 million for services  provided to the placement agent by Ernst & Young
LLP.

DETERMINATION OF AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE

     The Audit  Committee has considered the provision of non-audit  services by
our principal accountants and has determined that the provision of such services
was consistent with maintaining the independence of Ernst & Young LLP.

AUDIT COMMITTEE'S PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES

     The Audit Committee's current practice is to pre-approve all audit services
and all  permitted  non-audit  services  to be  provided  to our  company by our
independent auditor;  provided,  however pre-approval requirements for non-audit
services are not required if all such services (1) do not aggregate to more than
five percent of total  revenues paid by us to our  accountant in the fiscal year
when services are provided; (2) were not recognized as non-audit services at the
time of the  engagement;  and (3) are promptly  brought to the  attention of the
Audit  Committee and approved  prior to the completion of the audit by the Audit
Committee.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors
Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.


     We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of Omega
Healthcare  Investors,  Inc. and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
and the related consolidated  statements of operations,  stockholders equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31, 2003.
Our audit also included the financial  statement  schedules  listed in the Index
under  Item  15  (a).   These   financial   statements  and  schedules  are  the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in  all  material  respects,   the  consolidated  financial  position  of  Omega
Healthcare  Investors,  Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and
the  consolidated  results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period  ended  December  31,  2003,  in  conformity  with
accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United  States.  Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedules,  when considered in relation
to the  basic  financial  statements  taken as a whole,  present  fairly  in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

     As discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated  financial statements,  in 2003
Omega  Healthcare  Investors,  Inc.  adopted the  provisions  of  Statements  of
Financial  Standards  No. 144,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets."

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

ORGANIZATION

     Omega   Healthcare   Investors,   Inc.,  a  Maryland   corporation,   is  a
self-administered  real estate investment trust ("REIT").  From the date that we
commenced  operations in 1992, we have  invested  primarily in  income-producing
healthcare  facilities,  which include  long-term care nursing  homes,  assisted
living facilities and  rehabilitation  hospitals.  At December 31, 2003, we have
investments in 211 healthcare facilities located in the United States.

CONSOLIDATION

     The consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of our company
and our wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of all material intercompany
accounts and transactions.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS

     We allocate the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified
intangible  assets  acquired  based on their fair values in accordance  with the
provisions  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS")  No.  141,
Business  Combinations.  In making  estimates  of fair  values for  purposes  of
allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including independent
appraisals  that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing
of the respective  property and other market data. We also consider  information
obtained about each property as a result of its  pre-acquisition  due diligence,
marketing and leasing  activities  in estimating  the fair value of the tangible
and intangible assets acquired.

     Depreciation for buildings is recorded on the  straight-line  basis,  using
estimated  useful lives  ranging from 20 to 39 years.  Leasehold  interests  are
amortized  over the  shorter  of useful  life or term of the  lease,  with lives
ranging from four to seven years.

OWNED AND OPERATED ASSETS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

     Real estate acquired and operated  pursuant to a foreclosure  proceeding is
designated  as "owned and operated  assets" and recorded at the lower of cost or
fair  value  and  is  included  in  "real  estate  properties"  on  our  audited
consolidated  balance sheet.  For 2003, the assets and  liabilities of our owned
and  operated  properties  are shown on a net  basis on the face of our  audited
consolidated balance sheet. For 2002, operating assets and operating liabilities
for our owned and operated  properties are shown on a gross basis on the face of
our audited  consolidated balance sheet and are detailed in Note 3 - Properties.
The net basis presentation in 2003 is due to the insignificance of the owned and
operated portfolio (one facility at December 31, 2003).

     When a formal  plan to sell real  estate was adopted and we held a contract
for sale, the real estate was classified as "assets held for sale," with the net
carrying amount adjusted to the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less cost
of disposal.  Depreciation of the facilities was excluded from operations  after
management has committed to a plan to sell the asset.  Upon adoption of SFAS No.
144,  Accounting  for the  Impairment  or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets,  as of
January 1, 2002,  long-lived  assets sold or  designated  as held for sale after
January  1,  2002 are  reported  as  discontinued  operations  in our  financial
statements.

ASSET IMPAIRMENT

     Management  periodically,  but not less than  annually,  evaluates the real
estate  investments  for  impairment  indicators.  The  judgment  regarding  the
existence  of  impairment  indicators  are  based  on  factors  such  as  market
conditions,   operator  performance  and  legal  structure.   If  indicators  of
impairment are present,  management  evaluates the carrying value of the related
real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the
underlying  facilities.  Provisions for impairment  related to long-lived assets
are recognized when expected future cash flows are less than the carrying values
of the assets.  If the sum of the  expected  future cash flow,  including  sales
proceeds,  is less than carrying value, then an impairment charge is recorded to
write the asset down to the  present  value of expected  future cash flows.  The
fair value of the real estate investment is determined by market research, which
includes  valuing the  property as a nursing  home as well as other  alternative
uses.

LOAN IMPAIRMENT

     Management  periodically,   but  not  less  than  annually,  evaluates  the
outstanding loans and notes  receivable.  When management  identifies  potential
loan  impairment  indicators,  such as  non-payment  under  the loan  documents,
impairment of the underlying collateral, financial difficulty of the operator or
other  circumstances  that may impair full execution of the loan documents,  the
loan is written down to the present value of the expected  future cash flows. In
cases where expected future cash flows cannot be estimated,  the loan is written
down to the  fair  value  of the  collateral.  The  fair  value  of the  loan is
determined by market research,  which includes valuing the property as a nursing
home as well as other alternative uses.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of cash on hand  and  highly  liquid
investments  with a maturity date of three months or less when purchased.  These
investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

     Effective  January  1,  2001,  we  adopted  SFAS No.  133,  Accounting  for
Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities,  as amended, which requires that
all derivatives  are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value.  Derivatives
that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative
is a hedge,  depending on the nature of the hedge,  changes in the fair value of
derivatives  are either  offset  against  the change in fair value of the hedged
assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other
comprehensive  income  until the  hedge  item is  recognized  in  earnings.  The
ineffective  portion of a derivative's  change in fair value will be immediately
recognized in earnings.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

     Accounts  receivable  consists  primarily  of lease and  mortgage  interest
payments.  Amounts  recorded  include  estimated  provisions for loss related to
uncollectible  accounts and disputed  items.  On a monthly basis,  we review the
contractual  payment  versus  actual cash payment  received and the  contractual
payment  due  date  versus  actual  receipt  date.  When  management  identifies
delinquencies, a judgment is made as to the amount of provision, if any, that is
needed.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE - OWNED AND OPERATED ASSETS

     Accounts  receivable from owned and operated assets consists of amounts due
from Medicare and Medicaid  programs,  other government  programs,  managed care
health plans,  commercial insurance companies and individual  patients.  Amounts
recorded include estimated provisions for loss related to uncollectible accounts
and disputed  items. A provision of $0.0 million,  $5.9 million and $7.3 million
was recorded in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES

     Marketable securities  classified as available-for-sale  are stated at fair
value  with  unrealized   gains  and  losses   recorded  in  accumulated   other
comprehensive income.  Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to
be other-than-temporary on securities held as available-for-sale are included in
investment  income.  The  cost of  securities  sold  is  based  on the  specific
identification method.  Interest and dividends on securities  available-for-sale
are included in investment income.

DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS

     Deferred  financing costs are amortized on a  straight-line  basis over the
terms of the  related  borrowings  which  approximates  the  effective  interest
method.  Amortization of financing costs totaling $4.9 million, $2.8 million and
$2.5 million in 2003,  2002 and 2001,  respectively,  is  classified as interest
expense in our audited consolidated  statements of operations.  Amounts paid for
financings  that  are not  ultimately  completed  are  expensed  at the time the
determination is made that such financings are not viable. In 2002, $7.0 million
of such costs was expensed and was classified as refinancing  expense in 2002 in
our audited consolidated statements of operations.

     We have  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standard  No.  145,
Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No.
13, and  Technical  Corrections,  which  requires that gains and losses from the
extinguishment  of debt are no longer presented as an extraordinary  item in our
audited  consolidated  statements of operations.  The accompanying  consolidated
financial  statements present gains or losses arising from the extinguishment of
debt as interest  expense  within  income  from  continuing  operations  and the
effects of extinguishments in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to
the prescribed presentation.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

     Rental income and mortgage  interest  income are  recognized as earned over
the terms of the related Master Leases and mortgage  notes,  respectively.  Such
income includes periodic increases based on pre-determined  formulas (i.e., such
as  increases  in the  Consumer  Price  Index  ("CPI")) as defined in the Master
Leases and mortgage loan agreements.  Reserves are taken against earned revenues
from leases and mortgages when collection of amounts due become  questionable or
when  negotiations  for  restructurings  of  troubled  operators  lead to  lower
expectations regarding ultimate collection.  When collection is uncertain, lease
revenues  are recorded as received,  after  taking into account  application  of
security  deposits.  Interest income on impaired mortgage loans is recognized as
received after taking into account application of security deposits.

     Nursing home revenues from owned and operated assets  (primarily  Medicare,
Medicaid and other third party insurance) are recognized as patient services are
provided.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

     Basic  earnings per common share ("EPS") is computed by dividing net income
available to common  stockholders  by the  weighted-average  number of shares of
common stock  outstanding  during the year.  Diluted EPS reflects the  potential
dilution that could occur from shares issuable through stock-based compensation,
including stock options and the conversion of our Series C preferred stock.

FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES

     As a qualified  REIT, we will not be subject to Federal income taxes on our
income, and no provisions for Federal income taxes have been made. To the extent
that we have  foreclosure  income from our owned and  operated  assets,  we will
incur federal tax at a rate of 35%. To date, our owned and operated  assets have
generated  losses,  and  therefore,  no  provision  for  federal  income  tax is
necessary.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

     Our  company  grants  stock  options to  employees  and  directors  with an
exercise  price  equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of the grant.
In accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion
No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,  compensation  expense is not
recognized for these stock option grants. Expense related to Dividend Equivalent
Rights is recognized as dividends are declared, based on anticipated vesting.

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities,  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

EFFECTS OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     In May 2003, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
No. 150,  Accounting for Certain Financial  Instruments with  Characteristics of
Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 requires certain financial instruments
that  embody  obligations  of  the  issuer  and  have  characteristics  of  both
liabilities and equity to be classified as  liabilities.  The provisions of SFAS
No. 150 are effective for financial  instruments  entered into or modified after
May 31, 2003 and to all other  instruments that exist as of the beginning of the
first interim  financial  reporting  period beginning after June 15, 2003. We do
not have any  financial  instruments  that meet the  provisions of SFAS No. 150,
therefore, adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 150 did not have an impact on our
results of operations or financial position.

     In January 2003, the FASB issued  Financial  Interpretation  Number ("FIN")
46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an Interpretation of ARB No. 51.
FIN 46 is an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated
Financial  Statements  and addresses  consolidation  by business  enterprises of
variable interest entities.  We believe that, as of December 31, 2003, we do not
have any entities that meet the definition of a variable  interest  entity under
FIN 46,  therefore,  the provisions of FIN 46 are not expected to have an impact
on our results of operations or financial position.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

     Our company is subject to certain  risks and  uncertainties  affecting  the
healthcare industry as a result of healthcare legislation and growing regulation
by federal, state and local governments.  Additionally,  we are subject to risks
and  uncertainties  as a result of changes  affecting  operators of nursing home
facilities due to the actions of governmental agencies and insurers to limit the
growth in cost of healthcare services. (See Note 6 - Concentration of Risk).

RECLASSIFICATIONS

     Certain  reclassifications  have been recorded to the prior year  financial
statements to conform to current year presentation.

NOTE 3 - PROPERTIES

LEASED PROPERTY

     Our leased  real  estate  properties,  represented  by 151  long-term  care
facilities  and two  rehabilitation  hospitals at December 31, 2003,  are leased
under provisions of single leases and Master Leases with initial terms typically
ranging  from 5 to 15 years,  plus  renewal  options.  Substantially  all of the
leases and Master Leases provide for minimum annual rentals which are subject to
annual increases based upon increases in the CPI or increases in revenues of the
underlying  properties,  with  certain  maximum  limits.  Under the terms of the
leases,  the  lessee is  responsible  for all  maintenance,  repairs,  taxes and
insurance on the leased properties.

     A summary of our investment in leased real estate properties is as follows:

     A summary of the lease transactions which occurred in 2003 is as follows:

ALTERRA HEALTHCARE CORPORATION

     o    Alterra Healthcare Corporation  ("Alterra") announced during the first
          quarter  of 2003,  that,  in  order to  facilitate  and  complete  its
          on-going  restructuring  initiatives,   they  had  filed  a  voluntary
          petition with the U.S.  Bankruptcy  Court for the District of Delaware
          to reorganize  under Chapter 11 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code. At that
          time, we leased eight assisted  living  facilities (325 units) located
          in seven states to subsidiaries of Alterra.

     o    Effective  July 7, 2003, we amended our Master Lease with a subsidiary
          of Alterra  whereby the number of leased  facilities  was reduced from
          eight to five.  The  amended  Master  Lease  has a  remaining  term of
          approximately   ten  years  with  an  annual   rent   requirement   of
          approximately  $1.5  million.  This  compares  to the 2002  annualized
          revenue of $2.6  million.  On  November  1,  2003,  we  re-leased  one
          assisted  living  facility  formerly  leased by  Alterra,  located  in
          Washington, to a new operator under a Lease, which has a ten-year term
          and has an initial  annual lease rate of $0.2  million.  We are in the
          process of  negotiating  terms and  conditions for the re-lease of the
          remaining two properties. In the interim, Alterra continues to operate
          the two facilities.  The Amended Master Lease was approved by the U.S.
          Bankruptcy Court in the District of Delaware.

CLAREMONT HEALTHCARE HOLDINGS, INC.

     o    Effective  December  1, 2003,  we sold one  skilled  nursing  facility
          ("SNF")  formerly  leased  by  Claremont  Healthcare  Holdings,   Inc.
          ("Claremont"),  located in Illinois, for $9.0 million. We received net
          proceeds of  approximately  $6.0  million in cash and a $3.0  million,
          five-year,  10.5%  secured  note  for the  balance.  This  transaction
          results in a non-cash  accounting loss of approximately  $3.8 million,
          which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003.

     o    On  November  7,  2003,  we  re-leased  two SNFs  formerly  leased  by
          Claremont,  located in Ohio,  to a new operator  under a Master Lease,
          which has a ten-year term and has an initial annual lease rate of $1.1
          million.

     o    Separately,  we continue our ongoing  restructuring  discussions  with
          Claremont  regarding the five facilities  Claremont  currently  leases
          from  us.  We  cannot   determine  the  timing  or  outcome  of  these
          discussions.  Claremont  failed to pay base rent due during the fourth
          quarter  of 2003 in the  amount of $1.5  million.  During  the  fourth
          quarter of 2003,  we applied  security  deposits in the amount of $1.0
          million  to  pay  Claremont's  rent  payments  and  we  demanded  that
          Claremont restore the $1.5 million security  deposit.  At December 31,
          2003,  we had no  additional  security  deposits  with  Claremont.  We
          recognize revenue from Claremont on a cash-basis as it is received.

SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC.

     o    On February 7, 2003,  Sun Healthcare  Group,  Inc.  ("Sun")  announced
          "that it has opened dialogue with many of its landlords concerning the
          portfolio of properties  leased to Sun and various of its consolidated
          subsidiaries  (collectively,  the `Company'). The Company is seeking a
          rent moratorium and/or rent concessions with respect to certain of its
          facilities  and is seeking to  transition  its  operations  of certain
          facilities to new operators while retaining  others." To this end, Sun
          has initiated  conversations  with us regarding a  restructure  of our
          lease. As a result,  during 2003, we released 12 SNFs, formerly leased
          by Sun, in the following transactions:

          o    On July 1, 2003, we re-leased one SNF in Louisiana to an existing
               operator under a Master Lease, which lease has an eight-year term
               and requires an initial annual lease rate of $400,000;

          o    On July 1, 2003,  we  re-leased  two SNFs  located in Texas to an
               existing operator under a Master Lease, which has a ten-year term
               and has an initial annual lease rate of $800,000;

          o    On July 1, 2003,  we re-leased  two SNFs located in Florida to an
               existing operator under a Master Lease, which has a ten-year term
               and has an initial annual lease rate of $1.3 million;

          o    On  October  1,  2003,   we  re-leased   three  SNFs  located  in
               California,  to a new operator under a Master Lease,  which has a
               15-year  term  and has an  initial  annual  lease  rate of  $1.25
               million;

          o    On November 1, 2003,  we re-leased two SNFs located in California
               to a new operator under a Master Lease, which has a ten-year term
               and has an initial annual lease rate of $0.6 million;

          o    On December 1, 2003,  we re-leased  one SNF located in California
               to a new operator  under a lease,  which has a ten-year  term and
               has an initial annual lease rate of $0.12 million; and

          o    On December 1, 2003,  we re-leased  one SNF located in Indiana to
               an existing operator under a lease, which has a five-year term.

     o    As a result of the  above-mentioned  transitions  of the 12 former Sun
          facilities, Sun operated 38 of our facilities at December 31, 2003.

     o    Effective  January  1, 2004,  we  re-leased  four SNFs to an  existing
          operator under a new Master Lease,  which has a five-year term and has
          an initial  annual lease rate of $0.75  million.  Three SNFs  formerly
          leased by Sun, located in Illinois, were part of this transaction. The
          fourth  SNF in the  transaction,  located  in  Illinois,  was the last
          remaining  owned  and  operated  facility  in our  portfolio.  A fifth
          facility,  leased in December  2003, was  incorporated  in this Master
          Lease.

     o    On January 26, 2004, we announced  the signing of a  non-binding  term
          sheet  representing  an agreement in principle  with Sun  regarding 51
          properties we own that are leased to various  affiliates of Sun. Under
          the arrangement  contemplated by the non-binding term sheet, Sun would
          continue  to operate and occupy 23  long-term  care  facilities,  five
          behavioral properties and two hospital properties. One property in the
          State of Washington, formerly operated by a Sun affiliate, has already
          been  closed  and  the  lease   relating  to  that  property  will  be
          terminated.  With  respect to the  remaining  20  facilities,  15 have
          already been transitioned to new operators and five are in the process
          of being  transferred to new  operators.  The  non-binding  term sheet
          contemplates  execution  and  delivery of a new master  lease with the
          following general terms:

          o    Term: Through December 31, 2013.

          o    Base Rent:  Commencing  February 1, 2004, monthly base rent would
               be $1.56 million,  subject to annual increases not to exceed 2.5%
               per year.

          o    Deferred  Base Rent:  $7.76  million  would be deferred  and bear
               interest  at a  floating  rate with a floor of 6% per year.  That
               interest  would  accrue  but would not be  payable  to us through
               January  3,  2008.  Interest  thereafter  accruing  would be paid
               monthly.  We are  releasing  all other claims for base rent which
               otherwise would be due under the current leases.

          o    Conversion  of Deferred Base Rent: We would have the right at any
               time to convert the  deferred  base rent into  800,000  shares of
               Sun's common stock,  subject to certain  non-dilution  provisions
               and the right of Sun to pay cash in an amount  equal to the value
               of that stock in lieu of issuing stock to Omega.  If the value of
               the common stock exceeds 140% of the deferred base rent,  Sun can
               require Omega to convert the deferred base rent into Sun's common
               stock.

          The terms described above are subject to the negotiation and execution
     of definitive documents satisfactory to us and Sun. Separately, we continue
     our ongoing  restructuring  discussions  with Sun. We cannot  determine the
     timing or outcome of these  discussions  at the time of this filing.  There
     can be no  assurance  that Sun  will  continue  to pay rent at the  current
     level,  although,  we believe that alternative operators would be available
     to lease or buy the remaining Sun facilities if an appropriate agreement is
     not completed with Sun.

     As a  result  of our  2003  re-leasing  efforts,  our  owned  and  operated
portfolio has  decreased  from three at December 31, 2002 to one at December 31,
2003.

OWNED AND OPERATED ASSETS

     At December 31, 2003, we owned one,  128-bed  facility that was  previously
recovered  from a bankrupt  customer and is operated  for our own  account.  The
facility and its respective  operations are presented on a consolidated basis in
our audited consolidated  financial  statements.  At December 31, 2002, we owned
and operated  three  long-term care  facilities  (two owned and one subject to a
leasehold interest).  Impairment charges of $3.0 million, including $2.0 million
for a  property  that was sold,  was taken on these  assets  for the year  ended
December 31, 2002.

     A summary  of our  investment  in the one and two owned and  operated  real
estate assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, is as follows:

                                          =====================

     Effective  January 1, 2004,  our  remaining  owned and  operated  asset was
re-leased to an existing  operator.  This  facility,  located in  Illinois,  was
re-leased under a new Master Lease which encompasses four additional facilities.

CLOSED FACILITIES

     At  December  31,  2003,  there  are six  closed  properties  that  are not
currently  under  contract for sale. We recorded a $8.8 million and $3.7 million
provision  for  impairment  for the year  ended  December  31,  2003  and  2002,
respectively.  These  properties  are  included  in real  estate in our  audited
consolidated  balance  sheet.  A summary of our investment in closed real estate
properties is as follows:

                                               DECEMBER 31,

                                          =====================

     In  2003,  six  facilities  were  transferred  to  closed  facilities.  Two
facilities were transferred from purchase leaseback and non-cash  impairments of
$8.8  million  were  recorded  to reduce the value of the  investments  to their
estimated fair value.  Three  facilities  were  transferred  from mortgage notes
receivable  after  we  received  a Deed  in  Lieu of  Foreclosure.  Finally,  we
transferred  one  facility  from our owned and  operated  portfolio  into closed
facilities.

     In addition,  in 2003 we sold eight closed facilities realizing proceeds of
approximately  $7.0 million,  net of closing  costs,  resulting in a net gain of
approximately  $3.0 million.  In accordance  with SFAS No. 144, the $3.0 million
realized net gain for the twelve months ended  December 31, 2003 is reflected in
our audited  consolidated  statements of operations as discontinued  operations.
(See Note 19 - Discontinued Operations).

ASSETS SOLD OR HELD FOR SALE

     During 2003, we sold the four remaining  facilities,  which were classified
as assets  held for sale in 2001,  realizing  proceeds of $2.0  million,  net of
closing costs,  resulting in a net loss of  approximately  $0.7 million,  in the
following transactions:

          o    On June 6, 2003, we sold one closed  facility  classified as held
               for sale located in the state of Indiana,  realizing net proceeds
               of $0.2 million, resulting in a gain of $0.1 million.

          o    On July 9, 2003, we sold one closed  facility  classified as held
               for sale located in the state of Indiana,  realizing net proceeds
               of $0.2 million, resulting in a gain of $0.1 million.

          o    On September 30, 2003, we sold one closed facility  classified as
               held for sale  located in Indiana  for its  approximate  net book
               value.

          o    On October 31, 2003, we sold our remaining held for sale facility
               located in Texas,  realizing  proceeds  of $1.5  million,  net of
               closing costs, resulting in a loss of $0.8 million.

     During 2002, we realized proceeds of $1.7 million  associated with the sale
of two  facilities,  which were  classified as assets held for sale in 2001, and
miscellaneous beds. Accordingly, these six facilities (four sold in 2003 and two
sold in 2002) were subject to SFAS No. 121,  Accounting  for the  Impairment  of
Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed  and have not been
reported  as  discontinued  operations  in our  audited  consolidated  financial
statements.

     During  2001,  we recorded a provision of $8.3  million for  impairment  of
assets  transferred  to assets held for sale. We also realized  proceeds of $1.4
million during 2001.

OTHER NON-CORE ASSETS

          o    On May 8, 2003, we sold an  investment  in a Baltimore,  Maryland
               asset,  leased by the United States Postal Service ("USPS"),  for
               approximately  $19.6  million.  The purchaser paid us proceeds of
               $1.8  million  and assumed  the first  mortgage of  approximately
               $17.6 million.  As a result,  we recorded a gain of $1.3 million,
               net of closing costs and other expenses.

          o    On  December  4,  2003,  we  sold  our  investment  in  Principal
               Healthcare Finance Trust realizing proceeds of approximately $1.6
               million, net of closing costs, resulting in an accounting gain of
               approximately $0.1 million.

          o    During 2002, we received  proceeds of $16.4 million from sales of
               certain  other  non-core  assets,  resulting  in a gain  of  $2.6
               million.  We also  recognized  a  provision  of $3.7  million for
               uncollectible  mortgages,  notes and  accounts  receivable.  This
               charge was primarily  related to the  restructuring and reduction
               of debt owed by Madison/OHI Liquidity Investors, LLC ("Madison"),
               as  part of the  compromise  and  settlement  of a  lawsuit  with
               Madison. (See Note 14 - Litigation).

NOTE 4 - MORTGAGE NOTES RECEIVABLE

     Mortgage  notes  receivable  relate to 51 long-term  care  facilities.  The
mortgage notes are secured by first mortgage liens on the borrowers'  underlying
real estate and personal  property.  The  mortgage  notes  receivable  relate to
facilities  located  in  ten  states,  operated  by ten  independent  healthcare
operating  companies.  We monitor  compliance  with mortgages and when necessary
have initiated  collection,  foreclosure and other  proceedings  with respect to
certain outstanding loans.

     The following  table  summarizes  the mortgage notes balances for the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002:


                                                   2003       2002

                                               ======================

     During  2003,  we reduced  the number of  mortgaged  facilities  by 12 as a
result of the following:

          o    One  facility,  located in Indiana,  was removed from an existing
               mortgage and sold on behalf of the mortgagor.  Net sales proceeds
               from this transaction of approximately  $73 thousand were used to
               repay principal on the existing mortgage.

          o    Fee-simple  ownership of two closed  facilities  on which we held
               mortgages were  transferred to us by Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure.
               These  facilities were  transferred to closed  facilities and are
               included in our audited  consolidated  balance  sheet under "land
               and buildings at cost." We intend to sell these closed facilities
               as soon as practicable; however, there can be no assurance if, or
               when, these sales will be completed.

          o    Titles to eight IHS  properties  on which we held  mortgage  were
               transferred to our  wholly-owned  subsidiaries by Deed in Lieu of
               Foreclosure.  These facilities were then  subsequently  leased to
               four unaffiliated  third-party operators as part of four separate
               transactions. (See Note 3 - Properties).

          o    We received fee-simple ownership to one closed property, which we
               previously  held the mortgage on, by Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure.
               This  facility  was  transferred  to  closed  facilities  and  is
               included in our audited  consolidated  balance  sheet under "land
               and buildings at cost."

     During 2002,  we determined  two mortgages  were impaired and we recorded a
reserve for uncollectible  loans of $4.9 million to reduce the carrying value of
the mortgage loans to the estimated value of their related collateral.

     The  outstanding  principal  amounts of mortgage notes  receivable,  net of
allowances, are as follows:

(1)  We paid $7.0 million to enter into a purchase option to acquire a portfolio
     of seven SNFs in Ohio from a third-party  operator.  Under the terms of the
     purchase  option,  the amount paid for this  option will be offset  against
     future purchase price  consideration.  We have the ability to exercise this
     option from 2007 to 2011 and we are continuing to assess the feasibility of
     this option.

NOTE 6 - CONCENTRATION OF RISK

     As of December 31, 2003,  our  portfolio  of  investments  consisted of 211
healthcare  facilities,  located in 28 states  and  operated  by 39  third-party
operators.  Our gross  investment in these  facilities,  net of impairments  and
before reserve for uncollectible  loans,  totaled $812.3 million at December 31,
2003,  with  97.1% of our real  estate  investments  related to  long-term  care
facilities. This portfolio is made up of 151 long-term healthcare facilities and
two  rehabilitation  hospitals  owned and  leased to third  parties,  fixed rate
mortgages on 51 long-term  healthcare  facilities  and one long-term  healthcare
facility that was recovered from customers and is currently  operated  through a
third-party management contract for our own account and six long-term healthcare
facilities  that were  recovered  from  customers and are currently  closed.  At
December  31,  2003,  we also held  other  investments  of  approximately  $29.8
million, including $22.7 million of notes receivable, net of allowance.

     At December 31, 2003,  approximately  41.6% of our real estate  investments
are operated by four public  companies:  Sun  Healthcare  Group,  Inc.  (20.7%),
Advocat, Inc. ("Advocat") (12.8%),  Mariner Health Care, Inc. ("Mariner") (7.4%)
and Emeritus Corporation  ("Emeritus") (0.7%). The two largest private operators
represent 6.8% and 5.7%,  respectively,  of our  investments.  No other operator
represents more than 4.0% of our investments.  The three states in which we have
our highest concentration of investments are Florida (15.5%),  California (8.2%)
and Ohio (7.3%).

     Effective  January 1, 2004,  our  remaining  owned and  operated  long-term
healthcare  facility  was  re-leased  to an existing  operator.  This  facility,
located in Illinois,  was re-leased  under a new Master Lease which  encompasses
four additional facilities.

NOTE 7 - LEASE AND MORTGAGE DEPOSITS

     We obtain  liquidity  deposits  and letters of credit  from most  operators
pursuant to our lease and mortgage contracts with the operators. These generally
represent the rental and mortgage interest for periods ranging from three to six
months with respect to certain of its investments. The liquidity deposits may be
applied  in the  event  of  lease  and  loan  defaults,  subject  to  applicable
limitations  under bankruptcy law with respect to operators filing under Chapter
11 of the United  States  Bankruptcy  Code.  At December 31, 2003,  we held $3.3
million  in such  liquidity  deposits  and $6.5  million  in  letters of credit.
Additional  security for rental and mortgage  interest revenue from operators is
provided by covenants  regarding minimum working capital and net worth, liens on
accounts receivable and other operating assets of the operators,  provisions for
cross default,  provisions for cross-collateralization and by corporate/personal
guarantees.

NOTE 8 - BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS

     We have two secured credit facilities totaling $275 million,  consisting of
a $225 million  Senior  Secured Credit  Facility  ("Credit  Facility") and a $50
million acquisition credit facility  ("Acquisition Line"). At December 31, 2003,
$177.1 million was  outstanding  under the Credit Facility and $12.1 million was
utilized for the issuance of letters of credit,  leaving  availability  of $85.0
million.  The $177.1 million of  outstanding  borrowings had an interest rate of
6.00% at December 31, 2003.

     The Credit  Facility  includes a $125 million term loan ("Term Loan") and a
$100  million  revolving  line  of  credit  ("Revolver")  collateralized  by our
interests  in 121  facilities  representing  approximately  half of our invested
assets.  Both the Term  Loan  and  Revolver  have a  four-year  maturity  with a
one-year extension at our option. The Term Loan amortizes on a 25-year basis and
is priced at London  Interbank  Offered Rate  ("LIBOR")  plus a spread of 3.75%,
with a floor of 6.00%. The Revolver is also priced at LIBOR plus a 3.75% spread,
with a 6.00% floor.

     Borrowings  under our old $160  million  secured  revolving  line of credit
facility  of $112.0  million  were paid in full upon the  closing  of the Credit
Facility.   Additionally,   $12.5  million  of  letters  of  credit   previously
outstanding  against this credit  facility  were  reissued  under the new Credit
Facility.  LIBOR-based  borrowings  under this  previous  credit  facility had a
weighted-average interest rate of approximately 4.5% at the payoff date.

     Borrowings  under our old $65 million  line of credit  facility,  which was
fully  drawn,  were  paid in full  upon  the  closing  of our  Credit  Facility.
LIBOR-based   borrowings   under   this   previous   credit   facility   had   a
weighted-average interest rate of approximately 4.6% at the payoff date.

     As a result of the new Credit Facility,  for the twelve-month  period ended
December  31,  2003,  our  interest  expense  includes  $2.6 million of non-cash
interest  expense related to financing costs written off in conjunction with the
termination of our two previous credit facilities mentioned above.

     In December  2003,  we secured a $50  million  revolving  Acquisition  Line
arranged by GE  Healthcare  Financial  Services.  The  Acquisition  Line will be
secured by first  liens on  potential  facilities  acquired  or  assignments  of
mortgages  made  on new  acquisitions.  The  interest  rate  on the  outstanding
borrowings is LIBOR plus 3.75% with a 6% floor.

     Also in 2003,  we sold an asset  located in  Baltimore,  MD,  leased by the
USPS. The asset was secured by a first mortgage note, which was fully assumed by
the purchaser, with an outstanding principal amount at the time of sale of $17.6
million and a fixed  interest rate of 7.26%.  The note  amortized over a 20-year
term.  In  addition,  during 2003,  we paid off four  Industrial  Revenue  Bonds
totaling $7.8 million with a fixed blended rate of approximately 9.66%.

     We are required to meet certain financial  covenants,  including prescribed
leverage and interest coverage ratios on our long-term  borrowings.  We are also
required to fix a certain  portion of our interest  rate. We utilize an interest
rate  cap to  reduce  exposure  to  interest  rate  fluctuations  (See  Note 9 -
Financial Instruments).

     At  December  31,  2003,  we had  borrowings  under  a 6.95%  $100  million
interest-only note due in August 2007.

     The following is a summary of our long-term borrowings:

                                                                 DECEMBER 31,

</TABLE>

     Fair value estimates are subjective in nature and are dependent on a number
of  important  assumptions,  including  estimates  of future cash flows,  risks,
discount rates and relevant  comparable market information  associated with each
financial instrument. (See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).
The use of different market assumptions and estimation  methodologies may have a
material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts.  Accordingly,  the
estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would
realize in a current market exchange.

     We utilize interest rate caps to reduce certain  exposures to interest rate
fluctuations.  We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We
have a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial  institutions
based upon their credit  ratings and other  factors.  When viewed in conjunction
with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to
hedge,  we have not sustained a material loss from those  instruments  nor do we
anticipate any material  adverse effect on our net income or financial  position
in the future from the use of derivatives.

     To manage  interest rate risk, we may employ  options,  forwards,  interest
rate swaps, caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying
exposure. We may employ swaps, forwards or purchased options to hedge qualifying
forecasted  transactions.  Gains and losses  related to these  transactions  are
deferred and recognized in net income as interest  expense in the same period or
periods  that  the  underlying  transaction  occurs,  expires  or  is  otherwise
terminated.  GAAP requires us to recognize all  derivatives on the balance sheet
at fair  value.  Derivatives  that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value
through  income.  If the  derivative is a hedge,  depending on the nature of the
hedge,  changes in the fair value of  derivatives  will either be offset against
the change in fair value of the hedged assets,  liabilities, or firm commitments
through  earnings or  recognized in other  comprehensive  income until the hedge
item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change
in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.

     In 2002, we entered into a 61-month,  $200.0 million interest rate cap with
a strike of 3.50% that has been designated as a cash flow hedge. Under the terms
of the cap agreement,  when LIBOR exceeds 3.50%,  the  counterparty  will pay us
$200.0 million  multiplied by the  difference  between LIBOR and 3.50% times the
number of days when LIBOR exceeds 3.50%.  The  unrealized  gain/loss in the fair
value of cash flow hedges are reported on the balance  sheet with  corresponding
adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income. On December 31, 2003, the
derivative  instrument  was  recorded  at its  fair  value of $5.5  million.  An
adjustment of $1.6 million to other comprehensive income was made for the change
in fair value of this cap during 2003.  Over the term of the interest  rate cap,
the $10.1 million cost is amortized to earnings based on the specific portion of
the total cost  attributed  to each  monthly  settlement  period.  Over the next
twelve  months,  $1.2 million is expected to be  reclassified  to earnings  from
other comprehensive income.

     In 2002,  we terminated  two interest  rate swaps with notional  amounts of
$32.0 million  each.  Under the terms of the first swap  agreement,  which would
have expired on December  2002, we received  payments when LIBOR  exceeded 6.35%
and paid the counterparty when LIBOR was less than 6.35%.  Under the second swap
agreement, which was scheduled to expire December 31, 2002, we received payments
when LIBOR  exceeded  4.89% and paid the  counterparty  when LIBOR was less than
4.89%.

     During 2002,  we recorded a non-cash  gain of $0.9  million  related to the
maturity and payoff of two interest  rate swaps with a notional  amount of $32.0
million each.

NOTE 10 - RETIREMENT ARRANGEMENTS

     We have a 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan covering all eligible employees. Under
this  plan,  employees  are  eligible  to make  contributions,  and  we,  at our
discretion, may match contributions and make a profit sharing contribution.

     We have a Deferred  Compensation Plan which is an unfunded plan under which
we can award  units that result in  participation  in the  dividends  and future
growth in the value of our common stock.  There are no  outstanding  units as of
December 31, 2003.

     Our contributions to these retirement  arrangements  totaled  approximately
$52,200, $38,800 and $33,500 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

NOTE 11 - STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND STOCK OPTIONS

SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK

     Explorer Holdings, L.P. ("Explorer"),  an affiliate of Hampstead Investment
Partners III, L.P.  ("Hampstead"),  a private equity investor,  owned all of the
1,048,420  outstanding shares of our Series C convertible  preferred stock as of
December 31, 2003 with a liquidation preference of $100 per share. Shares of the
Series C preferred  stock are  convertible  into common stock at any time by the
holder at an initial  conversion  price of $6.25 per share of common stock.  The
shares of Series C  preferred  stock are  entitled to receive  dividends  at the
greater of 10% per annum or the dividend payable on shares of common stock, with
the Series C preferred stock participating on an "as converted" basis. Dividends
on the Series C preferred  stock are cumulative  from the date of original issue
and are payable quarterly. (See Note 20 - Subsequent Events).

     The Series C preferred  stock votes (on an "as converted"  basis)  together
with our common  stock on all matters  submitted to  stockholders.  The original
terms of the Series C preferred stock provided that if dividends on the Series C
preferred  stock were in arrears for four quarters,  the holders of the Series C
preferred stock,  voting  separately as a class (and together with the holder of
Series A and Series B preferred  stock if and when  dividends on such series are
in arrears for six or more  quarters  and  special  class  voting  rights are in
effect  with  respect to the Series A and Series B  preferred  stock),  would be
entitled to elect directors who, together with the other directors designated by
the  holders of Series C preferred  stock,  would  constitute  a majority of our
Board of Directors.  The general terms of the Equity Investment are set forth in
the Investment Agreement.

     In  connection  with  Explorer's  Equity  Investment,  we  entered  into  a
stockholders   agreement  with  Explorer  dated  July  14,  2000  ("Stockholders
Agreement") pursuant to which Explorer was initially entitled to designate up to
four members of our Board of  Directors  depending  on the  percentage  of total
voting  securities  (consisting  of common  stock and Series C preferred  stock)
acquired  from time to time by Explorer  pursuant to the  documentation  entered
into by Explorer in connection  with the Equity  Investment.  Under the original
Stockholders Agreement, Explorer was entitled to designate at least one director
of our Board of  Directors as long as it owned at least five percent (5%) of the
total voting power of our company and to approve one  "independent  director" as
long as it owned at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares it acquired at
the time it  completed  the Equity  Investment  (or common stock issued upon the
conversion of the Series C preferred  stock  acquired by Explorer at such time).
The Stockholders Agreement has been subsequently amended as described below.

FEBRUARY 2002 RIGHTS OFFERING AND CONCURRENT PRIVATE PLACEMENT

     In 2002, we completed a registered rights offering and simultaneous private
placement to Explorer.  Stockholders exercised subscription rights to purchase a
total of 6.4 million shares of common stock at a subscription price of $2.92 per
share,  raising gross proceeds of $18.7 million.  In the private  placement with
Explorer, we issued a total of 10.7 million shares of common stock at a price of
$2.92 per share,  raising  gross  proceeds of $31.3  million.  Proceeds from the
rights   offering  and  private   placement  were  used  to  repay   outstanding
indebtedness and for working capital and general corporate purposes.

     In connection with Explorer's 2002 investment,  we amended the Stockholders
Agreement  with  Explorer to provide that Explorer will be entitled to designate
to our Board of  Directors  that number of  directors  that would  generally  be
proportionate to Explorer's  ownership of voting securities in our company,  not
to exceed five  directors (or six directors upon the increase in the size of the
Board of  Directors  to ten  directors).  The  Stockholders  Agreement  has been
further  amended to provide  that  Explorer  shall be  entitled  to  designate a
majority of the total number of directors so long as Explorer owns a majority of
our issued and outstanding  voting securities.  Explorer currently  beneficially
owns a majority  of our voting  securities  and  therefore  would be entitled to
designate a majority of our directors. Explorer has agreed to vote its shares in
favor of three independent  directors as defined under the rules of the New York
Stock Exchange who are not  affiliates of Explorer,  so long as Explorer owns at
least 15% of our voting securities.

outstanding  shares of 8.625%  Series B Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  ("Series B
preferred stock") with a liquidation  preference of $25 per share.  Dividends on
the Series B preferred  stock are cumulative from the date of original issue and
are  payable  quarterly.   At  December  31,  2003,  the  aggregate  liquidation

STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASE ASSISTANCE PLAN

     We account for stock options using the intrinsic value method as defined by
APB 25:  Accounting  for Stock Issued to Employees.  Under the terms of the 2000
Stock Incentive Plan ("Incentive  Plan"), we reserved 3,500,000 shares of common
stock for grants to be issued  during a period of up to ten years.  Options  are
exercisable  at the market  price at the date of grant,  expire five years after
date of grant for over 10%  owners and ten years from the date of grant for less
than 10% owners. Directors' shares vest over three years while other grants vest
over five years or as defined in an employee's contract. Directors, officers and
employees are eligible to  participate  in the  Incentive  Plan. At December 31,
2003,  there  were  2,282,630   outstanding   options  granted  to  21  eligible
participants. Additionally, 350,278 shares of restricted stock have been granted
under the  provisions of the Incentive  Plan. The market value of the restricted
shares on the date of the award was recorded as unearned compensation-restricted
stock,  with  the  unamortized   balance  shown  as  a  separate   component  of
stockholders  equity.  Unearned  compensation is amortized to expense  generally
over the vesting period.

     During 2000,  1,040,000 Dividend Equivalent Rights were granted to eligible
employees.  A Dividend  Equivalent  Right  entitles the  participant  to receive
payments from us in an amount determined by reference to any cash dividends paid
on a specified  number of shares of stock to our  stockholders  of record during
the period such rights are  effective.  During 2001,  payments of $502,500  were
made in settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights in connection with cancellation
of options on 1,005,000 shares.

     Statement  of  Financial   Accounting  Standard  No.  148,  Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation  -  Transition  and  Disclosure,  which was  effective
January  1,  2003,  requires  certain  disclosures  related  to our  stock-based
compensation arrangements. The following table presents the effect on net income
and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value  recognition  provisions
of SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for  Stock-Based  Compensation,  to our stock-based
compensation.

     The  Black-Scholes  options  valuation  model  was  developed  for  use  in
estimating the fair value of traded  options which have no vesting  restrictions
and are fully  transferable.  In addition,  option  valuation models require the
input of highly  subjective  assumptions,  including  the  expected  stock price
volatility.   Because  our   employee   stock   options   have   characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially  affect the fair value estimate,  in
management's  opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

NOTE 12 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

EXPLORER HOLDINGS, L.P.

     Hampstead,  through its  affiliate  Explorer,  indirectly  owned  1,048,420
shares of Series C preferred  stock and  12,539,078  shares of our common stock,
representing  54.2% of our  outstanding  voting  power as of December  31, 2003.
Daniel A. Decker, our Chairman of the Board, is a principal of Hampstead. Donald
J. McNamara, the Chairman of Hampstead, is one of our directors.  Christopher W.
Mahowald is one of our directors and holds an equity investment in Explorer.

     SERIES C INVESTMENT  AGREEMENT.  Under the terms of an investment agreement
dated May 11,  2000  between  us and  Explorer  in  connection  with  Explorer's
purchase of Series C preferred  stock and an investment  agreement dated October
25,  2001  between us and  Explorer in  connection  with  Explorer's  additional
investment,  we agreed to reimburse Explorer for its out-of-pocket  expenses, up
to a maximum  amount of $2.5 million,  incurred in connection  with the Series C
investment.   As  of  December  31,  2002,  we  have  reimbursed   Explorer  for
approximately  $2.2 million of these  expenses,  including  $0.4 million  during
2002.

     ADVISORY  AGREEMENT.  Under the terms of an amended and  restated  advisory
agreement  dated  October  4, 2000  between us and  Hampstead,  we agreed to pay
Explorer an advisory fee if Hampstead  provided  assistance  to us in connection
with the evaluation of growth  opportunities or other financing matters. On June
1, 2001, in connection with Hampstead's  agreement to provide certain  specified
financial  advisory,  consulting  and  operational  services,  including but not
limited to  assistance  in our  efforts to  refinance,  repay or extend  certain
indebtedness and assist in efforts to manage our  capitalization  and liquidity,
we agreed to pay  Hampstead  a fee  equal to 1% of the  aggregate  amount of our
indebtedness  that was  refinanced,  repaid or  extended,  based on the  maximum
amount available to be drawn in the case of revolving credit facilities, up to a
maximum  fee of $3.1  million.  Upon the  closing  of the  rights  offering  and
Explorer's  investment  in February  2002,  Hampstead  had  fulfilled all of its
obligations under the agreement. The fee was paid in the third quarter of 2002.

     DIRECT  EXPENSES.  In  addition  to the Series C  investment  costs and the
Advisory Fee costs of $3.1 million, we reimbursed Explorer for Explorer's direct
expenses.  As of December 31, 2003, we reimbursed  Explorer  approximately  $0.6
million of such direct expenses.

     DIVIDEND AND GOVERNANCE RIGHT DEFERRAL. We issued 48,420 shares of Series C
preferred  stock to Explorer on April 2, 2001 in full payment of our obligations
under the dividend  deferral  letter  agreement with Explorer dated November 14,
2000  relating to the  extension of the dividend  payment  payable in connection
with our Series C preferred  stock for the  dividend  period  ended  October 31,
2000.  The  amount  of  the  deferred   dividend   payment  was  $4.667  million
representing the total unpaid  preferential  cumulative dividend for the October
2000  dividend.  In exchange for the deferral,  we also agreed to pay Explorer a
fee equal to 10% of the daily unpaid  principal  balance of the unpaid  dividend
amount from November 15, 2000 until the dividend was paid.

OMEGA WORLDWIDE

     In  December  2003,  we sold our  investment  in the  Principal  Healthcare
Finance Trust, an Australian  Unit Trust,  which owns 47 nursing home facilities
and 446 assisted living units in Australia and New Zealand,  realizing  proceeds
of  approximately  $1.6 million,  net of closing  costs,  resulting in a gain of
approximately $0.1 million.

     During 2002, we sold our investment in Omega Worldwide, Inc. ("Worldwide"),
a company which  provides  asset  management  services and  management  advisory
services,  as well as  equity  and  debt  capital  to the  healthcare  industry,
particularly  residential  healthcare  services  to the  elderly.  Pursuant to a
tender offer by Four Seasons Health Care Limited ("Four Seasons") for all of the
outstanding shares of common stock of Worldwide,  we sold our investment,  which
consisted of 1.2 million  shares of common stock and 260,000 shares of preferred
stock,  to  Four  Seasons  for  cash  proceeds  of  approximately  $7.4  million
(including $3.5 million for preferred stock  liquidation  preference and accrued
preferred  dividends).   In  addition,  we  sold  our  investment  in  Principal
Healthcare  Finance  Limited  ("Principal"),  an Isle of Jersey  company,  whose
purpose is to invest in  nursing  homes and  long-term  care  facilities  in the
United  Kingdom,  which  consisted  of 990,000  ordinary  shares and warrants to
purchase  185,033  ordinary  shares,  to an  affiliate  of Four Seasons for cash
proceeds of $2.8 million. Both transactions were completed in September 2002 and
provided  aggregate cash proceeds of $10.2 million.  We realized a gain from the
sale of our  investments  in Worldwide  and  Principal of $2.2 million which was
recorded in gain (loss) on assets  sold in our  audited  consolidated  financial
statements. We no longer own any interest in Worldwide or Principal.

NOTE 13 - DIVIDENDS

     In order to qualify as a REIT,  we are  required  to  distribute  dividends
(other than capital gain  dividends) to our  stockholders  in an amount at least
equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our "REIT taxable income"  (computed  without
regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of
the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (B) the sum
of certain items of non-cash income. In addition,  if we dispose of any built-in
gain asset during a  recognition  period,  we will be required to  distribute at
least  90%  of  the  built-in  gain  (after  tax),  if  any,  recognized  on the
disposition of such asset. Such  distributions  must be paid in the taxable year
to which they relate,  or in the  following  taxable year if declared  before we
timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular
dividend payment after such  declaration.  In addition,  such  distributions are
required  to be made  pro  rata,  with no  preference  to any  share of stock as
compared  with other  shares of the same class,  and with no  preference  to one
class of stock as compared  with  another  class  except to the extent that such
class is entitled to such a preference.  To the extent that we do not distribute
all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of
our "REIT  taxable  income," as  adjusted,  we will be subject to tax thereon at
regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates.

     On  February  1,  2001,  we  announced  the  suspension  of all  common and
preferred dividends.

     In  July  2003,  our  Board  of  Directors  declared  a  full  catch-up  of
cumulative,  unpaid  dividends for all classes of preferred stock that were paid
on August 15, 2003 to  preferred  stockholders  of record on August 5, 2003.  In
addition, our Board of Directors declared the regular quarterly dividend for all
classes of  preferred  stock that was also paid on August 15, 2003 to  preferred
stockholders  of  record  on August 5,  2003.  Series A and  Series B  preferred
stockholders  of record on August 5, 2003 were paid  dividends  in the amount of
approximately $6.36 and $5.93 per preferred share,  respectively,  on August 15,
2003. Our Series C preferred  stockholder  was paid a dividend of  approximately
$27.31 per Series C preferred share on August 15, 2003.

     In  September  2003,  our Board of  Directors  reinstated  our common stock
dividend that was paid on November 17, 2003 to common  stockholders of record on
October 31, 2003 in the amount of $0.15 per common  share.  Total  common  stock
cash dividends  totaled  approximately  $5.6 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2003.

     In  addition,  our  Board  of  Directors  declared  its  regular  quarterly
dividends for all classes of preferred  stock that was paid on November 17, 2003
to preferred  stockholders of record on October 31, 2003.  Series A and Series B
preferred  stockholders of record on October 31, 2003 were paid dividends in the
amount of approximately $0.578 and $0.539 per preferred share, respectively,  on
November 17,  2003.  Our Series C preferred  stockholder  was paid a dividend of
$2.50 per Series C  preferred  share on November  17,  2003.  Regular  quarterly
dividends  represented  dividends for the period August 1, 2003 through  October
31, 2003.  Total  preferred cash dividend  payments for all classes of preferred
stock totaled  approximately  $59.9 million for the twelve months ended December
31, 2003.

     Per share  distributions by our company were characterized in the following
manner for income tax purposes:

dividend to be paid on February  13,  2004 to common  stockholders  of record on
February  2, 2004 in the amount of $0.17 per common  share.  Also on January 21,

classes of  preferred  stock.  Series A and Series B preferred  stockholders  of
record on February 2, 2004 will be paid dividends in the amount of approximately
$0.578 and $0.539 per preferred share,  respectively,  on February 13, 2004. Our
Series C  preferred  stockholder  will be paid a dividend  of $2.72 per Series C

NOTE 14 - LITIGATION

     We are  subject  to various  legal  proceedings,  claims and other  actions
arising out of the normal  course of  business.  While any legal  proceeding  or
claim has an element of  uncertainty,  management  believes  that the outcome of
each lawsuit claim or legal proceeding that is pending or threatened,  or all of
them  combined,  will not have a  material  adverse  effect on our  consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

     On June 21,  2000,  we were  named as a  defendant  in  certain  litigation
brought  against  us in the U.S.  District  Court for the  Eastern  District  of
Michigan,  Detroit Division,  by Madison/OHI  Liquidity Investors,  LLC, for the
breach and/or  anticipatory  breach of a revolving  loan  commitment.  Ronald M.
Dickerman  and Bryan  Gordon are  partners  in Madison  and  limited  guarantors
("Guarantors")  of Madison's  obligations  to us.  Effective as of September 30,
2002, the parties settled all claims in the suit in  consideration  of Madison's
payment of the sum of $5.4 million consisting of a $0.4 million cash payment for
our attorneys' fees, with the balance evidenced by the amendment of the existing
promissory  note from  Madison to us. The note  reflects a principal  balance of
$5.0 million,  with interest accruing at 9% per annum,  payable over three years
upon  liquidation  of the  collateral  securing the note. The note is also fully
guaranteed by the Guarantors;  provided that if all accrued  interest and 75% of
original  principal has been repaid  within 18 months,  the  Guarantors  will be
released.  Accordingly, a reserve of $1.25 million was recorded in 2002 relating
to this note. As of December 31, 2003,  the  principal  balance on this note was
$2.2 million prior to reserves.

     In 2000, we filed suit against a title company  (later adding a law firm as
a  defendant),  seeking  damages  based on  claims of  breach  of  contract  and
negligence,  among  other  things,  as a result of the  alleged  failure to file
certain Uniform  Commercial Code ("UCC")  financing  statements in our favor. We
filed a subsequent suit seeking recovery under title insurance  policies written
by the  title  company.  The  defendants  denied  the  allegations  made  in the
lawsuits.  In settlement of our claims against the defendants,  we agreed in the
first  quarter of 2003 to accept a lump sum cash  payment of $3.2  million.  The
cash proceeds were offset by related expenses incurred of $1.0 million resulting
in a net gain of $2.2 million.

     On December 29, 1998, Karrington Health, Inc.  ("Karrington")  brought suit
against us in the  Franklin  County,  Ohio,  Common  Pleas  Court  (subsequently
removed to the U.S.  District Court for the Southern  District of Ohio,  Eastern
Division)  alleging  that we  repudiated  and  ultimately  breached a  financing
contract to provide $95 million of financing for the  development of 13 assisted
living facilities.  Karrington was seeking recovery of approximately $34 million
in damages it alleged to have incurred as a result of the breach.  On August 13,
2001, we paid Karrington $10 million to settle all claims arising from the suit,
but  without  our  admission  of any  liability  or fault,  which  liability  is
expressly  denied.  Based on the  settlement,  the suit has been  dismissed with
prejudice. The settlement was recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2001.

     We  and  several  of our  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  have  been  named  as
defendants in  professional  liability  claims related to our owned and operated
facilities. Other third-party managers responsible for the day-to-day operations
of these facilities have also been named as defendants in these claims. In these
suits, patients of certain previously owned and operated facilities have alleged
significant  damages,  including  punitive  damages against the defendants.  The
lawsuits  are in various  stages of  discovery  and we are unable to predict the
likely  outcome at this time. We continue to vigorously  defend these claims and
pursue all rights we may have against the managers of the facilities,  under the
terms of the management  agreements.  We have insured these matters,  subject to
self-insured retentions of various amounts.

NOTE 15 - SEVERANCE, MOVING AND CONSULTING AGREEMENT COSTS

     We entered into several consulting and severance agreements in 2001 related
to the resignation of certain of our company's senior managers.  In addition, we
incurred  certain  relocation costs in 2001 associated with our corporate office
move from Michigan to Maryland, effective January 2002. Costs incurred for these
items total $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.

are not included in reported  revenues for the year ended  December 31, 2003, no
adjustment is necessary to exclude nursing home revenues.

NOTE 19 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

     The  implementation  of SFAS No.  144,  Accounting  for the  Impairment  or
Disposal  of  Long-Lived  Assets,  as  of  January  1,  2002,  resulted  in  the
presentation  of the net  operating  results on  facilities  sold during 2003 as
income from discontinued operations for all periods presented. We incurred a net
loss from  discontinued  operations  of $0.3  million,  $10.9  million  and $1.1
million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively,  in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.

     Upon adoption of SFAS No. 144, long-lived assets sold or designated as held
for sale after  January 1, 2002 are reported as  discontinued  operations in our
financial statements. All properties sold in 2002 were classified as assets held
for sale in 2001. Accordingly,  they are subject to SFAS 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of  Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed and
have not been reported as discontinued operations in our financial statements.

     The following  table  summarizes  the results of operations of the sold and
held for sale  facilities for the years ended December 31, 2003,  2002 and 2001,
respectively.

NOTE 20 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

SERIES D PREFERRED OFFERING; SERIES C PREFERRED REPURCHASE AND CONVERSION

     On February 5, 2004, we entered into a Repurchase and Conversion  Agreement
with Explorer,  pursuant to which Explorer granted us an option to repurchase up
to 700,000 shares of Series C preferred stock at $145.92 per share (or $9.12 per
share of common stock on an as converted basis), provided we purchased a minimum
of $100  million on or prior to  February  27,  2004.  Explorer  also  agreed to
convert all of its remaining  shares of Series C preferred  stock into shares of
our common stock upon exercise of the  repurchase  option.  At the time Explorer
entered into the Repurchase and Conversation Agreement, Explorer held all of our
outstanding  Series  C  preferred  stock,  which  had an  aggregate  liquidation
preference of $104,842,000,  and was convertible at the holder's option into our
common stock at a conversion price of $6.25 per share.

     On February 10, 2004, we sold in a registered  direct  placement  4,739,500
shares of our 8.375% Series D cumulative  redeemable  preferred stock at $25 per
share  for net  proceeds,  after  fees and  expenses,  of  approximately  $114.9
million.  The Series D preferred stock may be redeemed at par at our election on
or after the fifth anniversary of the original issue date. These securities rank
pari  passu  with  the  Series  A and  Series  B  preferred  stock  and  are not
convertible into any other Omega securities. The Series D preferred stock has no
stated maturity and is not be subject to a sinking fund or mandatory redemption.

     We used  approximately  $102.1  million of the net proceeds of the Series D
preferred  stock  offering to  repurchase  700,000  shares of Series C preferred
stock from Explorer as of February 10, 2004 pursuant to the  repurchase  option.
In connection with the  transaction,  Explorer  converted its remaining  348,420
shares of Series C preferred stock into 5,574,720 shares of common stock.

     As a result of the offering of Series D preferred stock, the application of
$102.1  million of the net proceeds  received to  repurchase  700,000  shares of
Series C preferred, and the conversion of the remaining Series C preferred stock
into shares of our common stock, (i) no Series C preferred stock is outstanding,
and we plan to re-classify the remaining authorized shares of Series C preferred
stock as authorized  but unissued  preferred  stock,  without  designation as to
class;  (ii)  4,739,500  shares of our  8.375%  Series D  cumulative  redeemable
preferred stock, with an aggregate liquidation preference of $118,487,500,  have
been issued; and (iii) Explorer holds, as of the date of this report, 18,118,246
shares of our common stock, representing  approximately 41.5% of our outstanding
common stock. Under the stockholders agreement between Explorer and the company,
Explorer continues to be entitled to designate four of our ten directors.

                                  CERTIFICATION

I, C. Taylor Pickett, Chief Executive Officer, certify that:

1.   I have  reviewed  this  annual  report  on Form  10-K of  Omega  Healthcare
     Investors, Inc.;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material  fact or omit to state a  material  fact  necessary  to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which such statements
     were made,  not  misleading  with  respect  to the  period  covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and  other  financial
     information  included  in  this  report,  fairly  present  in all  material
     respects the financial  condition,  results of operations and cash flows of
     the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.   The  registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I are  responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the registrant and have:

     a.   Designed  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  or caused such
          disclosure   controls  and   procedures  to  be  designed   under  our
          supervision,  to ensure  that  material  information  relating  to the
          registrant,  including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities,  particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     b.   Evaluated the  effectiveness of the registrant's  disclosure  controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions  about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end
          of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

     c.   Disclosed  in this  report  any  change in the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          fourth fiscal quarter that has materially  affected,  or is reasonably
          likely to materially  affect,  the registrant's  internal control over
          financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on
     our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
     the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board
     of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     a.   All significant  deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation  of internal  control  over  financial  reporting  which are
          reasonably  likely to  adversely  affect the  registrant's  ability to
          record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

     b.   Any fraud, whether or not material,  that involves management or other
          employees who have a  significant  role in the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting.

                                  CERTIFICATION

I, Robert O. Stephenson, Chief Financial Officer, certify that:

1.   I have  reviewed  this  annual  report  on Form  10-K of  Omega  Healthcare
     Investors, Inc.;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material  fact or omit to state a  material  fact  necessary  to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which such statements
     were made,  not  misleading  with  respect  to the  period  covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and  other  financial
     information  included  in  this  report,  fairly  present  in all  material
     respects the financial  condition,  results of operations and cash flows of
     the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.   The  registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I are  responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the registrant and have:

     a.   Designed  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  or caused such
          disclosure   controls  and   procedures  to  be  designed   under  our
          supervision,  to ensure  that  material  information  relating  to the
          registrant,  including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities,  particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     b.   Evaluated the  effectiveness of the registrant's  disclosure  controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions  about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end
          of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

     c.   Disclosed  in this  report  any  change in the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          fourth fiscal quarter that has materially  affected,  or is reasonably
          likely to materially  affect,  the registrant's  internal control over
          financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on
     our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
     the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board
     of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     a.   All significant  deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation  of internal  control  over  financial  reporting  which are
          reasonably  likely to  adversely  affect the  registrant's  ability to
          record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

     b.   Any fraud, whether or not material,  that involves management or other
          employees who have a  significant  role in the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting.
