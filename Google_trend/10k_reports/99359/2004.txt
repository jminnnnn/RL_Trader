SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
AND SECTION 21E OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934:

      Certain of the statements contained in the body of this Report are
forward-looking statements (rather than historical facts) that are subject to
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those described in the forward-looking statements. In the preparation of
this Report, where such forward-looking statements appear, the Company has
sought to accompany such statements with meaningful cautionary statements
identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. A description
of the principal risks and uncertainties inherent in the Company's business is
included herein under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Readers of this Report are
encouraged to read these cautionary statements carefully.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL

      TransTechnology Corporation designs, develops, manufactures and sells
sophisticated lifting equipment for specialty aerospace and defense
applications. TransTechnology Corporation was originally organized in 1962 as a
California corporation and reincorporated in Delaware in 1986. Unless the
context otherwise requires, references to the "Company" or the "Registrant"
refer to TransTechnology Corporation (including the California corporation prior
to the reincorporation) and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company's fiscal
year ends on March 31. Accordingly, all references to years in this report refer
to the fiscal year ended March 31 of the indicated year.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND RESTRUCTURING

      On January 19, 2001, the Company announced its intention to restructure
and divest its cold-headed products (TCR), retaining ring (Seeger-Orbis,
TransTechnology (GB), TT Brasil and TransTechnology Engineered Rings USA), hose
clamp (Breeze Industrial and Pebra) and aerospace rivet (Aerospace Rivet
Manufacturers Corp.) operations. In addition, on April 12, 2001, the Company
announced that it would divest TransTechnology Engineered Components (TTEC), a
manufacturer of spring steel engineered fasteners and headlight adjusters. For
business segment reporting purposes, these above-mentioned business units,
excluding ARM for 2002, have previously been classified as the "Specialty
Fasteners Segment." The Company has reclassified these business units as
discontinued operations for all periods presented.

      A portion of the Company's interest expense for 2003 and 2002 has been
allocated to discontinued operations based upon the net asset balances
attributable to those operations. Interest expense allocated to discontinued
operations was $6.3 million and $20.1 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Income taxes have been allocated to discontinued operations in 2003 and 2002
based on the estimated tax attributes of the income and assets of the underlying
discontinued businesses.

      On July 10, 2001, the Company sold its Breeze Industrial and Pebra hose
clamp businesses to Industrial Growth Partners and members of Breeze
Industrial's management for $46.2 million, which was paid in cash. In a related
transaction, the Company sold the real estate occupied by Breeze Industrial to a
quasi-governmental organization for $2.0 million which the Company may, under
certain circumstances, be required to repurchase for $1.0 million in fiscal
2006. Proceeds from the sales were used to repay borrowings outstanding under
the Company's then current Credit Facility (the "Fleet Credit Facility").

      On December 5, 2001, the Company sold its TTEC businesses to a company
formed by affiliates of Kohlberg & Company, L.L.C. for $98.5 million, of which
$96.0 million was cash and the balance the assumption of certain liabilities
related to the purchased businesses. The cash proceeds of the sale were used to
repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility. In the fiscal
quarter ended September 30, 2001, as part of its restructuring program, the
Company reported a pre-tax asset impairment charge for TTEC in the amount of
$85.8 million to reduce the carrying value of these businesses to estimated fair
market value. This noncash charge was specifically related to the write-down of
goodwill. The sale proceeds of TTEC approximated its adjusted carrying value.

      On February 21, 2002, the Company sold its Seeger-Orbis retaining ring
business in Germany to Barnes Group Inc. for $20.0 million cash. The net
proceeds of the sale were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet
Credit Facility.

      On April 16, 2002, the Company sold its Aerospace Rivet Manufacturers
Corporation subsidiary to Allfast Fastening Systems, Inc. for $3.2 million cash.
The net proceeds of the sale were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the
Fleet Credit Facility.

                                       2
<PAGE>

      On May 30, 2002, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of
the net assets of its U.S. retaining ring business to SeaView Capital LLC for
$2.9 million of cash, a promissory note of $0.8 million and warrants for 5% of
the equity of the purchaser. The net proceeds of the sale were used to repay
borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility.

      On July 16, 2002, the Company completed the recapitalization of
TransTechnology (GB) Ltd., now known as Cirteq, Ltd., by selling 81% of its
shares to a new entity controlled by local management for $121 (one hundred
twenty-one dollars). The Company also converted $2.0 million of unsecured
intercompany debt into a $2.0 million loan secured by a first lien on Cirteq's
real property in Glusburn, England. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company
recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.9 million that is included in other income
relating to the sale of the remaining 19% interest in Cirteq, Ltd. and the
collection of the loan from Cirteq, Ltd.

      On August 6, 2002, we completed the sale of all of the shares of
TransTechnology Brasil, Ltda. for $0.7 million, of which $0.3 million was paid
in cash and the balance in installment payments. We also will be paid $0.3
million of intracompany debt due from the Brazilian unit. We used the net
proceeds of the sale to repay borrowings outstanding under our prior senior
credit agreement.

      On January 3, 2003, the Company completed the sale of TCR Corporation for
cash consideration of $10.0 million, plus the assumption of certain liabilities,
to an affiliate of MidMark Capital LLC. The net proceeds of the sale were used
to repay borrowings outstanding under the New Senior Credit Facility (as
detailed in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Senior Credit
Facility".)

      On February 24, 2003, the Company sold Norco, Inc. for $51.0 million cash
and a $1.0 million reimbursement for certain income taxes payable as a result of
the transaction to a wholly-owned subsidiary of TransDigm Inc. The net cash
proceeds were used to retire senior debt under the New Senior Credit Facility
and partially repay subordinated debt. On June 11, 2004, the Company sold the
NORCO real estate located in Ridgefield, Connecticut for $1.6 million, and
applied the net proceeds to reduce its Senior Debt under the Senior Credit
Facility.

      In fiscal 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized charges of $2.7 million
and $1.6 million, respectively, for severance and other costs related to the
corporate office restructuring, substantially all of which costs were paid by
the end of each fiscal year.

CORE BUSINESS

      As a result of the above referenced restructuring program, TransTechnology
Corporation's core business is aerospace and defense products.

      The Company conducts its business under the trade-name "Breeze-Eastern".
Breeze-Eastern is the world's largest designer and leading supplier of
performance-critical rescue hoists and cargo-hook systems. Breeze-Eastern also
manufactures weapons-handling systems, cargo winches, tie-down equipment and
tow-hook assemblies. These products are sold primarily to military and civilian
agencies and aerospace contractors.

PRODUCTS

      The Company's products are designed, developed and manufactured by
Breeze-Eastern. Breeze-Eastern specializes in the design, development and
manufacture of sophisticated lifting and restraining products, principally
helicopter rescue hoists, cargo winches, external hook systems and weapons
handling systems. Breeze-Eastern's weapons-handling systems range from cargo
handling on fixed-wing aircraft to hoisting weapons into position on
carrier-based aircraft. Management believes that Breeze-Eastern is the industry
market share leader in sales of personnel-rescue hoists and cargo hook
equipment. As a pioneer of helicopter hoist technology, Breeze-Eastern continues
to develop sophisticated helicopter hoist and winch systems, including systems
for the current generation of Blackhawk, Seahawk, Osprey, Chinook, Ecureuil,
Dolphin, Merlin/Cormorant and Super Stallion helicopters. Breeze-Eastern also
supplies equipment for the United States, Japanese and European Multiple-Launch
Rocket System and the United States High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, which
uses specialized hoists to load and unload rocket pod containers.
Breeze-Eastern's external cargo hook systems are original equipment on most
medium and heavy lift helicopters manufactured today. These hook systems range
from small 1,000-pound capacity models up to the largest 36,000-pound capacity
hooks employed on the Super Stallion helicopter. Breeze-Eastern also
manufactures aircraft and cargo tie-downs.

      Breeze-Eastern sells its products through internal marketing
representatives and several independent sales representatives and distributors.

      The Aerospace Product backlog varies substantially from time to time due
to the size and timing of orders. At March 31, 2004, the backlog of unfilled
orders was $41.0 million, compared to $46.2 million at March 31, 2003. The
majority of the March 31, 2004 backlog is expected to be shipped during fiscal
2005.

                                       3

DEFENSE INDUSTRY SALES

      Approximately 61% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2004, as
compared to 55% and 47% in 2003 and 2002, respectively, were derived from sales
to the United States Government, principally the military services of the
Department of Defense and its prime contractors. These contracts typically
contain precise performance specifications and are subject to customary
provisions which give the United States Government the contractual right of
termination for convenience. In the event of termination for convenience,
however, the Company is typically protected by provisions allowing reimbursement
for costs incurred as well as payment of any applicable fees or profits.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

      Due primarily to Federal and State legislation which imposes liability,
regardless of fault, upon commercial product manufacturers for environmental
harm caused by chemicals, processes and practices that were commonly and
lawfully used prior to the enactment of such legislation, the Company may be
liable for all or a portion of the environmental clean-up costs at sites
previously owned or leased by the Company (or corporations acquired by the
Company). The Company's contingencies associated with environmental matters are
described in Note 13 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included
elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

COMPETITION

      The Company competes in some markets with entities that are larger and
have substantially greater financial and technical resources than the Company.
Generally, competitive factors include design capabilities, product performance,
delivery and price. The Company's ability to compete successfully in such
markets will depend on its ability to develop and apply technological
innovations and to expand its customer base and product lines. The Company is
successfully doing so both internally and through acquisitions. There can be no
assurance that the Company will continue to successfully compete in any or all
of the businesses discussed above. The failure of the Company to compete could
have a materially adverse effect on the Company's profitability.

RAW MATERIALS

      The various components and raw materials used by the Company to produce
its products are generally available from more than one source. In those
instances where only a single source for any material is available, such items
can generally be redesigned to accommodate materials made by other suppliers. In
some cases, the Company stocks an adequate supply of the single source materials
for use until a new supplier can be approved. The Company's business is not
dependent upon a single supplier or a few suppliers, the loss of which would
have a materially adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial
position.

EMPLOYEES

      As of June 18, 2004, the Company employed 183 people. There were 177
persons employed with the Breeze-Eastern operation and 6 with the corporate
office.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND SALES

      The Company has no foreign-based facilities. The Company had export sales
of $22.6 million, $21.9 million and $21.5 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, representing 35%, 40% and 45% of the Company's consolidated net
sales in each of those years, respectively. The risk and profitability attendant
to these sales is generally comparable to similar products sold in the United
States. Net export sales by geographic area and domicile of customers are set
forth in Note 14 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" which is
included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

      The following table sets forth certain information concerning the
Company's principal facilities:

                      and manufacturing plant
</TABLE>

      The Company believes that such facilities are suitable and adequate for
the Company's foreseeable needs and that additional space, if necessary, will be
available. The Company continues to own property that it no longer needs in its
operations. These properties are located in Pennsylvania, New York and New
Jersey. On June 11, 2004, the Company sold its property in Connecticut. In some
instances, the properties are leased or subleased or are for sale or are under
contract for sale.

GENERAL

      We design, develop and manufacture sophisticated lifting equipment for
specialty aerospace and defense applications. With over 50% of the global
market, we have long been recognized as the world's largest designer and leading
supplier of performance-critical rescue hoists and cargo-hook systems. We also
manufacture weapons-handling systems, cargo winches, tie-down equipment and
tow-hook assemblies. Marketed under the trade name "Breeze-Eastern", our
products are designed to be efficient and reliable in extreme operating
conditions. Our equipment is used to complete rescue operations and military
insertion/extraction operations, move and transport cargo, and load weapons onto
aircraft and ground-based launching systems.

      Beginning in fiscal 2001, we implemented a restructuring plan to focus our
resources and capital on our aerospace and defense products business and exit
the specialty fastener segment. On February 24, 2003, we completed the sale of
the business and substantially all of the assets of our subsidiary, Norco, Inc.,
to Marathon Power Technologies Company, a division of TransDigm Inc., for cash
consideration of $51.0 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. This
transaction completed our divestiture program. As a result, our discontinued
operations for fiscal 2003 and 2002 include Norco, Inc. and all of the
operations related to our Specialty Fastener segment, including the
TransTechnology Engineered Rings retaining rings businesses, Aerospace Rivet
Manufacturers Corp. and TCR Corporation. Of the operations included in
discontinued operations prior to fiscal 2003, only the operations of
TransTechnology Engineered Rings USA, Inc., TransTechnology (GB) Limited,
TransTechnology Brasil Ltda., Aerospace Rivet Manufacturers Corporation, TCR
Corporation and Norco, Inc. were carried into fiscal 2003.

      All discussions related to our ongoing operations, or to TransTechnology
Corporation, which include our results of operations, refer only to continuing
operations, which consists of our Breeze-Eastern business. We discuss our
discontinued operations separately under the heading " -- Divestitures and
Discontinued Operations."

      All references to years in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to the fiscal year ended
March 31 of the indicated year unless otherwise specified.

      As previously reported, we are subject to an investigation being conducted
by the Newark, New Jersey office of the United States Attorney with respect to
Breeze-Eastern's overhaul and repair operations. We have, to date, cooperated
fully and will continue to cooperate fully with the government's investigation.
In addition, the Board of Directors retained a fact finding and forensic
accounting firm, The Bradlau Group of Morristown, New Jersey, to perform an
independent review of the overhaul and repair operations of our Breeze-Eastern
business. The Board of Directors has shared the preliminary and follow-on
reports of the findings of this independent review with the United States
Attorney's office. The investigation has had no impact, and we do not expect an
impact, on our ability to manufacture and ship products and meet customer
delivery schedules. As of this date, the United States Attorney's investigation
is continuing and we have not been made aware of any specific statutory or
regulatory violations resulting from that investigation.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue at the later of 1) when products
are shipped to customers or 2) when title passes to customers.

      Inventory. We purchase materials to manufacture components for use in our
products and for use by our engineering, repair and overhaul business. Our
decision to purchase a set quantity of a particular item is influenced by
several factors including current and projected cost, future estimated
availability, lead time for production of the materials, existing and projected
contracts to produce certain items and the estimated needs for our repair and
overhaul business.

      We value our inventories using the lower of cost or market on a first-in
first-out (FIFO) basis. We reduce the carrying amount of these inventories to
net realizable value based on our assessment of inventory that is considered
excess or obsolete using a formula based on firm sales orders and historical
usage. Since all of our products are produced to meet firm sales orders, our
focus for reserves is on the purchased and manufactured parts.

      Environmental Reserves. We provide for environmental reserves when, after
consultation with our internal and external counsel and other environmental
consultants, we determine that a liability is both probable and estimable. In
many cases, we do not fix or cap the liability for a particular site when we
first record it. Factors that affect the recorded amount of the liability in
future years include our participation percentage due to a settlement by, or
bankruptcy of, other potentially responsible parties, a change in the
environmental laws requiring more stringent requirements, a change in the
estimate of future costs that will be incurred to remediate the site, changes in
technology related to environmental remediation and appropriate discount factors
to reflect the net present value of expected expenditures.

                                       7
<PAGE>

      We discuss current estimated exposure to environmental claims under the
caption " -- Environmental Matters."

      Financial Derivatives. Until July 5, 2002, we had outstanding interest
rate swaps in association with our prior senior credit agreement. We valued
these swaps using estimates based on then-prevailing interest rates and the
amount we were required to pay was impacted significantly by changes in interest
rates. We no longer hold any such agreements. Additionally, we were required to
treat our outstanding warrants as financial derivatives and mark these
securities to market at the end of each accounting period, resulting in the
recognition of a gain or loss in each period. This mark-to-market requirement
terminated at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2004 as the put feature
causing the warrants to be treated as derivatives expired during that period.

      Deferred Tax Assets. This asset, for which no valuation allowance was
needed, represents income tax benefits expected to be realized in the future,
primarily as a result of the use of net operating loss carry-forwards. Because
we expect to generate adequate amounts of taxable income prior to the expiration
of the tax loss carry-forwards in 2006 through 2024, no valuation allowance is
considered necessary. If we do not generate adequate taxable earnings, some or
all of our deferred tax assets may not be realized. Additionally, changes to the
federal and state income tax laws also could impact our ability to use the net
operating loss carryforwards. The State of New Jersey, in response to a budget
crisis, has suspended through fiscal 2004 the ability of a corporation to use a
net operating loss carryforward against taxable income earned in the state. As a
result, we are required to pay New Jersey income taxes (if any) for fiscal years
2003 and 2004 in spite of losses being carried forward. It is possible that the
State of New Jersey could extend the suspension.

      Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets (excluding financial
instruments and deferred tax assets) and certain identifiable intangibles with
finite useful lives to be held and used are reviewed by us for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recoverable. Such circumstances include, but are not limited
to, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, a significant change
in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant physical
change in an asset, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the
business climate that could affect the value of an asset, or an adverse action
or assessment by a regulator. If a review for recoverability is necessary, we
estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. In
performing these estimates, we group our assets at the lowest level for which
there are identifiable cash flows (including divestitures of certain businesses
in prior years). If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and
without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an
impairment loss is recognized. Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
Any impairment loss recognized is measured as the excess of carrying amount of
the asset over the fair value of the asset.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

      Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003

      Net sales. Our sales increased to $64.6 million for fiscal 2004, a 17%
increase over sales of $55.0 million for fiscal 2003. This increase in sales is
the result of higher shipments of rescue hoists and cargo hooks for military and
civil rescue agencies and shipments of our HLU-196 Bomb Hoist to the U.S. Navy.
The HLU-196 Bomb Hoist is a newly developed product for which we were under
contract to the U.S. Navy to deliver approximately 550 units with 13 units
remaining which will be shipped in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.

      Gross profit. Gross profit increased 14% to $28.1 million for fiscal 2004
from $24.6 million for fiscal 2003. Generally, repair and overhaul services and
spare parts sales have higher gross margins than sales of new equipment or
engineering services. Notwithstanding improved gross margins realized in fiscal
2004 for new equipment versus 2003, the change in product mix to one that was
more heavily weighted in favor of new equipment led to a decrease in gross
margin to 43.5% in fiscal 2004 from 44.7% in fiscal 2003. Generally, we cannot
predict changes in our product mix between aftermarket sales and new equipment
sales for any given period because the changes result primarily from the timing
of our customers' orders, over which we have little control.

      General, administrative and selling expenses. General, administrative and
selling expenses decreased 8% to $16.2 million in fiscal 2004 from $17.6 million
in fiscal 2003. This decrease was primarily due to lower corporate office
expenses resulting from the completion of the restructuring of the corporate
office that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. This decrease was offset
partially by approximately $1.0 million of legal and other costs associated with
the ongoing investigation by the Newark, New Jersey office of the United States
Attorney of our overhaul and repair operations

      Operating income. Operating income (gross profit less general,
administrative and selling expenses) increased 71% to $11.9 million in fiscal
2004 from $7.0 million in fiscal 2003. This increase mainly was due to higher
sales volume, the benefit of spreading fixed costs over a larger sales volume
and the reduction in corporate office expenses.

      Interest expense. Interest expense increased $1.2 million to $10.4 million
in fiscal 2004 from $9.2 million in fiscal 2003 as a result of the allocation
formula we used to apportion interest expense between continuing and
discontinued operations in fiscal 2003. We based this allocation formula for
fiscal 2003 upon the net asset balances attributable to continuing and
discontinued operations. Total

                                       8
<PAGE>

interest expense for fiscal 2004 decreased $5.0 million to $10.4 million from
$15.4 million for fiscal 2003 due to the retirement of debt with the proceeds
from divestitures and other internally generated sources of cash.

      Interest and other income. In fiscal 2004 we recorded a pre-tax gain of
$0.9 million relating to the sale of our remaining 19% interest in Cirteq, Ltd.
and the collection of a note from Cirteq, Ltd. There was no such transaction in
fiscal 2003.

      Forbearance fees. During fiscal 2004, we incurred no expense for
forbearance fees versus the $0.8 million we paid in fiscal 2003 to our lenders
under our prior senior credit agreement in exchange for their agreement not to
pursue any actions against us for violating certain financial covenants. The
elimination of this expense was the result of the refinancing of our prior
senior credit agreement in August 2002, which cured all defaults and ended the
forbearance agreements.

      Corporate office restructuring charge. In fiscal 2003 we recognized a $2.7
million charge associated with severance and other costs related to the
elimination of several positions and restructuring in our corporate office, all
of which was paid in fiscal 2003 and 2004. There was no such charge in fiscal
2004.

      Unrealized gain on warrants. As we discuss in Note 7 to the financial
statements included in this report, the warrants associated with our senior
subordinated notes due 2006 were deemed to be derivative financial instruments
for purposes of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles at the end of
fiscal 2003. As required by those principles, changes in the value of our share
price between August 7, 2002 and the end of fiscal 2003 resulted in our
recognizing a noncash, non-taxable gain of $2.0 million during fiscal 2003. We
recognized no similar gain or loss in fiscal 2004.

      Net income. We earned net income of $1.7 million in fiscal 2004, versus
net income of $9.2 million (including a gain from discontinued operations of
$13.1 million - see "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations") in fiscal 2003,
which primarily resulted from the reasons discussed above.

      New orders. New orders received in fiscal 2004 totaled $59.4 million,
which represents a 12% decrease from new orders of $67.3 million in fiscal 2003.
The rescue hoist and cargo winch product line was particularly strong in fiscal
2003 and accounted for virtually all of the decrease in fiscal 2004. Increases
in orders for cargo hooks and overhaul and repair were offset by decreases in
spares orders and engineering. Generally, new equipment sales are the subject of
high-value, long-term contracts, while repair, overhaul and spare parts sales
have much shorter lead times and a less predictable order pattern.

      Backlog. Backlog at March 31, 2004 was $41.0 million, down $5.2 million
from $46.2 million at March 31, 2003. The decrease in the backlog is primarily
attributable to shipments of the HLU-196 Bomb Hoist for the U. S. Navy mentioned
above. We measure backlog by the amount of products or services that our
customers have committed by contract to purchase from us as of a given date. Our
book to bill ratio for fiscal 2004 was 0.92, compared to 1.22 for fiscal 2003.
Cancellations of purchase orders or reductions of product quantities in existing
contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog. Therefore, our
backlog may not represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future
period.

      Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002

      Net sales. Our sales increased to $55.0 million for fiscal 2003, a 15%
increase over sales of $47.8 million for fiscal 2002. This increase in sales was
the result of higher shipments of cargo hooks and weapons handling equipment for
military and civil agencies, as well as increases in sales of spare parts,
repair and overhaul of equipment already in the field and the initial shipments
of our HLU-196 Bomb Hoist to the U.S. Navy. The HLU-196 Bomb Hoist is a newly
developed product for which we are under contract to the U.S. Navy to deliver
approximately 550 units through fiscal 2004.

      Gross profit. Gross profit increased 18% to $24.6 million for fiscal 2003
from $20.9 million for fiscal 2002. Generally, repair and overhaul services and
spare parts sales have higher gross margins than sales of new equipment or
engineering services. As a result of a sales mix that was more heavily weighted
in favor of aftermarket sales due to the timing of customer orders, we recorded
slightly higher gross margins for fiscal 2003. These improvements in product
mix, combined with fixed-cost absorption on a generally higher sales volume led
to an increase in gross margin to 44.7% in fiscal 2003 from 43.7% in fiscal
2002. These margin improvements from product mix, however, were partially offset
by lower than normal gross margins on the HLU-196 Bomb Hoist, a product that was
shipped for the first time during the third quarter of fiscal 2003. While the
gross margins recognized on the initial shipments of the HLU-196 were lower than
historical gross margins, they were higher than the budgeted gross margins due
to the realization of manufacturing efficiencies not originally expected in the
initial production lots. As a result of the lower gross margins experienced on
the HLU-196, we expect future gross margins to be lower than those historically
reported. Generally, we cannot predict changes in our product mix between
aftermarket sales and new equipment sales for any given period because the
changes result primarily from the timing of our customers' orders, over which we
have little control.

      General, administrative and selling expenses. General, administrative and
selling expenses increased 4.7% to $17.6 million in fiscal 2003 from $16.8
million in fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to higher general,
administrative and selling expenses due to our higher sales volume and a
significant increase in the cost of aircraft product liability insurance, the
write-off of $0.7 million

                                       9
<PAGE>

of costs associated with our efforts to restructure the balance sheet, and a
provision of $0.4 million associated with a product liability claim from a
business sold several years ago offset by $1.2 million on a 14% reduction in
corporate office expense. The decrease in corporate office expenses during
fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the restructuring of the corporate office that
began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.

      Operating income. Operating income increased 71% to $7.0 million in fiscal
2003 from $4.1 million in fiscal 2002. This increase mainly was due to a more
favorable mix of repair, overhaul and spare parts business, a higher sales
volume, the benefit of spreading fixed costs over a larger sales volume and the
reduction in corporate office expenses.

      Interest expense. Interest expense increased $4.2 million to $9.2 million
in fiscal 2003 from $4.9 million in fiscal 2002 as a result of the allocation
formula we use to apportion interest expense between continuing and discontinued
operations. We base this allocation formula upon the net asset balances
attributable to continuing and discontinued operations. Total interest expense
for fiscal 2003 decreased $9.6 million to $15.4 million from $25.1 million for
fiscal 2002 due to the retirement of debt with the proceeds from divestitures
and other internally generated sources of cash. Assets held for sale also were
reduced substantially, however, causing a higher percentage of assets to be
allocated to continuing operations in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002, which
resulted in an increased allocation of interest expense to continuing operations
in fiscal 2003. The sale of our Norco subsidiary in February 2003 completed our
divestiture program and, accordingly, all interest expense is now charged to
continuing operations.

      Interest and other income. In March 2002, we sold excess real estate and
recorded a pre-tax gain of $1.3 million. There was no such transaction in fiscal
2003.

      Forbearance fees. During fiscal 2003, we incurred an expense of $0.8
million for forbearance fees we paid to our lenders under our prior senior
credit agreement in exchange for their agreement not to pursue any actions
against us for violating certain financial covenants. In fiscal 2002, we
incurred $2.7 million of such expenses. The reduction in these expenses was the
result of lower overall levels of debt during the current fiscal year and the
refinancing of our prior senior credit agreement in August 2002, which cured all
defaults and ended the forbearance agreements.

      Corporate office restructuring charge. In fiscal 2003 we recognized a $2.7
million charge associated with severance and other costs related to the
elimination of several positions and restructuring in our corporate office, 90%
of which was paid by the end of the first quarter of 2004. In fiscal 2002, we
recognized a $1.6 million charge associated with the restructuring of our
corporate office, related primarily to severance costs following the elimination
of several positions, all of which amounts have been paid.

      Unrealized gain on warrants. As we discuss in Note 7 to the financial
statements included in this report, the warrants associated with our senior
subordinated notes due 2006 were deemed to be derivative financial instruments
for purposes of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in fiscal 2003. As
required by those principles, changes in the value of our share price between
August 7, 2002 and the end of fiscal 2003 resulted in our recognizing a noncash,
non-taxable gain of $2.0 million during fiscal 2003. We recognized no similar
gain or loss in fiscal 2002. As the put feature of the warrants expired during
the first quarter of fiscal 2004, no future gains or losses on the warrants were
recognized.

      Net income. We earned net income of $9.2 million in fiscal 2003, versus a
loss of $71.8 million in fiscal 2002, which primarily resulted from the reasons
discussed above.

      New orders. New orders received in fiscal 2003 totaled $67.3 million,
which represents a 28% increase from new orders of $52.4 million in fiscal 2002.
The rescue hoist and cargo winch product line was particularly strong,
accounting for $14.3 million of the increase. We derived a significant portion
of fiscal 2003 orders from long-term contracts. Generally, new equipment sales
are the subject of high-value, long-term contracts, while repair, overhaul and
spare parts sales have much shorter lead times and a less predictable order
pattern.

      Backlog. Backlog at March 31, 2003 was $46.2 million, up $12.4 million
from $33.8 million at March 31, 2002. We measure backlog by the amount of
products or services that our customers have committed by contract to purchase
from us as of a given date. Our book to bill ratio for fiscal 2003 was 1.22,
compared to 1.10 for fiscal 2002. Cancellations of purchase orders or reductions
of product quantities in existing contracts could substantially and materially
reduce our backlog. Therefore, our backlog may not represent the actual amount
of shipments or sales for any future period.

      Liquidity and Capital Resources

      Our liquidity requirements depend on a number of factors, many of which
are beyond our control, including the timing of production under our long-term
contracts with the U.S. Government. Although we have infrequently received
payments on these government contracts based on performance milestones, as is
the case with our contract with the U.S. Navy for the HLU-196 Bomb Hoist, our
working capital needs fluctuate between periods as a result of changes in
program status and the timing of payments by program. Additionally, as our sales
are generally made on the basis of individual purchase orders, our liquidity
requirements vary based on the timing and volume of these orders.

                                       10

      Our restructuring and divestiture program has had a substantial impact
upon our financial condition through March 31, 2004, as we reduced debt with the
proceeds from the divestitures and lowered costs as a result of the corporate
office restructuring. At March 31, 2004 and 2003, there was no indebtedness
outstanding under our New Senior Credit Facility. The loan agreements prohibit
the payment of dividends.

      As previously reported, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has notified us
that the Company has fallen below the NYSE continued listing standards requiring
total market capitalization of not less than $50 million over a 30-day trading
period and total stockholders' equity of not less than $50 million. We have
submitted to the NYSE a plan to comply with the listing standards, which was
accepted by the NYSE on July 7, 2003. The Company periodically updates the NYSE
on developments with respect to the plan. In the event of delisting from the
NYSE, we believe an alternate trading venue would be available.

      Working Capital

      Our working capital at March 31, 2004, was $22.2 million, compared to
$11.2 million at the beginning of fiscal 2004. The ratio of current assets to
current liabilities was 2.6 to 1.0 at March 31, 2004, compared to 1.4 to 1.0 at
the beginning of fiscal 2004.

      Working capital changes during fiscal 2004 resulted from an increase in
accounts receivable of $2.0 million, an increase in inventories of $0.8 million,
a decrease in prepaid expenses of $0.5 million and an increase in real estate
held for sale of $1.4 million. The increase in accounts receivable was due to
strong shipments in March of fiscal 2004 versus the same month in fiscal 2003.
The increase in inventory was largely due to the purchase of long lead time
materials and the manufacture of work in progress needed to fulfill customers'
long-term purchase orders. The decrease in prepaid expenses was due primarily to
the receipt of an escrow deposit related to a divestiture. The increase in real
estate held for sale is due to a pending sale of the land and building retained
from a previous divestiture. The number of days that sales were outstanding in
accounts receivable increased to 35.2 days at March 31, 2004, from 31.8 days at
March 31, 2003. Inventory turnover improved to 1.79 turns from 1.55 turns over
the same time period. Current liabilities decreased $11.4 million, primarily due
to the payment of state income taxes relating to the sale of Norco, Inc. of $2.2
million, off-set by an increase of $1.1 million for income taxes due resulting
from the disposition of a former foreign affiliate, payments due to the
corporate office restructuring of $0.8 million, settlement of obligations from
divestitures of $7.5 million, reduction in customer advances of $1.5 million and
other items of $0.5 million.

      Capital Expenditures

      Our capital expenditures were $0.5 million for fiscal 2004, compared to
$0.6 million for fiscal 2003. The Company initiated the implementation of a new
enterprise resource planning system late in fiscal 2004 and expects to complete
the project in early fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, total capital expenditures are
expected to be in a range of $2.6 million to $3.3 million.

      Senior Credit Facility

      At March 31, 2004, we had a senior credit facility consisting of an $8.0
million asset based revolving credit facility which was established in August
2002 (the "New Senior Credit Facility") to refinance all remaining obligations
outstanding under our prior senior credit facility. The New Senior Credit
Facility was amended on August 5, 2003 and was amended again on January 30,
2004. The maturity date of this facility, as amended, is July 31, 2004. The
current interest rate is approximately 5.0%. The New Senior Credit Facility is
secured by all of our assets. We are in compliance with the provisions of the
facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at March 31,
2004.

      Senior Subordinated Notes

      On August 30, 2000, we completed a private placement of $75 million of
senior subordinated notes (the "Notes") and warrants to purchase shares of our
common stock (the "Warrants") to a group of institutional investors
(collectively, the "Purchasers"). We used the proceeds of the private placement
to retire, in full, a $75 million bridge loan held by a group of lenders led by
Fleet National Bank. The Notes, as amended in August 2002, are due on August 29,
2005 and bear interest at a rate of 18% per annum consisting of 13% cash
interest on principal, payable quarterly, and 5% interest on principal, payable
quarterly in "payment-in-kind" ("PIK") promissory notes. The PIK portion of the
interest rate increases 0.25% each quarter, commencing December 31, 2002 until
the Notes are retired. We may prepay the Notes after August 29, 2001, at a
premium initially of 9%, declining to 5%, 3% and 1% on each of the next
succeeding anniversaries of that date. The Notes contain customary financial
covenants and events of default, including a cross-default provision to our
senior debt obligations. We are in compliance with the provisions of the Notes.
At March 31, 2004, the principal balance outstanding on the Notes amounted to
$56.4 million, which included the original principal amount plus the PIK notes.
At March 31, 2003, we reported redeemable common stock in the amount of $1.3
million representing the per share put right (257,000 shares at $5.00 per share)
held by certain Purchasers who had exercised their Warrants and recorded a $2.0
million noncash, non-taxable gain relating to the mark-to-market accounting of
the Warrants as a derivative. The put right on approximately 211,000 shares
expired on June 24, 2003 and, accordingly, we reclassified in the first quarter
of 2004, $1.1 million from redeemable common stock to additional paid in capital
with the remainder of the redeemable common stock being reclassified to
long-term debt to reflect the

                                       11
<PAGE>

exercise of the put by a Purchaser. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter
of 2004, the Purchaser revoked its put exercise and that portion was
reclassified to additional paid in capital in the second quarter. In addition,
the put right on 171,041 Warrants expired and, accordingly, $0.9 million
representing the cash value of the put right on these Warrants was reclassified
from a liability account to additional paid-in capital in the first quarter of
2004. At March 31, 2004, there were 171,041 Warrants outstanding which are each
convertible into common stock at the price of $.01 per warrant. These Warrants
are considered to be common stock equivalents for the purpose of calculating
basic earnings per share at March 31, 2004.

      We have long-term debt maturities of $0.1 million and $56.5 million in
fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006, respectively.

      Our operations require significant amounts of cash, and we may be required
to seek additional capital, whether from selling equity or borrowing money, for
the future growth and development of our business or to fund our operations and
inventory, particularly in the event of a market downturn. Although currently we
have the ability to borrow additional sums under the New Senior Credit Facility,
this facility contains a borrowing base provision and financial covenants which
may limit the amount we can borrow. Also, while we continue to have on-going
discussions with prospective lenders, we may not be able to replace or renew the
New Senior Credit Facility upon its expiration on terms that are favorable to
us. In addition, a number of factors could affect our ability to access debt or
equity financing, including our financial strength and credit rating, the
financial market's confidence in our management team and financial reporting,
general economic conditions, the conditions in the defense and aerospace
industries and overall capital market conditions.

      Even if available, additional financing could be costly or have adverse
consequences. If we raise additional funds by issuing stock, dilution to
stockholders may result. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt, we will
incur increased debt servicing costs and may become subject to additional
restrictive financial and other covenants. We can give no assurance as to the
terms or availability of additional capital. If we were not successful in
obtaining sufficient capital, it could reduce our sales and earnings and
adversely impact our financial position and we may not be able to expand or
operate our business as planned.

TAX BENEFITS FROM NET OPERATING LOSSES

      At March 31, 2004, we had federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $58.0 million and $77.4 million,
respectively, which are due to expire in fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2024. These
NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income through their respective
expiration dates and thereby reduce or eliminate our federal and state income
taxes otherwise payable. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code") imposes significant limitations on the utilization of NOLs in the event
of an "ownership change" as defined under section 382 of the Code (the "Section
382 Limitation"). The Section 382 Limitation is an annual limitation on the
amount of pre-ownership NOLs that a corporation may use to offset its
post-ownership change income. The Section 382 Limitation is calculated by
multiplying the value of a corporation's stock immediately before an ownership
change by the long-term tax-exempt rate (as published by the Internal Revenue
Service). Generally, an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation if
the aggregate increase in the percentage of stock ownership by value of that
corporation by one or more 5% shareholders (including specified groups of
shareholders who in the aggregate own at least 5% of that corporation's stock)
exceeds 50 percentage points over a three-year testing period. We believe that
we have not gone through an ownership change that would cause our NOLs to be
subject to the Section 382 Limitation.

DIVESTITURES AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

      During fiscal 2001, we implemented a restructuring plan to focus our
resources and capital on our aerospace and defense products business and exit
the specialty fastener segment. As a result, our discontinued operations in
fiscal 2003 and 2002 include all of the operations related to our specialty
fastener segment, which includes all of the divested operations we describe
below.

      On July 10, 2001, we sold our Breeze Industrial and Pebra hose clamp
businesses to Industrial Growth Partners and members of Breeze Industrial's
management for $46.2 million in cash. In a related transaction, we sold the real
estate occupied by Breeze Industrial to a quasi-governmental organization for
$2.0 million which we may, under certain circumstances, be required to
repurchase for $1.0 million in fiscal 2006. We used the proceeds from these
sales to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility.

      On December 5, 2001, we sold TransTechnology Engineered Components to a
company formed by affiliates of Kohlberg & Company, L.L.C. for $98.5 million, of
which $96.0 million was cash and the balance the assumption of certain
liabilities related to the purchased businesses. We used the cash proceeds of
the sale to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility. In the
fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2001, as part of our restructuring program,
we reported a pre-tax asset impairment charge for TransTechnology Engineered
Components, Inc. in the amount of $85.8 million to reduce the carrying value of
these businesses to estimated fair market value. This noncash charge was related
specifically to the write-down of goodwill. The sale proceeds of TransTechnology
Engineered Components approximated our adjusted carrying value.

      On February 21, 2002, we sold Seeger-Orbis to Barnes Group Inc. for $20.0
million cash. We used the net proceeds of the sale to repay borrowings
outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility. Our balance sheet contains a
noncurrent asset and a noncurrent liability

                                       12
<PAGE>

in the amount of $3.7 million relating to the pension plan of Seeger-Orbis.
These amounts represent our legal liability under German law and the
indemnification we received from the buyer of the business for that liability.

      On April 16, 2002, we sold Aerospace Rivet Manufacturers Corporation to
Allfast Fastening Systems, Inc. for $3.2 million in cash. We used the net
proceeds of the sale to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit
Facility.

      On May 30, 2002, we completed the sale of substantially all of the net
assets of TransTechnology Engineered Rings (USA) to a newly formed affiliate of
Sea View Capital LLC for $2.9 million in cash, a promissory note of $0.8 million
and warrants for 5% of the equity of the purchaser. We used the net proceeds of
the sale to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility.

      On July 16, 2002, we completed the recapitalization of our TransTechnology
(GB) Ltd. subsidiary, now known as Cirteq, Ltd., by selling 81% of its shares to
a new entity controlled by local management for $121 (one hundred twenty-one
dollars). We also converted $2.0 million of unsecured intercompany debt into a
$2.0 million loan secured by a first lien on Cirteq's real property in Glusburn,
England. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of
$0.9 million that is included in other income relating to the sale of the
remaining 19% interest in Cirteq, Ltd. and the collection of the loan from
Cirteq, Ltd.

      On August 6, 2002, we completed the sale of all of the shares of
TransTechnology Brasil, Ltda. for $0.7 million, of which $0.3 million was paid
in cash and the balance in installment payments. We also will be paid $0.3
million of intracompany debt due from the Brazilian unit. We used the net
proceeds of the sale to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit
Facility.

      On January 3, 2003, we completed the sale of the business and
substantially all of the assets of our wholly owned subsidiary, TCR Corporation,
to a newly formed affiliate of Mid-Mark Capital LLC for $10.0 million in cash.
We used the net proceeds of the sale to repay borrowings outstanding under our
New Senior Credit Facility.

      On February 24, 2003, we sold Norco, Inc. for $51.0 million cash and a
$1.0 million reimbursement for certain income taxes payable as a result of the
transaction to a wholly owned subsidiary of TransDigm Inc. We used the net cash
proceeds to retire senior debt under the New Senior Credit Facility and
partially repay subordinated debt.

      For fiscal 2003, the $13.1 million gain from discontinued operations
included actual operating income of $7.0 million from discontinued operations, a
gain of $28.5 million from the sale of our Norco subsidiary, allocated interest
expense of $6.3 million, an $8.2 million charge to reflect the amounts
ultimately realized from sales of discontinued business units, a cash charge of
$0.2 million from the final settlement of our interest rate swap contracts, a
noncash charge of $4.6 million associated with the recognition of accumulated
currency translation losses from the sale of our Brazilian operation and a tax
provision of $3.1 million.

      For fiscal 2002, the $69.6 million loss from discontinued operations
included $110.3 million of impairment charges related to reducing the carrying
values of the discontinued businesses to their estimated net realizable values,
$12.0 million of actual operating income of the discontinued businesses through
their expected divestiture dates, $20.1 million of allocated interest expense;
$8.4 million from the write-off of capitalized loan fees and the mark-to-market
of interest rate swaps required under the terms of our credit agreements, $24.7
million of gains recognized on the sale of certain business units; and $0.2
million of other income or credits associated with the discontinued operations.
These gains and losses, which aggregated $101.9 million, were reduced by a tax
benefit of $32.3 million.

SUMMARY DISCLOSURE ABOUT CONTRACTUAL

      The following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations
for the next several years:

</TABLE>

      In addition, we have divested ten businesses since March 31, 2001. Under
the terms of the agreements associated with the sales of those businesses, we
have agreed to indemnify the purchasers for certain damages that might arise in
the event that a representation we made with respect to the divested business is
found to have contained a material misstatement, subject in each case to a
customary cap on the indemnification amount and customary limitations on the
survivability of the representations made. As of the date of this report, we
have unresolved claims for indemnification with respect to these divested
businesses that aggregate less than $0.1 million. Additionally, the terms of
these divestiture agreements generally require the calculation of purchase price
adjustments based upon the

                                       13
<PAGE>

amount of working capital or net assets transferred at the closing date. In the
case of each divestiture completed as of the filing date purchase price
adjustments have been agreed and paid.

INFLATION

      While neither inflation nor deflation has had, and we do not expect it to
have, a material impact upon operating results, we cannot assure you that our
business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future.

CONTINGENCIES

      Environmental Matters - The environmental cleanup plan presented by the
Company during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 for a portion of a site in
Pennsylvania which continues to be owned although the related business has been
sold was approved during the third quarter of fiscal 2004. This plan was
submitted pursuant to the Consent Order and Agreement with the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection ("PaDEP") concluded in fiscal 1999.
Pursuant to the Consent Order, upon its execution the Company paid $0.2 million
for past costs, future oversight expenses and in full settlement of claims made
by PaDEP related to the environmental remediation of the site with an additional
$0.2 million paid in fiscal 2001. A second Consent Order was concluded with
PaDEP in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 for another portion of the site, and a
third Consent Order for the remainder of the site was concluded in the third
quarter of fiscal 2003. An environmental cleanup plan for the portion of the
site covered by the 2003 Consent Order was presented by the Company during the
second quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company is also administering an agreed
settlement with the Federal government under which the government pays 50% of
the direct and indirect environmental response costs associated with a portion
of the site. The Company has also reached an agreement in principle with the
Federal government and is in the process of finalizing the necessary
documentation under which the Federal government will pay 45% of the direct and
indirect environmental response costs associated with another portion of the
site. At March 31, 2004, the Company's cleanup reserve was $2.0 million based on
the net present value of future expected cleanup costs. The Company expects that
remediation at the Pennsylvania site will not be completed for several years.

      The Company also continues to participate in environmental assessments and
remediation work at nine other locations, including former facilities of the
Company. The Company estimates that its potential cost for implementing
corrective action at these sites will not exceed $0.5 million payable over the
next several years, and has provided for the estimated costs in its accrual for
environmental liabilities. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the
Company entered into a consent order for a former facility in New York pursuant
to which it is developing a remediation plan for review and approval by the New
York Department of Environmental Conservation. The Company has established a
reserve of $2.4 million which it believes is adequate.

      In addition, the Company has been named as a potentially responsible party
in five environmental proceedings pending in several states in which it is
alleged that the Company was a generator of waste that was sent to landfills and
other treatment facilities and, as to one site, it is alleged that the Company
was an owner or operator. Such properties generally relate to businesses which
have been sold or discontinued. The Company estimates that its expected future
costs, and its estimated proportional share of remedial work to be performed,
associated with these proceedings will not exceed $0.2 million and has provided
for these estimated costs in its accrual for environmental liabilities.

      Litigation - The Company is also engaged in various other legal
proceedings incidental to its business. It is the opinion of management that,
after taking into consideration information furnished by its counsel, these
matters will have no material effect on the Corporation's consolidated financial
position or the results of the Corporation's operations in future periods.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

      In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of
Both Liabilities and Equity," that improves the accounting for certain financial
instruments that, under previous guidance, issuers could account for as equity.
SFAS No. 150 requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in
statement of financial position. The adoption of this standard did not have any
impact on our financial position or results of operations.

      In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133
on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" that amends and clarifies
accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under Statement 133.
With certain exceptions, SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designed after June
30, 2003. The adoption of this standard will not have any impact on our
financial position or results of operations.

      In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46R, a revision to
Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities", which
addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling
financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and
accordingly should consolidate the entity. Interpretation No. 46R clarifies some
of the provisions of Interpretation No. 46 and exempts certain entities from its
requirements. Interpretation No. 46R is effective at the end of

                                       14
<PAGE>

the first interim period ending March 15, 2004. The adoption of this statement
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of
operations.

      In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure" which amends SFAS No. 123.
This statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change
to the fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123. The
transition guidance and disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years
ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption of this statement did not have a
material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

      In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." This interpretation requires a guarantor
to recognize, at the inception of the guarantee, a liability for the fair value
of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. It also enhances
guarantor's disclosure requirements to be made in its interim and annual
financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees it has
issued. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this
interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for
financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15,
2002. In the normal course of business, we do not issue guarantees to third
parties; accordingly, this interpretation will not have any effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

      In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations," effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2002. This statement addresses the diverse accounting practices for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated
asset retirement costs. The adoption of this statement did not have any effect
on our financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

      We are exposed to various market risks, primarily changes in interest
rates associated with the New Senior Credit Facility under which there were no
borrowings at March 31, 2004.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of TransTechnology Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TransTechnology
Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, and
the related statements of consolidated operations, stockholders' equity
(deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March
31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in
the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement
schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of TransTechnology Corporation and
subsidiaries at March 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2004
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

BUSINESS - The fiscal year for TransTechnology Corporation (the "Company") ends
on March 31. Accordingly, all references to years in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements refer to the fiscal year ended March 31 of the indicated
year unless otherwise specified.

As a result of a restructuring program completed by the Company during 2003, the
Company has reclassified all of the business units that made up its Specialty
Fastener segment in prior years and its Aerospace Rivet Manufacturers
Corporation and Norco, Inc. businesses, which had been included in its Aerospace
Products segment, as discontinued operations. All references related to ongoing
operations, or the Company, refer only to continuing operations, which consists
of the Breeze-Eastern business.

The Company, which has one manufacturing facility in the United States,
develops, manufactures, sells and services a complete line of sophisticated
lifting and restraining products, principally performance critical helicopter
rescue hoist and cargo hook systems, winches and hoists for aircraft and weapons
systems.

USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. These estimates are based on historical experience and information that
is available to management about current events and actions the Company may take
in the future. Significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include
the carrying value of long-lived assets; valuation allowances for receivables,
inventories and deferred tax assets; environmental liabilities; litigation
contingencies; and obligations related to employee benefit plans. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue is recognized at the later of 1) when products are
shipped to customers, or 2) when title passes to customers.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with a maturity at date of acquisition of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.

INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes material, labor
and manufacturing overhead costs.

PROPERTY AND RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION - Property is recorded at
cost. Provisions for depreciation are made on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of depreciable assets ranging from three to thirty years.
Depreciation expense for the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $0.5
million, $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. During 2002 the Company
sold excess real estate realizing a gain of $1.3 million that is included in
other income.

EARNINGS PER SHARE ("EPS") - The computation of basic earnings per share is
based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The
computation of diluted earnings per share assumes the foregoing and, in
addition, the exercise of all dilutive stock options using the treasury stock
method.

The components of the denominator for basic earnings per common share and
diluted earnings per common share are reconciled as follows:

Options to purchase 230,135 shares of common stock at prices between $8.84 and
$19.38 were outstanding during 2004 but were not included in the computation of
diluted EPS because the options' exercise prices were greater than the average
market price of the common shares. Similarly, during 2003, options to purchase
311,411 shares of common stock at prices between $8.84 and $27.88 were
outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. During
2002, options to purchase 450,183 shares of common stock at prices between $8.84
and $27.88 were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted
EPS.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING COSTS - Research and development costs and
engineering costs, which are charged to the statements of consolidated
operations when incurred, amounted to $2.3 million, $2.3 million and $1.7
million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Included in these amounts were
expenditures of $2.0 million, $1.7 million and $1.2 million in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively, which represent costs related to research and development
activities.

INCOME TAXES - Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The
Company periodically assesses recoverability of deferred tax assets and
provisions for valuation allowances are made as required.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments
for trading purposes. The estimated liability relating to interest rate swap
agreements was accrued during 2002. These agreements were terminated and settled
in 2003.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", encourages, but does not
require, companies to record compensation cost for stock-based employee
compensation plans at fair value. The Company has chosen to continue to account
for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees" and related interpretations. Accordingly, the Company records expense
in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the quoted market price on the
grant date over the option price.

The following table includes as reported and proforma information required by
SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and
Disclosure." Proforma information is based on the fair value method under SFAS
No. 123 (in thousands except per share amounts):

</TABLE>

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity," that improves the accounting
for certain financial instruments that, under previous guidance, issuers could
account for as equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that those instruments be
classified as liabilities in statement of financial position. The adoption of
this standard did not have any impact on the Company's financial position or
results of operations.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" that amends and clarifies
accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under Statement 133.
With certain exceptions, SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designed after June
30, 2003. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46R, a revision to
Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities", which
addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling
financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and
accordingly should consolidate the entity. Interpretation No. 46R clarifies some
of the provisions of Interpretation No. 46 and exempts certain entities from its
requirements. Interpretation No. 46R is effective at the end of the first

                                       22
<PAGE>

interim period ending March 15, 2004. The adoption of this statement did not
have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure" which amends SFAS No. 123. This
statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to
the fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation
and amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123. The transition guidance
and disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2002. The adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others." This interpretation requires a guarantor to recognize,
at the inception of the guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the
obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. It also enhances guarantor's
disclosure requirements to be made in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under certain guarantees it has issued. The
initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial
statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. In the
normal course of business, the Company does not issue guarantees to third
parties; accordingly, this interpretation will not have any effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations," effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. This
statement addresses the diverse accounting practices for obligations associated
with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs. The adoption of this statement did not have any effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS - Long-lived assets (excluding financial
instruments and deferred tax assets) and certain identifiable intangibles with
finite useful lives to be held and used are reviewed by the Company for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such circumstances include,
but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset,
a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a
significant physical change in an asset, a significant adverse change in legal
factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, or
an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If a review for recoverability
is necessary, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result
from the use of the asset. In performing these estimates, the Company groups its
assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. If the
sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest
charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is
recognized. Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized. Any impairment loss
recognized is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over
the fair value of the asset.

2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND RESTRUCTURING

On January 19, 2001, the Company announced its intention to restructure and
divest its cold-headed products (TCR), retaining ring (Seeger-Orbis,
TransTechnology (GB), TT Brasil and TransTechnology Engineered Rings USA), hose
clamp (Breeze Industrial and Pebra) and aerospace rivet (Aerospace Rivet
Manufacturers Corp.) operations. In addition, on April 12, 2001, the Company
announced that it would divest TransTechnology Engineered Components (TTEC), a
manufacturer of spring steel engineered fasteners and headlight adjusters. For
business segment reporting purposes, these above-mentioned business units,
excluding ARM for 2002, have previously been classified as the "Specialty
Fasteners Segment." The Company has reclassified these business units as
discontinued operations for all periods presented.

A portion of the Company's interest expense for 2003 and 2002 has been allocated
to discontinued operations based upon the net asset balances attributable to
those operations. Interest expense allocated to discontinued operations was $6.3
million and $20.1 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Income taxes have been
allocated to discontinued operations in 2003 and 2002 based on the estimated tax
attributes of the income and assets of the underlying discontinued businesses.

On July 10, 2001, the Company sold its Breeze Industrial and Pebra hose clamp
businesses to Industrial Growth Partners and members of Breeze Industrial's
management for $46.2 million, which was paid in cash. In a related transaction,
the Company sold the real estate occupied by Breeze Industrial to a
quasi-governmental organization for $2.0 million which the Company may, under
certain circumstances, be required to repurchase for $1.0 million in fiscal
2006. Proceeds from the sales were used to repay borrowings outstanding under
the Company's then current Credit Facility (the "Fleet Credit Facility").

On December 5, 2001, the Company sold its TTEC businesses to a company formed by
affiliates of Kohlberg & Company, L.L.C. for $98.5 million, of which $96.0
million was cash and the balance the assumption of certain liabilities related
to the purchased businesses. The cash proceeds of the sale were used to repay
borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility. In the fiscal quarter
ended September 30, 2001, as part of its restructuring program, the Company
reported a pre-tax asset impairment charge for TTEC in the amount of $85.8
million to reduce the carrying value of these businesses to estimated fair
market value. This noncash charge was specifically related to the write-down of
goodwill. The sale proceeds of TTEC approximated its adjusted carrying value.

                                       23

On February 21, 2002, the Company sold its Seeger-Orbis retaining ring business
in Germany to Barnes Group Inc. for $20.0 million cash. The net proceeds of the
sale were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility.

On April 16, 2002, the Company sold its Aerospace Rivet Manufacturers
Corporation subsidiary to Allfast Fastening Systems, Inc. for $3.2 million cash.
The net proceeds of the sale were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the
Fleet Credit Facility.

On May 30, 2002, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the net
assets of its U.S. retaining ring business to SeaView Capital LLC for $2.9
million of cash, a promissory note of $0.8 million and warrants for 5% of the
equity of the purchaser. The net proceeds of the sale were used to repay
borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility.

On July 16, 2002, the Company completed the recapitalization of TransTechnology
(GB) Ltd., now known as Cirteq, Ltd., by selling 81% of its shares to a new
entity controlled by local management for $121 (one hundred twenty-one dollars).
The Company also converted $2.0 million of unsecured intercompany debt into a
$2.0 million loan secured by a first lien on Cirteq's real property in Glusburn,
England. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of
$0.9 million that is included in other income relating to the sale of the
remaining 19% interest in Cirteq, Ltd. and the collection of the loan from
Cirteq, Ltd.

On August 6, 2002, we completed the sale of all of the shares of TransTechnology
Brasil, Ltda. for $0.7 million, of which $0.3 million was paid in cash and the
balance in installment payments. We also will be paid $0.3 million of
intracompany debt due from the Brazilian unit. We used the net proceeds of the
sale to repay borrowings outstanding under our prior senior credit agreement.

On January 3, 2003, the Company completed the sale of TCR Corporation for cash
consideration of $10.0 million, plus the assumption of certain liabilities, to
an affiliate of MidMark Capital LLC. The net proceeds of the sale were used to
repay borrowings outstanding under the New Senior Credit Facility (as defined in
Note 7).

On February 24, 2003, the Company sold Norco, Inc. for $51.0 million cash and a
$1.0 million reimbursement for certain income taxes payable as a result of the
transaction to a wholly-owned subsidiary of TransDigm Inc. The net cash proceeds
were used to retire senior debt under the New Senior Credit Facility and
partially repay subordinated debt.

Net sales and income (losses) from the discontinued operations were as follows
(in thousands):

million for the final settlement of interest rate swap contracts; and a noncash
charge of $4.6 million associated with the recognition of accumulated currency
translation losses from the sale of the Brazilian operation. These gains and
losses, which aggregated a net gain of $16.2 million, were reduced by a tax
provision of $3.1 million. The 2002 loss was comprised of $110.3 million of
impairment charges related to reducing the carrying values of the discontinued
businesses to their estimated net realizable values; $12.0 million of actual
operating income of the discontinued businesses through their expected
divestiture dates; $20.1 million of allocated interest expense; $8.4 million
from the write-off of capitalized loan fees and the mark-to-market of interest
rate swaps; $24.7 million of gains recognized on the sale of certain business
units; and, $0.2 million of other income or credits associated with the
discontinued operations. These gains and losses, which aggregated a net loss of
$101.9 million, were reduced by a tax benefit of $32.3 million.

CREDIT FACILITIES - At March 31, 2004, the Company had a senior credit facility
consisting of an $8.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility which was
established in August 2002 (the "New Senior Credit Facility") to refinance all
remaining obligations outstanding under our prior senior credit facility. The
New Senior Credit Facility was amended on August 5, 2003 and was amended again
on January 30, 2004. The maturity date of this facility, as amended, is July 31,
2004. The current interest rate is approximately 5.0%. The New Senior Credit
Facility is secured by all of the Company's assets. The Company is in compliance
with the provisions of the facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under
the facility at March 31, 2004.

SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES - On August 30, 2000, the Company completed a private
placement of $75 million of senior subordinated notes (the "Notes") and warrants
to purchase shares of the Company's common stock (the "Warrants") to a group of
institutional investors (collectively, the "Purchasers"). The Company used the
proceeds of the private placement to retire, in full, a $75 million bridge loan
held by a group of lenders led by Fleet National Bank. The Notes, as amended in
August 2002, are due on August 29, 2005 and bear interest at a rate of 18% per
annum consisting of 13% cash interest on principal, payable quarterly, and 5%
interest on principal, payable quarterly in "payment-in-kind" ("PIK") promissory
notes. The PIK portion of the interest rate increases 0.25% each quarter,
commencing December 31, 2002 until the Notes are retired. The Company may prepay
the Notes after August 29, 2001, at a premium initially of 9%, declining to 5%,
3% and 1% on each of the next succeeding anniversaries of that date. The Notes
contain customary financial covenants and events of default, including a
cross-default provision to the Company's senior debt obligations. The Company is
in compliance with the provisions of the Notes. At March 31, 2004, the principal
balance outstanding on the Notes amounted to $56.4 million, which included the
original principal amount plus the PIK notes. At March 31, 2003, the Company
reported redeemable common stock in the amount of $1.3 million representing the
per share put right (257,000 shares at $5.00 per share) held by certain
Purchasers who had exercised their Warrants and recorded a $2.0 million noncash,
non-taxable gain relating to the mark-to-market accounting of the Warrants as a
derivative. The put right on approximately 211,000 shares expired on June 24,
2003 and, accordingly, the Company reclassified in the first quarter of 2004,
$1.1 million from redeemable common stock to additional paid in capital with the
remainder of the redeemable common stock being reclassified to long-term debt to
reflect the exercise of the put by a Purchaser. Subsequent to the end of the
first quarter of 2004, the Purchaser revoked its put exercise and that portion
was reclassified to additional paid in capital in the second quarter. In
addition, the put right on 171,041 Warrants expired and, accordingly, $0.9
million representing the cash value of the put right on these Warrants was
reclassified from a liability account to additional paid-in-capital in the first
quarter of 2004. At March 31, 2004, there were 171,041 Warrants outstanding
which are each convertible into common stock at the price of $.01 per warrant.
These Warrants are considered to be common stock equivalents for the purpose of
calculating basic earnings per share at March 31, 2004.

Amortization of loan origination fees on the Credit Facilities and the Senior
Subordinated Notes amounted to $1.6 million, $1.7 million and $1.7 million in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The loan agreements prohibit the payment of
dividends.

The Company has long-term debt maturities of $0.1 million and $56.5 million in
fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006, respectively.

9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND EMPLOYEE/DIRECTOR STOCK OPTIONS

The Company maintains the amended and restated 1992 long-term incentive plan
(the "1992 Plan"), the 1998 non-employee directors stock option plan (the "1998
Plan") and the 1999 long-term incentive plan (the "1999 Plan").

Under the terms of the 1999 plan, 300,000 of the Company's common shares may be
granted as stock options or awarded as restricted stock to officers, directors
and certain employees of the Company through July 2009. Under both the 1992 and
1999 Plans, option exercise prices equal the fair market value of the common
shares at their grant dates. For grants made prior to May 1999, options expire
not later than five years after the date of the grant. Options granted beginning
in May 1999 to officers and employees expire not later than 10 years after the
date of the grant. Options granted to directors and to officers and employees
with the annual cash bonus vest ratably over three years beginning one year
after the date of the grant. Restricted stock is payable in equivalent number of
common shares. The shares are distributable in a single installment and, with
respect to officers and employees, restrictions lapse ratably over a three-year
period from the date of the award, and with respect to directors, the
restrictions lapse six months after the director ceases to be a member of the
board of directors.

Under the terms of the 1998 Plan, non-employee directors are entitled to receive
matching options for a) each share of the Company's common stock which they hold
at the end of a 60-day period following initial election as a director, but not
to exceed 25,000 shares, with the strike price of the option being the fair
market value of the shares at their grant dates, and b) thereafter, for each
share of the Company's common stock that they purchase on the open market, with
the strike price of the option being the purchase price of the share, up to a
maximum of 5,000 options in any twelve month period or 15,000 options over a
three-year period. Options granted under the 1998 Plan vest on the first
anniversary of the grant. Options expire not later than five years after the
date of the grant.

10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has a defined contribution plan covering all eligible employees.
Contributions are based on certain percentages of an employee's eligible
compensation. Expenses related to this plan were $0.7 million, $0.6 million and
$0.6 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company provides postretirement benefits to certain union employees. The
Company funds these benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis. On December 8, 2003, the
Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 was enacted
that introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as a subsidy
to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans. The Company has elected to
defer the recognition of the Act until such time when the authoritative guidance
is issued. Any measures of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or
net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the Company's financial statements
do not reflect the effect of the Act.

For measurement purposes, a 13.5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost
of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2004 and 2003. The rate was
assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% by 2011 and remain at that level
thereafter. Under the Plan, the actuarially determined effect of a
one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend would be as
follows:

13. CONTINGENCIES

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS - The environmental cleanup plan presented by the Company
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 for a portion of a site in Pennsylvania
which continues to be owned, although the related business has been sold, was
approved during the third quarter of fiscal 2004. This plan was submitted
pursuant to the Consent Order and Agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection ("PaDEP") concluded in fiscal 1999. Pursuant to the
Consent Order, upon its execution the Company paid $0.2 million for past costs,
future oversight expenses and in full settlement of claims made by PaDEP related
to the environmental remediation of the site with an additional $0.2 million
paid in fiscal 2001. A second Consent Order was concluded with PaDEP in the
third quarter of fiscal 2001 for another portion of the site, and a third
Consent Order for the remainder of the site was concluded in the third quarter
of fiscal 2003. An environmental cleanup plan for the portion of the site
covered by the 2003 Consent Order was presented by the Company during the second
quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company is also administering an agreed settlement
with the Federal government under which the government pays 50% of the direct
and indirect environmental response costs associated with a portion of the site.
The Company has also reached an agreement in principle with the Federal
government and is in the process of finalizing the necessary documentation under
which the Federal government will pay 45% of the direct and indirect
environmental response costs associated with another portion of the site. At
March 31, 2004, the Company's cleanup reserve was $2.0 million based on the net
present value of future expected cleanup costs. The Company expects that
remediation at the Pennsylvania site will not be completed for several years.

The Company also continues to participate in environmental assessments and
remediation work at nine other locations, including former facilities of the
Company. The Company estimates that its potential cost for implementing
corrective action at these sites will not exceed $0.5 million payable over the
next several years, and has provided for the estimated costs in its accrual for
environmental liabilities. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the
Company entered into a consent order for a former facility in New York pursuant
to which it is developing a remediation plan for review and approval by the New
York Department of Environmental Conservation. The Company has established a
reserve of $2.4 million which it believes is adequate.

In addition, the Company has been named as a potentially responsible party in
five environmental proceedings pending in several states in which it is alleged
that the Company was a generator of waste that was sent to landfills and other
treatment facilities and, as to one site, it is alleged that the Company was an
owner or operator. Such properties generally relate to businesses which have
been sold or discontinued. The Company estimates that its expected future costs,
and its estimated proportional share of remedial work to be performed,
associated with these proceedings will not exceed $0.2 million and has provided
for these estimated costs in its accrual for environmental liabilities.

LITIGATION - The Company is also engaged in various other legal proceedings
incidental to its business. It is the opinion of management that, after taking
into consideration information furnished by its counsel, these matters will have
no material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or the
results of the Company's operations in future periods.

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY INVESTIGATION - As previously reported, the Company is
subject to an investigation being conducted by the Newark, New Jersey office of
the United States Attorney with respect to Breeze-Eastern's overhaul and repair
operations. The Company has, to date, cooperated fully and will continue to
cooperate fully with the government's investigation. In addition, the Board of
Directors retained a fact finding and forensic accounting firm, The Bradlau
Group of Morristown, New Jersey,

                                       32

<PAGE>

to perform an independent review of the overhaul and repair operations of the
Company's Breeze-Eastern business. The Board of Directors has shared the
preliminary and follow-on reports of the findings of this independent review
with the United States Attorney's office. The investigation has had no impact,
and the Company does not expect an impact, on the Company's ability to
manufacture and ship products and meet customer delivery schedules. As of this
date, the United States Attorney's investigation is continuing and the Company
has not been made aware of any specific statutory or regulatory violations
resulting from that investigation.

14. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

      None.

ITEM 9A. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

      The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's Exchange
Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management
necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures.

      With 90 days prior to the date of this report, the Company carried out an
evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's
management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Company's
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the forgoing, the
Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

There have been no significant changes in the Company's internal controls or in
other factors that could significantly affect the internal controls subsequent
to the date the Company completed its evaluation.

      Section 2.04. NOTICE OF MEETINGS. Except as otherwise required by law,
notice of each meeting of the stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be
given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to

secretary his address for such purpose, then at his post-office address last
known to the secretary, or by transmitting a notice thereof to him at such
address by facsimile.

      Except as otherwise expressly required by law, the notice shall state the
place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting,
shall also state the purpose for which the meeting is called. Notice of any
meeting of stockholders shall not be required to be given to any stockholder to

attend such meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of
the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Except as otherwise expressly required by law,
notice of any adjourned meeting of the stockholders need not be given if the
time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. If adjournment of the meeting is for a period exceeding 30 days, or if

entitled to vote at the meeting.

      Section 2.05. CONDUCT OF MEETINGS. All annual and special meetings of

matters not governed by such rules and procedures, as the chairman of such

stockholders shall be the chairman of the Board if he is willing, and if not,
then the president. The secretary, or in the absence of the secretary, a person
designated by the chairman of the Board or president, as the case may be, shall
act as secretary of the meeting.

      Section 2.06. QUORUM. At any meeting of stockholders, the presence, in
person or by proxy, of the holders of record of a majority of shares then issued
and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business; provided, however, that this Section 2.06 shall
not affect any different requirement which may exist under statute, pursuant to
the rights of any authorized class or series of stock, or under the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Corporation (the "Certificate") for the vote necessary
for the adoption of any measure governed thereby. In the absence of a quorum,
the stockholders present in person or by proxy, by majority vote and without
further notice, may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is
attained. At any reconvened meeting following such an adjournment at which a
quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been
transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

      Section 2.07. VOTES REQUIRED. A majority of the votes cast at a duly
called meeting of stockholders, at which a quorum is present, shall be
sufficient to take or authorize action upon any matter which may properly come
before the meeting, unless the vote of a greater or different number thereof is
required by statute, by the rights of any authorized class of stock or by the
Certificate. Unless the Certificate or a resolution of the Board of Directors
adopted in connection with the issuance of shares of any class or series of
stock provides for a greater or lesser number of votes per share, or limits or
denies voting rights, each outstanding share of stock, regardless of class,
shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of
stockholders.

      Section 2.08. PROXIES. A stockholder may vote the shares owned of record
by him either in person or by proxy executed in writing (which shall include
writings sent by telex, facsimile or other electronic transmission) by the
stockholder himself or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall
be valid after 3 years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer
period. Each proxy shall be in writing, subscribed by the stockholder or his
duly authorized attorney-in-fact, and dated, but it need not be sealed,
witnessed or acknowledged.

every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of stockholders entitled to vote
at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address of, and
the number of shares registered in the name of, each stockholder. The secretary
of the Corporation is not required to include electronic mail addresses or other
electronic contact information on the list. Such list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a
period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting, (i) during ordinary business
hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation, or (ii) on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required
to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting. If the
Corporation makes the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation
may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to
stockholders of the Corporation. The list shall also be produced and kept at the
time and place of the meeting during the duration thereof, and may be inspected
by any stockholder who is present.

      Section 2.10. INSPECTORS OF ELECTION. In advance of any meeting of
stockholders, the Board may appoint Inspectors of Election to act at such
meeting or at any adjournments thereof. If such Inspectors are not so appointed
or fail or refuse to act, the chairman of any such meeting may (and, upon the
demand of any stockholder or stockholder's proxy, shall) make such an
appointment.

      The number of Inspectors of Election shall be 1 or 3. If there are 3
Inspectors of Election, the decision, act or certificate of a majority shall be
effective and shall represent the decision, act or certificate of all. No such
Inspector need be a stockholder of the Corporation.

      The Inspectors of Election shall determine the number of shares
outstanding, the voting power of each, the shares represented at the meeting,
the existence of a quorum and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies;
they shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges
and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote, count and
tabulate all votes or consents, determine when the polls shall close and
determine the result; and finally, they shall do such acts as may be proper to
conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders. On request, the
Inspectors shall make a report in writing to the secretary of the meeting
concerning any challenge, question or other matter as may have been determined
by them and shall execute and deliver to such secretary a certificate of any
fact found by them.

                                 Indemnification

      To the maximum extent permitted by then applicable law, the Corporation
(i) shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who was or is a party to, or
is threatened to be made a party to, any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether or not by or in the right of the
Corporation, and whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
otherwise (any such action, suit or proceeding being hereafter in this Article
referred to as a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such person is or was
a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or was a director or officer of a
foreign or domestic corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the
Corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor
corporation; and (ii) may indemnify and hold harmless each person who was or is
a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, any such proceeding by
reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or agent of the
Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as an employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, or was an employee or agent of a foreign or domestic corporation
which was a predecessor corporation of the Corporation or of any enterprise at
the request of such corporation

<PAGE>

(any such person being hereafter in the Article referred to as an "indemnifiable
party"). Where required by law, the indemnification provided for in this Article
shall be made only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination, in
the manner provided by law, that the indemnification of the indemnifiable party
is proper in the circumstances. The Corporation shall advance to indemnifiable
parties expenses incurred in defending any proceeding prior to the final
disposition thereof except to the extent prohibited by then applicable law, and
upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such individual to repay such
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to
be indeminified by the Corporation. This Article shall create a right of
indemnification for each such indemnifiable party whether or not the proceeding
to which the indemnification relates arose in whole or in part prior to adoption
of this Article (or the adoption of the comparable provisions of the Bylaws of
the Corporation's predecessor corporation) and, in the event of the death of an
indemnifiable party, such right shall extend to such indemnifiable party's legal
representatives. The right of indemnification hereby given shall not be
exclusive of any right such indemnifiable party may have, whether by law or
under any agreement, insurance policy, vote of the Board or stockholders, or
otherwise. The Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance
on behalf of any indemnifiable party against any liability asserted against or
incurred by the indemnifiable party in such capacity or arising out of the
indemnifiable party's status as such whether or not the Corporation would have
the power to indemnify the indemnifiable party against such liability.

stockholder shall be entitled to a certificate or certificates which shall
represent and certify the number and class (and series, if appropriate) of
shares of stock owned by him in the Corporation. Each certificate shall be
signed in the name of the Corporation by the chairman of the Board and the
president, together with the secretary. Any or all of the signatures on any
certificate may be facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar
who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate
shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such
certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect
as if such person were an officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of
issue.

      Section 7.02. TRANSFER OF SHARES. Shares of stock shall be transferable on
the books of the Corporation only by the holder thereof, in person or by his
duly authorized attorney, upon the surrender of the certificate representing the
shares to be transferred, properly endorsed, to the Corporation's registrar if
the Corporation has a registrar. The Board shall have power and authority to
make such other rules and regulations concerning the issue, transfer and
registration of certificates of the Corporation's stock as it may deem
expedient.

      Section 7.03. TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS. The Corporation may have one
or more transfer agents and one or more registrars of its stock whose respective
duties the Board or the Secretary may, from time to time, define. No certificate
of stock shall be valid until countersigned by a transfer agent, if the
Corporation has a transfer agent, or until registered by a registrar, if the
Corporation has a registrar. The duties of transfer agent and registrar may be
combined.

      Section 7.04. STOCK LEDGERS. Original or duplicate stock ledgers,

      Section 7.05. RECORD DATES. The Board shall fix, in advance, a date as the
record date for the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of,
or to vote at, any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or
stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution
or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or in order to make a determination of
stockholders for any other proper purpose. Such date in any case shall be not
more than 60 days, and in case of a meeting of stockholders, not less than 10
days, prior to the date on which the particular action requiring such
determination of stockholders is to be taken. Only those stockholders of record
on the date so fixed shall be entitled to any of the foregoing rights,
notwithstanding the transfer of any such stock on the books of the Corporation
after any such record date fixed by the Board.

      Section 7.06. NEW CERTIFICATES. In case any certificate of stock is lost,
stolen, mutilated or destroyed, the Board may authorize the issuance of a new
certificate in place thereof upon such terms and conditions as it may deem
advisable; or the Board may delegate such power to the secretary; but the Board
or secretary or agents, in their discretion, may refuse to issue such a new
certificate unless the Corporation is ordered to do so by a court of competent
jurisdiction.

the Corporation, may be represented and voted at any of the stockholders'
meetings thereof by the chairman of the Board, the chief executive officer, the
president or the secretary. The Board, however, may by resolution appoint some

can be converted into clearly legible paper form within a reasonable time. The
Corporation shall so convert any records so kept upon the request of any person
entitled, by law, to inspect such records.

      Section 8.05. DEFINITION OF ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION. For purposes of the
Bylaws, "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly

            (ii) three Business Days prior to any requested LIBOR Loan;
            provided, however, that in the event that after giving effect to the
            making of a requested loan and advance, the principal amount of
            outstanding Revolving Loans would exceed ten percent (10%) of the

            Agreement immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
            provided, however, that if the Event of Default is an event listed

            Agreement shall automatically terminate on the day that is six

            Financing Agreement, whether by CIT, Parent or on January 31, 2004

            absolute or contingent, including, but not limited to, cash reserves

            have been paid and satisfied in full."

Loan Promissory Note, provided, however, that if such promissory notes are
unavailable, CIT will instead deliver to TransTechnology an affidavit of loss

      warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as
      of such specific date).

            (b)   Payment of Expenses. TransTechnology agrees to pay or
reimburse CIT for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Amendment, any other documents prepared in connection herewith and the

Dear Mr. White:

      This letter agreement (the "Agreement") sets out the agreement between you
(the "Executive") and TransTechnology Corporation (the "Corporation") with
respect to certain severance arrangements which shall apply only in the event
that a Change in Control, as hereinafter defined, of the Corporation occurs
after the date hereof.

      1.    For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall mean
      the occurrence of any one (or more) of the following events after the date
      of this Agreement:

      a.    When (i) the Corporation acquires actual knowledge that any person,
            including a group as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities
            Exchange Act of 1934, is or has become the beneficial owner of
            shares of the Corporation with respect to which thirty-three percent
            (33%) or more of the total number of votes for the election of the
            Corporation's Board of Directors may be cast, and (ii) such person
            or group publicly makes known, or communicates to the Corporation in
            writing, its intention to either (A) acquire control of the business
            of the Corporation, (B) liquidate the Corporation, (C) sell the
            assets of the Corporation or merge the Corporation with any other
            persons, or (D) make any material change in the business or
            corporate structure of the Corporation;

      b.    During any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the
            beginning of such period constituted the Board of Directors of the
            Corporation (together with any new directors whose election by such
            Board of Directors or whose nomination for election was previously
            approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) cease for any
            reason to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the
            Corporation; or

      c.    The stockholders of the Corporation shall approve an agreement
            providing either for a transaction in which the Corporation will
            cease to be an independent publicly owned corporation or for a sale
            or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
            Corporation; or

      d.    A tender offer or exchange offer is made by any person, including a
            group as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act
            of 1934, for such amount of shares representing a majority of the
            voting power of the Corporation with respect to the election of the
            Corporation's Board of Directors, and at least

               700 Liberty Avenue - Union - New Jersey 07083-8198

            such amount of shares of common stock are acquired pursuant to such
            tender offer.

      2.    In the event of a Change in Control of the Corporation, and the
      termination by the Corporation of the Executive's employment upon such
      Change in Control or within 24 months thereafter for reason other than
      Cause, as defined in Paragraph 3 below, or in the event the Executive
      terminates his employment with the Corporation for "Good Reason," as
      defined in Paragraph 5 below, in connection with, or within 24 months
      after a Change in Control, the Corporation shall pay to the Executive an
      amount equal to (a) 200% of the Executive's annual salary in effect on the
      date of said termination ("Base Salary"), plus (b) the average of his
      total bonuses paid or due for each of the last two (2) completed fiscal
      years prior to the Termination Date as defined below (or, in the event the
      Executive has been employed by the Corporation for less than two (2)
      fiscal years and has received only one bonus, an amount equal to the bonus
      received by the Executive), plus (c) the working days pay equivalent of
      earned but unused vacation, comp time and sick time, plus (d) the fair
      market value of any accrued but unvested restricted stock and stock
      options outstanding as of the Executive's Termination Date, plus (e) all
      accrued and unpaid salary, less any governmentally required withholdings
      on the foregoing. As used in clause (d), the term "fair market value"
      means the closing price of the common stock of the Corporation on the New
      York Stock Exchange on the Termination Date, less any amounts remaining to
      be paid by the Executive for such restricted stock or the exercise of such
      stock options.

            Subject to Paragraph 6 below, said lump sum shall be paid in two (2)
      installments, the first installment to be in an amount which (x) does not,
      in combination with all other compensation received by the Executive in
      the same fiscal year, exceed the deductible limit for the Executive's
      compensation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) and (y) subject to
      the preceding clause (x), is equal to the maximum aggregate amount which
      can be paid to the Executive without constituting Excess Parachute
      Payments as defined in Paragraph 6 below. The first installment shall be
      paid within 10 days of the Executive's last day of employment with the
      Corporation (said last day being hereinafter the "Termination Date") and
      the second installment, which shall equal the balance due to the Executive
      under this Agreement, shall be paid within ten (10) days of the close of
      the Corporation's fiscal year in which the first installment was paid;
      provided that in the event of a breach by the Corporation of this
      Agreement as set out in Paragraph 10 below, the aforesaid sums referenced
      in clauses 2(a) through (e) above shall be paid in one installment within
      ten (10) days of the exercise by the Executive of his rights under
      Paragraph 10. The aforesaid sums referenced in clauses 2(a) through (e)
      shall be in addition to all other amounts which may become payable to the
      Executive pursuant to other agreements and plans which the Corporation may
      have in force for the benefit of its executive employees and for which the
      Executive is eligible, including without limitation the agreements and
      plans referred to in paragraph 17 below; provided that any amount paid to
      the Executive pursuant to the Corporate Severance Pay Plan of the
      Corporation shall be credited against amounts due under this Agreement.
      The Corporation shall continue to provide the Executive for a period of 24
      months from the Termination Date with life, health, and disability
      insurance coverage substantially identical to the coverage maintained for
      the Executive prior to the Termination Date.

      3.    For purposes of this Agreement, termination for "Cause" shall mean
      only the following conduct by the Executive:

            a.  material breach of any provision of this Agreement;

            b.  breach of fiduciary duty to the Corporation involving personal
                gain or profit;

            c.  intentional and repeated failure to perform material stated
                duties;

            d.  conviction of any felony, any crime involving moral turpitude,
                or any crime committed in the conduct of his or her official
                duties which is materially adverse to the welfare of the
                Corporation.

            The Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause
            unless there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a
            resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a
            majority of the entire membership of the Board of Directors of the
            Corporation at a meeting of the Board of Directors duly called and
            held for the purpose (and reasonable notice to the Executive and an
            opportunity for the Executive, together with his counsel, to be
            heard before the Board of Directors), finding that in the good faith
            opinion of the Board of Directors of the Corporation the Executive
            was guilty of conduct specified in this Paragraph 3 and specifying
            the particulars thereof in detail. Except in the event of a
            conviction as described in subparagraph 3(d), in no event will the
            Executive be subject to termination for Cause pursuant to this
            Agreement unless the Executive shall have failed to cure, correct or
            prevent the alleged breach or failure within thirty (30) days after
            such resolution has been delivered to the Executive.

      4.    This Agreement may be terminated by the Executive at any time upon
      ninety (90) days' written notice to the Corporation or upon such shorter
      period as may be agreed upon between the Executive and the Chairman of the
      Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation. In the event of such
      termination by the Executive, the Corporation shall be obligated only to
      continue to pay the Executive his salary up to the date of termination,
      and those retirement and/or employee benefits which have been earned or
      become payable up to the date of termination.

      5.    For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean the
      occurrence, in connection with, or within 24 months after, a Change in
      Control, of any of the events or conditions described in subparagraphs (a)
      through (g) hereof without the Executive's express written consent.
      Executive's right to terminate his employment pursuant to this Paragraph 5
      shall not be affected by his incapacity due to physical or mental illness.

            a.    A change in the Executive's status, title, position or
            responsibilities (including reporting responsibilities) which, in
            the Executive's reasonable judgment, does not represent a promotion
            from his status, title, position or responsibilities as in effect
            immediately prior thereto; the assignment to the Executive of any
            duties or responsibilities which, in the Executive's reasonable
            judgment, are inconsistent with such status, title, position or
            responsibilities; or any removal of the Executive from or failure to
            reappoint him to any of such positions, except in connection with
            the termination of his employment for (i) Cause, (ii) as a result of
            his death or (iii) by the Executive other than for Good Reason;

            b.    A reduction by the Corporation in the Executive's Base Salary
            as in effect on the date of a Change in Control or as the same may
            be increased from time to time;

            c.    The intention to relocate or transfer the Executive to a
            location outside a 50 mile radius of the location which is his
            primary office location as of the date immediately preceding the
            date of a Change in Control.

            d.    The adverse and substantial alteration in the nature and
            quality of the office space from which the Executive performs his
            duties, including the size and location thereof, as well as the
            secretarial and administrative support provided to him;

            e.    The failure by the Corporation to continue to provide the
            Executive with compensation and benefits provided as of the date
            hereof or benefits substantially similar to those provided under any
            of the employee benefit plans in which the Executive becomes a
            participant or the taking of any action by the Corporation which
            would directly or indirectly materially reduce any of such benefits
            or deprive the Executive of any material benefit enjoyed by him at
            the time of the Change in Control;

            f.    Any material breach by the Corporation of any provision of
            this Agreement; or

            g.    The failure of the Corporation to obtain a satisfactory
            agreement from any successor or assignee of the Corporation to
            assume and agree to perform this Agreement, as contemplated in
            Paragraph 10 hereof.

      6.    If the benefits payable under this Agreement and any other payments
      otherwise payable to the Executive by the Corporation (collectively
      referred to as "Severance Benefits") have a Present Value (as defined
      herein) equal to or in excess of three times the Executive's Base Amount
      (as defined herein) and, in addition thereto, meet the other requirements
      set forth in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
      (the "Code") so that the Severance Benefits constitute "Parachute
      Payments" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code), the Executive may
      elect to apply the provisions set out below.

            a.    In the event that any Severance Benefits to be made to the
            Executive by the Corporation, whether pursuant to this Agreement or
            otherwise, upon termination of the Executive's employment pursuant
            hereto are deemed, in the opinion of the Corporation's independent
            public accountants (the "Accountants") to constitute Parachute
            Payments, the Executive may, upon written notification by the
            Corporation of the determination of the Accountants, elect to
            receive any combination of Severance Benefits from the Corporation
            due to him as a result of termination which equal the maximum
            aggregate amount which can be paid to the Executive without
            constituting Excess Parachute Payments as defined in Section 280G of
            the Code. The Executive undertakes to make such election in the
            event that receipt by him of amounts constituting Excess Parachute
            Payments will result in a net amount payable to him after taxes
            which is less than the amount he would be entitled to receive by
            making the aforesaid election. The

<PAGE>

            written notification by the Corporation of any determination of the
            Accountants pursuant to this Paragraph 6 shall be provided to the
            Executive within five (5) business days of the Termination Date, and
            shall (i) list all Severance Benefits which are deemed to constitute
            Parachute Payments in the opinion of the Accountants, and (ii)
            contain the Corporation's opinion as to the Present Value of each of
            such Severance Benefits, which opinion shall be determined in
            consultation with the Accountants. Any election by the Executive
            pursuant to this paragraph shall be made by the Executive and
            submitted to the Corporation by the thirtieth (30th) day following
            the Termination Date, and the Corporation shall pay to the Executive
            the Severance Benefits specified in such election in one (1) or two
            (2) installments, as the case may be, the first installment to be in
            an amount equal to the maximum amount which can be paid to the
            Executive which does not, in combination with all other compensation
            received by the Executive in the same fiscal year, exceed the
            deductible limit for the Executive's compensation under Internal
            Revenue Code Section 162(m). The first installment shall be paid
            within five (5) business days of receipt of such election, and the
            second installment, if needed, which shall equal the balance, if
            any, due to the Executive under such election shall be paid within
            ten (10) days of the close of the Corporation's fiscal year in which
            the first installment was paid.

            b.    In the event that the Executive does not file a written
            election with the Corporation pursuant to subparagraph (a) upon
            receipt of a written notification by the Corporation of the
            Accountant's determination that Severance Benefits to which the
            Executive is entitled upon termination constitute Excess Parachute
            Payments, then the Corporation shall pay the Executive all Severance
            Benefits due him pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.

            c.    For purposes of this Paragraph 6, Present Value means the
            value determined under the rules provided in Proposed Treasury
            Regulations under Section 280G of the Code, and Base Amount means
            the average annual compensation payable to the Executive by the
            Corporation and includable in the Executive's gross income for
            Federal income tax purposes during the shorter of the period
            consisting of the most recent five taxable years ending before the
            date of any Change in Control or the portion of such period during
            which the Executive was an employee.

            d.    References to Code Section 280G herein are intended as
            references to Section 280G as added to the Code by the Tax Reform
            Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-369, 98th Cong., 2nd Sess., and as it
            may be amended.

            e.    In the event the Corporation fails to give the notification to
            the Executive of the determination by the Accountants as
            contemplated by subparagraph 6(a) hereof; or if the Accountants
            erroneously fail to determine the existence of Excess Parachute
            Payments; or in the event of any other circumstance caused by the
            Corporation which results in the imposition of tax pursuant to
            Section 4999 of the Code, then any such tax, including any penalty
            or interest paid by the Executive (the "Excise Tax") shall be
            reimbursed to the Executive by the Corporation. In addition, the
            Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment or
            payments (a "Gross Up Payment") in an amount such that, after
            payment by the Executive of all taxes (including federal, state and
            local taxes and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to
            such taxes and including

<PAGE>

February 10, 2004
Page 6

            any Excise Tax) imposed upon the Gross Up Payment, the Executive
            and/or his estate collectively retain (or have withheld and credited
            on his behalf for tax purposes) an amount of the Gross Up Payment
            equal to the Excise Tax.

      7.    All reasonable legal fees, arbitration fees, and expenses paid or
      incurred by the Executive relating to any dispute, controversy or claimed
      breach regarding this Agreement shall be paid or reimbursed by the
      Corporation, if the Executive is successful, or as may be determined to be
      appropriate by any arbitrator's award based on the relative merits of the
      two parties.

      8.    The Executive agrees that during the term of this Agreement, and for
      a period of two (2) years commencing the Termination Date, he will not
      directly or indirectly:

            a.    Solicit, divert or take away any of the customers, business or
            patronage of the Corporation or its subsidiaries or affiliates; or

            b.    Induce or attempt to influence any employee of the Corporation
            or its subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her employment
            therewith.

            c.    In the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Executive
            of the provisions of this Paragraph 8, the Corporation, or any duly
            authorized officer thereof, will be entitled to a temporary
            restraining order or injunction.

      9.    The Executive shall not, during the term of this Agreement, have any
      other employment (exclusive of volunteer services with not-for-profit
      institutions or occasional speaking engagements) except with the prior
      approval of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the
      Corporation.

      10.   The Corporation will require any successor (whether direct or
      indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
      substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Corporation, by an
      assumption agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Executive,
      to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner
      and to the same extent that the Corporation would be required to perform
      it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Corporation to
      obtain such assumption agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such
      succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the
      Executive to compensation from the Corporation in the same amount and on
      the same terms that he would be entitled to hereunder if he terminated his
      employment for Good Reason in connection with, or within 24 months after,
      a Change in Control.

            This Agreement and all rights of the Executive hereunder shall inure
      to the benefit of and be enforceable by his personal or legal
      representatives, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, legatees and
      permitted assigns.

      11.   This Agreement is personal to each of the parties hereto and, except
      as provided in Paragraph 10, neither party may assign or delegate any of
      its rights or obligations hereunder without first obtaining the written
      consent of the other party.

      12.   All notices, requests, demands and other communications hereunder
      shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if
      delivered by hand or mailed, certified or registered mail, return receipt
      requested with postage prepaid, or delivered

      court declares a provision of this Agreement to be invalid or

      the provision so that it is valid and enforceable to the greatest extent
      possible.

      15.   This Agreement shall, except to the extent that Federal law shall be
      deemed to preempt it, be governed by and construed and enforced in
      accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey applicable to
      contracts made and performed within the State.

      16.   Except for injunctive relief, any dispute or controversy arising
      under or in connection with this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall
      be settled exclusively by binding arbitration at a site in the State of
      New Jersey and administered by the American Arbitration Association
      ("AAA") in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of
      Employment Disputes of the AAA then in effect. Notwithstanding the
      pendency of any arbitration proceeding, the Corporation will continue to
      pay the Executive's full compensation in effect when the dispute,
      controversy, or claimed breach, arose and continue the Executive as a
      participant in all compensation, benefit and insurance plans in which the
      Executive was then participating, until the matter submitted to
      arbitration is finally resolved. Judgment may be entered on the
      arbitrator's award in any court having competent jurisdiction.

      17.   Nothing in this Agreement amends or modifies, or shall be deemed or
      construed to amend or modify, the terms and provisions (including the
      triggers and dates of payments thereunder) of any stock option granted by
      the Corporation to the Executive, or restricted stock agreement between
      the Corporation and the Executive, or the provisions of the 1992 Long Term
      Incentive Plan and the 1999 Long Term Incentive Plan.

      18.   Absent a change in control or unless extended in writing by the
      parties hereto, this Agreement shall expire on January 31, 2006.

Gerald C. Harvey
18 Countryside Drive
Summit, NJ 07901

Dear Mr. Harvey:

      This letter agreement (the "Agreement") sets out the agreement between you
(the "Executive") and TransTechnology Corporation (the "Corporation") with
respect to certain severance arrangements which shall apply only in the event
that a Change in Control, as hereinafter defined, of the Corporation occurs
after the date hereof.

      1.    For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall mean
      the occurrence of any one (or more) of the following events after the date
      of this Agreement:

      a.    When (i) the Corporation acquires actual knowledge that any person,
            including a group as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities
            Exchange Act of 1934, is or has become the beneficial owner of
            shares of the Corporation with respect to which thirty-three percent
            (33%) or more of the total number of votes for the election of the
            Corporation's Board of Directors may be cast, and (ii) such person
            or group publicly makes known, or communicates to the Corporation in
            writing, its intention to either (A) acquire control of the business
            of the Corporation, (B) liquidate the Corporation, (C) sell the
            assets of the Corporation or merge the Corporation with any other
            persons, or (D) make any material change in the business or
            corporate structure of the Corporation;

      b.    During any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the
            beginning of such period constituted the Board of Directors of the
            Corporation (together with any new directors whose election by such
            Board of Directors or whose nomination for election was previously
            approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) cease for any
            reason to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the
            Corporation; or

      c.    The stockholders of the Corporation shall approve an agreement
            providing either for a transaction in which the Corporation will
            cease to be an independent publicly owned corporation or for a sale
            or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
            Corporation; or

      d.    A tender offer or exchange offer is made by any person, including a
            group as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act
            of 1934, for such amount of shares representing a majority of the
            voting power of the Corporation with respect to the election of the
            Corporation's Board of Directors, and at least

         700 Liberty Avenue - P.O. Box 3300 - Union - New Jersey 07083

<PAGE>

February 10, 2004
Page 2

            such amount of shares of common stock are acquired pursuant to such
            tender offer.

      2.    In the event of a Change in Control of the Corporation, and the
      termination by the Corporation of the Executive's employment upon such
      Change in Control or within 24 months thereafter for reason other than
      Cause, as defined in Paragraph 3 below, or in the event the Executive
      terminates his employment with the Corporation for "Good Reason," as
      defined in Paragraph 5 below, in connection with, or within 24 months
      after a Change in Control, the Corporation shall pay to the Executive an
      amount equal to (a) 200% of the Executive's annual salary in effect on the
      date of said termination ("Base Salary"), plus (b) the average of his
      total bonuses paid or due for each of the last two (2) completed fiscal
      years prior to the Termination Date as defined below (or, in the event the
      Executive has been employed by the Corporation for less than two (2)
      fiscal years and has received only one bonus, an amount equal to the bonus
      received by the Executive), plus (c) the working days pay equivalent of
      earned but unused vacation, comp time and sick time, plus (d) the fair
      market value of any accrued but unvested restricted stock and stock
      options outstanding as of the Executive's Termination Date, plus (e) all
      accrued and unpaid salary, less any governmentally required withholdings
      on the foregoing. As used in clause (d), the term "fair market value"
      means the closing price of the common stock of the Corporation on the New
      York Stock Exchange on the Termination Date, less any amounts remaining to
      be paid by the Executive for such restricted stock or the exercise of such
      stock options.

            Subject to Paragraph 6 below, said lump sum shall be paid in two (2)
      installments, the first installment to be in an amount which (x) does not,
      in combination with all other compensation received by the Executive in
      the same fiscal year, exceed the deductible limit for the Executive's
      compensation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) and (y) subject to
      the preceding clause (x), is equal to the maximum aggregate amount which
      can be paid to the Executive without constituting Excess Parachute
      Payments as defined in Paragraph 6 below. The first installment shall be
      paid within 10 days of the Executive's last day of employment with the
      Corporation (said last day being hereinafter the "Termination Date") and
      the second installment, which shall equal the balance due to the Executive
      under this Agreement, shall be paid within ten (10) days of the close of
      the Corporation's fiscal year in which the first installment was paid;
      provided that in the event of a breach by the Corporation of this
      Agreement as set out in Paragraph 10 below, the aforesaid sums referenced
      in clauses 2(a) through (e) above shall be paid in one installment within
      ten (10) days of the exercise by the Executive of his rights under
      Paragraph 10. The aforesaid sums referenced in clauses 2(a) through (e)
      shall be in addition to all other amounts which may become payable to the
      Executive pursuant to other agreements and plans which the Corporation may
      have in force for the benefit of its executive employees and for which the
      Executive is eligible, including without limitation the agreements and
      plans referred to in paragraph 17 below; provided that any amount paid to
      the Executive pursuant to the Corporate Severance Pay Plan of the
      Corporation shall be credited against amounts due under this Agreement.
      The Corporation shall continue to provide the Executive for a period of 24
      months from the Termination Date with life, health, and disability
      insurance coverage substantially identical to the coverage maintained for
      the Executive prior to the Termination Date.

      3.    For purposes of this Agreement, termination for "Cause" shall mean
      only the following conduct by the Executive:

            a.   material breach of any provision of this Agreement;

            b.   breach of fiduciary duty to the Corporation involving personal
                 gain or profit;

            c.   intentional and repeated failure to perform material stated
                 duties;

            d.   conviction of any felony, any crime involving moral turpitude,
                 or any crime committed in the conduct of his or her official
                 duties which is materially adverse to the welfare of the
                 Corporation.

            The Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause
            unless there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a
            resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a
            majority of the entire membership of the Board of Directors of the
            Corporation at a meeting of the Board of Directors duly called and
            held for the purpose (and reasonable notice to the Executive and an
            opportunity for the Executive, together with his counsel, to be
            heard before the Board of Directors), finding that in the good faith
            opinion of the Board of Directors of the Corporation the Executive
            was guilty of conduct specified in this Paragraph 3 and specifying
            the particulars thereof in detail. Except in the event of a
            conviction as described in subparagraph 3(d), in no event will the
            Executive be subject to termination for Cause pursuant to this
            Agreement unless the Executive shall have failed to cure, correct or
            prevent the alleged breach or failure within thirty (30) days after
            such resolution has been delivered to the Executive.

      4.    This Agreement may be terminated by the Executive at any time upon
      ninety (90) days' written notice to the Corporation or upon such shorter
      period as may be agreed upon between the Executive and the Chairman of the
      Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation. In the event of such
      termination by the Executive, the Corporation shall be obligated only to
      continue to pay the Executive his salary up to the date of termination,
      and those retirement and/or employee benefits which have been earned or
      become payable up to the date of termination.

      5.    For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean the
      occurrence, in connection with, or within 24 months after, a Change in
      Control, of any of the events or conditions described in subparagraphs (a)
      through (g) hereof without the Executive's express written consent.
      Executive's right to terminate his employment pursuant to this Paragraph 5
      shall not be affected by his incapacity due to physical or mental illness.

            a.    A change in the Executive's status, title, position or
            responsibilities (including reporting responsibilities) which, in
            the Executive's reasonable judgment, does not represent a promotion
            from his status, title, position or responsibilities as in effect
            immediately prior thereto; the assignment to the Executive of any
            duties or responsibilities which, in the Executive's reasonable
            judgment, are inconsistent with such status, title, position or
            responsibilities; or any removal of the Executive from or failure to
            reappoint him to any of such positions, except in connection with
            the termination of his employment for (i) Cause, (ii) as a result of
            his death or (iii) by the Executive other than for Good Reason;

<PAGE>

February 10, 2004
Page 4

            b.    A reduction by the Corporation in the Executive's Base Salary
            as in effect on the date of a Change in Control or as the same may
            be increased from time to time;

            c.    The intention to relocate or transfer the Executive to a
            location outside a 50 mile radius of the location which is his
            primary office location as of the date immediately preceding the
            date of a Change in Control.

            d.    The adverse and substantial alteration in the nature and
            quality of the office space from which the Executive performs his
            duties, including the size and location thereof, as well as the
            secretarial and administrative support provided to him;

            e.    The failure by the Corporation to continue to provide the
            Executive with compensation and benefits provided as of the date
            hereof or benefits substantially similar to those provided under any
            of the employee benefit plans in which the Executive becomes a
            participant or the taking of any action by the Corporation which
            would directly or indirectly materially reduce any of such benefits
            or deprive the Executive of any material benefit enjoyed by him at
            the time of the Change in Control;

            f.    Any material breach by the Corporation of any provision of
            this Agreement; or

            g.    The failure of the Corporation to obtain a satisfactory
            agreement from any successor or assignee of the Corporation to
            assume and agree to perform this Agreement, as contemplated in
            Paragraph 10 hereof.

      6.    If the benefits payable under this Agreement and any other payments
      otherwise payable to the Executive by the Corporation (collectively
      referred to as "Severance Benefits") have a Present Value (as defined
      herein) equal to or in excess of three times the Executive's Base Amount
      (as defined herein) and, in addition thereto, meet the other requirements
      set forth in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
      (the "Code") so that the Severance Benefits constitute "Parachute
      Payments" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code), the Executive may
      elect to apply the provisions set out below.

            a.    In the event that any Severance Benefits to be made to the
            Executive by the Corporation, whether pursuant to this Agreement or
            otherwise, upon termination of the Executive's employment pursuant
            hereto are deemed, in the opinion of the Corporation's independent
            public accountants (the "Accountants") to constitute Parachute
            Payments, the Executive may, upon written notification by the
            Corporation of the determination of the Accountants, elect to
            receive any combination of Severance Benefits from the Corporation
            due to him as a result of termination which equal the maximum
            aggregate amount which can be paid to the Executive without
            constituting Excess Parachute Payments as defined in Section 280G of
            the Code. The Executive undertakes to make such election in the
            event that receipt by him of amounts constituting Excess Parachute
            Payments will result in a net amount payable to him after taxes
            which is less than the amount he would be entitled to receive by
            making the aforesaid election. The

<PAGE>

February 10, 2004
Page 5

            written notification by the Corporation of any determination of the
            Accountants pursuant to this Paragraph 6 shall be provided to the
            Executive within five (5) business days of the Termination Date, and
            shall (i) list all Severance Benefits which are deemed to constitute
            Parachute Payments in the opinion of the Accountants, and (ii)
            contain the Corporation's opinion as to the Present Value of each of
            such Severance Benefits, which opinion shall be determined in
            consultation with the Accountants. Any election by the Executive
            pursuant to this paragraph shall be made by the Executive and
            submitted to the Corporation by the thirtieth (30th) day following
            the Termination Date, and the Corporation shall pay to the Executive
            the Severance Benefits specified in such election in one (1) or two
            (2) installments, as the case may be, the first installment to be in
            an amount equal to the maximum amount which can be paid to the
            Executive which does not, in combination with all other compensation
            received by the Executive in the same fiscal year, exceed the
            deductible limit for the Executive's compensation under Internal
            Revenue Code Section 162(m). The first installment shall be paid
            within five (5) business days of receipt of such election, and the
            second installment, if needed, which shall equal the balance, if
            any, due to the Executive under such election shall be paid within
            ten (10) days of the close of the Corporation's fiscal year in which
            the first installment was paid.

            b.    In the event that the Executive does not file a written
            election with the Corporation pursuant to subparagraph (a) upon
            receipt of a written notification by the Corporation of the
            Accountant's determination that Severance Benefits to which the
            Executive is entitled upon termination constitute Excess Parachute
            Payments, then the Corporation shall pay the Executive all Severance
            Benefits due him pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.

            c.    For purposes of this Paragraph 6, Present Value means the
            value determined under the rules provided in Proposed Treasury
            Regulations under Section 280G of the Code, and Base Amount means
            the average annual compensation payable to the Executive by the
            Corporation and includable in the Executive's gross income for
            Federal income tax purposes during the shorter of the period
            consisting of the most recent five taxable years ending before the
            date of any Change in Control or the portion of such period during
            which the Executive was an employee.

            d.    References to Code Section 280G herein are intended as
            references to Section 280G as added to the Code by the Tax Reform
            Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-369, 98th Cong., 2nd Sess., and as it
            may be amended.

            e.    In the event the Corporation fails to give the notification to
            the Executive of the determination by the Accountants as
            contemplated by subparagraph 6(a) hereof; or if the Accountants
            erroneously fail to determine the existence of Excess Parachute
            Payments; or in the event of any other circumstance caused by the
            Corporation which results in the imposition of tax pursuant to
            Section 4999 of the Code, then any such tax, including any penalty
            or interest paid by the Executive (the "Excise Tax") shall be
            reimbursed to the Executive by the Corporation. In addition, the
            Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment or
            payments (a "Gross Up Payment") in an amount such that, after
            payment by the Executive of all taxes (including federal, state and
            local taxes and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to
            such taxes and including

<PAGE>

February 10, 2004
Page 6

            any Excise Tax) imposed upon the Gross Up Payment, the Executive
            and/or his estate collectively retain (or have withheld and credited
            on his behalf for tax purposes) an amount of the Gross Up Payment
            equal to the Excise Tax.

      7.    All reasonable legal fees, arbitration fees, and expenses paid or
      incurred by the Executive relating to any dispute, controversy or claimed
      breach regarding this Agreement shall be paid or reimbursed by the
      Corporation, if the Executive is successful, or as may be determined to be
      appropriate by any arbitrator's award based on the relative merits of the
      two parties.

      8.    The Executive agrees that during the term of this Agreement, and for
      a period of two (2) years commencing the Termination Date, he will not
      directly or indirectly:

            a.    Solicit, divert or take away any of the customers, business or
            patronage of the Corporation or its subsidiaries or affiliates; or

            b.    Induce or attempt to influence any employee of the Corporation
            or its subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her employment
            therewith.

            c.    In the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Executive
            of the provisions of this Paragraph 8, the Corporation, or any duly
            authorized officer thereof, will be entitled to a temporary
            restraining order or injunction.

      9.    The Executive shall not, during the term of this Agreement, have any
      other employment (exclusive of volunteer services with not-for-profit
      institutions or occasional speaking engagements) except with the prior
      approval of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the
      Corporation.

      10.   The Corporation will require any successor (whether direct or
      indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
      substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Corporation, by an
      assumption agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Executive,
      to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner
      and to the same extent that the Corporation would be required to perform
      it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Corporation to
      obtain such assumption agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such
      succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the
      Executive to compensation from the Corporation in the same amount and on
      the same terms that he would be entitled to hereunder if he terminated his
      employment for Good Reason in connection with, or within 24 months after,

      13.   No amendments or additions to this Agreement shall be binding unless
      in writing and signed by both parties.

      14.   The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the
      invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
      validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. In the event a
      court declares a provision of this Agreement to be invalid or
      unenforceable, that court may, in the exercise of its discretion, reform
      the provision so that it is valid and enforceable to the greatest extent
      possible.

      15.   This Agreement shall, except to the extent that Federal law shall be

      New Jersey and administered by the American Arbitration Association
      ("AAA") in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of
      Employment Disputes of the AAA then in effect. Notwithstanding the
      pendency of any arbitration proceeding, the Corporation will continue to
      pay the Executive's full compensation in effect when the dispute,
      controversy, or claimed breach, arose and continue the Executive as a
      participant in all compensation, benefit and insurance plans in which the
      Executive was then participating, until the matter submitted to
      arbitration is finally resolved. Judgment may be entered on the
      arbitrator's award in any court having competent jurisdiction.

      17.   Nothing in this Agreement amends or modifies, or shall be deemed or
      construed to amend or modify, the terms and provisions (including the
      triggers and dates of payments thereunder) of any stock option granted by
      the Corporation to the Executive, or restricted stock agreement between
      the Corporation and the Executive, or the provisions of the 1992 Long Term
      Incentive Plan and the 1999 Long Term Incentive Plan.

      18.   Absent a change in control or unless extended in writing by the
      parties hereto, this Agreement shall expire on January 31, 2006.
