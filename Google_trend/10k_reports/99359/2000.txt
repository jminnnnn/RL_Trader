                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

GENERAL

         TransTechnology Corporation develops, manufactures and sells a wide
range of products in two industry segments, as described below. TransTechnology
Corporation was originally organized in 1962 as a California corporation and
reincorporated in Delaware in 1986. Unless the context otherwise requires,
references to the "Company" or the "Registrant" refer to TransTechnology
Corporation (including the California corporation prior to the reincorporation)
and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company's fiscal year ends on March 31.
Accordingly, all references to years in this report refer to the fiscal year
ended March 31 of the indicated year.

         TransTechnology Corporation's core business areas are specialty
fastener products and aerospace products. During 2000, the Company continued its
program to improve its position as one of the world's major suppliers of
specialty fasteners to the transportation and industrial markets. Key aspects of
this program include growth through acquisitions and the consolidation and
rationalization of its manufacturing operations. Actions taken during 2000 to
accomplish these goals included the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners
Division of Eaton Corporation ("Tinnerman") on August 31, 1999 and the
acquisition of Ellison Holdings PLC ("Ellison") on July 19, 1999. For a more
detailed description of these transactions, see Note 3 of "Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements" included in the Company's 2000 Annual Report on page 19
which is incorporated herein by reference. The Company has substantially
completed consolidation of the manufacturing plants in Great Britain as part of
the Ellison acquisition program. This action has further strengthened the
Company's position as one of the world's major suppliers of specialty fastener
products to the transportation and industrial markets.

         Breeze-Eastern and NORCO, Inc. ("NORCO") make up the Company's
aerospace products segment, and are the world's leading designers and
manufacturers of sophisticated helicopter rescue hoists, cargo winches, cargo
hook systems, mechanical components such as hold open rods, and
application-specific mechanical and linear motion systems. These products are
sold primarily to military and civilian agencies and aerospace contractors. The
acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of NORCO was accomplished in fiscal
1999. For a more detailed description of this transaction, see Note 3 of "Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in the Company's 2000 Annual
Report on page 19 which is incorporated herein by reference.

SPECIALTY FASTENER PRODUCTS

         The Company's specialty fastener products are manufactured by its
Engineered Components Group (Palnut and the recently acquired Tinnerman
companies), its Engineered Products Group (Breeze Industrial, Pebra, TCR and
ARM) and its Engineered Rings Group (Seeger-Orbis, TransTechnology Brasil,
Waldes/IRR, TransTechnology (GB)). TransTechnology (GB) represents the
consolidation of the Anderton and the recently acquired Ellison plants into a
single manufacturing facility in Great Britain.

         The Engineered Components Group includes single and multi-thread metal
fasteners, retaining rings and headlight adjusters for the automotive and
industrial markets. These fasteners include: lock nuts for load carrying in
light duty assemblies or as a supplement to ordinary nuts to assure tightness;
the On-Sert(R) fastener, which is pressed onto hollow plastic bosses to increase
torque and minimize stripping; push-nuts used as temporary fasteners that hold
pre-inserted bolts in place for final assembly or in ratchet plates which fasten
onto a shaft or stud; self-threaders used in the installation of automotive
trim; U-nuts that provide one-sided screw assembly and are used to fasten
bumpers, fenders and grills to vehicles; various single threaded parts designed

                                       1
<PAGE>   3

for insertion into metal or plastic panels; and a variety of automotive
headlight adjusters.

         Within the Engineered Products Group, Breeze Industrial designs and
manufactures a diverse line of high-quality stainless steel hose clamps,
including worm drive hose clamps, T-Bolt and V-Band clamps, and light duty
clamps for use in the heavy truck and industrial equipment industries by
original equipment manufacturers and replacement suppliers. Pebra designs and
manufactures hose clamps primarily for heavy truck manufacturers in Europe. TCR
designs and manufactures sophisticated externally threaded fastening devices and
custom industrial components by combining its expertise in cold forging and
machining technologies. TCR products are used by industrial customers worldwide,
with key market groups, including automotive, hydraulic and recreational product
industries. ARM designs and manufactures rivets and externally threaded
fasteners primarily for the aerospace industry.

         Within the Engineered Rings Group, Seeger-Orbis, TransTechnology
Brasil, Waldes/IRR and TransTechnology (GB) manufacture a large range of
retaining and snap rings used in the automotive, marine, household and computer
applications that require retention of parts to shafts and axles.

         Specialty fasteners are marketed through a combination of a direct
sales force, distributors and manufacturing representatives. Such products
comprised 80%, 78% and 83% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively.

         At March 31, 2000, the Company's Specialty Fastener Products segment
backlog was $65.4 million, compared to $45.9 million at March 31, 1999. The
increase is primarily the result of the Tinnerman and Ellison acquisitions.
Substantially all of the March 31, 2000 backlog is scheduled to be shipped
during fiscal 2001.

AEROSPACE PRODUCTS

         The Company's aerospace products are designed, developed and
manufactured by Breeze-Eastern and NORCO. Breeze-Eastern specializes in the
design, development and manufacture of sophisticated lifting and restraining
products, principally helicopter rescue hoists, reeling machines and external
hook systems. In addition, Breeze-Eastern designs, develops and manufactures
winches and hoists for aircraft cargo and weapon-handling systems with
applications ranging from cargo handling on fixed-wing aircraft to positioning
television cameras on blimps, antenna and gear drives. Management believes that
Breeze-Eastern is the industry market share leader in sales of personnel-rescue
hoists and cargo hook equipment. As a pioneer of helicopter hoist technology,
Breeze-Eastern continues to develop sophisticated helicopter hoist systems,
including systems for the current generation of Seahawk, Chinook, Dolphin,
Merlin and Super Stallion helicopters. Breeze-Eastern also supplies equipment
for the United States, Japanese and European Multiple-Launch Rocket Systems
which use two specialized hoists to load and unload rocket pod containers.
Breeze-Eastern's external cargo-lift hook systems are original equipment on most
helicopters manufactured today. These hook systems range from small 1,000-pound
capacity models up to the largest 36,000-pound capacity hooks employed on the
Super Stallion helicopter. Breeze-Eastern also manufactures aircraft and cargo
tie-downs. NORCO designs, develops and manufactures mechanical components and
systems such as hold open rods, quick connect/disconnect locking systems,
helicopter blade restraint systems, latch assemblies, safety locks and
application-specific mechanical systems. Its power transmission line of products
include rollnuts, rollnut longspan assemblies, ball reversers, ball oscillators,
FlenNute assemblies and other application-specific linear motion assemblies.

         Breeze-Eastern and NORCO sell their products through internal marketing
representatives and several independent sales representatives and distributors.
The Aerospace product lines contributed 20%, 22% and 17% to the Company's
consolidated net sales in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

                                       2
<PAGE>   4

         The Aerospace Product segment backlog varies substantially from time to
time due to the size and timing of orders. At March 31, 2000, the backlog of
unfilled orders was $44.2 million, compared to $43.8 million at March 31, 1999.
The majority of the March 31, 2000 backlog is expected to be shipped during
fiscal 2001.

DEFENSE INDUSTRY SALES

         Approximately 8% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2000, as
compared to 10% and 11% in 1999 and 1998, respectively, were derived from sales
to the United States Government, principally the military services of the
Department of Defense and its prime contractors. These contracts typically
contain precise performance specifications and are subject to customary
provisions which give the United States Government the contractual right of
termination for convenience. In the event of termination for convenience,
however, the Company is typically protected by provisions allowing reimbursement
for costs incurred as well as payment of any applicable fees or profits.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         Due primarily to Federal and State legislation which imposes liability,
regardless of fault, upon commercial product manufacturers for environmental
harm caused by chemicals, processes and practices that were commonly and
lawfully used prior to the enactment of such legislation, the Company may be
liable for all or a portion of the environmental clean-up costs at sites
previously owned or leased by the Company (or corporations acquired by the
Company). The Company's contingencies associated with environmental matters are
described in Note 12 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in
the Company's 2000 Annual Report on page 25 which is incorporated herein by
reference.

COMPETITION

         The Company's businesses compete in some markets with entities that are
larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than the
Company. Generally, competitive factors include design capabilities, product
performance, delivery and price. The Company's ability to compete successfully
in such markets will depend on its ability to develop and apply technological
innovations and to expand its customer base and product lines. The Company is
successfully doing so both internally and through acquisitions. There can be no
assurance that the Company will continue to successfully compete in any or all
of the businesses discussed above. The failure of the Company to compete in more
than one of these businesses could have a materially adverse effect on the
Company's profitability.

                                       3
<PAGE>   5

RAW MATERIALS

         The various components and raw materials used by the Company to produce
its products are generally available from more than one source. In those
instances where only a single source for any material is available, such items
can generally be redesigned to accommodate materials made by other suppliers. In
some cases, the Company stocks an adequate supply of the single source materials
for use until a new supplier can be approved. The Company's business is not
dependent upon a single supplier or a few suppliers, the loss of which would
have a materially adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial
position.

EMPLOYEES

         As of June 2, 2000, the Company employed 2,581 people. There were 2,277
employees associated with the Specialty Fastener Products segment, 283 with the
Aerospace Products segment and 21 with the corporate office.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

         Financial information relating to each of the Company's segments has
been included in Note 13 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"
included in the Company's 2000 Annual Report on pages 25-27 and is incorporated
herein by reference.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND SALES

         The Company's foreign-based facilities during fiscal 2000 consisted of
the Seeger-Orbis and Pebra facilities located in Konigstein and Frittlingen,
Germany, TransTechnology (GB) Limited's facility located in Glusburn, England,
sales offices in Paris, France, Barcelona, Spain and Surrey, England,
TransTechnology Brasil's facility located in Sao Paulo, Brazil and
TransTechnology Canada Corporation's facility located in Hamilton, Ontario. The
Company acquired the Seeger-Orbis and TransTechnology Brazil businesses on June
30, 1995. Pebra was acquired on June 18, 1996. TransTechnology (GB) resulted
from the consolidation on December 1, 1999, of Anderton International Limited,
acquired on June 30, 1995, and Ellison Holdings PLC, was acquired on July 19,
1999. TransTechnology Canada Corporation was incorporated on August 12, 1999 to
hold the Canadian based assets of Eaton's Engineered Fasteners Division acquired
on August 31, 1999. The Company had foreign sales of $66.2 million, $56.7
million and $57.2 million in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively,
representing 22%, 25% and 28% of the Company's consolidated net sales in each of
those years, respectively. The Company had export sales of $43.3 million, $31.2
million and $20.3 million in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively,
representing 15%, 14% and 10% of the Company's consolidated net sales in each of
those years, respectively. The risk and profitability attendant to these sales
is generally comparable to similar products sold in the United States. Net
sales, profits and identifiable assets attributable to the Company's foreign and
domestic operations, and the identification of export sales by geographic area,
are set forth in Note 13 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in the
Company's 2000 Annual Report on pages 25-27 and is incorporated herein by
reference.

<S>            <C>                              <C>

                -------------                    -------------
                                                              Shares

                -------------                    -------------
</TABLE>

              The installments shall be cumulative; i.e., this option may be
              exercised, as to any or all shares covered by an installment, at
              any time after an installment becomes exercisable and until
              expiration or termination of this option.

       4.     Exercise. This option may only be exercised by delivery to the
              Company of (i) a written notice of exercise, in form acceptable to
              the Company, stating the number of Shares then being purchased
              hereunder, and (ii) a check, or cash, in the amount of the
              purchase price of such shares (or, at the discretion of the Board
              of Directors, with Shares of Company with a market value equal to

              the Company or a subsidiary thereof for any reason other than his
              death or


<PAGE>   2


              disability, either Optionee or the person entitled to succeed to
              his rights hereunder shall have the right, at any time within
              three months after such termination of employment and prior to the
              expiration of this option pursuant to Paragraph 2 hereof, to
              exercise this option to the extent, but only to the extent, that
              this option was exercisable and had not previously been exercised
              at the date of such termination of employment; provided, however,
              that all rights under this option shall expire in any event on the
              day specified in Paragraph 2 hereof or three months after Optionee
              terminates employment, whichever first occurs.

       6.     Death of Optionee & No Assignment. The option shall not be
              assignable or transferable except by will or by the laws of
              descent and distribution and shall be exercisable during his
              lifetime only by the Optionee. If Optionee shall become disabled
              or die while in the employ of the Company, the Optionee or the
              person entitled to succeed to his rights hereunder may exercise
              this option until the first to occur of (i) the date one year from
              the date of the Optionee's disability or death, or (ii) the date
              such option expires pursuant to Paragraph 2 hereof to the extent
              that Optionee was entitled to exercise this Option at the date of
              his disability or death.

       7.     Employment of Optionee. In consideration of the granting of this
              option by the Company, the Optionee agrees to render faithful and
              efficient services to the Company or a subsidiary thereof, with
              such duties and responsibilities as the Company or such subsidiary
              shall from time to time prescribe, for a period of at least one
              year from the date this option is granted. Nothing in this
              Agreement or in the Plan shall confer upon the Optionee any right
              to continue in the employ of the Company or any subsidiary thereof
              or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the
              Company and its subsidiaries, which are hereby expressly reserved,
              to discharge the Optionee at any time for any reason whatsoever,
              with or without good cause.

       8.     No Rights as Stockholders. Optionee shall have no rights as a
              stockholder with respect to the Shares covered by the option until
              the date of the issuance of stock certificates to him. No
              adjustment will be made for dividends or other rights for which
              the record date is prior to the date such stock certificates are
              issued pursuant to the exercise of options granted hereunder.

       9.     Modification and Termination. The rights of Optionee are subject
              to modification and termination in certain events as provided in
              the Plan.

       10.    Shares Purchased for Investment. Optionee represents and agrees
              that if he exercises this option in whole or in part, he shall
              acquire the shares upon such exercise for the purpose of
              investment and not with a view to their resale or distribution.
              The Company reserves the right to include a legend on each
              certificate representing shares subject to this option, stating in
              effect that such shares have not been registered under the
              Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

       11.    This Agreement Subject to Plan. This agreement is made pursuant to
              all of the provisions of the Plan, and is intended, and shall be
              interpreted in a manner, to comply therewith. Any provision hereof
              inconsistent with the Plan shall be superseded and governed by the
              Plan.

       12.    Gender. Unless the context otherwise requires, the masculine
              gender includes the feminine.

       13.    Notices. Any notices or other communication required or permitted
              hereunder shall be sufficiently given if delivered personally or
              sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the
              Company at its corporate headquarters, and to the Optionee at the
              address above, or to such other address as shall be furnished in
              writing by either party to the other party, and shall be deemed to
              have been given as of the date so delivered or deposited in the
              United States mail, as the case may be.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this agreement.

       1.     Award; Acceptance of Award. Subject to the terms and conditions
              contained herein, the Company shall issue to Participant, as an
              award pursuant to the Plan and without payment by Participant of
              any consideration therefor, ______ shares of Restricted Stock, and
              Participant hereby accepts such award.

       2.     Forfeiture of Restricted Stock Upon Termination of Employment. In
              the event that Participant ceases to be a full-time employee of
              the Company or any corporation a majority of the voting stock of
              which is owned directly or indirectly by the Company (a
              "Subsidiary") for any reason whatsoever (including without
              limitation by reason of the termination of such employment by the
              Company or a Subsidiary with or without cause, by reason of
              disability, death or retirement or by reason of Participant
              leaving the employ of the Company or a Subsidiary voluntarily),
              then a portion (determined as hereinafter set forth) of the shares
              of Restricted Stock awarded pursuant to this Agreement shall
              thereupon automatically, and without further notice, demand,
              period of time or legal or administrative proceeding, be forfeited
              and canceled, and all right, title and interest therein of
              Participant shall terminate and expire, without payment by the
              Company or any Subsidiary of any consideration therefor and
              without any liability on the part of the Company or any
              Subsidiary. Such forfeiture provisions shall apply as follows:



<PAGE>   2



              (a)    If the Participant so ceases to be such an employee on or
                     after___________, ______ (the "Award Date") but prior to
                     that date which occurs one year thereafter (the "First
                     Anniversary Date"), 100% of the total number of shares of
                     Restricted Stock awarded pursuant to this Agreement shall
                     be so forfeited and canceled;

              (b)    If the Participant so ceases to be such an employee on or
                     after the First Anniversary Date but prior to that date
                     which occurs two years after the Award Date (the "Second
                     Anniversary Date"), then 66-2/3% of the total number of
                     shares of Restricted Stock awarded pursuant to this
                     Agreement shall be so forfeited and canceled;

              (c)    If the Participant so ceases to be such an employee on or
                     after the Second Anniversary Date but prior to that date
                     which occurs three years after the Award Date (the "Third
                     Anniversary Date"), then 33-1/3% of the total number of
                     shares of Restricted Stock awarded pursuant to this
                     Agreement shall be so forfeited and canceled; and

              (d)    If the Participant remains a continuous full-time employee
                     of the Company or a Subsidiary until the Third Anniversary
                     Date, then none of the shares of Restricted Stock awarded
                     pursuant to this Agreement shall be forfeited or canceled.

              For purposes of the foregoing, the Participant shall not lose his
              or her status as a full-time employee of the Company or a
              Subsidiary by reason of time away from such employment as a result
              of authorized vacation, authorized leave of absence, and leave by
              reason of sickness or disability of not longer than three
              consecutive months (or such longer period as the Committee may
              specifically permit, in its sole discretion, in any particular
              instance upon written request by the Participant to do so).

              Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant may elect to extend
              the period during which shares of Restricted Stock are subject to
              forfeiture and cancellation (the "Restriction Period") as follows.
              If the Participant desires to extend the Restriction Period, the
              Participant shall deliver to the Company a written request that
              the Restriction Period be extended for a specified period or until
              a specified event. Such election shall be subject in each case to
              the Committee's approval and to such terms as are determined by
              the Committee, all in its sole discretion. The Committee shall
              notify the Participant of its approval and such terms as have been
              determined by the Committee, or of its disapproval (as the case
              may be), within 30 days of its receipt of the Participant's
              written request to extend the Restriction Period. Subject to any
              exceptions adopted by the Committee, each request must generally
              be made at least twelve months prior to the applicable date, set
              forth above in this Section 2, upon which shares of Restricted
              Stock may no longer be forfeited or canceled.

       3.     Forfeiture Procedures. If, pursuant to Sections 2 or 7 of this
              Agreement, any shares of Restricted Stock are forfeited and
              canceled, such forfeiture and cancellation shall be documented
              pursuant to the appropriate one of the following procedures:


                                       2
<PAGE>   3


              (a)    If a certificate or certificates representing the number of
                     shares of Restricted Stock so forfeited and canceled are in
                     the possession of the Company pursuant to Section 4 hereof,
                     then the officer of the Company having custody of such
                     certificate shall, forthwith upon the occurrence of the
                     event resulting in such forfeiture and cancellation,
                     transmit such certificates to the Company's transfer agent
                     and registrar (or, if the Company has no such transfer
                     agent or registrar, then to the appropriate officer of the
                     Company) with information as to the number of shares so
                     forfeited and canceled and, if the certificates evidence a
                     number of shares greater than the amount to be so canceled,
                     with instructions that a certificate representing the
                     shares not so canceled be issued in the name of the
                     Participant; and

              (b)    If, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 2 or 7 of this
                     Agreement, any shares of Restricted Stock are forfeited and
                     canceled and the Company does not have in its possession a
                     certificate or certificates representing the shares so
                     forfeited and canceled, then the Participant shall, upon
                     written demand from the Company, furnish to the Company a
                     certificate duly endorsed and assigned to the Company
                     representing the number of shares of Restricted Stock so
                     forfeited and canceled and, upon its receipt thereof, the
                     Company shall follow the procedures indicated in the
                     preceding paragraph.

              The Participant agrees to provide the Company, upon its request
              therefor, with one or more stock assignments separate from
              certificate, executed by the Participant without completing the
              information as to share amount transferred or name of transferee,
              and with such other and further instruments of assignment or other
              documents which may be reasonably required in order to implement
              the forfeiture and cancellation provisions of Sections 2 and 7 of
              this Agreement.

       4.     Issuance of Restricted Stock; Retention of Certificate by Company.
              Within a reasonable time after the execution of this Agreement by
              the Company and the Participant, the Company shall issue, in the
              name of the Participant as the registered holder thereof,
              certificates representing, in the aggregate, the number of shares
              of Restricted Stock awarded pursuant to Section 1 hereof. At the
              time of such issuance and at all times thereafter, the Company
              shall deliver to Participant, upon the Participant's request, one
              or more certificates (in such denominations as the Participant may
              direct) representing in the aggregate a number of shares of Common
              Stock which does not at any time exceed the number of shares not
              subject to forfeiture and cancellation under Section 2 hereof.
              Certificates representing the remaining shares of Restricted Stock
              awarded hereunder (which shares are subject to possible forfeiture
              and cancellation pursuant to Section 2 hereof) shall be retained
              in the custody of the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the
              Company (or any other officer of the Company designated by the
              Board of Directors of the Company) for the purpose of implementing
              the forfeiture and cancellation provisions of this Agreement.

       5.     Stock Splits, Stock Dividends, Mergers and Reorganizations. If, at
              any time or from time to time when there are shares of Restricted
              Stock subject to forfeiture and cancellation under Section 2
              hereof:


                                       3
<PAGE>   4


              (a)    There is any stock dividend or liquidating dividend of cash
                     and/or property, stock split or other change in the
                     character or amount of any of the outstanding securities of
                     the Company; or

              (b)    There is any consolidation, merger or sale of all, or
                     substantially all, of the assets of the Company; then, in
                     such event, any and all new, substituted or additional
                     securities or other property to which the Participant is
                     entitled by reason of his or her ownership of the shares of
                     Restricted Stock which are so subject to forfeiture and
                     cancellation shall be immediately and similarly subject to
                     such forfeiture and shall be included in the words and
                     treated as "Restricted Stock" for all purposes of such
                     forfeiture provisions and all other terms and conditions
                     hereof with the same force and effect as the original
                     shares of Restricted Stock subject to such forfeiture
                     provisions.

              Notwithstanding the above, upon the dissolution or liquidation of
              the Company or upon any reorganization, merger or consolidation in
              which the Company does not survive, the forfeiture and
              cancellation provisions of Section 2 shall terminate as to any
              shares of Restricted Stock not previously forfeited and canceled
              pursuant to such provisions.

       6.     Indemnification of Company. The Participant hereby agrees to
              indemnify the Company and to hold the Company harmless from and
              against any loss, liability, cost or expense, including attorneys'
              fees and expenses, which the Company may incur or to which the
              Company may be subject by any reason of or based upon the fact
              that the Company has custody of any certificates representing
              Restricted Stock retained in accordance with Section 4 hereof and
              that such stock, or any right, title or interest therein, may
              become involved in any legal, administrative or arbitration
              proceeding.

       7.     Transfer or Hypothecation of Stock. The Participant agrees that he
              or she will not transfer, sell, pledge, assign or in any other way
              hypothecate, alienate or dispose of any shares of Restricted Stock
              awarded under this Agreement so long as such shares are subject to
              forfeiture and cancellation under Section 2 hereof. It is agreed
              that if the Participant does, or attempts to do, or suffers any of
              such prohibited acts or events specified in the immediately
              preceding sentence, then forthwith upon the occurrence of such act
              or event such shares shall be automatically forfeited and
              canceled, without payment by the Company of any consideration
              therefor and without any notice, demand, period of time or legal
              or administrative proceeding.

       8.     Ownership Rights. Subject only to the provisions of this
              Agreement, the Participant shall have all of the rights, powers
              and privileges of an owner of shares of Common Stock, including
              without limitation the right to vote such shares and to receive
              non-liquidating cash dividends and non-liquidating distributions
              thereon, with respect to shares of Restricted Stock awarded
              hereunder notwithstanding that certificates representing any or
              all of such shares are retained by the Company pursuant to Section
              4 hereof; provided, however, that all such rights shall terminate
              automatically with respect to any shares forfeited and canceled
              pursuant to Sections 2 or 7 of this Agreement.


                                       4
<PAGE>   5


       9.     Endorsement on Share Certificates. The Participant agrees that the
              certificates representing any Restricted Stock subject to the
              forfeiture and cancellation provisions of Section 2 may have
              endorsed upon them in a conspicuous manner a legend in
              substantially the following form:

                 "The voluntary or involuntary transfer or encumbrance of
                 the shares represented by this certificate are restricted
                 by, and such shares are subject to, the provisions of a
                 certain agreement between the company and the registered
                 holder hereof (which agreement, among other things,
                 subjects such shares to possible forfeiture and
                 cancellation), a copy of which is on file at the principal
                 office of the company and will be furnished to the holder
                 of this certificate upon request without charge."

              When the forfeiture and cancellation provisions of Section 2
              hereof expire or terminate as to any of such shares, the Company
              shall, upon the Participant's request and at no charge to the
              Participant, exchange the certificates representing the shares
              that contain the endorsement provided for herein for new
              certificates representing those of the shares as to which such
              rights have expired or terminated containing no such endorsement
              and certificates containing such endorsement representing the
              balance of the shares as to which such rights have not expired or
              terminated.

       10.    No Contract of Employment. The Participant acknowledges and agrees
              that this Agreement shall not be construed to give Participant any
              right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any
              Subsidiary, and that the right and power of the Company or any
              Subsidiary to dismiss or discharge the Participant (with or
              without cause) is strictly reserved. The Participant recognizes
              that, in the event of any such discharge, the forfeiture
              provisions of Section 2 hereof shall be fully applicable.

       11.    Tax Withholding. Participant acknowledges that the Company is
              required, and hereby specifically authorizes the Company, to
              deduct and withhold from the wages, salary or other income payable
              by the Company to Participant from time to time, the requisite
              amounts required to be so deducted and withheld for federal, state
              or local taxes with respect to the award of Restricted Stock
              hereunder. Participant specifically authorizes the Company to
              withhold such amounts from time to time, as required by law, in
              connection with the termination or expiration of the forfeiture
              provisions of Section 2 hereof. Participant agrees that the
              Company may, at its election, require Participant to pay to the
              Company (for such withholding on behalf of Participant) any
              amounts required to be so withheld if such amounts are not
              directly withheld from such wages, salary or other income, and in
              such event Participant shall forthwith make such payments.

       12.    Governing Law. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of
              the parties hereto shall be governed by and construed in
              accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of
              Delaware.

       13.    Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted
              hereunder shall be sufficiently given only if delivered personally
              or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the
              Company at its principal place of business, or to the


                                       5

              Participant at the address below or any address of Participant
              appearing on the Company's stock records, or to such other address
              or addresses as shall be furnished in writing in the foregoing
              manner by either party to the other party, and shall be deemed to
              have been given as of the date so personally delivered or two days
              after the date deposited in the United States mail, as the case
              may be.

       IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of
the date first above written.

Dear

       In order to induce you to serve or continue to serve as an officer or
director of TransTechnology Corporation (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation,
or one of its subsidiaries, and in consideration of your so serving, the Company
hereby agrees to indemnify you according to the terms and conditions set forth
below:

       1.     Indemnification.

              (a)    The Company hereby agrees to indemnify you to the fullest
                     extent permitted by the law of the State of Delaware, as
                     amended from time to time ("Delaware Law"), in connection
                     with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
                     proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
                     investigative (other than an action by or in the right of
                     the Company), to which you were or are a party or to which
                     you were or are threatened to be made a party by reason of
                     the fact that you were or are a director, member of any
                     committee of the board of directors, officer, employee or
                     agent of the Company, or were or are serving at the request
                     of the Company as a director, member of any committee of
                     the board of directors, officer, employee or agent of
                     another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
                     employee benefit plan or other enterprise, or by reason of
                     anything done or not done by you in any such capacity,
                     against any and all reasonable expenses (including fees and
                     expenses of counsel), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
                     settlement actually incurred by you in connection with the
                     investigation, defense, appeal or settlement of any such
                     action, suit or proceeding if you acted in good faith and
                     in a manner you reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
                     to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to
                     any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause
                     to believe your conduct was unlawful.




              (b)    The Company hereby agrees to indemnify you to the fullest
                     extent permitted by Delaware Law in connection with any
                     threatened, pending or completed

                     judgment in its favor to which you were or are a party or
                     to which you were or are threatened to be made a party by
                     reason of the fact that you were or are a director,
                     officer, employee or agent of the Company, or were or are
                     serving at the request of the Company as a director, member
                     of any committee of the board of directors, officer,
                     employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
                     joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
                     enterprise, or by reason of anything done or not done by
                     you in any such capacity, against any and all reasonable
                     expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel) and
                     amounts paid in settlement actually incurred by you in
                     connection with the investigation, defense, appeal or
                     settlement of any such action, suit or proceeding if you
                     acted in good faith and in a manner you reasonably believed
                     to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
                     Company; provided, however, that no such indemnification
                     shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as
                     to which you shall have been adjudged to be liable to the
                     Company unless and only to the extent that the Court of
                     Chancery or the court in which such suit, action or
                     proceeding was brought shall determine upon application
                     that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of
                     all the circumstances of the case, you are fairly and
                     reasonably entitled to indemnification for such amounts
                     which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem
                     proper.

              (c)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, to
                     the extent that you are, by reason of your status as a
                     director or officer of the Company, a witness in any
                     action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
                     administrative or investigative, you shall be indemnified
                     against all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by
                     you or on your behalf in connection therewith.

              (d)    For purposes hereof, the termination of any action, suit or
                     proceeding by judgement, order, settlement, conviction, or
                     upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall
                     not, of itself, create a presumption that you did not act
                     in good faith and in a manner which you reasonably believed
                     to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
                     Company, and with respect to any criminal action or
                     proceeding, that you had reasonable cause to believe your
                     conduct was unlawful.

              (e)    No indemnity pursuant to Section 1 shall be paid by the
                     Company on account of any suit in which judgment is
                     rendered against you, as an officer or director, for an
                     accounting of profits made from the purchase or sale by you
                     of securities of the Company pursuant to the provisions of
                     Section 16(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
                     and amendments thereto or similar provisions of any
                     applicable federal, state or local law.

              (f)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, to
                     the extent that you are successful on the merits or
                     otherwise in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding
                     described in (a) or (b) of Section 1, or in the defense of
                     any

                     claim, issue or matter therein, you shall be indemnified
                     against expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel)
                     reasonably incurred by you in connection therewith.

                     If you are entitled to indemnification under this agreement
                     to only a portion of the amounts actually incurred by you
                     in the investigation, defense, appeal or settlement of any
                     action, suit or proceeding but not for the total amount
                     thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify you for
                     the portion thereof to which you are entitled.

              (g)    Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, (i) the
                     Company shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses
                     of any counsel or amounts paid in any settlement unless the
                     Company shall have previously approved such counsel or such
                     settlement, which approval shall not be unreasonably
                     withheld, and (ii) the Company shall not be obligated to
                     approve more than one counsel to represent you and all
                     other officers and directors entitled to indemnification
                     under agreements similar to this agreement in any single or
                     similar action, suit or proceeding in the same
                     jurisdiction, unless representation of all such officers or
                     directors by the same counsel would be inappropriate
                     because of actual or potential differing interests among
                     you and such officers and directors.

                     Any determination as to approval of counsel or of any
                     settlement shall be made by the Company within five days
                     following your written request for such approval. In
                     determining whether to approve any counsel, the Company
                     shall consider only the following factors: (i) the
                     reputation of such counsel for performing quality legal
                     work, (ii) the level of education and experience of such
                     counsel, (iii) the level of expertise of such counsel with
                     respect to the type of action, suit or proceeding involved,
                     and (iv) the existence of any conflict of interest that
                     such counsel may have in connection with such action, suit
                     or proceeding.

       2.     Method of Payment.

              (a)    Except as otherwise provided in (b) below, you shall, upon
                     making a written request to the Company accompanied by
                     supporting documentation as described below, be entitled to
                     receive promptly (but in no event more than 30 days after
                     the Company's receipt of such written request) from the
                     Company, and the Company agrees to pay to you, by check
                     payable in next day funds, the amount you are entitled to
                     receive from the Company pursuant to Section 1 (the
                     "Indemnified Amounts"). In making any such written request,
                     you shall submit to the Company a schedule setting forth in
                     reasonable detail the amount expended (or incurred and
                     expected to be expended) for each Indemnified Amount,
                     accompanied by a copy of the relevant bill, agreement or
                     other documentation.

              (b)    In the event you are unsuccessful on the merits or
                     otherwise in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding
                     referred to in Section 1, you shall be similarly entitled
                     to receive promptly, but in no event more than 30 days
                     after the Company's receipt of such written request from
                     the Company, upon making a written request to the Company
                     accompanied by supporting documentation described above,
                     payment of Indemnified Amounts, unless a determination is
                     made within the 30 day period referred to above by (a) a
                     majority vote of directors of the Company who were not
                     parties to such action, suit or proceeding even though less
                     than a quorum, (b) a committee of such directors of the
                     Company, designated by a majority vote of such directors,
                     even though less than a quorum, or (c) independent legal
                     counsel (being an attorney or firm of attorneys who shall
                     not have otherwise performed services for the Company
                     within the last five years (other than with respect to
                     matters concerning your rights under this agreement or of
                     other indemnitees under similar indemnity agreements) in a
                     written opinion (which counsel shall be appointed if (a)
                     and (b) are not obtainable) that you have not met the
                     relevant standard for indemnification set forth in Section
                     1.

       3.     Advancement of Indemnified Amounts. Indemnified Amounts expended
              by you or reasonably expected to be expended by you within three
              months next succeeding a request by you as described below shall
              be paid by the Company in advance of the final resolution of any
              suit, action or proceeding (an "Advanced Amount") upon your
              written request, which shall include a schedule setting forth in
              reasonable detail the amount expended, or reasonably expected to
              be expended within the next three months, by you for any
              Indemnified Amount, accompanied by a copy of the relevant bill,
              agreement or other documentation. You may make as many requests
              for an Advanced Amount under this Section as you deem reasonably
              necessary to cover Indemnified Amounts expended or reasonably
              expected to be expended, provided that each request shall be at
              least for the sum of $1,000.

              You hereby agree to repay all Advanced Amounts to the Company by
              check payable in next day funds promptly following the final
              resolution of any action, suit or proceeding to which such
              Advanced Amounts relate if it is determined that you are not
              entitled to indemnification with respect thereto pursuant to
              Section 1.

              In the event that you are entitled to indemnification pursuant to
              Section 1, you shall have the right to seek payment for the
              portion of Indemnified Amounts which is in excess of Advanced
              Amounts received by you (the "Unadvanced Indemnified Amounts") by
              following the procedures set forth in Section 2; provided that the
              schedule of Indemnified Amounts shall in addition set forth each
              and every Advanced Amount received as of the date of such listing
              in order to calculate the net Unadvanced Indemnified Amounts.
              Alternatively, if you are entitled to indemnification pursuant to
              Section 1 and the total of the Advanced Amounts theretofore
              received by you exceeds the total amount of Indemnified Amounts,
              you shall pay the amount of the difference to the Company by a
              check payable in next day funds promptly upon the determination of
              the amount of such excess.

       4.     Enforcement of Rights Under this Agreement. The rights to
              indemnification or advances pursuant to this agreement shall be
              enforceable by you in any court of competent jurisdiction and your
              expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing
              your right to indemnification or advances, in whole or in part, in
              any such proceedings shall be paid by the Company. In any such
              proceeding, the Company shall have the burden of proving by the
              preponderance of the evidence that you are not entitled to
              indemnification or advances hereunder. Neither the failure of the
              Company (including its Board of Directors, independent legal
              counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination that you are
              entitled to indemnification or advances in the circumstances nor
              an actual determination by the Company (including its Board of
              Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) that you are
              not so entitled shall be a defense to an action or create a
              presumption that you are not so entitled.

       5.     Rights to Indemnification Not Exclusive; Subrogation Rights, Etc.
              The indemnification rights hereunder shall not be deemed exclusive
              of any other rights to which you may be entitled under any law,
              agreement, provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
              of the Company, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
              otherwise, both as to action in your official capacity and as to
              action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall
              continue as to you after you have ceased to be a director,
              officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of your
              heirs, executors and administrators.

              In the event you shall receive payment from any insurance carrier
              or from the plaintiff in any action, suit or proceeding against
              you in respect of Indemnified Amounts after payments on account of
              all or part of such Indemnified Amounts have been made by the
              Company pursuant hereto, you shall reimburse to the Company the
              amount, if any, by which the sum of such payment by such insurance
              carrier or such plaintiff and payments by the Company to you
              exceeds such Indemnified Amounts; provided that such portions, if
              any, of any such insurance proceeds that are required to be
              reimbursed to the insurance carrier under the terms of its
              insurance policy shall not be deemed to be payments to you
              hereunder. In addition, upon payment of Indemnified Amounts
              hereunder, the Company shall be subrogated to your rights (to the
              extent thereof) against any insurance carrier in respect of such
              Indemnified Amounts (to the extent permitted under such insurance
              policies). Such right of subrogation shall be terminated upon
              receipt by the Company of the amount to be reimbursed by you
              pursuant to the first sentence of this Section.

       6.     Successors; Binding Agreement. The Company shall require any
              successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger,
              consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the
              business and/or assets of the Company, by agreement in form and
              substance reasonably satisfactory to you, expressly to assume and
              agree to perform this agreement in the same manner and to the same
              extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such
              succession had taken place.

              This agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
              your personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators,
              successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If you
              should die while any amounts would still be payable to you
              hereunder if you had continued to live, all such amounts, unless
              otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the
              terms of this agreement to your devisee, legatee, or other
              designee, or if there be no such designee, to your estate.

       7.     Notice. For the purposes of this agreement, notices and all other
              communications provided for in this agreement shall be in writing
              and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or
              mailed by United States registered mail, return receipt requested,
              postage prepaid, as follows:

              other in writing in accordance herewith, except that notices of
              change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.


       8.     Miscellaneous. No provision of this agreement may be modified,
              waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge
              is agreed to in writing signed by you and either the Company's
              Chairman of the Board, President or another officer of the Company
              specifically designated by the Board of Directors. No waiver by
              either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party
              hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this
              agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a
              waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the
              same or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreement or
              representations, verbal or otherwise, express or implied, with
              respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either
              party which are not set forth expressly in this agreement. This
              agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
              Delaware Law, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts
              of laws thereof.

       9.     Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
              of this agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability
              of any other provision of this agreement, which shall remain in
              full force and effect.

       10.    Counterparts. This agreement may be executed in one or more
              counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but
              all of which together shall constitute one and the same
              instrument.

       11.    Modifications. No change in the Company's certificate of
              incorporation or by laws or in the Delaware General Corporation
              Law subsequent to the date of this agreement shall have the effect
              of limiting or eliminating the indemnification available under
              this agreement as to any act, omission or capacity for which this
              agreement provides indemnification at the time of such act,
              omission or capacity. To the extent that a change in the Delaware
              General Corporation Law (whether by statute or judicial decision)
              permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be
              afforded currently under the Company's certificate of
              incorporation, by laws and this agreement, it is the intent of the
              parties hereto that you shall enjoy by this agreement the greater
              benefits so afforded by such change. If any change in the Delaware
              General Corporation Law diminishes the power of the Company to
              indemnify you, such change, except to the extent otherwise
              required by law to be applied to this agreement, shall have no
              effect on this agreement or the parties' rights and obligations
              hereunder.

       If this letter correctly sets forth our agreement on the subject matter
hereof, kindly sign and return to the Secretary of the Company the enclosed copy
of this letter, which shall then constitute our agreement on this matter.

       This agreement is entered into and is effective as of the date first
written above.

During the fiscal year that ended March 31, 2000 our company made two strategic
acquisitions that have increased our focus on our niche businesses and laid the
foundation for stronger, more rapid growth in shareholder value. The Tinnerman
assembly fastener business and the Ellison retaining ring business will further
extend our global leadership position in each of those product lines as well as
provide us the opportunity to increase their growth and profitability. Primarily
as a result of these acquisitions, sales increased 31% in the fiscal year,
although after tax income from operations decreased 14% and net income, after
the recognition of special charges and an extraordinary item, decreased 52%.

Our results for fiscal 2000 were mixed, with both successes and disappointments.
Our internal operating results and share price were affected by external
conditions in the marketplace and the economy. The dramatic decline in the price
of shares in small cap industrial companies over the past two years has been a
tremendous financial blow not only to our shareholders, but also to those of our
entire peer group. Much has been written about the disconnect in valuations
between industrials and high-tech and Internet stocks, but knowing that it is a
systemic problem shared by many does not make the effects of that disconnect any
easier to live with. Fortunately, some of the excesses in the market seem to be
correcting themselves, and we hope to see a more rational investment outlook
return soon. Operationally, a surprisingly strong British Pound sterling against
the Euro and Deutsche mark reduced sales and profits in the European retaining
ring product lines that were already weakened by a slowdown in the distribution
and machinery markets. The 20% decline in the Euro over the past fifteen months
gave a second wallop as we translated our German results into dollars. Also
adding to our challenges were higher interest rates on our non-acquisition
related borrowings and the short-term amortization of bank loan fees related to
our fiscal 2000 acquisitions and refinancing.

The downturn of our aerospace fastener unit in fiscal 2000 was the single
largest factor contributing to missing our company-wide internal targets for the
first time in eight years. The unit's revenues were cut almost in half from 1999
levels and profits were eliminated completely because of several factors,
including the loss of its largest customer; a slowdown in the airframe build
rate; Boeing's "push-back" upon the fastener industry of over $400 million in
"excess" fastener inventories; work stoppages at Boeing; the consolidation of
several major distributors, and severe price cutting as manufacturers suddenly
found themselves with excess capacity.

Our domestic retaining ring business saw further erosion in its market share in
the first half of the year, although it began to recoup some of its lost ground
in the second half. The July 1999 acquisition of the Ellison business was
dilutive in fiscal 2000, in that no operating earnings were realized from the
combined Anderton/Ellison business as the consolidation began, yet interest
expense on the purchase price and plant consolidation charges were recognized
for eight months. The physical consolidation of the Anderton and Ellison
factories in the UK is now complete, with more than $4 million of annual
operating costs scheduled for elimination beginning in the first quarter of
fiscal 2001.

Our other fastener businesses are also developing in an exciting fashion. German
and European distribution and industrial markets for retaining rings have
recently become very strong, and our domestic unit has begun to regain the
market share it lost over the past four years. Of equal importance, the
worldwide retaining ring business has now been consolidated under a single
management team, with a focused global marketing organization determined to
regain market share and enter new markets. Our assembly fastener business is
also poised for growth in both revenues and operating income as the combination
of Palnut with Tinnerman hits its stride, building on Tinnerman's contribution
of $.08 per share in just seven months of fiscal 2000. The highly skilled
engineering sales force of Tinnerman fills a long-missing link in our assembly
fastener business, and the broad Palnut product line provides Tinnerman's
customers a much wider offering of fastening solutions.

Our aerospace products group once again outperformed our expectations and posted
another record year of sales and profits. Our Norco, Inc. division, acquired in
July 1998, has more than doubled its operating profit since it became part of
our company, while Breeze-Eastern set a new record for sales and operating
profit. Both divisions have strong backlogs and solid prospects for further
growth in fiscal 2001 and beyond.

As we enter the new fiscal year, your management team is focused on four basic
initiatives. First, we want to maximize the value added of our products by
focusing on engineered solutions to solve our customers' problems. Second, we
want to produce our products to the highest quality standards at the lowest cost
by utilizing lean manufacturing techniques. Third, we want to develop a company
with an industry-wide, multi-disciplinary approach to e-commerce. And, fourth,
we want to concentrate our efforts to pay-down debt further by reducing working
capital, liquidating excess assets, and accelerating cash flows. We believe that
these four programs, each under the leadership of a senior manager, will provide
the impetus and framework for each of our business units and the company as a
whole to achieve their potential in fiscal 2001.

As I end this eighth year as your chairman and chief executive officer, I would
like to thank each of the more than 2,600 TransTechnology employees around the
world who work so hard to make this company the success that it is today. The
best part of my job is to meet these people in their offices and factories, and
to see the pride and excitement that they put into their work. It is their
spirit that drives our company forward.

I would also like to thank each of the members of our Board of Directors who
have provided our management team with advice, support and guidance as we have
seen the world change so rapidly around us. And, most importantly, I thank you,
the shareholders, who have placed your trust, confidence, and resources in our
hands. We appreciate your support, and look forward to continued growth in the
future.

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of TransTechnology Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TransTechnology
Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related
statements of consolidated operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2000. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of TransTechnology Corporation and

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

BUSINESS - The fiscal year for TransTechnology Corporation (the "Company") ends
on March 31. Accordingly, all references to years in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements refer to the fiscal year ended March 31 of the indicated
year unless otherwise specified.

The Company develops, manufactures and sells a wide range of products in two
industry segments, Specialty Fastener Products and Aerospace Products. The
Company has manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Canada,
Germany, the United Kingdom and Brazil. The Specialty Fastener Products Segment
produces highly engineered precision metal retaining rings, gear driven band
fasteners, circlips, custom cold-formed parts, head light adjusters, rivets and
other threaded and non-threaded assembly fasteners primarily for the automotive,
heavy truck, industrial, aerospace and consumer/durables markets and accounted
for approximately 80% of the Company's consolidated 2000 net sales. Through its
Aerospace Products Segment, the Company develops, manufactures, sells and
services a complete line of sophisticated lifting and restraining products,
principally performance critical helicopter rescue hoist and cargo hook systems,
winches and hoists for aircraft and weapons systems and aircraft engine
compartment hold open rods, actuators and other motion control devices. This
segment accounted for approximately 20% of the Company's consolidated 2000 net
sales.

USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in its
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which, except
one subsidiary in Spain, are wholly-owned. Intercompany balances and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in less than 20% owned
companies are accounted for by the cost method.

REVENUE RECOGNITION - Sales and cost of sales are recorded when title passes to
customers which is generally at the time products are shipped. All of the
Company's contracts are firm fixed-price. Accounts receivable from the United
States Government represent billed receivables and substantially all amounts are
expected to be collected within one year. Losses on contracts are recorded as
they are identified.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with a maturity at date of acquisition of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.

INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes material, labor
and manufacturing overhead costs.

PROPERTY AND RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION - Property is recorded at
cost. Provisions for depreciation are made on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of depreciable assets ranging from three to thirty years.
Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed on a straight-line basis over
the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the terms of
the leases. The Company reviews property and equipment and assets held for sale
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. It has been determined that
no impairment loss needs to be recognized for such assets.

COSTS IN EXCESS OF NET ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES -
The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets
of acquired businesses is included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets under the caption "Costs in excess of net assets of acquired businesses"
and is being amortized over 40 years. The Company has determined that there is
no impairment in value, since projected future cash flows on an undiscounted
basis, through the period such costs in excess of net assets of acquired
businesses are being amortized, are in excess of the recorded asset amount.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS - Patents are amortized on a straight-line basis over
their remaining lives not to exceed 20 years. Trademarks are amortized on a
straight-line basis over 40 years.

EARNINGS PER SHARE ("EPS") - The computation of basic earnings per share is
based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The
computation of diluted earnings per share assumes the foregoing and, in
addition, the exercise of all dilutive stock options using the treasury stock
method.

The components of the denominator for basic earnings per common share and
diluted earnings per common share are reconciled as follows:

<PAGE>   20
Options to purchase 288,759 shares of common stock at prices between $15.13 and
$30.13 were outstanding during 2000 but were not included in the computation of
diluted EPS because the options' exercise prices were greater than the average
market price of the common shares. Similarly, during 1999 options to purchase
169,774 shares of common stock at prices between $22.94 and $27.88 were
outstanding but were not included in the computation of EPS. During 1998, all
options to purchase common stock were included in the computation of EPS.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING COSTS - Research and development costs and
engineering costs, which are charged to expense when incurred, amounted to $2.0
million, $2.4 million and $2.1 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Included in these amounts were expenditures of $1.3 million, $1.2 million and
$1.1 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, which represent costs related
to research and development activities.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The assets and liabilities of the Company's
international operations have been translated into U.S. dollars at year-end
exchange rates, with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated as a
separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Income and expense
items are converted into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing
during the year. The Company treated its operation in Brazil as highly
inflationary until the end of the third quarter of fiscal 1999. Effective
December 28, 1998, the Brazilian operation ceased to be considered highly
inflationary by the Company and the functional currency was changed from the
U.S. dollar to the Brazilian real.

INCOME TAXES - Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.

INVESTMENTS - On March 1, 1994, the Company received 465,000 shares of Mace
Security International common stock, valued at $3.4 million, as partial
consideration for the sale of a division. In March 1997, the Company recorded a
$2.6 million pretax charge to continuing operations to write-down the carrying
value of these shares to their current market value as the decline in value of
these shares was determined to be other than temporary. During fiscal 1999, the
Company sold all of these shares for $2.0 million and realized a pretax gain of
$1.1 million.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments
for trading purposes. Amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swap
agreements are recognized as increases or reductions in interest expense in the
periods in which they accrue. The Company enters into off-balance-sheet forward
foreign exchange instruments in order to hedge certain intercompany financing
denominated in foreign currencies, accounts receivable denominated in foreign
currencies, a percentage of projected sales denominated in foreign currencies,
and projected foreign currency intercompany purchases. Gains and losses on the
financing transactions are included in other income - net. Gains and losses on
forward foreign exchange instruments that hedge specific third party
transactions are included in the cost or carrying value of the underlying
transaction. Gains and losses on instruments that are hedges of projected third
party transactions are included in current period income.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - In June 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities was issued and, as amended by SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS
Statement No. 133 in June 1999, is effective for the Company for its fiscal year
ending March 31, 2002. SFAS No. 133 requires that all derivative instruments be
measured at fair value and recognized in the balance sheet as either assets or
liabilities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this pronouncement
will have on its consolidated financial statements.

RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years'
financial statements to conform to the 2000 presentation.

2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

During fiscal 1998 the Company recorded after tax costs of $0.9 million for the
disposal of previously discontinued and sold operations. These costs represent
adjustments to previous estimates related primarily to legal and environmental
matters.

Included in Other Assets at both March 31, 2000 and 1999 were assets held for
sale related to discontinued operations of $5.2 million.

3.  ACQUISITIONS

On August 31, 1999, the Company acquired all of the assets and assumed certain
liabilities, consisting primarily of trade debts and accrued expenses, of the
Engineered Fasteners Division of Eaton Corporation and its Tinnerman product
line (collectively referred to as "Tinnerman") for a total purchase price of
$173.3 million in cash. Tinnerman had 650 employees and manufactures a wide
variety of fastening devices for the automotive, business equipment, consumer
electronics and home appliance markets. Tinnerman has manufacturing facilities
in Brunswick and Massillon, Ohio and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

On July 19, 1999, the Company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of
Ellison Holdings PLC, a privately held company, and its German affiliate
Ellison, Roettges & Co. GmbH (collectively referred to as "Ellison") for $13.8
million in cash, a $0.4 million note payable 24 months from the date of
acquisition and other contingent consideration. Ellison, headquartered in
Glusburn, West Yorkshire, England, manufactures retaining and snap rings as well
as lockwashers for the automotive, heavy vehicle and industrial markets. The
allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities of Ellison is
preliminary pending final purchase price adjustments, if any, between the
Company and the selling shareholders. As part of the acquisition plan, the
Company closed its existing facility in Bingley, UK and consolidated that
operation with the Ellison facility. In the quarter ended September 26, 1999,
the Company recorded a $4.5 million charge for the consolidation. In the quarter
ended March 31, 2000, the Company recorded an additional $0.1 million related to
this plant consolidation. The total charge consists of $3.8 million, principally
related to the write-down of Anderton's assets no longer being used to estimated
realizable values and other costs directly related to the exit of the facility,
and approximately $0.8 million for severance and related benefit payments to
approximately 100 Anderton employees. At March 31, 2000, the Company had $0.3
million remaining in current liabilities related to these costs.

In addition, in the quarter ended March 31, 2000, approximately $1.0 million was
charged to cost of sales primarily due to excess overtime incurred to produce
parts pending customer approval on first part production lots.

On June 29, 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Aerospace
Rivet Manufacturers Corporation ("ARM") for $26.2 million in cash, including
direct acquisition costs, and other contingent consideration. ARM, located in
City of Industry, California, produces rivets and externally threaded fasteners
for the aerospace industry.

On July 28, 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of NORCO,
Inc. ("NORCO") for $17.7 million in cash, including direct acquisition costs,
and other contingent consideration. NORCO, located in Ridgefield, Connecticut,
produces aircraft engine compartment hold open rods, actuators and other motion
control devices for the aerospace industry.

On April 17, 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of TCR
Corporation ("TCR") for $32.6 million in cash including direct acquisition
costs, and other contingent consideration. TCR, located in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, produces cold forged and other externally threaded fasteners and
related products for the automotive, heavy vehicle, marine and industrial
markets.

The following is a summary of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed

CREDIT AGREEMENT - Effective August 31, 1999, the Company's revolving credit
facility (the "Revolver") was amended and increased from $145.0 million to
$200.0 million, and additional term debt (the "Term Loan") of $50.0 million and
senior subordinated debt (the "Bridge Loan") of $75.0 million were obtained in
order to provide the necessary funds for the Tinnerman acquisition. Credit was
provided by the same group of lending banks plus several new lending banks. The
Revolver and Term Loan have a maturity of five years. The Bridge Loan has an
initial maturity of one year, after which time the Bridge Loan automatically
converts to a term loan subject to, among other things, an early payment premium
and the issuance of stock warrants (as more fully described below). The stock
warrants would provide for the lenders to obtain up to ten percent of the shares
of the Company's stock (on a fully diluted basis) after August 31, 2000. The
Company intends to replace the Bridge Loan before August 31, 2000 with
alternative long term subordinated debt under terms more favorable to the
Company. The Bridge Loan contains a provision for exit fees of approximately
$2.1 million which may be applied to certain refinancing fees.

An extraordinary charge for the refinancing of debt, net of tax, in the amount
of $0.5 million was incurred for the year ended March 31, 2000, to reflect the
write-off of the unamortized debt issue costs of the prior credit agreement.

The Company has unused borrowing capacity for both domestic and international
operations of $45.3 million as of March 31, 2000, and letters of credit of $4.9
million. The Revolver, Bridge Loan and Term Loan are secured by all of the
Company's assets. As of March 31, 2000, the Company had total borrowings of
$275.9 million under the amended agreements which have a weighted-average
interest rate of 10.48%. The Company had $1.4 million of other borrowings
consisting of collateralized borrowing arrangements with fixed interest rates of
3% and 3.75%, and loans on life insurance policies owned by the Company with a
fixed interest rate of 5%.

Borrowings under the Revolver as of March 31, 2000, were $154.7 million.
Interest on the Revolver is tied to the primary bank's prime rate, or at the
Company's option, the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), plus a margin
that varies depending upon the Company's achievement of certain operating
results. As of March 31, 2000, $152.5 million of the Company's outstanding
borrowings utilized LIBOR, of which $127.0 million were payable in U.S. Dollars
and $7.1 million and $18.4 million were payable in Deutsche marks and Pounds
sterling, respectively.

Borrowings under the Term Loan as of March 31, 2000, were $46.3 million of which
$7.5 million is due within one year, $8.8 million is due in year two, $10.0
million is due in year three, $12.5 million is due in year four, and $7.5
million is due upon maturity in year five.

Borrowings under the Bridge Loan as of March 31, 2000, were $75.0 million, all
of which is considered to be short term. Interest on the Bridge Loan is based on
LIBOR plus a margin which is currently 9.5% and increases in quarterly
increments subject to an overall maximum interest rate of 18%. The Bridge Loan
matures on August 31, 2000, after which time, unless replaced, it converts
automatically to senior subordinated term debt with additional provisions. The
major additional provisions of the resulting term debt provide for a warrant
escrow agreement that stipulates that the Company shall issue stock warrants to
the debt holders for 731,197 shares of the Company's stock exercisable at par
value (or $.01) per share, representing ten percent of the common equity of the
Company on a fully diluted basis after giving effect to the warrants. Other
provisions of the resulting term debt include various repayment premiums during
the first seven years of the term, an overall maximum interest rate of 18% and
the right of the holders of the Bridge Loan to require the Company to exchange
this debt for a class of debt securities which the Company would be required to
register for public distribution. The Company intends to replace the Bridge Loan
prior to its maturity and, therefore, does not expect to be subject to the
provisions of the term debt which would become effective after the Bridge Loan
maturity date on August 31, 2000.

The credit agreements require the Company to maintain interest rate protection
on a minimum of $125.0 million of its variable rate debt. The Company has,
accordingly, provided for this protection by means of interest rate swap
agreements which have fixed the rate of interest on $50.0 million of debt at a
base rate of 5.48% through May 4, 2002, and $75.0 million of debt at a base rate
of 6.58% through March 3, 2003. Under the agreement, the base interest rate is
added to the applicable interest rate margin to determine the total interest
rate in effect. The credit agreement also limits the Company's ability to pay
dividends to 25% of net income and restricts annual capital expenditures to
$12.0 million through 2001, $13.0 million in 2002, and $15.0 million thereafter,
and contains other customary financial covenants.

Other - Other long-term debt is comprised principally of collateralized
borrowing arrangements with fixed interest rates of 3% and 3.75% and loans on
life insurance policies owned by the Company with a fixed interest rate of 5%.

7.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND EMPLOYEE/DIRECTOR STOCK OPTIONS

The Company maintains the amended and restated 1992 long-term incentive plan
(the "1992 Plan"), the 1998 non-employee directors stock option plan (the "1998
Plan") and the 1999 long-term incentive plan (the "1999 Plan").

Under the terms of the 1992 Plan, 800,000 of the Company's common shares may be
granted as stock options or awarded as restricted stock to officers, directors
and certain employees of the Company through September 2002. Under the terms of
the 1999 plan, 300,000 of the Company's common shares may be granted as stock
options or awarded as restricted stock to officers, directors and certain
employees of the Company through July 2009. Under both plans, option exercise
prices equal the fair market value of the common shares at their grant dates.
For grants made prior to May 1999, options expire not later than five years
after the date of the grant. Options granted beginning in May 1999 expire not
later than 10 years after the date of the grant; options granted to officers and
employees, awarded as part of a three-year bonus plan, expire not later than 5
years after the date of the grant. Options granted to directors and to officers
and employees with the annual yearly cash bonus vest ratably over three years
beginning one year after the date of the grant; options granted to officers and
employees awarded as part of a three-year long term bonus plan vest at the end
of the three-year plan period. Restricted stock is payable in equivalent number
of common shares. The shares are distributable in a single installment and, with
respect to officers and employees, restrictions lapse ratably over a three year
period from the date of the award, and with respect to directors, the
restrictions lapse after one year.

Under the terms of the 1998 Plan, non-employee directors are entitled to receive
matching options for each share of the Company's common stock which they hold at
the end of a 60-day period following initial election as a director, but not to
exceed 25,000 shares with the strike price of the option being the fair market
value of the shares at their grant dates, and thereafter, for each share of the
Company's common stock that they purchase on the open market, with the strike
price of the option being the purchase price of the share, up to a maximum of
5,000 options in any twelve month period or 15,000 options over a three year
period. Options granted under the 1998 Plan vest on the first anniversary of the
grant, provided that, exclusive of the options granted to match shares held at
the end of the 60-day period, the optionee may not acquire by exercise of the
options more than 5,000 shares in any one year. Options expire not later than
five years after the date of the grant.

The Company continues to apply the accounting standards set forth in APB No. 25.
However, disclosures are required of pro forma net income and earnings per share
as if the Company had adopted the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123. Based
on Black-Scholes values, pro forma net income for 2000, 1999 and 1998 would be
$6.1 million, $14.0 million and $11.0 million, respectively; pro forma earnings
per common share for 2000, 1999 and 1998 would be $1.00, $2.24 and $1.93,
respectively.

The following table summarizes stock option activity over the past three years
under the plan:

9. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS - The Company periodically enters into interest
rate swap agreements to effectively convert all or a portion of its
floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt in order to reduce the Company's risk to
movements in interest rates. Such agreements involve the exchange of fixed and
floating interest rate payments over the life of the agreement without the
exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Accordingly, the impact of
fluctuations in interest rates on these interest rate swap agreements is fully
offset by the opposite impact on the related debt. Swap agreements are only
entered into with strong creditworthy counterparties. The swap agreements in
effect were as follows:

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS - The Company enters into forward foreign
currency agreements to hedge foreign currency financing transactions. Realized
and unrealized gains and losses arising from forward currency contracts are
recognized as adjustments to the gains and losses resulting from the underlying
hedged transactions.

The Company enters into off-balance-sheet forward foreign exchange instruments
in order to hedge certain intercompany financing denominated in foreign
currencies, accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies, a percentage
of projected sales denominated in foreign currencies, and projected foreign
currency intercompany purchases. Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange
instruments that hedge specific third party transactions are included in the
cost of carrying value of the underlying transaction. Gains and losses on
instruments that are hedges of projected third party transactions are included
in current period income. The Company recognized $0.5 million of unrealized
gains on forward exchange contracts in 2000.

The table below summarizes, by currency, the contractual amounts of the
Company's foreign exchange contracts at March 31, 2000 and 1999. The "Buy"
amounts represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign
currencies, and the "Sell" amounts represent the U.S. dollar equivalent to sell
foreign currencies (in thousands):

10. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM

In fiscal 2000, the Company refinanced its credit facilities. Due to the
termination of the prior credit agreement, the Company recognized an
extraordinary charge of $0.5 million, net of tax, to write-off the unamortized
portion of the loan origination costs associated with the prior agreement. (See
Note 6).

In fiscal 1999, the Company recognized an extraordinary charge of $0.8 million,
net of tax, to write-off the remaining deferred loan fees associated with the
early extinguishment of the Company's indebtedness pursuant to its revised and
amended revolving credit facility.



11. COMMITMENTS

Rent expense under operating leases for the years ended March 31, 2000, 1999,

12. CONTINGENCIES

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS -During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company
presented an environmental cleanup plan for a portion of a site in Pennsylvania
which continues to be owned although the related business has been sold. This
plan was submitted pursuant to the Consent Order with the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection ("PaDEP") concluded in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 1999. Pursuant to the Consent Order, the Company has paid $0.2 million
for past costs, future oversight expenses and in full settlement of claims made
by PaDEP related to the environmental remediation of the site with an additional
$0.2 million to be paid in fiscal 2001, which amount has been provided for by
the Company in its accrual for environmental liabilities. A second Consent Order
is contemplated by December 1, 2000 for another portion of the site, and a third
Consent Order for the remainder of the site is contemplated by October 1, 2002.
The Company is also administering an agreed settlement with the Federal
government under which the government pays 50% of the environmental response
costs associated with a portion of the site. The Company is also in the process
of finalizing the documentation of an agreed settlement under which the Federal
government will pay 45% of the environmental response costs associated with
another portion of the site. At March 31, 2000, the Company's cleanup reserve
was $1.6 million based on the net present value of future expected cleanup
costs. In fiscal 1999, the Company settled for a recovery of a portion of
cleanup costs with its insurance carriers for approximately $5.1 million (net)
which is included in Other income-net. The Company expects that remediation at
the Pennsylvania site will not be completed for several years.

The Company also continues to participate in environmental assessments and
remediation work at ten other locations, which include operating facilities,
facilities for sale, and previously owned facilities. The Company estimates that
its potential cost for implementing corrective action at these sites will not
exceed $0.2 million payable over the next several years, and has provided for
the estimated costs in its accrual for environmental liabilities.

In addition, the Company has been named as a potentially responsible party in
seven environmental proceedings pending in several other states in which it is
alleged that the Company was a generator of waste that was sent to landfills and
other treatment facilities and, as to several sites, it is alleged that the
Company was an owner or operator. Such properties generally relate to businesses
which have been sold or discontinued. It is not possible to reliably estimate
the costs associated with any remedial work to be performed until studies at
these sites have been completed, the scope of work defined, a method of
remediation selected and approved by the relevant state authorities, and the
costs allocated among the potentially responsible parties.

LITIGATION - The Company is also engaged in various other legal proceedings
incidental to its business. It is the opinion of management that, after taking
into consideration information furnished by its counsel, the above matters will
have no material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or the
results of the Company's operations in future periods.



13. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

The Company has two business segments. Each segment has separate management
teams that report operating results regularly which are reviewed by the chief
operating decision makers of the Company. Certain businesses have been
aggregated into the same reportable segment because they have similar products
and services, production processes, types of customers and distribution methods
and their long-term financial performance is affected by similar economic
conditions.

The Company develops, manufactures and sells a wide range of products in two
industry segments, Specialty Fastener Products and Aerospace Products. The
Company has manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Canada,
Germany, the United Kingdom and Brazil. The Specialty Fastener Products Segment
produces highly engineered precision metal retaining rings, gear driven band
fasteners, circlips, custom cold-formed parts, head light adjusters, rivets and
other threaded and non-threaded assembly fasteners primarily for the automotive,
heavy truck, industrial, aerospace and consumer/durables markets and accounted
for approximately 80% of the Company's consolidated 2000 net sales. Through its
Aerospace Products Segment, the Company develops, manufactures, sells and
services a complete line of sophisticated lifting and restraining products,
principally performance critical helicopter rescue hoist and cargo hook systems,
winches and hoists for aircraft and weapons systems and aircraft engine
compartment hold open rods, actuators and other motion control devices. This
segment accounted for approximately 20% of the Company's consolidated 2000 net
sales.




                                                           2000 ANNUAL REPORT 25
<PAGE>   28
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates performance
based on operating profit of the respective segments. Operating profit is net
sales less operating expenses. General corporate expenses, interest and income
taxes have not been deducted in determining operating profit. Assets,
depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures are those identifiable to
a particular segment by their use. Approximately 8%, 10% and 11% of sales from
continuing operations in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, were derived from
sales to the United States Government and its prime contractors which are
attributable primarily to Aerospace Products.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company's fiscal year ends on March 31. Accordingly, all references to years
in this Management's Discussion and Analysis refer to the fiscal year ended
March 31 of the indicated year. Also, when referred to herein, operating profit
means net sales less operating expenses, without deduction for general corporate
expenses, interest and income taxes.

Sales in 2000 were $299.3 million, an increase of $71.2 million, or 31% from
1999, compared with a $24.1 million, or a 12% increase, from 1998 to 1999. Gross
profit in 2000 increased $16.4 million, or 23%, from 1999, compared with an
increase of $5.8 million, or 9%, from 1998 to 1999. Operating profit for 2000
was $40.0 million, an increase of $1.6 million or 4%, from 1999, compared with
an increase of $2.9 million or 8%, from 1998 to 1999. Operating profit in 2000
was adversely affected by plant consolidation expenses of $5.5 million as
described below in the discussion of acquisitions. In 1999, income before income
taxes and extraordinary charge was favorably affected by a $5.1 million gain
from the settlement of litigation relative to claims against its insurance
carriers for environmental matters and a $1.1 million gain from the sale of
marketable securities. Changes in sales, operating profit and new orders are
discussed below by segment, and additional information regarding industry
segments is contained in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Net income, including an extraordinary charge in 2000, was $6.6 million, or
$1.07 per diluted share, compared to $13.8, million or $2.18 per diluted share,
in 1999. Changes in net income were affected both by operating profit, as
discussed in the Business Segment sections below, interest expense, plant
consolidation expense and an extraordinary charge as discussed in the sections
below.

During the first half of 2000 the Company completed two acquisitions. On August
31, 1999, the Company acquired all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities
of the Engineered Fasteners Division of Eaton Corporation and its Tinnerman
product line (collectively referred to as "Tinnerman") for a total purchase
price of $173.3 million in cash. On July 19, 1999, the Company acquired all the
outstanding capital stock of Ellison Holdings PLC, a privately held company, and
its German affiliate Ellison, Roettges & Co. GmbH (collectively referred to as
"Ellison") for $13.8 million in cash, a $0.4 million note payable, and other
contingent consideration.

As part of the Ellison acquisition plan, the Company recorded a plant
consolidation provision of $4.5 million to cover the estimated plant closure of
the Company's existing facility and consolidation costs. The initial estimate of
$4.5 million was recorded during the first half of 2000. During the fourth
quarter of 2000 additional expenses of $0.1 million were added to the provision.
In addition, approximately $1.0 million of additional costs relating to the
plant consolidation was charged to cost of sales in the fourth quarter.

During the first quarter of 2000 the Company recorded an extraordinary charge
for the early extinguishment of debt in the amount of $0.5 million after tax.
The early extinguishment of existing debt was necessary in order to obtain new
credit facilities which provided funding for the Tinnerman and Ellison
acquisitions.

Interest expense increased by $13.0 million in 2000 from 1999 due to the
additional bank borrowings required for the Tinnerman and Ellison acquisitions
as well as higher interest rates. Interest expense decreased by $0.3 million in
1999 from 1998 primarily due to lower borrowing rates.

New orders received during 2000 totaled $305.2 million, an increase of $84.3
million, or 38%, from 1999. This increase was due mainly to the acquisitions of
Tinnerman and Ellison during 2000. New orders received during 1999 totaled
$220.9 million, an increase of $14.0 million, or 7%, from 1998. At March 31,
2000, total backlog of unfilled orders was $109.6 million, compared to $89.7
million and $75.9 million at March 3l, 1999 and 1998, respectively. New orders
and backlog by industry segment are discussed below.



SPECIALTY FASTENER PRODUCTS SEGMENT

2000 COMPARED WITH 1999

Sales for the Specialty Fastener Products segment were $238.4 million in 2000,
an increase of $60.6 million, or 34%, from 1999. The increase in sales was
primarily




28 TransTechnology Corporation
<PAGE>   31
due to the acquisition of Ellison on July 19, 1999 and Tinnerman on August 31,
1999. Increases in domestic hose clamps and assembly fasteners and cold-headed
parts sales were offset by decreases in European hose clamps and both domestic
and international retaining rings. Sales of the rivet division continued to
decline due to loss of business from its largest customer and the down cycle of
the airframe industry. The Company has filed an arbitration demand against this
customer and the former owner seeking damages for fraud and breach of contract,
punitive damages and rescission.

Operating profit for the Specialty Fastener Products segment was $24.6 million
in 2000, a decrease of $1.7 million, or 6%, compared to 1999. Excluding $5.5
million of expenses relating to the consolidation of two retaining ring
factories in England as part of the Ellison acquisition program, operating
profit increased 15%. This increase was primarily driven by the Tinnerman
acquisition. Operating profits at the European operation were lower due to
reduced market and economic factors, as well as currency factors, especially the
exchange rates between the Pound sterling and the Euro. Domestic retaining ring
operating profit was lower due to lower sales volume. Operating profit in
assembly fasteners increased in 2000 mainly due to increased sales volume,
primarily in the U.S. automotive market.

New orders during 2000 for the Specialty Fastener Products segment were $243.4
million, an increase of $71.9 million, or 42%, mainly due to the Tinnerman and
Ellison acquisitions. Backlog of unfilled orders as of March 31, 2000 increased
to $65.4 million, compared to $45.9 million at March 31, 1999, mainly due to
acquisitions.



SPECIALTY FASTENER PRODUCTS SEGMENT

1999 COMPARED WITH 1998

Sales for the Specialty Fastener Products segment were $177.8 million in 1999,
an increase of $9.4 million, or 6%, from 1998. The increase in sales was
primarily due to the acquisition of ARM on June 29, 1998. Domestic Fastener
sales were otherwise lower or flat as compared to 1998 sales. Sales of the
European hose clamp division were lower reflecting mainly the loss of one major
customer, which had been anticipated. Sales from the Brazilian retaining ring
operation were also reduced compared to 1998 due to the currency devaluation as
well as economic difficulties experienced in Brazil during 1999. Domestic
retaining ring sales were also lower compared to 1998 due to a loss in market
share suffered during the consolidation of two plants in New Jersey.

Operating profit for the Specialty Fastener Products segment was $26.3 million
in 1999, an increase of $0.1 million compared to 1998. Increased operating
profit generated by the ARM acquisition was essentially offset by the lower
sales and resulting lower operating profit as discussed above from the domestic
and Brazilian retaining ring divisions as well as the European hose clamp
division. Lower operating profit also was experienced at the domestic hose clamp
division due to increased price competition and a change in product mix
resulting in lower absorption of overhead.

In 1999, new orders in the Specialty Fastener Products segment were $171.5
million, virtually the same as 1998. Increased orders stemming from the ARM
acquisition were offset as were sales for the period due to the reasons
discussed above. Backlog of unfilled orders was $45.9 million at March 31, 1999,
compared to $43.5 million at March 31, 1998.



AEROSPACE PRODUCTS SEGMENT

2000 COMPARED WITH 1999

Sales for the Aerospace Products segment were $60.8 million in 2000, an increase
of $10.7 million, or 21%, from 1999. Approximately 9% of the increase came from
increased rescue hoist and engineering development programs and 12% due to the
inclusion of twelve months of sales from NORCO this year compared to eight
months in 1999.

Operating profit for the Aerospace Products segment was $15.4 million, an
increase of $3.3 million, or 27%. This increase was due to the inclusion of
NORCO for the full year, as well as increased sales of rescue hoists.

New orders during 2000 for the Aerospace Products segment were $61.8 million, an
increase of $12.4 million, or 25%, mainly due to NORCO. Increased orders also
included increased engineering program orders and increased orders for spare
parts. Backlog of unfilled orders as of March 31, 2000 was $44.2 million,
compared to $43.8 million at March 31, 1999.



AEROSPACE PRODUCTS SEGMENT

1999 COMPARED WITH 1998

Sales for the Aerospace Products segment were $50.2 million in 1999, an increase
of $14.7 million or 41%




                                                           2000 ANNUAL REPORT 29
<PAGE>   32
from 1998. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of NORCO on July
28, 1998. Sales of rescue hoist and cargo hook products were also higher for
1999 due mainly to the timing of program sales such as the Boeing V-22 program,
which were developed in prior years from continuing research and development
efforts.

The Aerospace Products segment reported an operating profit of $12.1 million in
1999, an increase of $2.8 million, or 30%, from 1998. The increase was primarily
due to the increased sales and operating profit generated by the NORCO
acquisition.

In 1999 new orders in the Aerospace Products segment increased by $14.0 million,
or 40%, from 1998. This increase was primarily due to the NORCO acquisition. New
orders for rescue hoists and cargo hooks also increased slightly. At March 31,
1999, the backlog of unfilled orders was $43.8 million, compared to $32.4
million at March 31, 1998.



YEAR 2000 READINESS

The Company undertook Year 2000 readiness programs at all of its facilities so
that the date change from the calendar year 1999 to 2000 did not cause
disruptions to the Company's operations or date sensitive systems. The Company
had been addressing this concern for several years and did not anticipate any
problems at any of its business units and did not expect any significant vendor
or customer related problems based on survey information gathered. Total costs
for Year 2000 programs were approximately $0.5 million of which $0.1 million was
capitalized. No further costs for Year 2000 programs are expected.



EURO CURRENCY

Effective January 1, 1999, eleven countries comprising the European Union
established fixed foreign currency exchange rates and adopted a common currency
unit designated as the "Euro". The Euro has since become publicly traded and is
currently used in commerce during the present transition period which is
scheduled to end January 1, 2002, at which time a Euro denominated currency is
scheduled to be issued and is intended to replace those currencies of the eleven
member countries. The transition to the Euro has not resulted in problems for
the Company to date, and is not expected to have any material adverse impact on
the Company's future operations.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In June 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, was issued and, as
amended by SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS Statement No. 133 in June
1999, is effective for the Company for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2002.
SFAS No. 133 requires that all derivative instruments be measured at fair value
and recognized in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact this pronouncement will have on its
consolidated financial statements.



ACQUISITIONS

On August 31, 1999, the Company acquired all of the assets and assumed certain
liabilities, consisting primarily of trade debts and accrued expenses, of the
Engineered Fasteners Division of Eaton Corporation and its Tinnerman product
line (collectively referred to as "Tinnerman") for a total purchase price of
$173.3 million in cash. Tinnerman had 650 employees and manufactures a wide
variety of fastening devices for the automotive, business equipment, consumer
electronics and home appliance markets. Tinnerman has manufacturing facilities
in Brunswick and Massillon, Ohio and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

On July 19, 1999, the Company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of
Ellison Holdings PLC, a privately held company, and its German affiliate
Ellison, Roettges & Co. GmbH (collectively referred to as "Ellison") for $13.8
million in cash, a $0.4 million note payable 24 months from the date of
acquisition and other contingent consideration. Ellison, headquartered in
Glusburn, West Yorkshire, England, manufactures retaining and snap rings as well
as lockwashers for the automotive, heavy vehicle and industrial markets. The
allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities of Ellison is
preliminary pending final purchase price adjustments, if any, between the
Company and the selling shareholders. As part of the acquisition plan, the
Company closed its existing facility in Bingley, UK and consolidated that
operation with the Ellison facility. In the quarter ended September 26, 1999,
the Company recorded a $4.5 million charge for the consolidation. In the quarter
ended March 31, 2000, the Company recorded an additional $0.1 million related to
this plant consol-




30 TRANSTECHNOLOGY CORPORATION
<PAGE>   33
idation. The total charge consists of $3.8 million principally related to the
write-down of Anderton's assets to estimated realizable values and other costs
directly related to the exit of the facility, and approximately $0.8 million for
severance and related benefit payments to approximately 100 Anderton employees.
At March 31, 2000, the Company had $0.3 million remaining in current liabilities
related to these costs.

In addition, in the quarter ended March 31, 2000, $1.0 million was charged to
cost of sales primarily due to excess overtime incurred to produce parts pending
customer approval on first part production lots.

On June 29, 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Aerospace
Rivet Manufacturers Corporation ("ARM") for $26.2 million in cash, including
direct acquisition costs, and other contingent consideration. ARM, located in
City of Industry, California, produces rivets and externally threaded fasteners
for the aerospace industry.

On July 28, 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of NORCO,
Inc. ("NORCO") for $17.7 million in cash, including direct acquisition costs,
and other contingent consideration. NORCO, located in Ridgefield, Connecticut,
produces aircraft engine compartment hold open rods, actuators and other motion
control devices for the aerospace industry.

On April 17, 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of TCR
Corporation ("TCR") for $32.6 million in cash including direct acquisition
costs, and other contingent consideration. TCR, located in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, produces cold forged and other externally threaded fasteners and
related products for the automotive, heavy vehicle, marine and industrial
markets.



DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

During fiscal 1998 the Company recorded after tax costs of $0.9 million for the
disposal of previously discontinued and sold operations. These costs represent
adjustments to previous estimates related primarily to legal and environmental
matters.

Included in Other Assets at March 31, 2000 and 1999, were assets held for sale
related to discontinued operations of $5.2 million in both years.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 68%, 45%, and 35% as of March 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The higher debt ratios for 2000 and 1999
reflect the additional bank borrowings necessary for the Tinnerman and Ellison
acquisitions in 2000, and the ARM and NORCO acquisitions in 1999. The current
ratio at March 31, 2000, was 1.01, compared to 3.39, and 2.06 at March 31, 1999
and 1998, respectively. Working capital was $1.8 million at March 31, 2000, down
$69.3 million from 1999 and down $49.2 million from 1998. The reduction in
working capital in 2000 was caused primarily by the Bridge Loan payable of $75.0
million, all of which is classified as a current liability, reflecting its
initial maturity date of August 31, 2000.

Effective August 31, 1999, the Company's revolving credit facility (the
"Revolver") was amended and increased from $145.0 million to $200.0 million, and
additional term debt (the "Term Loan") of $50.0 million and senior subordinated
debt (the "Bridge Loan") of $75.0 million were obtained in order to provide the
necessary funds for the Tinnerman acquisition. Credit was provided by the same
group of lending banks plus several new lending banks. The Revolver and Term
Loan have a maturity of five years. The Bridge Loan has an initial maturity of
one year, after which time the Bridge Loan automatically converts to a term loan
subject to, among other things, an early payment premium and the issuance of
stock warrants. The stock warrants would provide for the lenders to obtain up to
ten percent of the shares of the Company's stock after August 31, 2000. The
Company intends to replace the Bridge Loan before August 31, 2000 with
alternative long term subordinated debt under terms more favorable to the
Company. The Bridge Loan contains a provision for exit fees of approximately
$2.1 million which may be applied to certain refinancing fees.

An extraordinary charge for the refinancing of debt, net of tax, in the amount
of $0.5 million was incurred for the year ended March 31, 2000, to reflect the
write-off of the unamortized debt issue costs of the prior credit agreement.

The Company's credit agreements provide it with unused borrowing capacity for
both domestic and international operations of $45.3 million as of March 31,
2000, and letters of credit of up to $4.9 million. The

                                                           2000 ANNUAL REPORT 31
<PAGE>   34
Revolver, Bridge Loan and Term Loan are secured by all of the Company's assets.
As of March 31, 2000, the Company had total borrowings of $275.9 million under
the amended agreements which have a weighted average interest rate of 10.4%. The
Company had $1.4 million of other borrowings consisting of collateralized
borrowing arrangements with fixed interest rates of 3% and 3.75%, and loans on
life insurance policies owned by the Company with a fixed interest rate of 5%.

Borrowings under the Revolver as of March 31, 2000, were $154.7 million.
Interest on the Revolver is tied to the primary bank's prime rate, or at the
Company's option, the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), plus a margin
that varies depending upon the Company's achievement of certain operating
results. As of March 31, 2000, $152.5 million of the Company's outstanding
borrowings utilized LIBOR, of which $127.0 million were payable in U.S. Dollars
and $7.1 million and $18.4 million were payable in Deutsche marks and Pounds
sterling, respectively.

Borrowings under the Term Loan as of March 31, 2000, were $46.3 million of which
$7.5 million is due within one year, $8.8 million is due in year two, $10.0
million is due in year three, $12.5 million is due in year four, and $7.5
million is due upon maturity in year five.

Borrowings under the Bridge Loan as of March 31, 2000, were $75.0 million, all
of which is considered to be short term. Interest on the Bridge Loan is based on
LIBOR plus a margin which is currently 9.5% and increases in quarterly
increments subject to an overall maximum interest rate of 18%. The Bridge Loan
matures on August 31, 2000, after which time, unless replaced, it converts
automatically to senior subordinated term debt with additional provisions. The
major additional provisions of the resulting term debt provide for a warrant
escrow agreement that stipulates that the Company shall issue stock warrants to
the debt holders for 731,197 shares of the Company's stock exercisable at par
value (or $.01) per share, representing ten percent of the common equity of the
Company on a fully diluted basis after giving effect to the warrants. Other
provisions of the resulting term debt include various repayment premiums during
the first seven years of the term, an overall maximum interest rate of 18% and
the right of the holders of the Bridge Loan to require the Company to exchange
this debt for a class of debt securities which the Company would be required to
register for public distribution. The Company intends to replace the Bridge Loan
prior to its maturity and, therefore, does not expect to be subject to the
provisions of the term debt which would become effective after the Bridge Loan
maturity date on August 31, 2000.

The credit agreements require the Company to maintain interest rate protection
on a minimum of $125.0 million of its variable rate debt. The Company has
accordingly provided for this protection by means of interest rate swap
agreements which have fixed the rate of interest on $50.0 million of debt at a
base rate of 5.48% through May 4, 2002, and $75.0 million of debt at a base rate
of 6.58% through March 3, 2003. Under the agreement, the base interest rate is
added to the applicable interest rate margin to determine the total interest
rate in effect. The credit agreement also limits the Company's ability to pay
dividends to 25% of net income and restricts annual capital expenditures to
$12.0 million through 2001, $13.0 million in 2002, and $15.0 million thereafter,
and contains other customary financial covenants.

The Company did not purchase any treasury stock in 2000 in contrast to 1999
during which the Company purchased 249,000 shares for $4.9 million. Treasury
stock purchases are made in the open market or in negotiated transactions when
opportunities are deemed to arise. Purchases of treasury stock are limited by
the terms of the Company's credit agreement.

Management believes that the Company's anticipated cash flow from operations,
combined with the bank credit agreement described above, will be sufficient to
support working capital requirements, capital expenditures and dividend payments
at their current or expected levels. Capital expenditures in 2000 were $10.0
million compared with $14.8 million in 1999 and $8.7 million in 1998, with
capital expenditures for the Fastener Segment being much larger than those
required by the Aerospace Products Segment. The Company expects capital
expenditures in 2001 to be below the 2000 level.



MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss
arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company enters into
off-balance-sheet forward foreign exchange instruments in order to hedge certain
intercompany financing denominated in foreign currencies, accounts receivable
denominated in foreign currencies, a percentage of projected sales denominated




32 TRANSTECHNOLOGY CORPORATION
<PAGE>   35
in foreign currencies, and projected foreign currency intercompany purchases.
Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange instruments that hedge specific
third party transactions are included in the cost of carrying value of the
underlying transaction. Gains and losses on instruments that are hedges of
projected third party transactions are included in current period income.

The Company recognized $0.5 million of unrealized gains on forward exchange
contracts in 2000.

At March 31, 2000, the Company had outstanding forward foreign exchange
contracts to purchase and sell $29.8 million of various currencies (principally
Deutsche marks and Pounds sterling). At March 31, 2000, if all forward contracts
were closed out, the Company would receive approximately $1.5 million (the fair
value of all outstanding contracts). A 10% fluctuation in the exchange rates for
the currencies hedged would have an immaterial effect on fair values of these
instruments.

The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of its
exposure to interest rate changes. The swaps involve the exchange of fixed and
variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal
amount. Payments or receipts on the swap agreements are recorded as adjustments
to interest expense. At March 31, 2000 the Company had outstanding interest rate
swap agreements to convert $125 million of floating rate debt to fixed rate
debt. The fair value of these swaps was approximately $2.4 million at March 31,
2000.



CONTINGENCIES

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS - During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 the Company
presented an environmental cleanup plan for a portion of a site in Pennsylvania
which continues to be owned although the related business has been sold. This
plan was submitted pursuant to the Consent Order and Agreement with the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection ("PaDEP") concluded in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1999. Pursuant to the Consent Order, the Company has
paid $0.2 million for past costs, future oversight expenses and in full
settlement of claims made by PaDEP related to the environmental remediation of
the site with an additional $0.2 million to be paid in fiscal 2001, which amount
has been provided for by the Company in its accrual for environmental
liabilities. A second Consent Order is contemplated by December 1, 2000 for
another portion of the site, and a third Consent Order for the remainder of the
site is contemplated by October 1, 2002. The Company is also administering an
agreed settlement with the Federal government under which the government pays
50% of the environmental response costs associated with a portion of the site.
The Company is also in the process of finalizing the documentation of an agreed
settlement under which the Federal government will pay 45% of the environmental
response costs associated with another portion of the site. At March 31, 2000,
the Company's cleanup reserve was $1.6 million based on the net present value of
future expected cleanup costs. In 1999, the Company settled for a recovery of a
portion of cleanup costs with its insurance carriers for approximately $5.1
million (net) which is included in Other income-net. The Company expects that
remediation at the Pennsylvania site will not be completed for several years.

The Company also continues to participate in environmental assessments and
remediation work at ten other locations, which include operating facilities,
facilities for sale, and previously owned facilities. The Company estimates that
its potential cost for implementing corrective action at these sites will not
exceed $0.2 million payable over the next several years, and has provided for
the estimated costs in its accrual for environmental liabilities.

In addition, the Company has been named as a potentially responsible party in
seven environmental proceedings pending in several other states in which it is
alleged that the Company was a generator of waste that was sent to landfills and
other treatment facilities and, as to several sites, it is alleged that the
Company was an owner or operator. Such properties generally relate to businesses
which have been sold or discontinued. It is not possible to estimate reliably
the costs associated with any remedial work to be performed until studies at
these sites have been completed, the scope of work defined, a method of
remediation selected and approved by the relevant state authorities, and the
costs allocated among the potentially responsible parties.

LITIGATION - The Company is also engaged in various other legal proceedings
incidental to its business. It is the opinion of management that, after taking
into consideration information furnished by its counsel, the above matters will
have no material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or the
results of the Company's operations in future periods.
