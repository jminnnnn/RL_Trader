ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL

         TransTechnology Corporation designs, develops, manufactures and sells
sophisticated lifting equipment for specialty aerospace and defense
applications. TransTechnology Corporation was originally organized in 1962 as a
California corporation and reincorporated in Delaware in 1986. Unless the
context otherwise requires, references to the "Company" or the "Registrant"
refer to TransTechnology Corporation (including the California corporation prior
to the reincorporation) and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company's fiscal
year ends on March 31. Accordingly, all references to years in this report refer
to the fiscal year ended March 31 of the indicated year.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND RESTRUCTURING

         On January 19, 2001, the Company announced its intention to restructure
and divest its cold-headed products (TCR), retaining ring (Seeger-Orbis,
TransTechnology (GB), TT Brasil, and TransTechnology Engineered Rings USA), hose
clamp (Breeze Industrial and Pebra) and aerospace rivet (Aerospace Rivet
Manufacturers Corp.) operations. In addition, on April 12, 2001, the Company
announced that it would divest TransTechnology Engineered Components (TTEC), a
manufacturer of spring steel engineered fasteners and headlight adjusters. For
business segment reporting purposes, these above-mentioned business units have
previously been classified as the "Specialty Fasteners Segment." The Company has
reclassified these business units as discontinued operations.

         On July 10, 2001, the Company sold its Breeze Industrial and Pebra hose
clamp businesses to Industrial Growth Partners and members of Breeze
Industrial's management for $46.2 million, which was paid in cash. In a related
transaction, the Company sold the real estate occupied by Breeze Industrial to a
quasi-governmental organization for $2.0 million which the Company may, under
certain circumstances, be required to repurchase for $1 million in fiscal 2006.
Proceeds from the sales were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the
Company's then current Credit Facility (the Fleet Credit Facility).

         On December 5, 2001, the Company sold its TransTechnology Engineered
Components ("TTEC") businesses to a company formed by affiliates of Kohlberg &
Company, L.L.C. for $98.5 million, of which $96.0 million was cash and the
balance the assumption of certain liabilities related to the purchased
businesses. The cash proceeds of the sale were used to repay borrowings
outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility. In the fiscal quarter ended
September 30, 2001, as part of its restructuring program, the Company reported a
pre-tax asset impairment charge for TTEC in the amount of $85.8 million to
reduce the carrying value of these businesses to estimated fair market value.
This noncash charge was specifically related to the write-down of goodwill. The
sale proceeds of TTEC approximated its adjusted carrying value.

On February 21, 2002, the Company sold its Seeger-Orbis retaining ring business
in Germany to Barnes Group Inc. for $20.0 million cash. The net proceeds of the
sale were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility.
The balance sheet of the Company contains a noncurrent asset and a non-current
liability in the amount of $3.7 million relating to the pension plan of
Seeger-Orbis. These amounts represent the legal liability of the Company under
German law and the indemnification received from the buyer of the business for
that liability.




                                       3
<PAGE>
         On April 16, 2002, the Company sold its Aerospace Rivet Manufacturers
Corporation subsidiary to Allfast Fastening Systems, Inc. for $3.2 million cash.
The net proceeds of the sale were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the
Fleet Credit Facility.

         On May 30, 2002, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of
the net assets of its U.S. retaining ring business to SeaView Capital LLC for
$2.9 million of cash, a promissory note of $0.8 million and warrants for 5% of
the equity of the purchaser. The net proceeds of the sale were used to repay
borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility.

         On January 3, 2003, the Company completed the sale of TCR Corporation
for cash consideration of $10.0 million, plus the assumption of certain
liabilities, to an affiliate of MidMark Capital LLC. The net proceeds of the
sale were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the Company's new $34.0
million senior credit facility which was established in August 2002 to refinance
all remaining obligations under the Fleet Credit Facility (the "New Senior
Credit Facility").

         On February 24, 2003, the Company sold Norco Inc. for $51.0 million
cash and a $1.0 million reimbursement for certain income taxes payable as a
result of the transaction to a wholly-owned subsidiary of TransDigm Inc. The net
cash proceeds were used to retire senior debt under the New Senior Credit
Facility and partially repay subordinated debt.

         In fiscal 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized charges of $2.7 million
and $1.6 million, respectively, for severance and other costs related to the
corporate office restructuring. In fiscal 2001, the charge of $11.2 million
included costs associated with the corporate office restructuring as well as
write offs of notes receivable and worthless investments in companies that had
been divested in prior fiscal years.

CORE BUSINESS

         As a result of the above referenced restructuring program,
TransTechnology Corporation's core business is aerospace and defense products.

         The company conducts its business through its Breeze-Eastern division.
Breeze-Eastern is the world's largest designer and leading supplier of
performance-critical rescue hoists and cargo-hook systems. Breeze-Eastern also
manufacturers weapons-handling systems, cargo winches, tie-down equipment and
tow-hook assemblies. These products are sold primarily to military and civilian
agencies and aerospace contractors.

PRODUCTS

         The Company's products are designed, developed and manufactured by
Breeze-Eastern. Breeze-Eastern specializes in the design, development and
manufacture of sophisticated lifting and restraining products, principally
helicopter rescue hoists, reeling machines and external hook systems. In
addition, Breeze-Eastern designs, develops and manufactures winches and hoists
for aircraft cargo and weapon-handling systems with applications ranging from
cargo handling on fixed-wing aircraft to hoisting weapons





                                       4

<PAGE>
into position on carrier based aircraft. Management believes that Breeze-Eastern
is the industry market share leader in sales of personnel-rescue hoists and
cargo hook equipment. As a pioneer of helicopter hoist technology,
Breeze-Eastern continues to develop sophisticated helicopter hoist systems,
including systems for the current generation of Seahawk, Chinook, Dolphin,
Merlin and Super Stallion helicopters. Breeze-Eastern also supplies equipment
for the United States, Japanese and European Multiple-Launch Rocket Systems,
which use two specialized hoists to load and unload rocket pod containers.
Breeze-Eastern's external cargo-lift hook systems are original equipment on most
helicopters manufactured today. These hook systems range from small 1,000-pound
capacity models up to the largest 36,000-pound capacity hooks employed on the
Super Stallion helicopter. Breeze-Eastern also manufactures aircraft and cargo
tie-downs.

         Breeze-Eastern sells its products through internal marketing
representatives and several independent sales representatives and distributors.

         The Aerospace Product backlog varies substantially from time to time
due to the size and timing of orders. At March 31, 2003, the backlog of unfilled
orders was $46.2 million, compared to $33.8 million at March 31, 2002. The
majority of the March 31, 2003 backlog is expected to be shipped during fiscal
2004.

DEFENSE INDUSTRY SALES

         Approximately 55% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2003, as
compared to 47% and 45% in 2002 and 2001, respectively, were derived from sales
to the United States Government, principally the military services of the
Department of Defense and its prime contractors. These contracts typically
contain precise performance specifications and are subject to customary
provisions which give the United States Government the contractual right of
termination for convenience. In the event of termination for convenience,
however, the Company is typically protected by provisions allowing reimbursement
for costs incurred as well as payment of any applicable fees or profits.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         Due primarily to Federal and State legislation which imposes liability,
regardless of fault, upon commercial product manufacturers for environmental
harm caused by chemicals, processes and practices that were commonly and
lawfully used prior to the enactment of such legislation, the Company may be
liable for all or a portion of the environmental clean-up costs at sites
previously owned or leased by the Company (or corporations acquired by the
Company). The Company's contingencies associated with environmental matters are
described in Note 11 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included
elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

COMPETITION

         The Company's businesses compete in some markets with entities that are
larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than the
Company. Generally, competitive factors include design capabilities, product
performance, delivery and price. The Company's ability to compete successfully
in such markets will depend on its ability to develop and apply technological
innovations and to expand its customer base and product lines. The Company is
successfully doing so both internally and

                                       5
<PAGE>
through acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue
to successfully compete in any or all of the businesses discussed above. The
failure of the Company to compete in more than one of these businesses could
have a materially adverse effect on the Company's profitability.

RAW MATERIALS

         The various components and raw materials used by the Company to produce
its products are generally available from more than one source. In those
instances where only a single source for any material is available, such items
can generally be redesigned to accommodate materials made by other suppliers. In
some cases, the Company stocks an adequate supply of the single source materials
for use until a new supplier can be approved. The Company's business is not
dependent upon a single supplier or a few suppliers, the loss of which would
have a materially adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial
position.

EMPLOYEES

         As of June 1, 2003, the Company employed 194 people. There were 188
persons employed with the aerospace products operations and 6 with the corporate
office.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND SALES

         The company has no foreign-based facilities. The Company had export
sales of $21.9 million, $21.5 million and $19.3 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively, representing 40%, 45% and 40% of the Company's consolidated
net sales in each of those years, respectively. The risk and profitability
attendant to these sales is generally comparable to similar products sold in the
United States. Net export sales by geographic area and domicile of customers are
set forth in Note 12 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" which is
included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

                               and manufacturing plant
</TABLE>

         The Company believes that such facilities are suitable and adequate for
the Company's foreseeable needs and that additional space, if necessary, will be
available. The Company continues to own or lease property that it no longer
needs in its operations. These properties are located in Illinois, Pennsylvania,
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. In some instances, the properties are
leased or subleased and in nearly all instances these properties are for sale or
are under contract for sale.

         The information required has been included in Note 11 of "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of TransTechnology Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TransTechnology
Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related
statements of consolidated operations, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2003. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of TransTechnology Corporation and
subsidiaries at March 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31,
2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

BUSINESS - The fiscal year for TransTechnology Corporation (the "Company") ends
on March 31. Accordingly, all references to years in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements refer to the fiscal year ended March 31 of the indicated
year unless otherwise specified.

As a result of a restructuring program completed by the Company during 2003, the
Company has reclassified all of the business units that made up its Specialty
Fastener segment in prior years and its Aerospace Rivet Manufacturers
Corporation and Norco Inc. businesses, which had been included in its Aerospace
Products segment, as discontinued operations. All references related to ongoing
operations, or the Company, refer only to continuing operations, which consists
of the Breeze-Eastern division.

The Company, which has one manufacturing facility in the United States,
develops, manufactures, sells and services a complete line of sophisticated
lifting and restraining products, principally performance critical helicopter
rescue hoist and cargo hook systems, winches and hoists for aircraft and weapons
systems.

USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue is recognized at the later of 1) when products are
shipped to customers, or 2) when title passes to customers.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with a maturity at date of acquisition of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.

INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes material, labor
and manufacturing overhead costs.

PROPERTY AND RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION - Property is recorded at
cost. Provisions for depreciation are made on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of depreciable assets ranging from three to thirty years.
Depreciation expense for the years ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $0.5
million, $0.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively. During 2002 the Company
sold excess real estate realizing a gain of $1.3 million that is included in
other income.

EARNINGS PER SHARE ("EPS") - The computation of basic earnings per
share is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The
computation of diluted earnings per share assumes the foregoing and, in
addition, the exercise of all dilutive stock options using the treasury stock
method.

The components of the denominator for basic earnings per common share and
diluted earnings per common share are reconciled as follows:

</TABLE>

Options to purchase 311,411 shares of common stock at prices between $8.84 and
$27.88 were outstanding during 2003 but were not included in the computation of
diluted EPS because the options' exercise prices were greater than the average
market price of the common shares. Similarly, during 2002, options to purchase
450,183 shares of common stock at prices between $8.84 and $27.88 were
outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. During
2001, options to purchase 505,971 shares of common stock at prices between $8.84
and $27.88 were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted
EPS.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING COSTS - Research and development costs and
engineering costs, which are charged to expense when incurred, amounted to $2.3
million, $1.7 million and $1.5 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Included in these amounts were expenditures of $1.7 million, $1.2 million and
$1.2 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, which represent costs related
to research and development activities.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The assets and liabilities of the Company's
international operations have been translated into U.S. dollars at year-end
exchange rates, with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated as a
separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Income and expense
items are converted into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing
during the year. Cumulative translation adjustments related to businesses which
have been sold have been reflected in the operating results from discontinued
operations.



                                       14

INCOME TAXES - Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The
Company periodically assesses recoverability of deferred tax assets and
provisions for valuation allowances are made as required.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments
for trading purposes. The estimated liability relating to interest rate swap
agreements was accrued during 2002. These agreements were terminated and settled
in 2003.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -
Transition and Disclosure" ("SFAS 148") which amends SFAS No. 123. This
statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to
the fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation
and amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123. The transition guidance
and disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2002. The adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

Following is a summary of the proforma effect on earnings under SFAS 123 (in
thousands except per share amounts):

</TABLE>

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - In May 2003 FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for
Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity," that improves the accounting for certain financial instruments that,
under previous guidance, issuers could account for as equity. SFAS 150 requires
that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statement of financial
position. This statement is effective for the Company's fiscal quarter beginning
June 30, 2003. Management does not believe adoption of this standard will have a
material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

In April 2003, FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" that amends and clarifies
accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under Statement 133.
With certain exceptions, SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designed after June
30, 2003. Management does not believe adoption of this standard will have a
material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities." This interpretation defines when a business
enterprise must consolidate a variable interest entity. This interpretation
applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31,
2003. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June
15, 2003, to entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it
acquired before February 1, 2003. The adoption of this statement is not expected
to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others." This interpretation requires a guarantor to recognize,
at the inception of the guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the
obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. It also enhances guarantor's
disclosure requirements to be made in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under certain guarantees it has issued. The
initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial
statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. In the
normal course of business, the Company does not issue guarantees to third
parties; accordingly, this interpretation will not have an effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Exit or Disposal
Activities." SFAS 146 requires the recognition of a liability for costs
associated with an exit plan or disposal activity when incurred and nullifies
Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including
Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)," which allowed recognition at the
date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan. The provisions of this statement
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated by the Company
after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this statement is not anticipated to
have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

In April 2002, SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections," was approved by
the FASB. Among other things, this statement requires that gains or losses on
the extinguishment of debt will generally be required to be reported as a
component of income from continuing operations and will no longer be classified
as an



                                       15
<PAGE>
extraordinary item. The Company's financial statements for the periods prior to
March 31, 2001, have been reclassified to include losses previously recorded as
an extraordinary item as a component of income from continuing operations.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations," effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. This
statement addresses the diverse accounting practices for obligations associated
with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs. The adoption of this statement will not have a material effect
on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS - Long-lived assets (excluding financial
instruments and deferred tax assets) and certain identifiable intangibles to be
held and used are reviewed by the Company for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, a
significant decrease in the market value of an asset, a significant change in
the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant physical change
in an asset, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business
climate that could affect the value of an asset, or an adverse action or
assessment by a regulator. If a review for recoverability is necessary, the
Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the
asset. In performing these estimates, the Company groups its assets at the
lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. If the sum of the
expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less
than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized.
Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized. Any impairment loss recognized
is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair
value of the asset.

2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND RESTRUCTURING

On January 19, 2001, the Company announced its intention to restructure and
divest its cold-headed products (TCR), retaining ring (Seeger-Orbis,
TransTechnology (GB), TT Brasil, and TransTechnology Engineered Rings USA), hose
clamp (Breeze Industrial and Pebra) and aerospace rivet (Aerospace Rivet
Manufacturers Corp.) operations. In addition, on April 12, 2001, the Company
announced that it would divest TransTechnology Engineered Components (TTEC), a
manufacturer of spring steel engineered fasteners and headlight adjusters. For
business segment reporting purposes, these above-mentioned business units,
excluding ARM for 2002, have previously been classified as the "Specialty
Fasteners Segment." The Company has reclassified these business units as
discontinued operations for all periods presented.

A portion of the Company's interest expense has been allocated to discontinued
operations based upon the net asset balances attributable to those operations.
Interest expense allocated to discontinued operations was $6.3 million, $20.1
million and $31.6 million, in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Income taxes
have been allocated to discontinued operations based on the estimated tax
attributes of the income and assets of the underlying discontinued businesses.

On July 10, 2001, the Company sold its Breeze Industrial and Pebra hose clamp
businesses to Industrial Growth Partners and members of Breeze Industrial's
management for $46.2 million, which was paid in cash. In a related transaction,
the Company sold the real estate occupied by Breeze Industrial to a
quasi-governmental organization for $2.0 million which the Company may, under
certain circumstances, be required to repurchase for $1 million in fiscal 2006.
Proceeds from the sales were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the
Company's then current Credit Facility (the Fleet Credit Facility).

On December 5, 2001, the Company sold its TransTechnology Engineered Components
("TTEC") businesses to a company formed by affiliates of Kohlberg & Company,
L.L.C. for $98.5 million, of which $96.0 million was cash and the balance the
assumption of certain liabilities related to the purchased businesses. The cash
proceeds of the sale were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet
Credit Facility. In the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2001, as part of its
restructuring program, the Company reported a pre-tax asset impairment charge

CREDIT FACILITIES - At March 31, 2003, the Company has a senior credit facility
consisting of a $13.5 million, asset based, revolving credit facility which was
established in August 2002 to refinance all remaining obligations outstanding
under the Fleet Credit Facility (the "New Senior Credit Facility"). The New
Senior Credit Facility, as amended June 2, 2003 and which matures August 7,
2005, is secured by all of the Company's assets, carries an interest rate of
5.25% and contains customary financial covenants and events of default. The
Company was in compliance with the provisions of the facility. Subject to
limitations relating to levels of certain assets and reserves for future
interest payments, the Company has unused borrowing capacity on the facility of
$13.5 million as there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at
March 31, 2003.

SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES - On August 30, 2000, the Company completed a private
placement of $75 million of senior subordinated notes (the "Notes") and warrants
to purchase shares of the Company's common stock (the "Warrants") to a group of
institutional investors (collectively, the "Purchasers"). The Company used the
proceeds of the private placement to retire, in full, a $75 million bridge loan
held by a group of lenders led by Fleet National Bank. The Notes, as amended in
August 2002, are due on August 29, 2005 and bear interest at a rate of 18% per
annum subject to adjustments described below, consisting of 13% cash interest on
principal, payable quarterly, and 5% interest on principal, payable quarterly in
"payment-in-kind" ("PIK") promissory notes. The Company may prepay the Notes
after August 29, 2001, at a premium initially of 9%, declining to 5%, 3%, and 1%
on each of the next succeeding anniversaries of that date. The Notes contain
customary financial covenants and events of default, including a cross-default
provision to the

                                       18

<PAGE>
Company's senior debt obligations. At March 31, 2003, the principal balance
outstanding on the notes amounted to $53.3 million, which included the original
principal amount plus the "payment-in-kind" notes less approximately $28.6
million paid off at the time of the sale of Norco, Inc. At March 31, 2003, the
Company was in compliance with the provisions of the Notes.

At issuance, the Warrants entitled the Purchasers to acquire, in the aggregate,
427,602 shares, or approximately 7%, of the common stock of the Company at an
exercise price of $9.93 a share. This exercise price represents the average
daily closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange
for the thirty (30) days preceding the completion of the private placement. The
Warrants must be exercised by August 29, 2010.

Effective with the refinancing of the Company's prior senior credit agreement
with the New Senior Credit Facility on August 7, 2002, the purchasers of the
senior subordinated notes agreed to amend the notes. Under the amended senior
subordinated notes, the Company paid an amendment fee equal to 1% of the
outstanding balance of the notes by issuing additional notes and agreed to
increase the PIK interest rate on the notes to 5% effective January 1, 2003,
with such rate increasing 0.25% each quarter until we retire the notes.
Additionally, the Company amended the terms of the warrants to reduce the
exercise price of each warrant to provide the holders with a minimum profit on
the exercise of the warrants equal to $5.00 per share if the warrants were
exercised and sold prior to December 31, 2002. Because the Company did not
redeem the warrants prior to December 31, 2002, their exercise price was reduced
to $0.01 per share as of that date. In addition, the amended warrants contain a
"put" right that allows the holders to cause the Company to purchase the
warrants at a price of $5.00 per underlying share up to 120 days following the
occurrence of certain "liquidity events." The sale of the Norco, Inc. subsidiary
constituted a liquidity event and, accordingly, under the terms of the warrants,
as amended, through June 24, 2003, the holders have the right to require the
Company to redeem the warrants or repurchase the stock acquired through the
exercise of the warrants at a price equal to $5.00 per share. The maximum cash
exposure related to these warrants and their put rights, if any, is the $2.1
million that would be required to redeem the unexercised warrants or the
underlying shares. The $1.3 million of redeemable common stock reflected on the
balance sheet, represents the $5.00 per share put price on that portion of the
warrants (approximately 257,000 shares of common stock) which have been
exercised by the holders of the warrants. Upon the expiration of the put right,
any amount of redeemable common stock for which the put right was not exercised
will be used to increase additional paid in capital.

At March 31, 2003, the Company recorded a $2.0 million noncash, non-taxable gain
relating to the mark-to-market accounting of the warrants as a derivative. Since
the put right attached to the warrants will expire during the first quarter of
fiscal 2004, no further gains or losses relating to the warrants will be
recorded.

The Company has maturities of long-term debt of $79 thousand, $53.4 million and
$79 thousand in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.

7.    STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND EMPLOYEE/DIRECTOR STOCK OPTIONS

The Company maintains the amended and restated 1992 long-term incentive plan
(the "1992 Plan"), the 1998 non-employee directors stock option plan (the "1998
Plan") and the 1999 long-term incentive plan (the "1999 Plan").

Under the terms of the 1999 plan, 300,000 of the Company's common shares may be
granted as stock options or awarded as restricted stock to officers, directors
and certain employees of the Company through July 2009. Under both plans, option
exercise prices equal the fair market value of the common shares at their grant
dates. For grants made prior to May 1999, options expire not later than five
years after the date of the grant. Options granted beginning in May 1999 to
officers and employees expire not later than 10 years after the date of the
grant. Options granted to directors and to officers and employees with the
annual cash bonus vest ratably over three years beginning one year after the
date of the grant. Restricted stock is payable in equivalent number of common
shares. The shares are distributable in a single installment and, with respect
to officers and employees, restrictions lapse ratably over a three-year period
from the date of the award, and with respect to directors, the restrictions
lapse after one year.

Under the terms of the 1998 Plan, non-employee directors are entitled to receive
matching options for a) each share of the Company's common stock which they hold
at the end of a 60-day period following initial election as a director, but not
to exceed 25,000 shares, with the strike price of the option being the fair
market value of the shares at their grant dates, and b) thereafter, for each
share of the Company's common stock that they purchase on the open market, with
the strike price of the option being the purchase price of the share, up to a
maximum of 5,000 options in any twelve month period or 15,000 options over a
three-year period. Options granted under the 1998 Plan vest on the first
anniversary of the grant. Options expire not later than five years after the
date of the grant.

For measurement purposes, a 13.5% and 10.0% annual rate of increase in the per
capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.25% by 2011 and
remain at that level thereafter. Under the Plan, the actuarially determined
effect of a one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend
would be as follows:

(1) Based on three-month LIBOR

The company recorded the fair value of these swaps in accrued liabilities at
March 31, 2002. During 2003, these agreements were terminated and settled as the
debt was repaid resulting in a charge of $0.2 million to discontinued
operations.



                                       21
<PAGE>
The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the
fair value of each class of financial instruments:

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet
for cash and cash equivalents approximates its fair value.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, DEBT, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES - The carrying
amounts of these items approximates their fair value.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK - The Company is subject to concentration of credit
risk primarily with its trade and notes receivable. The company grants credit to
certain customers who meet pre-established credit requirements, and generally
requires no collateral from its customers. Estimates of potential credit losses
are provided for in the Company's consolidated financial statements and are
within management's expectations and industry averages. As of March 31, 2003,
the Company had no other significant concentrations of risk.

10. COMMITMENTS

Rent expense under operating leases for the years ended March 31, 2003, 2002,
and 2001 was $419 thousand, $589 thousand and $515 thousand, respectively.

11. CONTINGENCIES

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS - During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company
presented an environmental cleanup plan for a portion of a site in Pennsylvania
which continues to be owned although the related business has been sold. This
plan was submitted pursuant to the Consent Order and Agreement with the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection ("PaDEP") concluded in
fiscal 1999. Pursuant to the Consent Order, upon its execution the Company paid
$0.2 million for past costs, future oversight expenses and in full settlement of
claims made by PaDEP related to the environmental remediation of the site with
an additional $0.2 million paid in fiscal 2001. A second Consent Order was
concluded with PaDEP in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 for another portion of
the site, and a third Consent Order for the remainder of the site was concluded
in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. The Company is also administering an agreed
settlement with the Federal government under which the government pays 50% of
the direct and internal environmental response costs associated with a portion
of the site. The Company has also reached an agreement in principle with the
Federal government and is in the process of finalizing the necessary
documentation under which the Federal government will pay 45% of the direct and
internal environmental response costs associated with another portion of the
site. At March 31, 2003, the Company's cleanup reserve was $2.0 million based on
the net present value of future expected cleanup costs. The Company expects that
remediation at the Pennsylvania site will not be completed for several years.

The Company also continues to participate in environmental assessments and
remediation work at nine other locations, including former facilities of the
Company. The Company estimates that its potential cost for implementing
corrective action at these sites will not exceed $0.5 million payable over the
next several years, and has provided for the estimated costs in its accrual for
environmental liabilities. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the
Company entered into a consent order for a former facility in New York pursuant
to which it is developing a remediation plan for review and approval by the New
York Department of Environmental Conservation. The Company has established a
reserve of $2.5 million which it believes is adequate.

In addition, the Company has been named as a potentially responsible party in
eight environmental proceedings pending in several other states in which it is
alleged that the Company was a generator of waste that was sent to landfills and
other treatment facilities and, as to several sites, it is alleged that the
Company was an owner or operator. Such properties generally relate to businesses
which have been sold or discontinued. The Company estimates that its expected
future costs, and its estimated proportional share of remedial work to be
performed, associated with these proceedings will not exceed $0.2 million and
has provided for these estimated costs in its accrual for environmental
liabilities.

LITIGATION - The Company is also engaged in various other legal proceedings
incidental to its business. It is the opinion of management that, after taking
into consideration information furnished by its counsel, the above matters will
have no material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or the
results of the Company's operations in future periods.

12. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

The Company operates in only one business segment, the design, manufacture and
sale of equipment for use in the aerospace industry. Approximately 55.1%, 47.3%
and 45.3% of sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were derived from sales to the United
States Government and its prime contractors.

ITEM 14. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures. Also, the Company has investments in certain
unconsolidated entities. As the Company does not control or manage these
entities, its disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities
are necessarily substantially more limited than those it maintains with respect
to its consolidated subsidiaries.

With 90 days prior to the date of this report, the Company carried out an
evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's
management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Company's
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the forgoing, the
Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

There have been no significant changes in the Company's internal controls or in
other factors that could significantly affect the internal controls subsequent
to the date the Company completed its evaluation.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of TransTechnology Corporation:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of TransTechnology
Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2003 and 2002, and for each of the
three years in the period ended March 31, 2003, and have issued our report
thereon dated May 1, 2003 (June 2, 2003 as to the second paragraph of Note 6);
such report is included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our audits also included
the financial statement schedule of TransTechnology Corporation, listed in Item
15. This financial statement schedule is the responsibility of the Corporation's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion based on our audits. In
our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to
the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in
all material respects the information set forth therein.

Attention: Mr. Joseph Spanier

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         Reference is made to that certain Financing Agreement, dated as of
August 7, 2002 (the "Financing Agreement"), by and among TransTechnology
Corporation, NORCO, Inc. (n/k/a TT Connecticut Corporation), TCR Corporation
(n/k/a TT Minnesota Corporation) and The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc.
("CIT"). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall
have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Financing Agreement.

         1.       The parties hereto agree that the Financing Agreement is
amended by restating subsection (a) of the definition of "Change of Control" in
Section 1.1 of the Financing Agreement to read as follows:

                           "(a)     the acquisition, directly or indirectly, by
         any person or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the
         Exchange Act) of beneficial ownership of more than 36% of the aggregate
         outstanding voting power of the Capital Stock of the Parent;"

         2.       Each of the Companies hereby represents and warrants that
after giving effect to this letter agreement, no Event of Default, or event
which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute an Event of Default
shall have occurred.

         3.       This letter agreement shall not constitute a waiver or
amendment of any other provision of the Financing Agreement or other Loan
Document not expressly referred to herein, and shall not be construed as a
waiver or consent to any further or future action on the part of any of the
Companies that would require a waiver or consent of CIT.

                  WHEREAS, The Company and Director believe it is in their best
         interests that the Director relinquishes the positions of President and
         Chief Executive Officer of the Company currently held by the Director;
         and,

                  WHEREAS, the Company and the Director are parties to an
         Executive Severance Agreement (the "Severance Agreement") originally
         dated January 13, 1999 and as amended from time to time; and,

                  WHEREAS, the Director and the Company deem it to be in their
         respective best interests to enter into an agreement providing for the
         Director's services to the Company pursuant to the terms herein stated;

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual promises and agreements contained herein, it is hereby agreed as follows:

                  1.       Effective Date. This Agreement shall be effective as
of January 16, 2003.

                  2.       Services and Duties.

                           (a)      The Company hereby agrees to continue
Director in the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors currently
occupied by the Director and Director hereby agrees to provide his services as
the non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company for such
term as the Board of Directors (the "Board"), in its sole discretion, may
request, with such customary responsibilities, duties and authority commensurate
with such position including, without limitation, the duties and authority
comprehended by the By-laws of the Company, attendance at all meetings of the
Board or of any Committee of the Board of which Director is a member, and such
other duties and responsibilities as the Board may assign to the Director.
During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall propose Director for
re-election to the Board and the Company shall use its best efforts in
compliance with applicable law to cause the Director to be elected to the Board
and to serve as Chairman of the Board.

<PAGE>

                           (b)      Director shall use his best efforts during

annual rate of $50,000 to be paid quarterly on the first day of each quarter of

as the "Fees."

                           (b)      Lump-Sum Payments. In addition to the Fees,
Director shall, at the time of his termination of employment as President and

receive the following lump-sum cash payments, determined in accordance with the
Severance Agreement:

                                    (i)      An amount equal to all accrued
vacation and sick pay earned by Director as of the Severance Date (estimated at

                                    (ii)     An amount equal to the compensated

                                    (iv)     Severance of $1,335,000, which has
been computed in accordance with the terms of the Severance Agreement; and

                                    (v)      The reasonable and documented costs

in the form of employer matching and/or profit sharing contributions with
respect to fiscal year 2003 had Director remained an employee of the Company
through the last day of fiscal year 2003 over (B) the amount of any such

Director's 401(k) plan account with respect to fiscal year 2003.

                           (c)      The Company shall reimburse Director for
reasonable business expenses incurred in performing Director's duties hereunder.

regarding outstanding matters with respect to the corporate restructuring and

restructuring, the Company shall pay to Director consulting fees at the annual
rate of $100,000 per year, such consulting fees to be paid quarterly on the

shall be paid on the Severance Date the pro rata amount of the consulting fees
due from the Severance Date through the end of the quarter.

                  6.       Term. Except as specifically provided herein, and
subject to Director's statutory rights as a duly elected member of the Board,
this Agreement shall terminate on the date that the Board determines, in its
sole discretion, and notifies Director in writing that the services contemplated
herein are no longer necessary, but in any event, not later than March 31, 2006.

                  7.       Non-Solicitation. The Director agrees that during the
term of this Agreement and for two years thereafter, provided that there is no
default by Company under this Agreement, he will not directly or indirectly:

                           (a)      Solicit, divert or take away any of the
customers, business or patronage of the Company or its subsidiaries or
affiliates; or

                           (b)      Induce or attempt to influence any employee
of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her

or may hereafter have arising under or in connection with the Severance

                  5.       Term; Termination of the Agreement. As used herein,
the phrase "Term of the Agreement" shall mean the period commencing on the
Effective Date and, except as otherwise specifically provided below, ending on

expire on the first to occur of the following:

                           (a)      Termination for any reason other than Cause.
In the event Executive's employment hereunder is terminated for any reason other
than for Cause, the Company shall (i) to the extent not otherwise paid prior to
the effective date of termination, pay to Executive a lump sum amount equal to
all amounts not theretofore paid under Section 3(c) of this Agreement, (ii) pay
to Executive all Base Salary that is accrued but unpaid as of the date of such

tenth day after the Executive's last day of employment with the Company.

                           (b)      Termination for Cause. In the event that the
Company terminates Executive's employment for Cause, the Company shall pay to
Executive all Base Salary that is accrued but unpaid as of the date of such
termination of employment and the Company shall have no further obligation
hereunder from and after the effective date of such termination (other than the
accelerated payment obligations set forth in the Note). For purposes of this
Agreement, "Cause" shall mean Executive's conviction of, or plea of guilty or
nolo contendere to, a felony or crime of moral turpitude.

                  6.       Non-Solicitation. Subject to the condition that the
Company is not in default under this Agreement, the Executive agrees that during
the Term of the Agreement and for two years thereafter, he will not directly or
indirectly:

                           (a)      Solicit, divert or take away any of the
customers, business or patronage of the Company or its subsidiaries or
affiliates; or

                           (b)      Induce or attempt to influence any employee
of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her
employment therewith.

In the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Executive of the provisions
of this Section 6 the Company, or any duly authorized officer thereof, will be
entitled to a temporary restraining order or injunction.

                  7.       Taxes. All payments to be made to Executive under
this Agreement will be subject to any applicable withholding of federal, state
and local income and employment taxes.

                  8.       Miscellaneous. This Agreement shall also be subject
to the following:

                           (a)      Executive and the Company each represent and
warrant to the other that he or it has the authorization, power and right to
deliver, execute, and fully perform his or its obligations under this Agreement
in accordance with its terms.

                           (b)      If any provision of this Agreement or any
portion thereof is declared invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by
any court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of such provisions and all of
the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect.

                           (c)      This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New Jersey,
except to the extent governed by federal law.

                           (d)      The Company will require any successor
(whether by merger, consolidation, spin-off, purchase or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the stock, assets or business of the Company or any
subsidiary or parent of the Company to expressly agree to assume this Agreement
and to perform all duties and obligations hereunder in the same manner and to
the same extent that the Company would have been required to perform had no such

                                       4

<PAGE>

succession taken place. Failure by the Company to obtain a successor's agreement
to assume this Agreement shall constitute a breach of this Agreement and
Executive shall be entitled to receive payments and benefits from the Company in
the same amount and on the same terms that he would be entitled to under Section
5(a) if his employment is terminated other than for Cause; provided, that in no
event shall the foregoing result in a duplication of any payments or benefits
provided for hereunder.

                           (e)      Subject to the provisions of Section 10, any
rights of Executive hereunder shall be in addition to any rights Executive may
otherwise have under benefit plans, agreements, or arrangements of the Company
to which he is a party or in which he is a participant, including, but not
limited to, any stock option grants.

                           (f)      For the purpose of this Agreement, notices
and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered by Federal Express,
or similar overnight express delivery service, or mailed by United States
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid,
addressed to the named Executive at the address contained in the Company's
records concerning the Executive. All notices to the Company shall be directed
to the attention of the Secretary of the Company.

                           (g)      Section headings in this Agreement are
included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a
part of this Agreement for any other purpose.

                           (h)      Failure to insist upon strict compliance
with any of the terms, covenants, or conditions hereof shall not be deemed a
waiver of such term, covenant, or condition, nor shall any waiver or
relinquishment of, or failure to insist upon strict compliance with, any right
or power hereunder at any one or more times be deemed a waiver or relinquishment
of such right or power at any other time or times.

                           (i)      This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument.

                  9.       Resolution of Disputes. Any dispute or controversy
arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively
by arbitration, conducted in Princeton, New Jersey in accordance with the rules
of the American Arbitration Association governing employment disputes as then in
effect. The Company and Executive hereby agree that the arbitrator will not have
the authority to award punitive damages, damages for emotional distress or any
other damages that are not contractual in nature. Judgment may be entered on the
arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction; provided, however, that the
Company shall be entitled to seek a restraining order or injunction in any court
of competent jurisdiction to prevent any continuation of any violation of the
provisions of Section 6, and Executive consents that such restraining order or
injunction may be granted without the necessity of the Company's posting any
bond except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law. The fees and
expenses of the American Arbitration Association and the arbitrator shall be
borne by the Company.

                  10.      Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise provide for
herein, this Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement between Executive
and the Company with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall supersede
that certain Executive Severance Agreement by and between Executive and the
Company, as originally dated November 11, 1996, and as amended on each of
October 15, 1998 and January 18, 2001) (the "Severance Agreement"). In exchange

and forever release and discharge the Company, its parents, subsidiaries,
affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, predecessors, successors and
assigns from any and all payments and obligations that the Company now has, has
ever had or may hereafter have arising under or in connection with the Severance
Agreement. Nothing herein shall be deemed to modify or supersede any stock
option grant or restricted stock award outstanding on the Effective Date or any
of Executive's rights or benefits thereunder.

                  11.      Indemnification Letter. That certain Indemnification
Letter dated January 13, 2000 by and between Executive and the Company shall
remain in full force and effect.

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this
Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

                                 PROMISSORY NOTE

$237,000                                                   Dated: March 31, 2003

                                                               Union, New Jersey

                  FOR VALUE RECEIVED, TRANSTECHNOLOGY CORPORATION, a Delaware

and in immediately available funds in accordance with the terms set forth herein
and in that certain Employment Agreement dated as of March 28, 2003, by and
between the Maker and the Payee (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
from time to time, the "Employment Agreement") and to pay interest on the unpaid
principal amount of such Note, in like money and funds, for the period
commencing on the date of such Note until such Note shall be paid in full, at
5 1/4% per annum and on the dates provided herein.

                  Repayments of principal, in installments of $79,000 each, plus
accrued but unpaid interest thereon, shall be due and payable on each of March
31, 2004, March 31, 2005 and March 31, 2006; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing the Company shall pay to Payee all unpaid
principal plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon upon the first to occur of
the following events: (a) Payee's termination of employment by the Company for
any reason; (b) the occurrence of a transaction resulting in a Change in

Maker fails to make any principal and/or interest payment when due hereunder;
(d) Maker shall breach its obligations under Section 8(d) of the Employment

or the taking of possession by, a receiver, custodian, trustee or liquidator;
(ii) be generally unable to pay the Maker's debts as such debts become due;
(iii) make a general assignment for the benefit of the Maker's creditors; (iv)

full of all amounts due and payable at the time of such payment, shall be deemed
to be a waiver or release of the same, such waiver or release to be effected
only through a written document executed by Payee and then only to the extent
specifically recited therein. A waiver or release with reference to any one
event shall not be construed as continuing, as a bar to, or as a waiver or
release of any subsequent right, remedy or recourse as to a subsequent event.

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Maker has executed and delivered this Note
as of the date first written above.

FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS

As our company enters the new fiscal year, our restructuring and associated
divestitures are complete, our management team has been reconfigured, and our
outlook for the future is bright. While smaller, we believe that our highly
focused company is now positioned to grow, prosper, and create value for its
owners, rewarding careers for its employees, and leading-edge products and
services for its customers.

Our business is now composed solely of Breeze-Eastern, the world's leading
designer, manufacturer, and servicer of helicopter rescue hoists, cargo winches
and cargo hooks. As such, 95% of our revenues are derived as the sole-source to
government agencies, both military and civil, for our products and services
across the globe.

The fiscal 2003 financial statements are difficult to follow as they reflect the
impact of the divestiture of several business units, the refinancing of senior
debt, the change in terms of subordinated debt, and the elimination of most
positions in our corporate office. Breeze-Eastern, which is our sole continuing
operation, had record levels of new orders, sales, backlog, and operating profit
during fiscal 2003. These solid results, however, were more than offset by
expenses associated with our restructuring activities, resulting in a loss from
continuing operations of $3.9 million, or $.61 per share. Sales for fiscal 2003
were up 15% to $55.0 million versus fiscal 2002. Operating income from
continuing operations, exclusive of nonrecurring, non-operating gains and losses
and gains from financial derivatives, was up 84%. Net income for fiscal 2003,
including a $13.1 million gain from discontinued operations attributable to our
divestitures, was $1.47 per share.

Our vision for the future is to have TransTechnology recognized as the
pre-eminent designer, manufacturer and servicer of sophisticated lifting
equipment for the aerospace and defense markets. Our business plan is to command
market leadership through design, engineering, and superior customer service. We
will strive to maintain operating agility and to keep our high-quality people
challenged as to personal growth and sustained performance while also
maintaining a focus on cash generation. Our ability to double sales and
operating income over the next five years - initially solely through organic
growth, and, in later years, supplemented by acquisitions of niche products and
technologies - will be our measure of success.

Our effort to remain at the forefront of our industry is illustrated by our
annual engineering budget. Last year, engineering and development spending
amounted to $4.1 million, or 7.5% of sales. This spending level has been
maintained for several years, even in those years when cash flow was tightest.
It was this devotion to engineering expertise that allowed us not only to
introduce new rescue hoist and cargo winch products this past year, but also to
expand our efforts into weapons handling systems. Our extended product line has
already seen several new introductions, including the HLU-196 Bomb Hoist, which
went from concept to delivery in only two years. Almost $5.8 million of these
bomb hoists were shipped in fiscal 2003, with a remaining backlog of $11.2
million to be shipped in fiscal 2004. Weapons loading hoists for the Line of
Sight Anti-Tank Weapon, the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, and the
Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle represent substantial opportunities for future
growth.

OUR VISION FOR THE FUTURE IS THAT TRANSTECHNOLOGY WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS THE
PRE-EMINENT DESIGNER, MANUFACTURER AND SERVICE PROVIDER OF SOPHISTICATED LIFTING
EQUIPMENT FOR THE AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE MARKETS.

In addition to the development of the weapons handling product line, this past
year saw us win the largest single rescue hoist contract awarded by the U.S.
Navy in recent memory. The award, for 102 BL-27100-85 rescue hoists for the Sea
Hawk helicopter made by Sikorsky, will begin to ship in fiscal 2004 and run into
fiscal 2005. The receipt of such large orders provides a solid base for future
sales of aftermarket products in the form of spare parts, repairs, and overhaul
services.

Our biggest challenge remains the restructuring of our balance sheet. The $53.3
million of very high-rate subordinated debt outstanding at the end of fiscal
2003 is our single most pressing challenge, and, at the same time, opportunity.
Our forecast for fiscal 2004 is that this debt could result in pre-tax interest
and amortization costs of almost $1.70 per share, and anything we can do to
reduce this high level of interest will be immediately beneficial to our
company, its customers, employees, and shareholders. We are dedicated to
completing this last piece of our restructuring effort as quickly as possible.
It is our belief that, at this point in time, there is nothing else we can do
that would create more value for all of our stakeholders.

Our workforce is one of the most productive in the industry. Highly skilled,
well trained, and motivated by producing products that help save lives in any
number of ways, each and every one of our employees makes a valuable
contribution to our company and our nation daily. We are very proud of them and
their commitment to customer service, product quality, and excellence. We were
saddened this past year to lose one of our most valued and committed
customer-service representatives, Nadine Schumann-Mahoney, who passed away in
February. An example to us all, Nadine was completely dedicated to her
customers, and would move mountains to help them in any way she could. She will
be missed by all those whose paths she crossed.

We would also like to thank our entire Board of Directors, which has dedicated
itself to the hard work and effort required to guide our company through the
difficulties of the past two years. Unselfish of their time, counsel, and
assistance, our Board members are one of our company's hidden strengths.

Finally, we thank you, the shareholders, who have placed your trust, confidence,
and resources in our hands. We appreciate your support and are making every
effort to see that TransTechnology regains its position of leadership in the
creation of value for all of its stakeholders.

BREEZE-EASTERN

TransTechnology Corporation's Breeze-Eastern unit is the world's leading
designer, manufacturer, and service provider of rescue hoists and cargo hooks
for helicopters as well as cargo winches for both helicopters and fixed wing
aircraft. Breeze-Eastern has been the industry standard almost since the
origination of helicopters, having worked with Igor Sikorsky in the 1940s to
develop a rudimentary hoist for use on his first search and rescue aircraft.
Breeze-Eastern has provided more than 20,000 rescue hoists, cargo winches, and
cargo hooks used by government agencies, both military and civil, around the
world. Rapid inroads are now being made by Breeze-Eastern into an additional
niche market for its sophisticated lifting technology - weapons handling
systems.

RESCUE HOISTS AND CARGO WINCHES

The largest product line within the company, these products are high
performance, highly engineered, and built to exacting standards. Rescue hoists,
which are mission-specific equipment, are in use in approximately one in four
medium- and heavy-lift government-owned helicopters throughout the world. They
are used to raise or lower personnel in a rescue, insertion, or extraction
operation. Our newest product, the HS-29900 electric hoist, has an unlimited
duty cycle and, using a 290-foot cable, can operate at speeds of 350 feet per
minute in hostile environments. The HS-29900 hoists are currently in use on the
most popular and widely used utility helicopters in the world, such as the
Sikorsky H60 Black Hawk, Boeing CH47 Chinook, AgustaWestland EH101, Eurocopter
AS332 Super Puma, and the Russian MIL171.

The Agusta A109K2 helicopters used by the Swiss Government Rescue Agency REGA
are all equipped with the Breeze-Eastern 450 lb. electric hoist.

Recently, Breeze-Eastern was the first to offer a double rescue hoist. This new
unit, in use by the Canadian Maritime Authority on its fleet of EH-101
helicopters, allows redundancy for rescue operations, ensuring that the mission
can be accomplished even if one of the hoists becomes entangled or otherwise
disabled. Breeze-Eastern's engineering department has also developed several
product enhancements for existing hoists, including lighted hooks, cable-foul
sensors, slip clutches, and crushable bumpers, each of which adds to the safety
and ease of operating the equipment.

Breeze-Eastern cargo winches are used to move cargo horizontally within either
fixed wing aircraft or helicopters. They generally have a less than 3,000-pound
capacity and are used in aircraft such as the Boeing C-17 and EADS-CASA 235 for
parachute line retrieval and for moving small loads within the aircraft. The
V-22 Osprey, currently in operational evaluation by the U.S. Marine Corps, the
AgustaWestland EH101, Lockheed Martin Alenia C27J Spartan, and EADS-CASA C295
are some of the new platforms that will use Breeze-Eastern cargo winches.

CARGO HOOKS

Breeze-Eastern is the world leader in medium- and heavy-lift cargo hooks. These
fixed devices, found on the bottom exterior along the centerline of the
helicopter, are used for lift or delivery using pendants that attach to the
load. Typical loads range from pallets of ammunition, food and supplies, to
aircraft,

vehicles, or artillery pieces. Capable of carrying loads of up to 36,000 pounds
- - the largest capacity in the industry - Breeze-Eastern cargo hooks can be found
on all of the world's heavy-lift helicopters, including the Boeing CH-47 and
Sikorsky SH-53 Super Stallion, and all Sikorsky H-60 Hawk series helicopters,
the workhorses of the U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps for delivering material
and equipment to troops in the field. Breeze-Eastern cargo hooks can also be
found on the Agusta Bell AB139, Agusta Bell AB412, and Eurocopter AS350 series.

WEAPONS HANDLING EQUIPMENT

Breeze-Eastern's newest and fastest growing product line is weapons handling
systems. For the past 20 years, Breeze-Eastern has been the sole-source supplier
of more than $100 million of loading equipment for Lockheed Martin's Multiple
Launch Rocket System ("MLRS"), widely used during the 1991 Gulf War and
Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. Building upon the basic technology used in
rescue hoists and cargo winches, i.e., a motor, cable, drum and transmission,
Breeze-Eastern has developed loading systems for several newly introduced
weapons platforms. The High Mobility Artillery Rocket System that is a smaller
version of the MLRS; the Line of Sight Anti-Tank Weapon, a HumVee mounted
kinetic energy missile system; and the Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle, expected to
be a primary combat bomber in the future, all use Breeze-Eastern weapon loading
devices. Breeze-Eastern's HLU-196 Bomb Hoist, developed from concept to
delivered product in less than two years, will become standard equipment on all
U.S. Navy aircraft carriers. The first $5.8 million of these units were shipped
during fiscal 2003 and Breeze-Eastern has received a total of $18.3 million of
orders for this new product. Although already considered a market leader,
Breeze-Eastern currently has less than 10% market share in this highly
fragmented market and has targeted its new weapons handling product line for
substantial growth in the future.

PRODUCT SUPPORT

Breeze-Eastern's commitment to product support is widely recognized as the best
in the business. From the daily quality meeting that is open to customer calls
and participation, to the user conferences that bring together front-line
operators of Breeze-Eastern equipment around the world, Breeze-Eastern focuses
on meeting the current and future needs of its customers while surpassing
expectations. Product support and after-market equipment sales generated more
than 50% of revenues in fiscal 2003. Product support is a highly visible segment
of the Breeze-Eastern business, and one that receives substantial resources from
marketing, engineering, manufacturing, quality and finance.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

BUSINESS - The fiscal year of TransTechnology Corporation (the "Company") ends
on March 31. Accordingly, all references to years in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements refer to the fiscal year ended March 31 of the indicated
year unless otherwise specified.

As a result of a restructuring program completed by the Company during 2003, the
Company has reclassified all of the business units that made up its Specialty
Fastener segment in prior years and its Aerospace Rivet Manufacturers
Corporation and Norco Inc. businesses, which had been included in its Aerospace
Products segment, as discontinued operations. All references related to ongoing
operations, or the Company, refer only to continuing operations, which consists
of the Breeze-Eastern division.

The company, which has one manufacturing facility in the United States,
develops, manufactures, sells and services a complete line of sophisticated
lifting and restraining products, principally performance critical helicopter
rescue hoist and cargo hook systems, winches and hoists for aircraft and
weapons systems.

USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue is recognized at the later of 1) when products are
shipped to customers, or 2) when title passes to customers.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with a maturity at date of acquisition of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.

INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes material, labor
and manufacturing overhead costs.

PROPERTY AND RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION - Property is recorded at
cost. Provisions for depreciation are made on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of depreciable assets ranging from three to thirty years.
Depreciation expense for the years ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $0.5
million, $0.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively. During 2002 the Company
sold excess real estate realizing a gain of $1.3 million that is included in
other income.

EARNINGS PER SHARE ("EPS") - The computation of basis earnings per share is
based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The
computation of diluted earnings per share assumes the foregoing and, in
addition, the exercise of all dilutive stock options using the treasury stock
method.

The components of the denominator for basic earnings per common share and
diluted earnings per common share are reconciled as follows:

</TABLE>

Options to purchase 311,411 shares of common stock at prices between $8.84 and
$27.88 were outstanding during 2003 but were not included in the computation of
diluted EPS because the options' exercise prices were greater than the average
market price of the common shares. Similarly, during 2002 options to purchase
450,183 shares of common stock at prices between $8.84 and $27.88 were
outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. During
2001, options to purchase 505,971 shares of common stock at price between $8.84
and $27.88 were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted
EPS.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING COSTS - Research and development costs and
engineering costs, which are charged to expense when incurred, amounted to $2.3
million, $1.7 million and $1.5 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Included in these amounts were expenditures of $1.7 million, $1.2 million and
$1.2 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, which represent costs related
to research and development activities.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The assets and liabilities of the Company's
international operations have been translated into U.S. dollars at year-end
exchange rates, with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated as a
separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Income and expense
items are converted into U.S. dollars at average rates or exchange prevailing
during the year. Cumulative translation adjustments related to businesses which
have been sold have been reflected in the operating results from discontinued
operations.

2003 ANNUAL REPORT                                                            11

<PAGE>

INCOME TAXES - Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The
Company periodically assesses recoverability of deferred tax assets and
provisions for valuation allowances are made as required.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments
for trading purposes. The estimated liability relating to interest rate swap
agreements was accrued during 2002. These agreements were terminated and settled
in 2003.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -
Transition and Disclosure" ("SFAS 148") which amends SFAS No. 123. This
statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to
the fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation
and amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123. The transition guidance
and disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2002. The adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

Following is a summary of the proforma effect on earnings under SFAS 123 (in
thousands except per share amounts):

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - In May 2003 FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for
Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity," that improves the accounting for certain financial instruments that,
under previous guidance, issuers could account for as equity. SFAS 150 requires
that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statement of financial
position. This statement is effective for the Company's fiscal quarter beginning
June 30, 2003. Management does not believe adoption of this standard will have a
material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

In April 2003, FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" that amends and clarifies
accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under Statement 133.
With certain exceptions, SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designed after June
30, 2003. Management does not believe adoption of this standard will have a
material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities." This interpretation defines when a business
enterprise must consolidate a variable interest entity. This interpretation
applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31,2003.
It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15,
2003, to entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it
acquired before February 1,2003. The adoption of this statement is not expected
to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others." This interpretation requires a guarantor to recognize,
at the inception of the guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the
obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. It also enhances guarantor's
disclosure requirements to be made in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under certain guarantees it has issued. The
initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31,2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial
statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15,2002. In the
normal course of business, the Company does not issue guarantees to third
parties; accordingly, this interpretation will not have an effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Exit or Disposal
Activities. " SFAS 146 requires the recognition of a liability for costs
associated with an exit plan or disposal activity when incurred and nullifies
Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including
Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)," which allowed recognition at the
date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan. The provisions of this statement
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated by the Company
after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this statement is not anticipated to
have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

In April 2002, SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections," was approved by
the FASB. Among other things, this statement requires that gains or losses on
the extinguishment of debt will generally be required to be reported as a
component of income from continuing operations and will no longer be classified
as an

extraordinary item. The Company's financial statements for the periods prior to
March 31, 2001, have been reclassified to include losses previously recorded as
an extraordinary item as a component of income from continuing operations.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations," effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. This
statement addresses the diverse accounting practices for obligations associated
with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs. The adoption of this statement will not have a material effect
on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS - Long-lived assets (excluding financial
instruments and deferred tax assets) and certain identifiable intangibles to be
held and used are reviewed by the Company for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, a
significant decrease in the market value of an asset, a significant change in
the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant physical change
in an asset, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business
climate that could affect the value of an asset, or an adverse action or
assessment by a regulator. If a review for recoverability is necessary, the
Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the
asset. In performing these estimates, the Company groups its assets at the
lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. If the sum of the
expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less
than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized.
Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized. Any impairment loss recognized
is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair
value of the asset.

2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND RESTRUCTURING

On January 19, 2001, the Company announced its intention to restructure and
divest its cold-headed products (TCR), retaining ring (Seeger-Orbis,
TransTechnology (GB), TT Brasil, and TransTechnology Engineered Rings USA), hose
clamp (Breeze Industrial and Pebra) and aerospace rivet (Aerospace Rivet
Manufacturers Corp.) operations. In addition, on April 12, 2001, the Company
announced that it would divest TransTechnology Engineered Components (TTEC), a
manufacturer of spring steel engineered fasteners and headlight adjusters. For
business segment reporting purposes, these above-mentioned business units,
excluding ARM for 2002, have previously been classified as the "Specialty
Fasteners Segment." The Company has reclassified these business units as
discontinued operations for all periods presented.

A portion of the Company's interest expense has been allocated to discontinued
operations based upon the net asset balances attributable to those operations.
Interest expense allocated to discontinued operations was $6.3 million, $20.1
million and $31.6 million, in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Income taxes
have been allocated to discontinued operations based on the estimated tax
attributes of the income and assets of the underlying discontinued businesses.

On July 10, 2001, the Company sold its Breeze Industrial and Pebra hose clamp
businesses to Industrial Growth Partners and members of Breeze Industrial's
management for $46.2 million, which was paid in cash. In a related transaction,
the Company sold the real estate occupied by Breeze Industrial to a
quasi-governmental organization for $2.0 million which the Company may, under
certain circumstances, be required to repurchase for $1 million in fiscal 2006.
Proceeds from the sales were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the
Company's then current Credit Facility (the Fleet Credit Facility).

On December 5, 2001, the Company sold its TransTechnology Engineered Components
("TTEC") businesses to a company formed by affiliates of Kohlberg & Company,
L.L.C. for $98.5 million, of which $96.0 million was cash and the balance the
assumption of certain liabilities related to the purchased businesses. The cash
proceeds of the sale were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet
Credit Facility. In the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2001, as part of its
restructuring program, the Company reported a pre-tax asset impairment charge
for TTEC in the amount of $85.8 million to reduce the carrying value of these
businesses to estimated fair market value. This noncash charge was specifically
related to the write-down of goodwill. The sale proceeds of TTEC approximated
its adjusted carrying value.

On February 21, 2002, the Company sold its Seeger-Orbis retaining ring business
in Germany to Barnes Group Inc. for $20.0 million cash. The net proceeds of the
sale were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility.

On April 16, 2002, the Company sold its Aerospace Rivet Manufacturers
Corporation subsidiary to Allfast Fastening Systems, Inc. for $3.2 million cash.
The net proceeds of the sale were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the
Fleet Credit Facility.

On May 30, 2002, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the net
assets of its U.S. retaining ring business to SeaView Capital LLC for $2.9
million of cash, a promissory note of $0.8 million and warrants for 5% of the
equity of the purchaser. The net proceeds of the sale were used to repay
borrowings outstanding under the Fleet Credit Facility.

On January 3, 2003, the Company completed the sale of TCR Corporation for cash
consideration of $10.0 million, plus the assumption of certain liabilities, to
an affiliate of MidMark Capital LLC. The net proceeds of the sale were used to
repay borrowings outstanding under the New Senior Credit Facility.

On February 24, 2003, the Company sold Norco Inc. for $51.0 million cash and a
$1.0 million reimbursement for certain income taxes payable as a result of the
transaction to a wholly-owned subsidiary of TransDigm Inc. The net cash proceeds
were used to retire senior debt under the New Senior Credit Facility and
partially repay subordinated debt.

The 2003 gain was comprised of $8.2 million of charges to reflect the amounts
ultimately realized from the sales of discontinued businesses; $7.0 million of
actual operating income of the discontinued businesses; a gain of $28.5 million
from the sale of Norco, Inc.; $6.3 million of allocated interest expense; $0.2
million for the final settlement of interest rate swap contracts; and a noncash
charge of $4.6 million associated with the recognition of accumulated currency
translation losses from the sale of the Brazilian operation. These gains and
losses, which aggregated a net gain of $16.2 million, were reduced by a tax
provision of $3.1 million. The 2002 loss was comprised of $110.3 million of
impairment charges related to reducing the carrying values of the discontinued
businesses to their estimated net realizable values; $12.0 million of actual
operating income of the discontinued businesses through their expected
divestiture dates; $20.1 million of allocated interest expense; $8.4 million
from the write-off of capitalized loan fees and the mark-to-market of interest
rate swaps; $24.7 million of gains recognized on the sale of certain business
units; and, $0.2 million of other income or credits associated with the
discontinued operations. These gains and losses, which aggregated a net loss of
$101.9 million, were reduced by a tax benefit of $32.3 million. The fiscal 2001
loss from discontinued operations consisted of $67.9 million of impairment
charges; $29.6 million of operating income of the discontinued businesses; and
$31.6 million of allocated interest expense. These fiscal 2001 losses, which
aggregated $69.9 million, were reduced by a tax benefit of $5.7 million.

Assets and liabilities of discontinued businesses at March 2002 were comprised
of current assets of $34,206, property of $12,407 and other assets of $18,364,
offset by current liabilities of $19,883 and $1,259 of long-term liabilities.

In fiscal 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized charges of $2.7 million and $1.6
million, respectively, for severance and other costs related to the corporate
office restructuring. In fiscal 2001, the charge of $11.2 million included costs
associated with the corporate office restructuring as well as write offs of
notes receivable and worthless investments in companies that had been divested
in prior fiscal years.

CREDIT FACILITIES - At March 31,2003, the Company has a senior credit facility
consisting of a $13.5 million, asset based, revolving credit facility which was
established in August 2002 to refinance all remaining obligations outstanding
under the Fleet Credit Facility (the "New Senior Credit Facility"). The New
Senior Credit Facility, as amended June 2,2003 and which matures August 7,2005,
is secured by all of the Company's assets, carries an interest rate of 5.25% and
contains customary financial covenants and events of default. The Company was in
compliance with the provisions of the facility. Subject to limitations relating
to levels of certain assets and reserves for future interest payments, the
Company has unused borrowing capacity on the facility of $13.5 million as there
were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at March 31,2003.

SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES - On August 30,2000, the Company completed a private
placement of $75 million of senior subordinated notes (the "Notes") and warrants
to purchase shares of the Company's common stock (the "Warrants") to a group of
institutional investors (collectively, the "Purchasers"). The Company used the
proceeds of the private placement to retire, in full, a $75 million bridge loan
held by a group of lenders led by Fleet National Bank. The Notes, as amended in
August 2002, are due on August 29, 2005 and bear interest at a rate of 18% per
annum subject to adjustments described below, consisting of 13% cash interest on
principal, payable quarterly, and 5% interest on principal, payable quarterly in
"payment-in-kind" ("PIK") promissory notes. The Company may prepay the Notes
after August 29,2001, at a premium initially of 9%, declining to 5%, 3%, and 1%
on each of the next succeeding anniversaries of that date. The Notes contain
customary financial covenants and events of default, including a cross-default
provision to the

2003 ANNUAL REPORT                                                            15


<PAGE>

Company's senior debt obligations. At March 31, 2003, the principal balance
outstanding on the notes amounted to $53.3 million, which included the original
principal amount plus the "payment-in-kind" notes less approximately $28.6
million paid off at the time of the sale of Norco, Inc. At March 31, 2003, the
Company was in compliance with the provisions of the Notes.

At issuance, the Warrants entitled the Purchasers to acquire, in the aggregate,
427,602 shares, or approximately 7%, of the common stock of the Company at an
exercise price of $9.93 a share. This exercise price represents the average
daily closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange
for the thirty (30) days preceding the completion of the private placement. The
Warrants must be exercised by August 29, 2010.

Effective with the refinancing of the Company's prior senior credit agreement
with the New Senior Credit Facility on August 7, 2002, the purchasers of the
senior subordinated notes agreed to amend the notes. Under the amended senior
subordinated notes, the Company paid an amendment fee equal to 1% of the
outstanding balance of the notes by issuing additional notes and agreed to
increase the PIK interest rate on the notes to 5% effective January 1, 2003,
with such rate increasing 0.25% each quarter until we retire the notes.
Additionally, the Company amended the terms of the warrants to reduce the
exercise price of each warrant to provide the holders with a minimum profit on
the exercise of the warrants equal to $5.00 per share if the warrants were
exercised and sold prior to December 31, 2002. Because the Company did not
redeem the warrants prior to December 31, 2002, their exercise price was reduced
to $0.01 per share as of that date. In addition, the amended warrants contain a
"put" right that allows the holders to cause the Company to purchase the
warrants at a price of $5.00 per underlying share up to 120 days following the
occurrence of certain "liquidity events." The sale of the Norco, Inc. subsidiary
constituted a liquidity event and, accordingly, under the terms of the warrants,
as amended, through June 24, 2003, the holders have the right to require the
Company to redeem the warrants or repurchase the stock acquired through the
exercise of the warrants at a price equal to $5.00 per share. The maximum cash
exposure related to these warrants and their put rights, if any, is the $2.1
million that would be required to redeem the unexercised warrants or the
underlying shares. The $1.3 million of redeemable common stock reflected on the
balance sheet, represents the $5.00 per share put price on that portion of the
warrants (approximately 257,000 shares of common stock) which have been
exercised by the holders of the warrants. Upon the expiration of the put right,
any amount of redeemable common stock for which the put right was not exercised
will be used to increase additional paid in capital.

At March 31, 2003, the Company recorded a $2.0 million noncash, non-taxable gain
relating to the mark-to-market accounting of the warrants as a derivative. Since
the put right attached to the warrants will expire during the first quarter of
fiscal 2004, no further gains or losses relating to the warrants will be
recorded.

The Company has maturities of long-term debt of $79 thousand, $53.4 million and
$79 thousand in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.

7. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND EMPLOYEE/DIRECTOR STOCK OPTIONS

The Company maintains the amended and restated 1992 long-term incentive plan
(the "1992 Plan"), the 1998 non-employee directors stock option plan (the "1998
Plan") and the 1999 long-term incentive plan (the "1999 Plan").

Under the terms of the 1999 plan, 300,000 of the Company's common shares may be
granted as stock options or awarded as restricted stock to officers, directors
and certain employees of the Company through July 2009. Under both plans, option
exercise prices equal the fair market value of the common shares at their grant
dates. For grants made prior to May 1999, options expire not later than five
years after the date of the grant. Options granted beginning in May 1999 to
officers and employees expire not later than 10 years after the date of the
grant. Options granted to directors and to officers and employees with the
annual cash bonus vest ratably over three years beginning one year after the
date of the grant. Restricted stock is payable in equivalent number of common
shares. The shares are distributable in a single installment and, with respect
to officers and employees, restrictions lapse ratably over a three-year period
from the date of the award, and with respect to directors, the restrictions
lapse after one year.

Under the terms of the 1998 Plan, non-employee directors are entitled to receive
matching options for a) each share of the Company's common stock which they hold
at the end of a 60-day period following initial election as a director, but not
to exceed 25,000 shares, with the strike price of the option being the fair
market value of the shares at their grant dates, and b) thereafter, for each
share of the Company's common stock that they purchase on the open market, with
the strike price of the option being the purchase price of the share, up to a
maximum of 5,000 options in any twelve month period or 15,000 options over a
three-year period. Options granted under the 1998 Plan vest on the first
anniversary of the grant. Options expire not later than five years after the
date of the grant.

For measurement purposes, a 13.5% and 10.0% annual rate of increase in the per
capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.25% by 2011 and
remain at that level thereafter. Under the Plan, the actuarially determined
effect of a one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend
would be as follows:

</TABLE>

(1) Based on three-month LIBOR

The company recorded the fair value of these swaps in accrued liabilities at
March 31,2002. During 2003, these agreements were terminated and settled as the
debt was repaid resulting in a charge of $0.2 million to discounted operations.

<PAGE>

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the
fair value of each class of financial instruments:

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet
for cash and cash equivalents approximates its fair value.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, DEBT, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES - The carrying
amounts of these items approximates their fair value.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK - The Company is subject to concentration of credit
risk primarily with its trade and notes receivable. The company grants credit to
certain customers who meet pre-established credit requirements, and generally
requires no collateral from its customers. Estimates of potential credit losses
are provided for in the Company's consolidated financial statements and are
within management's expectations and industry averages. As of March 31, 2003,
the Company had no other significant concentrations of risk.

10. COMMITMENTS

The Company and its subsidiaries have minimum rental commitments under
noncancelable operating leases, primarily leased equipment, as follows (in
thousands):

Rent expense under operating leases for the years ended March 31, 2003, 2002,
and 2001 was $419 thousand, $589 thousand and $515 thousand, respectively.

11. CONTINGENCIES

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS - During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company
presented an environmental cleanup plan for a portion of a site in Pennsylvania
which continues to be owned although the related business has been sold. This
plan was submitted pursuant to the Consent Order and Agreement with the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection ("PaDEP") concluded in
fiscal 1999. Pursuant to the Consent Order, upon its execution the Company paid
$0.2 million for past costs, future oversight expenses and in full settlement of
claims made by PaDEP related to the environmental remediation of the site with
an additional $0.2 million paid in fiscal 2001. A second Consent Order was
concluded with PaDEP in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 for another portion of
the site, and a third Consent Order for the remainder of the site was concluded
in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. The Company is also administering an agreed
settlement with the Federal government under which the government pays 50% of
the direct and internal environmental response costs associated with a portion
of the site. The Company has also reached an agreement in principle with the
Federal government and is in the process of finalizing the necessary
documentation under which the Federal government will pay 45% of the direct and
internal environmental response costs associated with another portion of the
site. At March 31, 2003, the Company's cleanup reserve was $2.0 million based on
the net present value of future expected cleanup costs. The Company expects that
remediation at the Pennsylvania site will not be completed for several years.

The Company also continues to participate in environmental assessments and
remediation work at nine other locations, including former facilities of the
Company. The Company estimates that its potential cost for implementing
corrective action at these sites will not exceed $0.5 million payable over the
next several years, and has provided for the estimated costs in its accrual for
environmental liabilities. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the
Company entered into a consent order for a former facility in New York pursuant
to which it is developing a remediation plan for review and approval by the New
York Department of Environmental Conservation. The Company has established a
reserve of $2.5 million which it believes is adequate.

In addition, the Company has been named as a potentially responsible party in
eight environmental proceedings pending in several other states in which it is
alleged that the Company was a generator of waste that was sent to landfills and
other treatment facilities and, as to several sites, it is alleged that the
Company was an owner or operator. Such properties generally relate to businesses
which have been sold or discontinued. The Company estimates that its expected
future costs, and its estimated proportional share of remedial work to be
performed, associated with these proceedings will not exceed $0.2 million and
has provided for these estimated costs in its accrual for environmental
liabilities.

LITIGATION - The Company is also engaged in various other legal proceedings
incidental to its business. It is the opinion of management that, after taking
into consideration information furnished by its counsel, the above matters will
have no material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or the
results of the Company's operations in future periods.

12. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

The Company operates in only one business segment, the design, manufacture and
sale of equipment for use in the aerospace industry. Approximately 55.1%, 47.3%
and 45.3% of sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were derived from sales to the United
States Government and its prime contractors.

equipment is used to complete rescue operations and military
insertion/extraction operations, move and transport cargo,and load weapons onto
aircraft and ground-based launching systems.

Beginning in fiscal 2001, we implemented a restructuring plan to focus our
resources and capital on our specialty aerospace and defense products business
and exit the specialty fastener segment. On February 24, 2003, we completed the
sale of the business and substantially all of the assets of our subsidiary,
Norco to Marathon Power Technologies Company, a division of TransDigm Inc., for
cash consideration of $51.0 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. This
transaction completed our divestiture program. As a result, our discontinued
operations include Norco and all of the operations related to our Specialty
Fastener segment, including TransTechnology Engineered Components LLC, the
Breeze Industrial Products and Pebra hose clamp businesses, the TransTechnology
Engineered Rings retaining rings businesses, Aerospace Rivet Manufacturers Corp.
and TCR Corporation. Of the operations included in discontinued operations for
fiscal 2002, only TransTechnology Engineered Rings USA, TransTechnology(GB),
TransTechnology Brasil, Aerospace Rivet Manufactures Corp., TCR Corporation and
Norco, Inc. were carried into fiscal 2003.

The net proceeds from our sale of Norco, of approximately $49.0 million, were
used to pay off all senior debt and redeem $28.6 million of our outstanding
senior subordinated notes due 2005. We believe that the divestiture of Norco,
while providing a source of funds to reduce our high rate subordinated debt,
will also simultaneously reduce our exposure to the commercial aircraft OEM and
aftermarket industries and allow us to focus all of our efforts on the military
and governmental aerospace and defense markets. The sale resulted in the
recognition of a pre-tax gain of approximately $28.5 million. Because our
federal income tax net operating loss carryforward is available to offset the
taxable gain from this sale, we do not anticipate paying any federal income
taxes on the sale, although we do expect to pay state income taxes of
approximately $2.2 million.

On January 3, 2003, we sold the business and substantially all of the assets of
our wholly owned subsidiary, TCR Corporation, for $10.0 million. We applied the
net proceeds of approximately $9.0 million from the sale of TCR Corporation to
reduce senior debt.

Under the terms of our existing warrants, the Norco sale constituted a
"liquidity event, " entitling our warrant holders to a put right, pursuant to
which they may require us to purchase their warrants during the 120-day period
following the closing date of the sale. Accordingly, through June 24,2003, the
company has a maximum cash exposure related to these warrants of $2.1 million.

All discussions related to our ongoing operations, or to TransTechnology
Corporation, which include our results of operations, refer only to continuing
operations, which consists of our Breeze-Eastern division. We discuss our
discontinued operations separately under the heading "-Divestitures and
Discontinued Operations."

All references to fiscal 2003 in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to the fiscal year ended
March 31,2003, and all references to fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 refer to the
fiscal year ended March 31.

DIVESTITURES AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

During fiscal 2001, we implemented a restructuring plan to focus our resources
and capital on our aerospace and defense products business and exit the
specialty fastener segment. As a result, our discontinued operations includes
all of the operations related to our specialty fastener segment, which includes
all of the divested operations we describe below and TCR Corporation, which was
sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Our discontinued operations also
include Norco, Inc., which we previously included in our aerospace and defense
products segment.

On July 10,2001, we sold our Breeze Industrial and Pebra hose clamp businesses
to Industrial Growth Partners and members of Breeze Industrial's management for
$46.2 million in cash. In a related transaction, we sold the real estate
occupied by Breeze Industrial to a quasi-governmental organization for $2.0
million which we may, under certain circumstances, be required to repurchase for
$1 million in fiscal 2006. We used the proceeds from these sales to repay
borrowings outstanding under our prior senior credit agreement.

On December 5, 2001, we sold TransTechnology Engineered Components to a company
formed by affiliates of Kohlberg & Company, L.L.C. for $98.5 million, of which
$96.0 million was cash and the balance the assumption of certain liabilities
related to the purchased businesses. We used the cash proceeds of the sale to
repay borrowings outstanding under our prior senior credit agreement. In the
fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2001, as part of our restructuring program,
we reported a pre-tax asset impairment charge for TransTechnology Engineered
Components, Inc. in the amount of $85.8 million to reduce the carrying value of
these businesses to estimated fair market value. This non-cash charge was
related specifically to the write-down of goodwill. The sale proceeds of

TransTechnology Engineered Components approximated our adjusted carrying value.

On February 21, 2002, we sold Seeger-Orbis to Barnes Group Inc. for $20.0
million cash. We used the net proceeds of the sale to repay borrowings
outstanding under our prior senior credit agreement. Our balance sheet contains
a non-current asset and a non-current liability in the amount of $3.7 million
relating to the pension plan of Seeger-Orbis. These amounts represent our legal
liability under German law and the indemnification we received from the buyer of
the business for that liability.

On April 16, 2002, we sold Aerospace Rivet Manufacturers Corporation to Allfast
Fastening Systems, Inc. for $3.2 million in cash. We used the net proceeds of
the sale to repay borrowings outstanding under our prior senior credit
agreement.

On May 30, 2002, we completed the sale of substantially all of the net assets of
TransTechnology Engineered Rings (USA) to a newly formed affiliate of Sea View
Capital LLC for $2.9 million in cash, a promissory note of $0.8 million and
warrants for 5% of the equity of the purchaser. We used the net proceeds of the
sale to repay borrowings outstanding under our prior senior credit agreement.

On July 16, 2002, we completed the recapitalization of our TransTechnology (GB)
Ltd. subsidiary, now known as Cirteq, Ltd., by selling 81% of its shares to a
new entity controlled by local management for $121 (one hundred twenty-one
dollars). We also converted $2.0 million of unsecured intercompany debt into a
$2.0 million loan secured by a first lien on Cirteq's real property in Glusburn,
England.

On August 6, 2002, we completed the sale of all of the shares of TransTechnology
Brasil, Ltda. for $742,000, of which $325,000 was paid in cash and the balance
in installment payments. We also will be paid $258,000 of intracompany debt due
from the Brazilian unit. We used the net proceeds of the sale to repay
borrowings outstanding under our prior senior credit agreement.

On January 3, 2003, we completed the sale of the business and substantially all
of the assets of our wholly owned subsidiary, TCR Corporation, to a newly formed
affiliate of Mid-Mark Capital LLC for $10.0 million in cash. We used the net
proceeds of the sale to repay borrowings outstanding under our new senior credit
agreement.

On February 24, 2003, the Company sold Norco Inc. for $51.0 million cash and a
$1.0 million reimbursement for certain income taxes payable as a result of the
transaction to a wholly owned subsidiary of TransDigm Inc. The net cash proceeds
were used to retire senior debt under the new credit facility and partially
repay subordinated debt.

For fiscal 2003, the $13.1 million gain from discontinued operations included
actual operating income of $7.0 million from discontinued operations, a gain of
$28.5 million from the sale of our Norco subsidiary, allocated interest expense
of $6.3 million, an $8.2 million charge to reflect the amounts ultimately
realized from sales of discontinued business units, a cash charge of $0.2
million from the final settlement of our interest rate swap contracts, a
non-cash charge of $4.6 million associated with the recognition of accumulated
currency translation losses from the sale of our Brazilian operation and a tax
provision of $3.1 million.

For fiscal 2002, the $69.6 million loss from discontinued operations included
$110.3 million of impairment charges related to reducing the carrying values of
the discontinued businesses to their estimated net realizable values, $12.0
million of actual operating income of the discontinued businesses through their
expected divestiture dates, $20.1 million of allocated interest expense; $8.4
million from the write-off of capitalized loan fees and the mark-to-market of
interest rate swaps required under the terms of our credit agreements, $24.7
million of gains recognized on the sale of certain business units; and $0.2
million of other income or credits associated with the discontinued operations.
These gains and losses, which aggregated $101.9 million, were reduced by a tax
benefit of $32.3 million.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

REVENUE RECOGNITION. We recognize revenue at the later of (1) when products are
shipped to customers or (2) when title passes to customers.

INVENTORY. We purchase materials to manufacture components for use in our
products and for use by our engineering, repair and overhaul business. Our
decision to purchase a set quantity of a particular item is influenced by
several factors including current and projected cost, future estimated
availability, lead time for production of the materials, existing and projected
contracts to produce certain items and the estimated needs for its repair and
overhaul business.

We value our inventories using the lower of cost or market on a first-in
first-out (FIFO) basis and establish reserves as necessary to reduce the
carrying amount of these inventories to net realizable value.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES. We provide for environmental reserves when, after
consultation with our internal and external counsel and other environmental
consultants, we determine that a liability is both probable and estimable. In
many cases, we do not fix or cap the liability for a particular site when we
first record it. Factors that affect the recorded amount of the liability in
future years include our participation percentage due to a settlement by, or
bankruptcy of, other potentially responsible parties, a change in the
environmental laws requiring more stringent requirements, a change in the
estimate of future costs that will be incurred to remediate the site and changes
in technology related to environmental remediation.

We discuss current estimated exposure to environmental claims under the caption
"--Environmental Matters."

FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES. Until July 5, 2002, we had outstanding interest rate
swaps in association with our prior senior credit agreement. We valued these
swaps using estimates based on then-prevailing interest rates and the amount we
were required to pay was impacted significantly by changes in interest rates.
Additionally, we are required to treat our outstanding warrants as financial
derivatives and mark these securities to market at

22                                                   TRANSTECHNOLOGY CORPORATION
<PAGE>

the end of each accounting period, resulting in the recognition of a gain or
loss in each period. We determine the amount of this gain or loss by measuring
the difference in the market value of a share of our common stock over a given
period. A $1.00 change in our share price will result in a gain or loss of $0.4
million during the period in which the price change is realized. This
mark-to-market requirement will terminate at the end of the first quarter of
fiscal 2004 as the put feature causing the warrants to be treated as derivatives
will expire.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. This asset represents income tax benefits expected to be
realized in the future, primarily as a result of the use of net operating loss
carry-forwards. If we do not generate adequate amounts of taxable income prior
to the expiration of the tax loss carry-forwards, the amount of this asset may
not be realized. Additionally, changes to the federal and state income tax laws
also could impact our ability to use them. The State of New Jersey, in response
to a budget crisis, has suspended for two years the ability of a corporation to
use a net operating loss carryforward against taxable income earned in the
state. As a result, we will be required to pay New Jersey income taxes (if any)
for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 in spite of losses being carried forward.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. Long-lived assets (excluding financial
instruments and deferred tax assets) and certain identifiable intangibles to be
held and used are reviewed by us for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant
decrease in the market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or
manner in which an asset is used or a significant physical change in an asset,
a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that
could affect the value of an asset, or an adverse action or assessment by a
regulator. If a review for recoverability is necessary, we estimate the future
cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. In performing these
estimates, we group our assets at the lowest level for which there are
identifiable cash flows. If the sum of the expected future cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of
the asset, an impairment loss is not recognized. Otherwise, an impairment loss
is not recognized. Any impairment loss recognized is measured as excess of
carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the asset.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002

Net sales. Our sales increased to $55.0 million for fiscal 2003, a 15% increase
over sales of $47.8 million for fiscal 2002. This increase in sales is the
result of higher shipments of cargo hooks and weapons handling equipment for
military and civil agencies, as well as increases in sales of spare parts,
repair and overhaul of equipment already in the field and the initial shipments
of our HLU-196 Bomb Hoist to the U.S. Navy. The HLU-196 Bomb Hoist is a newly
developed product for which we are under contract to the U.S. Navy to deliver
approximately 550 units through fiscal 2004.

Gross profit. Gross profit increased 18% to $24.6 million for fiscal 2003 from
$20.9 million for fiscal 2002. Generally, repair and overhaul services and spare
parts sales have higher gross margins than sales of new equipment or engineering
services. As a result of a sales mix that was more heavily weighted in favor of
aftermarket sales due to the timing of customer orders, we recorded slightly
higher gross margins for fiscal 2003. These improvements in product mix,
combined with fixed-cost absorption on a generally higher sales volume led to an
increase in gross margin to 44.7% in fiscal 2003 from 43.7% in fiscal 2002.
These margin improvements from product mix, however, were partially offset by
lower than normal gross margins on the HLU-196 Bomb Hoist, a product that was
shipped for the first time during the third quater of fiscal 2003. While the
gross margins recognized on the initial shipments of the HLU-196 were lower than
historical gross margins, they were higher than the budgeted gross margins due
to the realization of manufacturing efficiencies not originally expected in the
initial production lots. As a result of the lower gross margins experienced on
the HLU-196, we expect future gross margins to be lower than those historically
reported. Generally, we cannot predict changes in our product mix between
aftermarket sales and new equipment sales for any given period because the
changes result primarily from the timing of our customers' orders, over which we
have little control.

General, administrative and selling expenses. General, administrative and
selling expenses increased 4.7% to $17.6 million in fiscal 2003 from $16.8
million in fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to higher general,
administrative and selling expenses due to our higher sales volume and a
significant increase in the cost of aircraft product liability insurance, the
write-off of $0.7 million of costs associated with our efforts to restructure
the balance sheet, and a provision of $0.4 million associated with a product
liability claim from a business sold several years ago offset by $1.2 million on
a 14% reduction in corporate office expense. The decrease in corporate office
expenses during fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the restructuring of the
corporate office that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.

Operating income. Operating income increased 71% to $7.0 million in fiscal 2003
from $4.1 million in fiscal 2002. This increase mainly was due to a more
favorable mix of repair, overhaul and spare parts business, a higher sales
volume, the benefit of spreading fixed costs over a larger sales volume, and the
reduction in corporate office expenses.

Interest expense. Interest expense increased $4.2 million to $9.2 million in
fiscal 2003 from $4.9 million in fiscal 2002 as a result of the allocation
formula we use to apportion interest expense between continuing and discontinued
operations. We base this allocation formula upon the net asset balances
attributable to continuing and discontinued operations. Total interest expense
for fiscal 2003 decreased $9.6 million to $15.4 million from $25.1 million for
fiscal 2002 due to the retirement of debt with the proceeds from divestitures
and other internally generated sources of cash. Assets held for sale also were
reduced substantially, however, causing a higher percentage of assets to be
allocated to continuing operations in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002, which
resulted in an increased allocation of interest expense to continuing operations
in fiscal

2003 ANNUAL REPORT                                                            23
<PAGE>

2003. The sale of our Norco subsidiary in February 2003 completed our
divestiture program and, accordingly, all interest expense will be charged to
continuing operations in the futures.

Forbearance fees. During fiscal 2003, we incurred an expense of $0.8 million for
forbearance fees we paid to our lenders under our prior senior credit agreement
in exchange for their agreement not to pursue any actions against us for
violating certain financial covenants. In fiscal 2002, we incurred $2.7 million
of such expenses. The reduction in these expenses was the result of lower
overall levels of debt during the current fiscal year and the refinancing of our
prior senior credit agreement in August 2002, which cured all defaults and ended
the forbearance agreements.

Corporate office restructuring charge. In fiscal 2003 we recognized a $2.7
million charge associated with severance and other costs related to the
elimination of several positions and restructuring in our corporate office, 90%
of which will be paid by the end of the first quarter of 2004. In fiscal 2002,
we recognized a $1.6 million charge associated with the restructuring of our
corporate office, related primarily to severance costs following the elimination
of several positions, all of which amounts have been paid.

Unrealized gain on warrants. As we discuss in note 6 to the financial statements
included in this report, the warrants associated with our senior subordinated
notes due 2005 are now deemed to be derivative financial instruments for
purposes of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As required by those
principles, changes in the value of our share price between August 7, 2002 and
the end of fiscal 2003 resulted in our recognizing a non-cash, non-taxable gain
of $2.0 million during fiscal 2003. We recognized no similar gain or loss in
fiscal 2002. As the put feature of the warrants will expire during the first
quarter of fiscal 2004, no future gains or losses on the warrants will be
recognized.

Net income. We earned net income of $9.2 million in fiscal 2003, versus a loss
of $71.8 million in fiscal 2002, which primarily resulted from the reasons
discussed above.

New orders. New orders received in fiscal 2003 totaled $67.3 million, which
represents a 28% increase from new orders of $52.4 million in fiscal 2002. The
rescue hoist and cargo winch product line were particularly strong accounting
for $14.3 million of the increase. We derived a significant portion of fiscal
2003 orders from long-term contracts. Generally, new equipment sales are the
subject of high-value, long-term contracts, while repair, overhaul and spare
parts sales have much shorter lead times and a less predictable order pattern.

Backlog. Backlog at March 31,2003 was $46.2 million, up $12.4 million from $33.8
million at March 31,2002. We measure backlog by the amount of products or
services that our customers have committed by contract to purchase from us as of
a given date. Out book to bill ratio for fiscal 2003 was 1.22, compared to 1.10
for fiscal 2002. Cancellations of purchase orders or reductions of product
quantities in existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our
backlog. Therefore, our backlog may not represent the actual amount of shipments
or sales for any future period.

FISCAL 2002 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001

Net sales. Our sales of $47.8 million for fiscal 2002 were essentially unchanged
from our sales of $47.8 million in fiscal 2001. Although sales remained constant
during the two fiscal years, there was a substantial change in product mix as
sales of new hoist and winches declined during the period and sales of weapons
handling equipment spares increased.

Gross profit. Gross profit increased 4.4% to $20.9 million for fiscal 2002 from
$20.0 million for fiscal 2001. Generally, repair and overhaul services and spare
parts sales have higher gross margins than sales of new equipment or engineering
services. Due to the timing of customer orders, our sales mix was more heavily
weighted in favor of aftermarket and spare parts sales in fiscal 2002, which
resulted in a 44.4% gross margin during fiscal 2002, compared to 40.7% in fiscal
2001.

General, administrative and selling expenses. General, administrative and
selling expenses decreased 16.6% to $16.8 million in fiscal 2002 from $20.2
million in fiscal 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a 32.5% decrease in
corporate office expenses to $8.5 million in fiscal 2002 from $12.6 million in
fiscal 2001. The decrease in corporate office expenses during fiscal 2002 was
primarily due to the restructuring of our corporate office during fiscal 2002.

Income from operations. Income from operations increased $4.2 million to $4.1
million in fiscal 2002 from a loss from operations of $0.1 million in fiscal
2001. This increase was mainly due to the $4.1 million reduction in corporate
office expenses during the period and a more favorable mix of repair, overhaul
and spare parts business that resulted in higher gross margins in fiscal 2002.

Interest expense. Interest expense increased $2.1 million in fiscal 2002 from
the prior year as a result of the allocation formula we use to apportion
interest expense between continuing and discontinued operations. This formula is
based upon the net asset balances attributable to continuing and discontinued
operations. Total interest expense for fiscal 2002 decreased $9.3 million due to
the retirement of debt with the proceeds from divestitures and other internally
generated sources of cash. Assets held for sale also were substantially reduced,
however, causing a higher percentage of assets to be allocated to continuing
operations in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001, which resulted in an
increased allocation of interest expense to fiscal 2002.

Interest and other income. In March 2002, we sold excess real estate and
recorded a pre-tax gain of $1.3 million.

Forbearance fees. During fiscal 2002, we incurred $2.7 million of costs related
to forbearance fees we paid to our lenders under our prior senior credit
agreement in association with their agreement not to pursue any actions against
us for violating certain financial covenants. In fiscal 2001, we incurred no
such charges.

Corporate office restructuring. In fiscal year 2002, we recognized a $1.6
million charge associated with the restructuring of our corporate office,
primarily due to severance costs resulting from the reduction of our corporate
office staff from twenty four to nine. In fiscal 2001 we recognized a corporate
office

24                                                   TRANSTECHNOLOGY CORPORATION
<PAGE>

restructuring charge of $11.2 million, which included costs associated with the
elimination of certain positions as well as write-offs associated with
uncollectible notes receivable and worthless investments in companies that had
been divested in previous fiscal years and the write-down to net realizable
value of certain parcels of real estate.

Net loss. Net loss decreased 1.6% to $71.8 million in fiscal 2002 from $73.0
million in fiscal 2001, primarily as a result of the reasons discussed above.

New orders. New orders received in fiscal 2002 totaled $52.4 million, which
represents a 23.3% increase in new orders from $42.5 million in fiscal 2001. We
experienced this significant increase in new orders due to an increase in orders
for spare parts for our hoist and winch product line and initial orders for our
newly developed HLU-196 Bomb Hoist. A significant portion of fiscal 2002 new
orders were from long-term contracts. Generally, new equipment sales are the
subject of high-value, long-term contracts, while repair, overhaul and spare
parts sales have much shorter lead times and a less predictable order pattern.

Backlog. Backlog at March 31, 2002 was $33.8 million, compared to $29.2 million
at March 31, 2001. The backlog increased as a result of the significant increase
in new orders received during fiscal 2002, most of which were scheduled for
shipment in fiscal 2003 and beyond. Our book to bill ratio for fiscal 2002 was
1.10 compared to 0.89 for fiscal 2001. The book to bill ratio increased in
fiscal 2002 as a result of the increase in new orders received as discussed in
the paragraph immediately above. Cancellations of purchase orders or reductions
of product quantities in existing contracts could substantially and materially
reduce our backlog. Therefore, our backlog may not represent the actual amount
of shipments or sales for any future period.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our liquidity requirements depend on a number of factors, many of which are
beyond our control, including the timing of production under our long-term
contracts with the U.S. Government. Although we have infrequently received
payments on these government contracts based on performance milestones, as is
the case with our contract with the U.S. Navy for the HLU-196 Bomb Hoist, our
working capital needs fluctuate between periods as a result of changes in
program status and the timing of payments by program. Additionally, as our sales
are generally made on the basis of individual purchase orders, our liquidity
requirements vary based on the timing and volume of these orders.

Our restructuring and divestiture program has had a substantial impact upon our
financial condition through March 31, 2003, as we reduced debt with the proceeds
from the divestitures and lowered costs as a result of the corporate office
restructuring. At March 31, 2003, there was no indebtedness outstanding under
our Senior Credit Facility, as compared to $29.1 million outstanding under our
prior senior credit agreement at the beginning of fiscal 2003.

On January 3, 2003, we completed the sale of the business and substantially all
of the assets of our wholly-owned subsidiary, TCR Corporation, for $10.0 million
in cash. We used the net proceeds of the sale to repay borrowings outstanding
under our new senior credit agreement. In addition, on February 24, 2003, we
completed the sale of the business and substantially all of the assets of our
subsidiary, Norco Inc., for $51.0 million in cash which was used to reduce the
senior debt to zero and partially repay the subordinated debt.

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has notified us that the company has fallen
below the NYSE continued listing standards requiring total market capitalization
of not less than $50 million over a 30-day trading period and total
stockholders' equity of not less than $50 million. We will be submitting to the
NYSE a plan to comply with the listing standards. If the NYSE accepts the plan,
we will be subject to quarterly monitoring for compliance with the plan goals
and targets. If the NYSE does not accept the plan, we will be subject to
delisting from the NYSE. In the event of delisting from the NYSE, we believe an
alternate trading venue would be available.

WORKING CAPITAL

Our working capital at March 31, 2003, was $11.2 million, compared to $13.8
million (excluding assets and liabilities of business units to be sold) at the
beginning of fiscal 2003. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was
1.4 to 1.0 at March 31, 2003, compared to 1.6 to 1.0 at the beginning of fiscal
2003.

Working capital changes during fiscal 2003, exclusive of assets held for sale,
resulted from a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.1 million, an increase in
inventories of $2.8 million, an increase in prepaid expenses of $0.4 million,
and a reduction in income tax refunds receivable of $7.2 million. The decrease
in accounts receivable was due to strong collection efforts in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003. The increase in inventory was largely due to the
purchase of long lead time materials and the manufacture of work in progress
needed to fulfill customers' long-term purchase orders, in particular with
regard the HLU-196 Bomb Hoist. The increase in prepaid expenses was due
primarily to the payment of deposits and other advance payments that will be
utilized in less than twelve months. The income tax receivable was reduced as a
result of the receipt of federal and state income tax refunds associated with
the carrying back of our fiscal 2002 operating loss. The number of days that
sales were outstanding in accounts receivable decreased to 31.8 days at March
31, 2003, from 42.8 days at March 31, 2002. Inventory turnover changed only
slightly, to 1.55 turns from 1.59 turns over the same time period. Current
liabilities, exclusive of liabilities associated with discontinued operations,
increased $4.1 million, primarily due to accrued state income taxes relating to
the sale of Norco Inc., and payments due to the corporate office restructuring.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

Our capital expenditures were $0.6 million for fiscal 2003, compared to $0.2
million for fiscal 2002. Projects budgeted in fiscal 2003 include refurbishment
of the offices and the initial phase of installing a new ERP system.

2003 ANNUAL REPORT                                                            25
<PAGE>

In fiscal 2004, capital expenditures are expected to be in a range of $1.1-1.4
million.

SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY

At March 31, 2003, we had a senior credit facility consisting of a $13.5
million, asset-based, revolving credit facility which was established in August
2002 to refinance all remaining obligations outstanding under the Fleet Credit
Facility (the "New Senior Credit Facility"). The New Senior Credit Facility, as
amended June 2, 2003 and which matures August 7, 2005, is secured by all of our
assets, carries an interest rate of 5.25% and contains customary financial
covenants and events of default. We are in compliance with the provisions of the
facility. Subject to limitations relating to levels of certain assets and
reserves for future interest payments, we have unused borrowing capacity on the
facility of $13.5 million as there were no borrowings outstanding under the
facility at March 31, 2003.

SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES

On August 30, 2000, we completed a private placement of $75 million of senior
subordinated notes (the "Notes") and warrants to purchase shares of our common
stock (the "Warrants") to a group of institutional investors (collectively, the
"Purchasers"). We used the proceeds of the private placement to retire, in full,
a $75 million bridge loan held by a group of lenders led by Fleet National Bank.
The Notes, as amended in August 2002, are due on August 29, 2005 and bear
interest at a rate of 18% per annum subject to adjustments described below,
consisting of 13% cash interest on principal, payable quarterly, and 5% interest
on principal, payable quarterly in "payment-in-kind" ("PIK") promissory notes.
We may prepay the Notes after August 29, 2001, at a premium initially of 9%,
declining to 5%, 3%, and 1% on each of the next succeeding anniversaries of that
date. The Notes contain customary financial covenants and events of default,
including a cross-default provision to our senior debt obligations. At March 31,
2003, the principal balance outstanding on the notes amounted to $53.3 million,
which included the original principal amount plus the "payment-in-kind" notes
less approximately $28.0 million paid off at the time of the sale of Norco, Inc.
At March 31, 2003, we were in compliance with the provisions of the Notes.

At issuance, the Warrants entitled the Purchasers to acquire, in the aggregate,
427, 602 shares, or approximately 7%, of our common stock at an exercise price
of $9.93 a share. This exercise price represents the average daily closing price
of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the thirty (30) days
preceding the completion of the private placement. The Warrants must be
exercised by August 29, 2010.

Effective with the refinancing of our prior senior credit agreement with the New
Senior Credit Facility on August 7, 2002, the purchasers of the senior
subordinated notes agreed to amend the notes. Under the amended senior
subordinated notes, we paid an amendment fee equal to 1% of the outstanding
balance of the notes by issuing additional notes and agreed to increase the PIK
interest rate on the notes to 5% effective January 1, 2003, with such rate
increasing 0.25% each quarter until we retire the notes. Additionally, we
amended the terms of the warrants to reduce the exercise price of each warrant
to provide the holders with a minimum profit on the exercise of the warrants
equal to $5.00 per share if the warrants were exercised and sold prior to
December 31, 2002. Because we did not redeem the warrants prior to December 31,
2002, their exercise price was reduced to $0.01 per share as of that date. In
addition, the amended warrants contain a "put" right that allows the holders to
cause us to purchase the warrants at a price of $5.00 per underlying share up to
120 days following the occurrence of certain "liquidity events." The sale of the
Norco, Inc. subsidiary constituted a liquidity event and, accordingly, under the
terms of the warrants, as amended, through June 24, 2003, the holders have the
right to require us to redeem the warrants or repurchase the stock acquired
through the exercise of the warrants at a price equal to $5.00 per share. The
maximum cash exposure related to these warrants and their put rights, if any, is
the $2.1 million that would be required to redeem the unexercised warrants or
the underlying shares. The $1.3 million of redeemable common stock reflected on
the balance sheet, represents the $5.00 per share put price on that portion of
the warrants (approximately 257,000 shares of common stock) which have been
exercised by the holders of the warrants. Upon the expiration of the put right,
any amount of redeemable common stock for which the put right was not exercised
will be used to increase additional paid in capital.

At March 31, 2003, we recorded a $2.0 million non-cash, non-taxable gain
relating to the mark-to-market accounting of the warrants as a derivative. Since
the put right attached to the warrants will expire during the first quarter of
fiscal 2004, no further gains or losses relating to the warrants will be
recorded.

We have long-term debt maturities of $79 thousand, $53.4 million and $79
thousand in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.

Our operations require significant amounts of cash, and we may be required to
seek additional capital, whether from selling equity or borrowing money, for the
future growth and development of our business or to fund our operations and
inventory, particularly in the event of a market downturn. Although currently we
have the ability to borrow additional sums under the revolving portion of our
senior credit facility, this facility contains a borrowing base provision and
financial covenants which may limit the amount we can borrow under our senior
credit facility or from other sources. Also, we may not be able to replace or
renew our senior credit facility upon its expiration on terms that are favorable
to us. In addition, a number of factors could affect our ability to access debt
or equity financing, including our financial strength and credit rating, the
financial market's confidence in our management team and financial reporting,
general economic conditions, the conditions in the defense and aerospace
industries and overall capital market conditions.

Even if available, additional financing could be costly or have adverse
consequences. If we raise additional funds by issuing stock, dilution to
stockholders may result. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt, we will
incur increased debt servicing costs and may become subject to additional
restrictive financial and other covenants. We can give no assurance as to the
terms or availability of additional capital. If we were not successful in
obtaining sufficient capital, it could reduce

our sales and earnings and adversely impact our financial position and we may
not be able to expand or operate our business as planned.

TAX BENEFITS FROM NET OPERATING LOSSES

At March 31,2003, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or
NOLs, of approximately $52.3 million and $73.9 million, respectively, which are
due to expire in 2004 through 2023.These NOLs may be used to offset future
taxable income through their respective expiration dates and thereby reduce or
eliminate our federal and state income taxes otherwise payable. The internal
Revenue Code of 1986,as amended (the "Code") imposes significant limitations on
the utilization of NOLs in the event of an "ownership change" as defined under
section 382 of the Code (the "Section 382 Limitation").The Section 382
Limitation is an annual limitation on the amount of pre-ownership NOLs that a
corporation may use to offset its post-ownership change income. The section 382
Limitation is calculated by multiplying the value of a corporation's stock
immediately before an ownership change by the long-term tax-exempt rate (as
published by the Internal Revenue Service). Generally, an ownership change
occurs with respect to a corporation if the aggregate increase in the percentage
of stock ownership by value of that corporation by one or more 5% shareholders
(including specified groups of shareholders who in the aggregate own at least 5%
of that corporation's stock) exceeds 50 percentage points over a three-year
testing period. We believe that we have not gone through an ownership change
that would cause out NOLs to be subject to the Section 382 Limitation.

In addition, we have divested ten businesses since March 31, 2001. Under the
terms of the agreements associated with the sales of those businesses, we have
agreed to indemnify the purchasers for certain damages that might arise in the
event that a representation we made with respect to the divested business is
found to have contained a material misstatement, subject in each case to a
customary cap on the indemnification amount and customary limitations on the
survivability of the representations made. As of the date of this report, we
have unresolved claims for indemnification with respect to these divested
business that aggregate less than $0.5 million. Additionally, the terms of these
divestiture agreements generally require the calculation of purchase price
adjustments based upon the amount of working capital or net assets transferred
at the closing date. In the case of each divestiture completed as of the filling
date, with the exception of the divestiture of Norco, Inc., all purchase price
adjustments have been agreed and paid.

INFLATION

While neither inflation nor deflation has had, and we do not expect it to have,
a material impact upon operating results, we cannot assure you that our business
will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future.

CONTINGENCIES

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS - During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, the
Corporation presented an environmental cleanup plan for a portion of a site in
Pennsylvania which the corporation continues to own although the related
business has been sold. This plan was submitted pursuant to the Consent Order
and Agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
("PaDEP") concluded in fiscal 1999. Pursuant to the Consent Order, upon its
execution the Corporation paid $0.2 million for past costs, future oversight
expenses and in full settlement of claims made by PaDEP related to the
environmental remediation of the site with an additional $0.2 million paid in
fiscal 2001. A second Consent Order was concluded with PaDEP in the third
quarter of fiscal 2001 for another portion of the site, and a third Consent
Order for the reminder of the site was concluded in the third quarter of fiscal
2003. The Corporation is also administering an agreed settlement with the
Federal government under which the government pays 50% of the environmental
response costs associated with a portion of the site. The Corporation has also
reached an agreement in principle with the Federal government and is in the
process of finalizing the necessary documentation under which the Federal
government will pay 45% of the environmental response costs associated with
another portion of the site. At March 31,2003, the Corporation's cleanup reserve
was $2.0 million based on the net present value of future expected cleanup
costs. The Corporation expects that remediation at the Pennsylvania site will
not be completed for several years.

The Corporation also continues to participate in environmental assessments and
remediation work at nine other locations, including former facilities of the
company. The Corporation estimates that its potential cost for implementing
corrective action at these sites will not exceed $0.5 million payable over the
next several years, and has provided for the estimated costs in its accrual for
environmental liabilities. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the
Corporation entered into a consent order for a former facility in New York
pursuant to which it is developing a remediation plan for review and approval by
the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. The Corporation has
established a reserve of $2.5 million which it believes is adequate.

In addition, the Corporation has been named as a potentially responsible party
in eight environmental proceedings pending in several other states in which it
is alleged that the Corporation was a generator of waste that was sent to
landfills and other treatment facilities and, as to several sites, it is alleged
that the Corporation was an owner or operator. Such

<PAGE>

properties generally relate to businesses which have been sold or discontinued.
The Corporation estimates that its expected future costs, and its estimated
proportional share of remedial work to be performed, associated with these
proceedings will not exceed $0.2 million and has provided for these estimated
costs in its accrual for environmental liabilities.

LITIGATION - The Corporation is also engaged in various other legal proceedings
incidental to its business. It is the opinion of management that, after taking
into consideration information furnished by its counsel, the above matters will
have no material effect on the Corporation's consolidated financial position or
the results of the Corporation's operations in future periods.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In May 2003 FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity," that improves
the accounting for certain financial instruments that, under previous guidance,
issuers could account for as equity. SFAS 150 requires that those instruments be
classified as liabilities in statement of financial position. This statement is
effective for the Company's fiscal quarter beginning June 30, 2003. We do not
believe adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial
position or results of operations.

In April 2003, FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" that amends and clarifies
accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under Statement 133.
With certain exceptions, SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designed after June
30, 2003. We do not believe adoption of this standard will have a material
impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities." This interpretation defines when a business
enterprise must consolidate a variable interest entity. This interpretation
applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31,
2003. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June
15, 2003, to entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it
acquired before February 1, 2003. The adoption of this statement is not expected
to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure"
("SFAS 148") which amends SFAS No. 123. This statement provides alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value-based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and amends the disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 123. The transition guidance and disclosure
requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The
adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on our financial
position or results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others." This interpretation requires a guarantor to recognize,
at the inception of the guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the
obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. It also enhances guarantor's
disclosure requirements to be made in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under certain guarantees it has issued. The
initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial
statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. In the
normal course of business, we do not issue guarantees to third parties;
accordingly, this interpretation will not have an effect on our financial
position or results of operations.

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Exit or Disposal
Activities." SFAS 146 requires the recognition of a liability for costs
associated with an exit plan or disposal activity when incurred and nullifies
Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including
Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)," which allowed recognition at the
date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan. The provisions of this statement
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated by us after
December 31, 2002. The adoption of this statement is not anticipated to have a
material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

In April 2002, SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections," was approved by
the FASB. Among other things, this statement requires that gains or losses on
the extinguishment of debt will generally be required to be reported as a
component of income from continuing operations and will no longer be classified
as an extraordinary item. Our financial statements for the periods prior to
March 31, 2001 have been reclassified to include losses previously recorded as
an extraordinary item as a component of income from continuing operations.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations," effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. This
statement addresses the diverse accounting practices for obligations associated
with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs. The adoption of this statement will not have a material effect
on our financial position or results of operations.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to various market risks, primarily changes in interest rates
associated with the New Senior Credit Facility under which there were no
borrowings at March 31, 2003.
