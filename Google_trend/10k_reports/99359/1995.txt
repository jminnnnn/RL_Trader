ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

GENERAL

         TransTechnology Corporation develops, manufacturers and sells a wide
range of products in two industry segments, as described below.
TransTechnology Corporation was originally organized in 1962 as a California
corporation and reincorporated in Delaware in 1986.  Unless the context
otherwise requires, references to the "Company" or the "Registrant" in this
Annual Report refer to TransTechnology Corporation (including the California
corporation prior to the reincorporation) and its consolidated subsidiaries.
The Company's fiscal year ends on March 31.  Accordingly, all references to
years in this report refer to the fiscal year ended March 31 of the indicated
year.

         During 1995, the Company continued its program of focusing on core
businesses by acquiring a company that manufactures retaining rings (Industrial
Retaining Ring Company located in New Jersey), selling the Company's chaff
business (Lundy Technical Center) and reclassifying its computer graphics
service operations and its Electronics division as discontinued operations.
These actions, together with acquisition activities subsequent to the close of
the fiscal year, position the company as a major supplier of specialty
fasteners for the industrial markets.  The only remaining aerospace business is
the Breeze-Eastern division, which manufactures helicopter rescue hoists, cargo
hook systems and cargo tie-down systems.  These changes led to the Company's
decision to retitle its industry segments based upon its current components.
The former "Industrial Products" segment is now entitled "Specialty Fastener
Products" and the former "Aerospace" segment is now entitled "Rescue Hoist and
Cargo Hook Products."

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

         The following entities, discontinued in the years indicated, have been
classified as discontinued operations in the Company's financial statements:
Federal Laboratories (tear gas) (1994), the Lundy Technical Center (chaff)
(1995), TransTechnology Electronics and Electronic Connections and Assemblies,
Inc. (cables, connectors and wire harness) (1995), and TransTechnology Systems
& Services (computer maintenance and service) (1995).  For a more detailed
description of these transactions, see "Note 2" of the "Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements."  See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations."


SPECIALTY FASTENER PRODUCTS

         The Company's specialty fastener products are manufactured by its
Breeze Industrial Products division ("Breeze Industrial"), its Palnut Company
division and its Industrial Retaining Ring subsidiary.  Breeze Industrial
designs and manufactures a diverse line of high-quality stainless steel hose
clamps including worm drive hose clamps, T-Bolt and V-Band clamps, and light
duty clamps for the appliance and hardware markets.  These clamps are widely
used in the heavy-duty vehicle, industrial, automotive and aircraft industries
by both original equipment manufacturers and replacement suppliers.  Breeze
Industrial's clamp products are sold to distributors and to industrial
manufacturers that require engineered products for specific applications.  The
Palnut Company manufactures single and multi-thread metal fasteners for the
automotive and industrial products industries.  These include lock nuts used
for load carrying in light duty assemblies





                                       1
<PAGE>   3
or as a supplement to ordinary nuts to assure tightness; the On-Sert fastener,
which is pressed onto hollow plastic bosses to increase torque and minimize
stripping; Pushnuts used as temporary fasteners that hold pre-inserted bolts in
place for final assembly or in ratchet plates which fasten onto a shaft or
stud; self-threaders used in the installation of automotive trim; U-Nuts that
provide one-sided screw assembly and are used to fasten bumpers, fenders and
grills to vehicles; and various single-threaded parts designed for insertion
into metal or plastic panels.  Effective August 31, 1994 the Company acquired
all of the outstanding capital stock of Industrial Retaining Ring Company and
its affiliated companies for a total purchase price of $14.8 million in cash
and the assumption of liabilities.  Industrial Retaining Ring manufactures
retaining rings used in heavy equipment and industrial machinery.

         Specialty fasteners are marketed through a combination of a direct
sales force, distributors and manufacturing representatives.  Such products
contributed 70%, 64% and 45% of the Company's consolidated sales from
continuing operations in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

         Through its MassTech product line, Breeze Industrial also manufactures
tachometers and related items such as speed sensors that are used to measure
rotational shaft speeds and direction, and to indicate revolutions per minute.
These products are sold to heavy-duty original equipment manufacturers and in
the military and high-performance markets.

         At March 31, 1995, the Company's Specialty Fastener Products segment
backlog was $12.7 million, compared to $9.5 million at March 31, 1994.  The
increase is primarily the result of the acquisition of Industrial Retaining
Ring.  Substantially all of the March 31, 1995 backlog is scheduled to be
shipped during fiscal 1996.


RESCUE HOIST AND CARGO HOOK PRODUCTS

         The Company's Breeze-Eastern division ("Breeze-Eastern") specializes
in the design, development and manufacture of sophisticated lifting and
restraining products, principally helicopter rescue hoists, reeling machines
and external hook systems.  In addition, Breeze-Eastern designs, develops and
manufactures winches and hoists for aircraft cargo and weapon-handling systems
with applications ranging from cargo handling on fixed-wing aircraft to
positioning television cameras on blimps, antenna and gear drives.  Management
believes that Breeze-Eastern is the industry market share leader in sales of
personnel-rescue hoists and cargo hook equipment.  As a pioneer of helicopter
hoist technology, Breeze-Eastern continues to develop sophisticated helicopter
hoist systems, including systems for the current generation of Seahawk,
Chinook, Dolphin, Merlin and Super Stallion helicopters.  Breeze-Eastern also
supplies equipment for the United States, Japanese and European Multiple-Launch
Rocket Systems which use two specialized hoists to load and unload rocket pod
containers.  Breeze-Eastern's external cargo-lift hook systems are original
equipment on most helicopters manufactured today.  These hook systems range
from small 1,000-pound capacity models up to the largest 36,000-pound capacity
hooks employed on the Super Stallion helicopter.  Breeze-Eastern also
manufactures aircraft and cargo tie-downs and electronic control boxes and
components for helicopter tow boom assemblies for helicopters employed in Navy
minesweeping operations.

         Breeze-Eastern sells its products through an internal marketing
representative and several independent sales representatives and distributors.
Breeze-Eastern's product lines contributed 30%, 36% and 55% to the Company's
consolidated sales in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The declining
percentage is attributable





                                       2
<PAGE>   4
primarily to disposition of the chaff business, the reclassification of the
Electronics division as a discontinued operation and the acquisitions of
fastener businesses (Palnut and Industrial Retaining Ring).

         The Rescue Hoist and Cargo Hook Product segment backlog varies
substantially from time to time due to the size and timing of orders.  At March
31, 1995, the backlog of unfilled orders was $21.8 million, compared to $21.4
million at March 31, 1994.  The majority of the March 31, 1995 backlog is
anticipated to be shipped during fiscal 1996.


DEFENSE INDUSTRY SALES

         Only 18% of the Company's revenues in 1995, as compared to 23% and 28%
in 1994 and 1993,  respectively, were derived from sales to the United States
Government, principally the military services of the Department of Defense and
its prime contractors.  These contracts typically contain precise performance
specifications and are subject to customary provisions which give the United
States Government the contractual right of termination for convenience.  In the
event of termination for convenience, however, the Company is typically
protected by provisions allowing reimbursement for costs incurred as well as
payment of any applicable fees or profits.  With overall defense spending down,
it is expected that the defense market for the Company's products will decline
in the future.  However, the overall reduction in the Company's dependence on
these products renders it less vulnerable to defense budget cuts.


ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         Due primarily to Federal and State legislation which imposes
liability, regardless of fault, upon commercial product manufacturers for
environmental harm caused by chemicals, processes and practices that were
commonly and lawfully used prior to the enactment of such legislation, the
Company may be liable for all or a portion of the environmental clean-up costs
at sites previously owned or leased by the Company (or corporations acquired by
the Company).  The Company's contingencies associated with environmental
matters are described in Item 3 "Legal Proceedings," and Note 10 of Notes to
Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof.


COMPETITION

         The Company's businesses compete in some markets with entities that
are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources
than the Company.  Generally, competitive factors include design capabilities,
product performance and delivery and price.  The Company's ability to compete
successfully in such markets will depend on its ability to develop and apply
technological innovations and to expand its customer base and product lines.
The Company is successfully doing so both internally and through acquisitions.
There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully
compete in any or all of the businesses discussed above.  The failure of the
Company to compete in more than one of these businesses could have a material
and adverse effect on the Company's profitability.





                                       3
<PAGE>   5
RAW MATERIALS

         The various components and raw materials used by the Company to
produce its products are generally available from more than one source.  In
those instances where only a single source for any material is available, most
of such items can generally be redesigned to accommodate materials made by
other suppliers.  In some cases, the Company stocks an adequate supply of the
single source materials for use until a new supplier can be approved.  No
material part of the Company's business is dependent upon a single supplier or
a few suppliers the loss of which would have a materially adverse effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position.


EMPLOYEES

         As of May 30, 1995 the Company employed 1,014 persons.  There were 495
employees associated with the Specialty Fastener Products segment, 173 with the
Rescue Hoist and Cargo Hook Products segment, 16 with the corporate office and
330 employees associated with operations classified as discontinued.


FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

         Financial information relating to each of the Company's segments has
been included in Note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements included in Item 8
hereof.


FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND SALES

         The Company's only foreign-based facilities during fiscal 1995
consisted of businesses that are  treated as discontinued operations as of
March 31, 1995.  The Company had export sales of $15.4 million, $14.9 million
and $10.2 million in fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively,  representing
15%, 18% and 16% of the Company's consolidated sales from continuing operations
in each of those years, respectively.  The risk and profitability attendant to
these sales are generally comparable to similar products sold in the United
States.  The acquisition of the business of AB SKF's Seeger companies will
significantly increase the Company's foreign operations and sales, with
manufacturing facilities located in Germany, England and Brazil.  (See the last
paragraph of "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Item 7, "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.") 
Sales, profits and identifiable assets attributable to the Company's combined
foreign and domestic operations, and the identification of export sales by
geographic area, are set forth in Note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements in
Item 8 hereof.

</TABLE>


         The Company believes that such facilities are suitable and adequate
for the Company's foreseeable needs and that additional space, if necessary,
will be available.  The Company continues to own or lease property that it no
longer needs in its operations.  These properties are located in California,
Florida, Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois and North Carolina.  In some
instances, the properties are leased or subleased and in nearly all instances
these properties are for sale.


ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         The Company has commenced environmental site assessments and cleanup
feasibility studies to determine the presence, extent and sources of any
environmental contamination at sites in Pennsylvania and Illinois which
continue to be owned although the related businesses have been sold or are
expected to be sold during fiscal 1996.  Although no governmental action
requiring remediation has been taken at this time, the Company is working in
cooperation with the relevant state authorities and any remedial work required
to be performed would be subject to state regulatory approval.  At the
Pennsylvania sites, a feasibility study has been prepared and submitted to the
state.  Based upon that study and upon claims for recovery which the Company
has against others, a pre-tax charge of $3.6 million (net of $1.2 million in
probable recoveries from third parties) was recorded in March 1993 for future
cleanup costs at the Pennsylvania sites.  In addition, the Company is pursuing
recovery of a portion of clean-up costs in litigation with several of its
insurance





                                       5
<PAGE>   7
carriers.  The Company expects that remediation work at the Pennsylvania site
will not be completed until fiscal 1999.

         In addition, the Company has been named as a potentially responsible
party in various environmental remediation recovery proceedings pending in
several other states in which it is alleged that the Company was a generator of
waste that was sent to landfills and other treatment facilities and, as to
several sites, it is alleged that the Company was an owner or operator.  Such
properties generally relate to businesses which have been sold or discontinued.
It is not possible to reasonably estimate the costs associated with any
remedial work to be performed until the studies at the Illinois site and these
other sites have been completed, the scope of work defined and a method of
remediation selected and approved by the relevant state authorities.
Management believes that the Company's potential liability with respect to such
remediation will not have any material adverse effect on the Company.

         In 1990, a lawsuit was brought in Los Angeles Superior Court against
the Company and certain of its former officers by Special Devices, Inc.
("Special Devices"), a landlord at one of the Company's former California
facilities, and Placerita Land and Farming Company, a predecessor of Special
Devices, in which plaintiffs sought to recover in excess of $15.0 million for
compensatory damages and an unspecified sum for punitive damages.  The
plaintiffs alleged that the Company's waste handling practices  diminished the
value of the leased property, reduced future rental income and caused
plaintiffs to incur substantial defense costs in connection with related legal
proceedings.  This action was settled in May 1995 with the Company paying $2.8
million in exchange for title to the subject real estate and a release of all
claims.  The Company recorded in discontinued operations a loss of $1.3
million, in fiscal 1995, based on the appraised value of the property.  In
November 1985, the Company entered into agreements with the California
Department of Health Services obligating the Company to clean up soil and
groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials on this property.
Substantially all of the remedial work has been performed, with ongoing
monitoring and water treatment activity expected to continue until 2002.

         Two of the Company's general liability insurance carriers filed
actions in California Superior Court asking the Court to determine that their
policies do not cover California environmental cleanup costs, damages to
neighboring landowners for alleged personal injury and property damage, and
related defense costs.  The Company then brought counterclaims against other
insurance carriers who had refused to contribute to defense and settlement
costs for these matters.  The Company has settled these cases by the payment of
$350,000 to one of the carriers and the collection of an aggregate $846,500 on
its counterclaims from the other carriers.

         The Company is also engaged in various other legal proceedings
incidental to its business all of which are immaterial to the Company's
operations.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         The Company's fiscal year ends on March 31.  Accordingly, all
references to years in this Management's Discussion refer to the fiscal year
ended March 31 of the indicated year.  Also when referred to herein, operating
profit means net sales less operating expenses, without deduction for general
corporate expenses, interest and income taxes.  The Consolidated Statement of
Operations has been restated with respect to discontinued operations to provide
a consistent basis for comparing the performance of the Company's continuing
operations for the years presented.

         Revenue from continuing operations in 1995 was $102.7 million, an
increase of $19.8 million or 24% from 1994, compared with a $18.2 million or
28% increase from 1993 to 1994.  Gross profit in 1995 increased $5.8 million or
23% from 1994, compared with an increase of $5.0 million or 25% from 1993 to
1994.  Operating profit from continuing operations for 1995 was $16.7 million,
an increase of $2.9 million or 21% from 1994, compared with an increase of $2.3
million or 20% from 1993 to 1994. Changes in sales, operating profit and new
orders from continuing operations are discussed below by segment, and
additional information regarding industry segments is contained in Note 12 of
the Notes to Financial Statements.

         Net income, including discontinued operations, for 1995 was $2.5
million or $.50 per share, compared to $6.9 million or $1.34 per share in 1994.
These changes in net income were affected both by operating profit, as
discussed in the Business Segment sections below, and by discontinued
operations, as discussed in the Discontinued Operations section below.  Net
loss from discontinued operations, including disposal losses,  was $4.9 million
or $.95 in 1995 and accounted for net income of $1.1 million or $.21 per share
in 1994.

         In the fourth quarter of 1995 the Company sold primarily all of the
assets and business of its chaff products operation and recorded a pre-tax loss
of $0.6 million as discussed below in the Discontinued Operations section.  In
August, 1994 the Company acquired Industrial Retaining Ring Company as
discussed below in the Acquisitions section and the Business Segment section.

         In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company recorded a reduction of
$0.8 million of Federal income tax provisions.  Also in the fourth quarter of
1994 the Company sold its tear gas division and recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.7
million as discussed below in the discontinued operations section.  In August,
1993 the Company acquired the Palnut fastener division and the Electrical
Specialties Company as discussed below in the Acquisitions section and the
Business Segment sections.

         In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge
of $3.6 million to provide for estimated future site remediation  costs at two
facilities located in Pennsylvania.  Also during 1993, the Company reflected
pre-tax charges of $0.8 million for proxy solicitation and related legal
expenses associated with the contested election of directors.  The Company
accrued or reimbursed the expenses for both slates of directors in connection
with the solicitation of proxies for the September 1992 annual meeting of
stockholders.  These charges were offset in the fourth quarter of 1993 by the
settlement of a contract termination claim for a pre-tax profit of $1.9
million and a fourth quarter reduction of $1.9 million of federal and state
income tax provisions.





                                       9
<PAGE>   11
         Fiscal 1993 results were impacted by a pre-tax charge of $0.5 million
for the final costs of downsizing the corporate staff and relocating corporate
headquarters from California to New Jersey.

         Interest expense increased $1.7 million in 1995 primarily as a result
of increased bank borrowings used for the acquisition of Industrial Retaining
Ring Company, as discussed below in the Liquidity and Capital Resources
section, and higher interest rates on the Company's debt in fiscal 1995 due to
increases in the prime interest rate throughout the year.  Interest expense
increased $1.0 million from 1993 to 1994 primarily as a result of increased
bank borrowings used for the acquisitions of Palnut and Electrical Specialties
Company.

         New orders received during 1995 by continuing operations totaled
$104.5 million, an increase of $17.1 million or 20% from 1994.  New orders
received during 1994 by continuing operations totaled $87.3 million, an
increase of $27.6 million or 46% from 1993.  New orders are discussed below by
industry segment.  At March 31, 1995, total backlog of unfilled orders was
$34.4 million, compared to $30.9 million and $25.8 million at March 31, 1994
and 1993, respectively.

         During 1994 two new accounting standards were adopted effective April
1, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.  106 and No. 109.  Statement
No. 106, related to post-retirement benefits other than pensions, resulted in a
pre-tax charge to income of $0.4 million in 1994, while Statement No. 109,
related to income taxes, had no material effect on 1994 earnings.  The
corporation's liquidity and cash flow were not affected by these accounting
changes.

         In March 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 115, related to accounting for certain investments in debt and
equity securities.  Adoption of this statement resulted in  a gross unrealized
holding loss of $1.6 million, reported as a reduction to stockholders' equity
in the March 31, 1994 balance sheet.


ACQUISITIONS

         Effective August 31, 1994, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
capital stock of Industrial Retaining Ring Company and its affiliated companies
for a total purchase price of $14.8 million in cash and the assumption of
liabilities.  Industrial Retaining Ring Company manufactures retaining rings
and clips used primarily in the heavy equipment and industrial machinery
industries.  Sales on an annual basis approximate $9 million.

         On July 28, 1993, the Company acquired the assets and business of
Electrical Specialties Company for a total purchase price of $1.7 million in
cash.  Electrical Specialties Company manufactures electrical cables and wire
harnesses for the heavy equipment industry.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal
1995 this product line, which is located at the TransTechnology Electronics
division, was classified with discontinued operations.

         On August 2, 1993, the Company acquired substantially all of the
assets of the Palnut fastener operation ("Palnut") of TRW Inc. for a total
purchase price of $20.5 million in cash and the assumption of certain
liabilities consisting primarily of trade payables and accrued expenses
aggregating approximately





                                       10
<PAGE>   12
$1.4 million.  The Palnut operation manufactures single and multi-thread metal
fasteners, for the automotive and industrial products industries.  Sales on an
annual basis approximate $29 million.


DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

         In March 1995, the Company sold substantially all of the assets and
business of its chaff products operation for $6.7 million in cash.  The sale of
this operation resulted in an after-tax disposal loss of $0.4 million.  The
Company retained the chaff avionics product line and negotiated its sale
separately in May 1995.  Also, in March 1995, the Company discontinued and is
negotiating the sale of its computer graphics service operations which operate
under the name TransTechnology Systems & Services, and its Electronics
division, which includes Electronic Connections and Assemblies, Inc.  The
domestic portion of the computer graphics service operations was sold in June
1995.

         In March 1994, the Company sold its Federal Laboratories division for
$1.0 million in cash, $1.2 million in notes receivable and 465,000 shares of
Mace Security International, Inc. Common stock.  The sale of this division
resulted in a after-tax gain of $0.5 million.  Additional after-tax disposal
costs of $0.5 million were recorded in 1995 in connection with the sale.

         During 1992, the Company adopted a restructuring plan which provided
for the sale of its Financial Systems,  Gessner , Lloyd and  Belfort
divisions, and the discontinuance of its Computer Graphics manufacturing
operation.  At March 31, 1992, the Company had completed the sale of its
Financial Systems division, and had classified all of these businesses for
financial reporting purposes as discontinued operations.  On May 29, 1992, and
June 4, 1992, the Company completed the sales of its  Gessner  and Lloyd
divisions, respectively.  The Company received cash of $4.3 million, long term
notes of $2.0 million, and a receivable of $0.3 million.  In the fourth quarter
of 1995 and 1993, the Company reported an after-tax loss and gain on disposal
of these divisions of $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively.  These
additional costs and income represented adjustments to previous estimates
related to litigation matters.  In January 1993, the Company sold its  Belfort
division for $1.0 million in cash and a $1.7 million note receivable.
After-tax income of $1.0 million and $0.4 million were recorded in the fourth
quarter of 1994 and 1993, respectively, from this transaction.  Additionally,
as part of the sale, the Company consigned $1.3 million of inventory under a
five-year contractual purchase agreement of which $0.7 million remained at
March 31, 1995.  The Company retained one weather instrument product line and
is negotiating its sale separately from the above transaction.  Additional
after-tax costs of $0.1 and $0.9 million were recorded in 1994 and 1993,
respectively, in connection with the Company's former Computer Graphics
manufacturing operation, which was discontinued in August, 1991.  These
additional costs were for actual and estimated future discontinuation costs.

         Additional after-tax net costs of $0.7 million and $0.7 million were
recorded in 1995 and 1993 in connection with the Company's former Space
Ordinance Systems division, which was sold in May 1990, and an after-tax gain
on disposal of $0.2 million was recorded in 1994.  These additional costs and
income represent adjustments to previous estimates related to litigation and
environmental matters.

         Additional after-tax costs of $0.3 million were recorded in 1995 in
connection with other previously discontinued and sold operations.  These
additional costs represent adjustments to previous estimates related to
environmental matters.

         Operating profit for the Rescue Hoist and Cargo Hook Products segment
was $0.2 million in 1995, a decrease of $3.6 million or 96% from 1994.  The
decrease was primarily due to reduced margins for all product lines through the
first three quarters from shipments on low profit contracts.

         In 1995 new orders in the Rescue Hoist and Cargo Hook Products segment
increased by $2.7 million or 10% from 1994.  New orders for rescue hoists and
related spare parts were up $5.2 million or 27%, new orders for cargo hooks
were down $2.8 million or 35%, and new orders for tie-downs were up $0.3
million or 55%, in 1995 over 1994. These changes were primarily due to customer
timing of  order placement.  At March 31, 1995, the backlog of unfilled orders
was $21.8 million, compared to $21.4 million at March 31, 1994.

         Sales related to United States Government contracts, which consist
primarily of defense contracts and represent approximately 18% of the Company's
total 1995 sales from continuing operations, have been declining in recent
years.  While management remains concerned with the continued trend toward
reductions in defense spending,  many of the Company's defense related
programs, as well as spare parts requirements for these programs, will continue
for several years, though there can be no assurances in that regard.  Moreover,
the Company is well on its way in implementing a strategy of developing its
non-defense businesses through acquisitions and refocused foreign and
commercial market attention.

         1994 COMPARED WITH 1993

         Sales for the Rescue Hoist and Cargo Hook Products segment were $29.6
million in 1994, a decrease of $5.4 million or 16% from 1993.  Fiscal 1994
sales of rescue hoists and related spare parts and tie-downs decreased $8.0
million or 27% from 1993 due primarily to delays in the timing of customers
placing new orders in 1994, increased competition resulting in reduced tie-down
orders and the settlement of a contract termination claim for a pre-tax profit
of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 1993.  Sales of cargo hooks increased
$2.6 million or 51% primarily due to timing of customer orders.

         Operating profit for the Rescue Hoist and Cargo Hook Products segment
was $3.8 million for 1994, a decrease of $2.2 million or 37% from 1993.  The
decrease was primarily due to the reduced shipments of rescue hoists and
related spare parts, offset by increased cargo hook shipments, as mentioned
above.

         New orders for the Rescue Hoist and Cargo Hook Products segment
decreased in 1994 by $2.1 million or 7%.  Cargo hook new orders increased while
rescue hoists and  related spare parts and tie-downs experienced decreased new
orders in 1994, primarily due to the timing of customer orders.  At March 31,
1994, the backlog of unfilled orders was $21.4 million, compared to $23.3
million at March 31, 1993.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         The Company's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 38%, 34% and 17% as of
March 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The current ratio at March 31,
1995, stood at 3.25 compared to 3.49 and 3.27 at March 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  Working capital was $53.1 million at March 31, 1995, down $0.8
million from March 31, 1994 and up $9.6 million from March 31, 1993.

         At March 31, 1995, the Company's debt consisted of $16.3 million of
borrowings under a revolving bank credit line, an $8.1 million bank term loan,
a $15.0 million bank term loan and $1.0 million of other borrowings.  The
revolving bank credit line commitment is $35.0 million and is subject to a
borrowing base





                                       13

formula.  This commitment, which was available to the Company through September
30, 1995, was refinanced on June 30, 1995.  The agreement provides for
borrowings and letters of credit based on collateralized accounts receivable
and inventory.  All fixed assets other than real property with the exception of
certain real property located in Mountainside, New Jersey, are also included as
collateral.  Letters of credit, which are included in the borrowing base
formula, are limited to $5.0 million. Letters of credit under the line at March
31, 1995 were $1.6 million.  Interest is accrued at the lending bank's prime
rate or, at the Company's option, the London Interbank Offered Rate plus two
percentage points, which the Company was utilizing for $16.3 million of
outstanding borrowings at March 31, 1995.  The agreement contains customary
operating and financial covenants typical to this form of financing and further
provides that quarterly dividend payments cannot exceed 25% of the Company's
cumulative net income in each year.  For the year ended March 31, 1995, the
Company was not in compliance with the net income covenant, and paid dividends
in excess of 25% of the Company's cumulative net income for the year.  The
Company has received waivers of acceptance from the lenders for both these
covenant non-compliance issues.  The $8.1 million term loan, which was used to
acquire the Palnut fastener operation in August 1993, is with the same lenders
as the revolving credit line, is secured by the same collateral, and is due and
payable on August 31, 1998.  Principal payments of $360,000 are due and payable
on the last day of each quarter through June 30, 1998, with a final balloon
payment of $3,040,000 due and payable on August 31, 1998.  Interest accrues at
the lending bank's prime rate and is payable monthly. In connection with the
Industrial Retaining Ring Company acquisition, in September 1994, the Company
obtained a $15.0 million term loan with the same lender as the revolving credit
line and secured by the same collateral.  This term loan is due and payable in
equal quarterly installments of $937,500 commencing on December 31, 1995. 
Interest accrues at the lending bank's prime rate and is payable monthly.  The
$8.1 and $15.0 million term loans were also refinanced on June 30, 1995.

         On May 13, 1994, the Company obtained authorization from its lender to
repurchase up to 200,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an aggregate
price not to exceed $2.5 million.  At March 31, 1995, the Company had
repurchased 172,500 shares at an aggregate cost of $2.1 million.

         Management believes that the Company's anticipated cash flow from
operations, combined with the bank credit described above, will be sufficient
to support current and forecasted working capital requirements and dividend
payments.  Capital expenditures in 1995 were $5.0 million as compared with $5.0
million in 1994.  The Company's two industry segments have similar cash flow
requirements.

         The Company is subject to various contingencies related to land and
groundwater contamination at several facilities.  These matters are described
in Note 10 of the Notes to Financial Statements.  Management believes that,
after taking into consideration information provided by counsel, the resolution
of these matters will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company's
liquidity.

         On June 30, 1995 the Company acquired the Seeger Group of companies
from a unit of AB SKF of Gothenburg, Sweden for approximately $43,000,000 plus
the assumption of trade debts and accrued expenses.  The Seeger Group,
headquartered in Konigstein, Germany, is the global leader in manufacturing
circlips, snap rings and retaining rings.  In 1994 the Group's consolidated
revenues from its manufacturing operations in Germany, the UK, Brazil and
U.S.A. were approximately $73.0 million with an operating income of $4.4
million.  The Seeger Group operates under the trade names of "Seeger",
"Anderton", and "Waldes" with over 900 employees at its five manufacturing
facilities.  Financing for the transaction was provided through a new
$115,000,000 credit facility provided by a bank.

          The credit facility, structured as a $25,000,000, 7 year term loan, a
$50,000,000, 4-1/2 year term loan, a $34,000,000 revolving crecdit facility,
and $6,000,000 of international lines of credit, is secured by all of the
assets of the Company and its subsidiaries.  Interest rates are tied to either
Prime or LIBOR with a margin depending upon the Company's achievement of
certain operating and financial goals.  The facility limits the Company's
ability to pay dividends to 25% of net income and restricts capital
expenditures to $6,500,000 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1996, and
$7,000,000 thereafter for the life of the loan, as well as containing other
customary financial covenants.

          Proceeds from the new credit facility were also used to retire the
Company's existing bank debt.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of TransTechnology Corporation:


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TransTechnology
Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1995 and 1994 and the related
statements of consolidated operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 1995.  Our audits also
included the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the Table of
Contents at Item 8.  These financial statements and the financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Corporation's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of TransTechnology Corporation and
subsidiaries at March 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31,
1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our
opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




1.       SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

         Principles of Consolidation.  The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of TransTechnology Corporation ("the Company")
and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned.  Intercompany balances and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

         Related Party.  Research Industries Incorporated owns approximately
22% of the Company's outstanding common stock.  Two former directors of the
Company are the only shareholders of Research Industries Incorporated, and each
of these directors had a consulting contract with the Company; one for $1.4
million and one for $0.7 million.  Of the total $2.1 million original
contracts, $0.7, $0.9 and $0.5 million has been expensed and paid during fiscal
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

         Accounting for Contracts.  All of the Company's contracts are firm
fixed-price.  Sales and cost of sales on such contracts are recorded as
deliveries are made.  Estimates of cost to complete are reviewed and revised
periodically throughout the lives of the contracts, and adjustments to profit
resulting from such revisions are recorded in the accounting period in which
the revisions are made.  Losses on contracts are recorded in full as they are
identified.

         Cash and Cash Equivalents.  The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with a maturity at date of acquisition of three months or less to
be cash equivalents.

         Accounts Receivable.  Accounts receivable from the United States
Government represent billed receivables and substantially all amounts are
expected to be collected within one year.  The Company has no amounts billed
under retainage provisions of contracts.

         Inventories.  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method.  Cost includes
material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs.

         Property and Related Depreciation and Amortization.  Provisions for
depreciation are made on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives
of depreciable assets ranging from three to thirty years.  Amortization of
leasehold improvements is computed on a straight-line basis over the shorter of
the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the terms of the leases.

         Costs in Excess of Net Assets of Acquired Businesses.  The difference
between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets of acquired
businesses is included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets under
the caption "Costs in Excess of Net Assets of Acquired Businesses" and is being
amortized over forty years, or shorter periods where deemed appropriate.  The
Company has determined that there is no impairment in value since projected
future operating results on an undiscounted basis through the period such costs
in excess of net assets of acquired businesses is being amortized are expected
to be sufficient to absorb the amortization.

         Earnings Per Share.  Earnings per share are based on the weighted
average number of common shares and, if dilutive, common stock equivalents
(stock options) outstanding during each year.

         Research, Development and Engineering Costs.  Research and development
costs and engineering costs in support of active products, which are charged to
expense when incurred, amounted to $1.4 million, $1.4 million and $1.0 million
in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Included in these amounts were
expenditures of $0.4 million, $0.6 million and $0.4 million in 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively, which represent costs related to research and development
activities.

         Income Taxes.  Effective April 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".
Statement No. 109 requires a change from the deferred method of accounting for
income taxes of APB Option 11 to the asset and liability method of accounting
for income taxes.  Under the asset and liability method of Statement No.  109,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future





                                       21
<PAGE>   23
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases.  The adoption of Statement No. 109 had no material effect on the
financial statements.

         Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.  The Company makes
contributions toward the cost of providing certain health care and life
insurance benefits to certain retirees, their beneficiaries and covered
dependents.  Company contributions in 1993 were expensed as paid.  The accrual
method of accounting for these benefits was adopted April 1, 1993 in accordance
with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."

         Investments.  On March 1, 1994 the Company acquired 465,000 shares of
Mace Security International common stock, valued at $3.4 million, as partial
payment for the sale of a division.  At March 31, 1994, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities".  The aggregate fair market value of
the investment at March 31, 1995 and 1994 was $0.8 and $1.8 million,
respectively.  This investment has been classified as available for sale, and
accordingly, gross unrealized holding losses of $2.6 million and $1.6 million
are reported as a reduction to stockholders' equity in the March 31, 1995 and
1994 balance sheets, respectively.

2.       DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

         In March 1995, the Company sold substantially all of the assets and
business of its chaff products operation for $6.7 million in cash.  The sale of
this operation resulted in an after-tax disposal loss of $0.4 million.  The
Company retained the chaff avionics product line and  negotiated its sale
separately in May 1995.  Also, in March 1995, the Company discontinued and is
negotiating the sale of its computer graphics service operations which operate
under the name TransTechnology Systems & Services, and its Electronics
division, which includes Electronic Connections and Assemblies, Inc.  The
domestic portion of the computer graphics service operations was sold in June
1995.

         In March 1994, the Company sold its Federal Laboratories division for
$1.0 million in cash, $1.2 million in notes receivable and 465,000 shares of
Mace Security International, Inc. Common stock.  The sale of this division
resulted in a after-tax gain of $0.5 million.  Additional after-tax disposal
costs of $0.5 million were recorded in 1995 in connection with the sale.

         During 1992, the Company adopted a restructuring plan which provided
for the sale of its Financial Systems,  Gessner , Lloyd and  Belfort
divisions, and the discontinuance of its Computer Graphics manufacturing
operation.  At March 31, 1992, the Company had completed the sale of its
Financial Systems division, and had classified all of these businesses for
financial reporting purposes as discontinued operations.  On May 29, 1992, and
June 4, 1992, the Company completed the sales of its Gessner and Lloyd
divisions, respectively.  The Company received cash of $4.3 million, long term
notes of $2.0 million, and a receivable of $0.3 million.  In the fourth quarter
of 1995 and 1993, the Company reported an after-tax loss and gain on disposal of
these divisions of $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively.  These
additional costs and income represented adjustments to previous estimates
related to litigation matters.  In January 1993, the Company sold its  Belfort 
division for $1.0 million in cash and a $1.7 million note receivable.  After-tax
income of $0.1 million and $0.4 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of
1994 and 1993, respectively, from this transaction. Additionally, as part of the
sale, the Company consigned $1.3 million of inventory under a five-year
contractual purchase agreement of which $0.7 million remained at March 31, 
1995.  The Company retained one weather instrument product line and is
negotiating its sale separately from the above transaction.  Additional
after-tax costs of $0.1 and $0.9 million were recorded in 1994 and 1993,
respectively, in connection with the Company's former Computer Graphics
manufacturing operation, which was discontinued in August, 1991.  These
additional costs were for actual and estimated future discontinuation costs.

         Additional after-tax net costs of $0.7 million and $0.7 million were
recorded in 1995 and 1993 in connection with the Company's former Space
Ordinance Systems division, which was sold in May 1990, and an after-tax gain
on disposal of $0.2 million was recorded in 1994.  These additional costs and
income represent adjustments to previous estimates related to litigation and
environmental matters.

         Additional after-tax costs of $0.3 million were recorded in 1995 in
connection with other previously discontinued and sold operations.  These
additional costs represent adjustments to previous estimates related to
environmental matters.

the deferral method and prior periods have not been restated to reflect this
change in accounting principle.  There was no material effect on the Company's
financial results as a result of adopting SFAS No. 109.

Credit Agreement

         At March 31, 1995, outstanding bank debt consisted of a revolving
credit facility which provides for borrowings and letters of credit of $35.0
million and two term loans totalling $23.1  million.  Borrowing under the
credit facility at March 31, 1995 was $16.3 million.

         The revolving credit facility, which was available to the Company
through September 1995, was refinanced in June 1995 (see Note 11).  Under this
facility, accounts receivable, inventory and all fixed assets other than real
property, with the exception of certain real property located in Mountainside,
New Jersey, are pledged as collateral. Borrowings are limited to 80% of the
unpaid face amount of eligible accounts receivable, plus the lesser of 50% of
eligible net inventory or $18.0 million. Letters of credit, which are included
in the borrowing base formula, are limited to $5.0 million.  Letters of credit
under this facility at March 31, 1995 were $1.6 million.  Borrowing under this
facility bears interest at the lending bank's prime rate.  The agreement also
gives the Company the option of using the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
plus two percentage points.  At March 31, 1995, the Company had $16.3 million
of borrowings using LIBOR.  The agreement contains requirements for a minimum
tangible net worth of $50.0 million at March 31, 1995; a quarterly maximum
total liabilities to tangible equity ratio of 1.4 to 1.0 at March 31, 1995; a
minimum annual working capital level of $40.0 million; a minimum annual cash
flow coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1.0; and minimum net income of $5.0 million per
year for the year ending on March 31, 1995.  In addition, the agreement
requires the Bank's approval for the repurchase of the Company's common stock,
and provides that quarterly dividend payments cannot exceed 25% of the
Company's cumulative net income in each year.  For the year ended March 31,
1995, the Company was not in compliance with the net income covenant, and paid
dividends in excess of 25% of the Company's cumulative net income for the year. 
The Company has received waivers of acceptance from the lenders for both these
covenant non-compliance issues.     

         The $8.1 million and $15.0 million term loans are with the same
lenders as the revolving credit line and were also refinanced on June 30, 1995
(see Note 11).  They are secured by the same collateral, and are due and
payable on August 31, 1998 and September 30, 1999, respectively. Principal
payments on the $8.1 million term loan of $360,000 are due and payable on the
last day of each quarter through June 30, 1998, with a final balloon payment of
$3,040,000 due and payable on August 31, 1998. Principal payments on the $15.0
million term loan of $937,500 are due and payable on the last day of each
quarter, commencing December 31, 1995, through September 30, 1999.  Interest on
the term loans accrue at the lending bank's prime rate plus 1/4 percentage
point.  Interest is payable monthly.
                
Other

         Other long-term debt is comprised principally of an obligation due
under a collateralized borrowing arrangement with a fixed interest rate of 3%
due December 2004 and loans on life insurance policies owned by the Company
with a fixed interest rate of 5%.

8.       EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

         The Company has an incentive bonus plan which provides for cash
payments to selected employees based upon formulas approved by the Board of
Directors.  Provisions for awards under the plan approximated $1,220,000,
$1,301,000 and $779,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Company has
two defined contribution plans covering substantially all employees.
Contributions are based on certain percentages of an employee's eligible
compensation.  Expenses related to these plans were $1,373,000, $1,786,000, and
$1,493,000 in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.  A division of the Company
also makes contributions to a union-sponsored multi-employer pension plan in
accordance with the negotiated labor contract.  Contributions to the plan were
$275,000, $226,000  and $218,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

         Effective April 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106 ("SFAS No. 106") on Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.  This statement requires that the
cost of these benefits, which are primarily health care related, be recognized
in the financial statements during the employee's active working career.  The
Company's previous practice was to recognize expense as claims were paid.  The
plan maintained by the Company provides postretirement benefits to union
employees at one of the Company's divisions.  Adopting the new standard created
a previously unrecognized obligation covering prior years.  This transition
obligation, estimated at $2.9 million, before tax effects, is being amortized
on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life of active
employees, estimated by the Company to be approximately 20 years.  During
fiscal year 1994, the Company adopted an amendment to the plan resulting in a
decrease of $859,000 to the transition obligation.

</TABLE>

         Accrued postretirement benefit cost is included in other liabilities
on the balance sheet.

         The assumed health care cost trend rates used for measurement purposes
were 13% and 14% for 1995 and 1994, respectively, trending down 1% each year to
10% in 1998 and then decreasing .5% each year to 6.5% in 2005 and beyond, for
substantially all participants.  The weighted-average discount rates used were
8.5% and 8.0% at March 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

         A 1% increase in health care trend rate would increase the annual
expense by approximately 12.3% for the year ended March 31, 1995 and
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately 13.5% at March
31, 1995.

         Included in the above amounts is the aggregate lease commitment
associated with the Company's former corporate office.  Other-long-term
liabilities at March 31, 1995, include a $0.4 million obligation associated
with the lease which expires in July 1998.


10.      CONTINGENCIES

         The Company has commenced environmental site assessments and cleanup
feasibility studies to determine the presence, extent and sources of any
environmental contamination at sites in Pennsylvania and Illinois which
continue to be owned although the related businesses have been sold or are
expected to be sold during fiscal 1996.  Although no governmental action
requiring remediation has been taken at this time, the Company is working in
cooperation with the relevant state authorities and any remedial work required
to be performed would be subject to their approval.  At the Pennsylvania sites,
a feasibility study has been prepared and submitted to the state.  Based upon
that study and upon claims for recovery which the Company has against others, a
pre-tax charge of $3.6 million (net of $1.2 million in probable recoveries from
third parties) was recorded in March 1993 for future cleanup costs at the
Pennsylvania sites.  At March 31, 1995, the balance of this clean-up reserve
was $3.1 million.  In addition, the Company is pursuing recovery of a portion
of clean-up costs in litigation with several of its insurance carriers.  The
Company expects that remediation work at the Pennsylvania site will not be
completed until fiscal 1999.

         In 1990, a lawsuit was brought in Los Angeles Superior Court against
the Company and certain of its former officers by Special Devices, Inc.
("Special Devices"), a landlord at one of the Company's former California
facilities, and Placerita Land and Farming Company, a predecessor of Special
Devices, in which plaintiffs sought to recover in excess of $15.0 million for
compensatory damages and an unspecified sum for punitive damages.  The
plaintiffs alleged that the Company's waste handling practices  diminished the
value of the leased property, reduced future rental income and caused
plaintiffs to incur substantial defense costs in connection with related legal
proceedings.  This action was settled in May 1995 with the Company paying $2.8
million in exchange for title to the subject real estate and a release of all
claims.  The Company recorded in discontinued operations a loss of $1.3
million, in fiscal 1995, based on the appraised value of the property.  In
November 1985, the Company entered into agreements with the California
Department of Health Services obligating the Company to clean up soil and
groundwater contaminated by





                                       30
<PAGE>   32
hazardous materials on this property.  Substantially all of the remedial work
has been performed, with ongoing monitoring and water treatment activity
expected to continue until 2002.

         In addition, the Company has been named as a potentially responsible
party in various environmental remediation recovery proceedings pending in
several other states in which it is alleged that the Company was a generator of
waste that was sent to landfills and other treatment facilities and, as to
several sites, it is alleged that the Company was an owner or operator.  Such
properties generally relate to businesses which have been sold or discontinued.
It is not possible to reliably estimate the costs associated with any remedial
work to be performed until the studies at the Illinois site and these other
sites have been completed, the scope of work defined and a method of
remediation selected and approved by the relevant state authorities.

         The Company is also engaged in various other legal proceedings
incidental to its business.

         It is the opinion of the management that, after taking into
consideration information furnished by its counsel, the above matters will not
have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.


11.      SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

         On June 30, 1995 the Company acquired the Seeger Group of companies
from a unit of AB SKF of Gothenburg, Sweden for approximately $43,00,000 plus
the assumption of trade debts and accrued expenses.  Financing for the
transaction was provided through a new $115,000,000 credit facility provided by
a bank.

         The credit facility, structured as a $25,000,000, 7 year term loan, a
$50,000,000, 4-1/2 year term loan, a $34,000,000 revolving credit facility, and
$6,000,000 of international lines of credit, is secured by all of the assets of
the Company and its subsidiaries.  Interest rates are tied to either Prime or
LIBOR with a margin depending upon the Company's achievement of certain
operating and financial goals.  The facility limits the Company's ability to
pay dividends to 25% of net income and restricts capital expenditures to
$6,500,000 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1996, and $7,000,000 thereafter
for the life of the loan, as well as containing other customary financial
covenants.

         Proceeds from the new credit facility were also used to retire the
Company's existing bank debt.

12.      SEGMENT INFORMATION

         The Company develops, manufactures and sells primarily specialty
fastener products and rescue hoist and cargo hook products.  Specialty Fastener
Products include gear-driven band fasteners, threaded fasteners and retaining
rings for the marine, auto, toy, aircraft, heavy equipment and industrial
machinery industries.  Rescue Hoist and Cargo Hook Products include lifting,
control, and restraint devices-principally helicopter rescue hoists and
external hook systems, winches and hoists for aircraft and weapon-handling
systems, and aircraft and cargo tie-downs.

         Operating profit is net sales less operating expenses.  General
corporate expenses, interest and income taxes have not been deducted in
determining operating profit.  Assets, depreciation and amortization, and
capital expenditures are those identifiable to a particular segment by their
use.  Approximately 18%, 23% and 28% of sales from continuing operations in
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, were derived from sales to the United States
Government and its prime contractors which are attributable primarily to the
Rescue Hoist and Cargo Hook Products Segment.

                          TRANSTECHNOLOGY CORPORATION

                        DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

     Agreement dated as of September 15, 1994 between TransTechnology
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and _________________
("Optionee"), residing at _____________________________________________________.

     Whereas, pursuant to the TransTechnology Corporation Amended and Restated
1992 Long Term Incentive Plan of the Company (the "Plan"), the Board of
Directors and shareholders have authorized the granting to Optionee of an
incentive stock option to purchase shares of common stock of the Company upon
the terms and conditions hereinafter stated.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants herein set forth, the
parties agree as follows:

     1.   Shares & Price. The Company grants to Optionee the right to
          purchase, upon and subject to the terms and conditions herein stated
          and the terms and conditions of the Plan, all or any part of _______ 
          shares of common stock ($.01 par value) of the Company (the
          "Shares"), for cash at the price of $_______ per share.
                 
     2.   Term of Option. This option shall expire on September 15, 1999.

     3.   Installments. Subject to the provisions hereof, this option shall
          become exercisable on September 15, 1995.

     4.   Exercise. This option may only be exercised by delivery to the
          Company of (i) a written notice of exercise, in form acceptable to
          the Company, stating the number of Shares then being purchased
          hereunder, and (ii) a check, or cash, in the amount of the purchase
          price of such shares (or, at the discretion of the Board of
          Directors, with Shares of Company with a market value equal to the
          purchase price at date of exercise).

     5.   Termination of Service as a Director. If Optionee ceases to be a
          director of the Company for any reason other than his death or
          disability, either Optionee or the person entitled to succeed to his
          rights hereunder shall have the right, at any time within ninety
          days after such termination and prior to the expiration of this
          option pursuant to Paragraph 2 hereof, to exercise this option to
          the extent, but only to the extent, that this option was exercisable
          and had not

















                                      41
<PAGE>   2

          previously been exercised at the date of such termination of
          employment; provided, however, that all rights under this option
          shall expire in any event on the day specified in Paragraph 2 hereof
          or ninety days after Optionee terminates service as a Director,
          whichever first occurs.

     6.   Death of Optionee & No Assignment. The option shall not be
          assignable or transferable except by will or by the laws of descent
          and distribution and shall be exercisable during his lifetime only
          by the Optionee. If Optionee shall become disabled or die while in
          the employ of the Company, the Optionee or the person entitled to
          succeed to his rights hereunder may exercise this option until the
          first to occur of (i) the date one year from the date of the
          Optionee's disability or death, or (ii) the date such option expires
          pursuant to Paragraph 2 hereof to the extent that Optionee was
          entitled to exercise this Option at the date of his disability or
          death.

     7.   Service of Optionee. In consideration of the granting of this Option
          by the Company, the Optionee agrees to render faithful and efficient
          services to the Company as a director for a period of at least one
          year from the date this Option is granted.

     8.   No Rights as Stockholders. Optionee shall have no rights as a
          stockholder with respect to the Shares covered by the Option until
          the date of the issuance of stock certificates to him. No adjustment
          will be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date
          is prior to the date such stock certificates are issued pursuant to
          the exercise of options granted hereunder.

     9.   Modification and Termination. The rights of Optionee are subject to
          modification and termination in certain events as provided in the
          Plan.

     10.  Shares Purchased for Investment. Optionee represents and agrees that
          if he exercises this option in whole or in part, he shall acquire
          the shares upon such exercise for the purpose of investment and not
          with a view to their resale or distribution. The Company reserves
          the right to include a legend of each certificate representing
          shares subject to this option, stating in effect that such shares
          have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
          amended.

     11.  This Agreement Subject to Plan. This agreement is made pursuant to
          all of the provisions of the Plan, and is intended, and shall be

          inconsistent with the Plan shall be superseded and governed by the
          Plan.

                                   RECITALS

     A.   On June 21, 1991, TT and Bank entered into a certain Revolving Loan
And Security Agreement (the "Loan Agreement," all terms defined therein being

     D.   On December 31, 1992, TT and Bank entered into a letter agreement
(the "Letter Agreement") to permit TT to pay dividends in accordance with
Section 7.2(H) of the Loan Agreement, as amended, commencing with the quarter
ending December 31, 1992.

     E.   On August 2, 1993, TT and Bank entered into a certain Third
Amendment To The Revolving Loan And Security Agreement (the "Third Amendment")
to provide for (1) an increase in the maximum principal amount of borrowings
under the Revolving Loan from $25,000,000 to $35,000,000 (inclusive of the
issuance by Bank to TT of a maximum of $5,000,000 of standby letters of

     F.   TT has established ECA, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of TT, for

     G.   Borrowers have requested that Bank make available to ECA, Inc. funds
under the Revolving Loan in accordance with the provisions of the Loan
Agreement, as amended.

     H.   In consideration for Bank agreeing to loan and re-loan funds to ECA,
inc. under the Revolving Loan in accordance with the provisions of the Loan

obligations and liabilities of Borrowers due and owing to Bank now or

     I.   Borrowers and Bank now desire to amend the Loan Agreement, as
amended, to (1) add ECA, Inc. as a co-obligor for the repayment of all loans
to Borrowers by Bank and (2) provide for such other amendments and
modifications as are set forth in the provisions of this Fourth Amendment.

     J.   Due to the affiliation and financial interdependence of Borrowers,
Bank and Borrowers have determined that it would be in their respective best
interests for each Borrower to be a joint and several obligor of each other
Borrower's obligations to Bank in accordance with the provisions set forth in
the Loan Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment, the Second Amendment,
the Letter Agreement, the Third Amendment, and this Fourth Amendment.

     A.   On June 21, 1991, TT and Bank entered into a certain Revolving Loan
And Security Agreement (the "Loan Agreement," all terms defined therein being

under the terms of which Bank loaned to TT $9,000,000 on a revolving loan
basis and $4,000,000 in the form of letters of credit pursuant to the

ending December 31, 1992.

     E.   On August 2, 1993, TT and Bank entered into a certain Third
Amendment To The Revolving Loan And Security Agreement (the "Third

Fifth Amendment.

     one percent (1/4%) per annum of the difference between the Revolving Loan
     Credit Limit and the sum of (1) the issued and outstanding standby
     letters of credit and (2) the outstanding principal balance of the
     Revolving Loan during the preceding month (the "Unused Line Fee").

          (C)  Termination Fee. Prior to the Termination Date, Borrowers may
     terminate this Agreement as of the last day of any month by giving Bank
     at least ninety (90) days prior written notice of the date on which this
     Agreement is to terminate, which date must be the last day of a month,

     principal balance due and payable under the Promissory Note, the Term
     Note, the Acquisition Term Note, all other Obligations, and all accrued
     and unpaid interest thereon; provided, however, that if such specified
     date of termination is on or before the Termination Date, Borrowers shall
     pay Bank an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the sum of the Revolving
     Loan Credit Limit and the original principal amount of the Term Loan (the
     "Termination Fee"). The Termination Fee shall be paid to Bank at the same
     time and in the same manner in which Borrowers pay in full the then
     outstanding principal amounts and interest thereon due and owing under
     the Promissory Note, the Term Note, the Acquisition Term Note and all
     other Obligations.

          (D)  Letter of Credit Fee. Borrowers shall be obligated to pay Bank
     a per-annum amount equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the face
     amount of each standby letter of credit issued by Bank for the benefit of
     Borrowers (the "Letter of Credit Fee"). Each Letter of Credit Fee shall
     be due and payable in equal quarterly installments. The first quarterly
     installment of each Letter of Credit Fee shall be due and payable on the
     date of issuance of such Letter of Credit and any additional quarterly
     installments shall be due and payable in advance for each subsequent
     quarter in which a standby letter of credit is issued and outstanding for
     the benefit of Borrowers.

          2.6  Accountings. Any accounting rendered by Bank to Borrowers shall
     be deemed correct and conclusively binding upon Borrowers unless (A)
     Borrowers notify Bank by certified mail, return receipt requested, within
     thirty (30) calendar days after the date when each such











                                      -7-

                                      57
<PAGE>   8

     accounting is mailed or otherwise delivered to Borrowers, or (B) there
     exists a bona fide mistake in such accounting regardless of which party
     discovers such mistake.

          2.7  All Advances to Constitute One Loan. The Revolving Loan, the
     Term Loan, the Acquisition Term Loan and all other amounts owed by
     Borrowers to Bank under this Agreement, whether or not evidenced by a
     promissory note or term note, shall constitute one obligation of
     Borrowers, secured by Bank's lien on and security interest in all of the
     Collateral. Borrowers shall be liable to Bank for all of the Obligations,
     regardless of whether such Obligations arise as a result of advances made
     directly to Borrowers, it being stipulated and agreed that all monies
     advanced by Bank hereunder inure to the benefit of Borrowers, and that
     Bank is relying on the liability of Borrowers in extending credit and
     otherwise making advances under this Agreement.

          2.8  Excess Interest. In no contingency or event whatsoever shall
     the interest rate charged pursuant to the terms of this Agreement exceed
     the highest rate permissible under any law which a court of competent
     jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable hereto. In
     the event that such a court determines that Bank has received interest
     under this Agreement in excess of the highest applicable rate, such
     excess interest shall first be applied to any unpaid principal balance
     owed by Borrowers and, if the then remaining excess interest is greater
     than the unpaid principal balance, Bank promptly shall refund such excess
     interest to Borrowers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
     in this Agreement, the Promissory Note, the Term Note or the Acquisition
     Term Note, if the rate of interest payable on the Promissory Note, the
     Term Note or the Acquisition Term Note is ever reduced as a result of
     this Section 2.8 and at any time thereafter the maximum rate permitted by
     applicable law shall exceed the rate of interest provided for in the
     Promissory Note, the Term Note or the Acquisition Term Note, then the
     rate provided for in the Promissory Note, the Term Note or the
     Acquisition Term Note, as the case may be, shall be increased to the
     maximum rate permitted by applicable law for such period as is required
     so that the total amount of interest received by Bank is that which would
     have been received by Bank but for the operation of this Section 2.8.

          2.9  Revival. To the extent that Borrowers make a payment or
     payments to Bank or to the extent Bank receives any payment or proceeds
     of the Collateral for







                                      -8-

                                      58
<PAGE>   9

     Borrowers' benefit, which payment or proceeds or any part thereof is
     subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set
     aside, and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver, or any other
     party under any bankruptcy act, state or Federal law, common law, or
     equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds received
     by Borrowers, the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied
     shall be revived and shall continue in full force and effect as if such
     payment or proceeds had not been received by Bank.

          2.10 Optional Charge Against Revolving Loan. To the extent Borrowers
     do not remit, when due, any payments of interest or, in the case of the
     Term Loan, the Acquisition Term Loan or any other loans or Obligations
     other than the Revolving Loan, any payment of principal or any other
     payment required to be made by Borrowers to Bank pursuant to the terms of
     any of the Credit Documents within any applicable grace periods, Bank, at
     its option, may make such payment by increasing the outstanding principal
     balance of the Revolving Loan in order to prevent such amount from
     becoming past due, but it is expressly acknowledged and covenanted that
     Bank shall be under no obligation to do so.

          2.11 Specific Conditions Applicable to Requests for Revolving Loan.
     In addition to all other conditions set forth in this Agreement, each
     request by Borrowers for a Revolving Loan also is subject to the
     following specific conditions:

          (A)  Notice of Request. Borrowers shall notify Bank in writing or
     telephonically of Borrowers' request for a Revolving Loan, which request
     shall be received by Bank not later than 2:00 p.m., Cleveland, Ohio time
     and shall state the total amount of the Revolving Loan requested.

          (B)  Borrowing Base Certificate. Borrowers' written request shall be
     accompanied by a duly completed and executed "Borrowing Base Certificate"
     in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit 2.9(B). If Borrowers'
     request is made telephonically, the Borrowing Base Certificate shall be
     delivered to Bank no later than the next business day after such
     telephonic request is made. Each Borrowing Base Certificate shall
     demonstrate that the principal amount of the Revolving Loan, when added
     to the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans then
     outstanding, shall not exceed the Borrowing Base, as determined based on
     the last Borrowing Base Certificate timely delivered to Bank pursuant to
     Section 5.4(B) of this Agreement.

<PAGE>   10

          (C)  Borrowers' Acceptance of Proceeds. The acceptance by Borrowers
     of the proceeds of any Revolving Loan, as of the date of such acceptance,
     shall be deemed (1) to constitute a representation and warranty by
     Borrowers that all conditions to the making of such Revolving Loan set
     forth in this Agreement have been satisfied, and (2) a confirmation by
     Borrowers of the granting and continuance of the Lien in favor of Bank
     created pursuant to this Agreement and the Credit Documents.

          (D)  Conditions to Making Revolving Loan. Bank shall not make any
     Revolving Loan unless (1) it shall have received Borrowers' written or
     telephonic request and Borrowing Base Certificate in the prescribed time
     as set forth in paragraph (A) of this Section 2.11, (2) no Event of
     Default shall then exist or, immediately after the making of any
     Revolving Loan, would exist, (3) all provisions or covenants contained in
     Section 7 of this Agreement shall have been complied with or performed,
     (4) all of the Credit Documents shall be in full force and effect, (5)
     the representations and warranties contained in Section 6 of this
     Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects as if made
     on and as of the date of such borrowing except to the extent that any
     thereof expressly relate to an earlier date, and (6) Bank shall not have
     made demand for the payment of the Obligations or otherwise terminated
     the availability of any Revolving Loan.

          2.12 Manner of Payments. On or before the date they become due,
     Borrowers shall make payments to Bank in immediately available funds,
     even if it contests any statement rendered by Bank; provided, however,
     that if any statement is subsequently proved to be incorrect, Bank, at
     the option of Borrowers, shall (A) refund any overpaid amount to
     Borrowers, or (B) grant a credit against amounts due for the following
     month in the appropriate amount. As to Obligations which become due and
     payable other than on a fixed date by their terms or as a result of
     demand for payment and/or acceleration on account of an Event of Default,
     Borrowers immediately shall pay to Bank such Obligations in immediately
     available funds. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder including, but
     not limited to, any payment to be made on the Promissory Note, the Term
     Note or the Acquisition Term Note, is stated to be due on a day which is
     not a banking day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding
     banking day and such extension of time in each such case shall be
     included in the computation of the interest payable on the Promissory
     Note, the Term Note or the Acquisition Term Note or such other



                                     -10-

                                      60

     Obligation. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, all payments or
     prepayments made or due hereunder (including, but not limited to,
     payments with respect to the Promissory Note, the Term Note or the
     Acquisition Term Note) shall be made in immediately available funds to
     Bank prior to 2:00 p.m., Cleveland, Ohio time, on the date when due.
     Payments received by Bank after 2:00 p.m., Cleveland, Ohio time, shall be
     deemed to have been made on the next following banking day.

          2.13 Default Interest. Upon and after the occurrence of an Event of
     Default, and during the continuation thereof, the Obligations shall bear
     interest at the Default Rate, calculated daily on a 360-day year basis,
     based upon the actual number of days elapsed.

     G.   The reference to Section 2.10(B) set forth in Section 5.4 of the
Loan Agreement is hereby amended to mean and refer to Section 2.11(B).

     H.   Section 4.6 is added to the Loan Agreement as follows:

          4.6  Pledge of Mace Stock. To further secure the prompt payment and
     performance of the Obligations, TT hereby pledges to Bank the Mace Stock
     pursuant to the provisions of the Pledge Agreement.

     I.   Paragraphs (N), (Q) and (S) and the first paragraph of paragraph (O)
