ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

General

   The Bombay Company, Inc. (the "Company") is a specialty retailer which
markets classic and traditional furniture, prints and accessories through a
network of  427 retail stores in the United States and Canada.  For financial
information by geographic areas, see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, located on page 23 of the 1996 Annual Report to Shareholders, filed
as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K Annual Report.  Such Exhibit is incorporated
herein by reference.
<F7>

   The Company has experienced declining profitability over the past several
years which it believes is the result of its previous rapid expansion with
increased expense structure and failure to introduce the appropriate quantity of
new successful products at a sufficient rate to improve the productivity of the
larger stores.  Management is addressing these issues and believes that its
current focus on introducing classic and traditional furnishings to offer more
complete, cohesive collections with a broader market appeal will help improve
the profitability of the Company.

Merchandise Sales, Purchasing and Distribution

   The fiscal 1996 sales mix consisted of: 49% furniture, 27%  accessories, 16%
wall decor (principally prints, mirrors and sconces) and 8% lamps and other
categories. Bombay products internally designed or styled represent
approximately 95% of total sales. During fiscal year 1996, the Company's
merchandise assortment consisted of approximately 2,600 SKU's.  The Company
regularly updates its merchandise assortment through introducing new products
and discontinuing others as they approach the end of their life cycles.  During
the year, approximately 1,000 new SKU's were introduced as compared to
approximately 1,500 in fiscal year 1995.  While new product is critical to the
Company's success, management also has recognized the need to present a more
cohesive collection for the customer.  The Company has made some strides in this
direction during fiscal 1996 and stronger efforts are continuing toward the
development of more appropriate mixes of furniture and accessory offerings.

   Merchandise is manufactured to Company specifications through a network of
contract manufacturers located principally in Asia and North America.
Approximately 60% of production needs are provided from overseas sources.
Branch offices located in Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia and agents in various
countries locate prospective vendors, coordinate production requirements with
manufacturers, provide technical expertise and quality control.

   Approximately 70% of the Company's merchandise requirements are supplied by
35 contract manufacturers in seven countries.  Although no long-term production
agreements exist with manufacturers, there are long standing relationships with
many of the major vendors.  Formal agreements with major manufacturers are in
place which prohibit production of proprietary products for any other party.
Additional manufacturing capacity and alternative sources, both domestic and
international, continue to be added through new vendors and plant expansions by
existing vendors.

   Usually, it takes several months from the time a merchandise order is placed
with an overseas manufacturer until the goods are received at centralized
distribution centers.  Order lead times are slightly less for domestic
manufacturers principally due to shorter shipping time.  Lead times can vary
depending on seasonality factors especially in months when factories are
producing at or near peak capacity to meet seasonal demands.  While overseas
purchases are principally denominated in U.S. dollars, significant foreign
currency fluctuations could adversely affect the Company's ability to source
product in any one country.

   Store inventories are replenished from three distribution centers in the
United States and one in Canada.  The distribution centers are strategically
located and provide the capability to replenish the majority of store
inventories within 48 hours of the time when the order is processed.


Stores and Real Estate

   The stores offer a wide variety of attractively styled, ready-to-assemble
furniture, prints and accessories, with a strong emphasis on value and quality.
Significant attention is given to visual merchandising in order to display
products in the most attractive setting.

   To accommodate the increasing number of products, the Company introduced a
large format Bombay store in late fiscal 1992.  The large format stores
average 4,000 square feet, while the regular stores average 1,700 square feet.
Presently, the Company's store opening program calls for large format stores
ranging in size from 2,500 to 3,500 square feet.  At February 1, 1997, 224 large
format Bombay stores were in operation, including 134 stores that have been
converted from regular stores since fiscal 1992.  Over 90% of all stores are
located in major shopping malls.  At February 1, 1997, stores were operating in
42 states in the United States and nine of ten provinces in Canada, as
illustrated in the map below.

Competition

   The home furnishings and decorative accessories market is highly fragmented.
The Company faces competition from furniture stores, department stores and other
specialty retailers.  The Company believes that it competes primarily on the
basis of selection, quality and value of merchandise.


Employees

   The Company has approximately 5,000 employees, which include approximately
3,000 part-time employees and is not a party to any union contract.  Employee
relations are considered to be good.


Seasonality
                                   
   Operating results are subject to seasonal variation.  Historically, the
largest proportion of sales and substantially all of the income occurs in the
fiscal quarter that includes December (the Christmas season).  Cash balances
increase significantly in December due to the Christmas business.


Intangibles

   The Company owns a number of copyright, trademark and tradename
registrations.  Management considers these intangibles to be valuable assets and
defends them as necessary.

   The Company owns its United States headquarters office complex, and leases
stores and distribution centers under numerous operating leases, generally with
10 year terms.  At February 1, 1997, owned office space was approximately
121,000 square feet of which the Company occupies approximately 71,000 square
feet.  Leased distribution/office and retail space was approximately 807,000 and

       Management's Discussion and Analysis

       General
       
       See Note 1 of  Notes To Consolidated Financial  Statements for fiscal
       reporting periods.
<F1>

       The Company operates a  chain of Bombay Company  retail stores in the
       United States  and  Canada. Prior  to  Fiscal 1995,  the  Company  also
       operated the Alex  & Ivy retail  chain whose closure  was announced  on
       January 13, 1995 and completed on May 10, 1995. As such, the discussion
       following relates primarily  to the ongoing  operations of Bombay. The
       discussion should be  read in conjunction  with the  Table below  which
       summarizes four year  comparable data for  the total  Company and  also
       presents  results excluding the closed Alex & Ivy division.

       The greater percentage of  sales and operating income  is realized in
       the quarter that includes December (Christmas season). Even though  the
       precise  effect  of  inflation  on  operations  cannot  be   accurately
       determined, management does not believe inflation has a material impact
       on sales or results of operations.

       Net Sales
       
       Net sales, excluding  Alex &  Ivy, increased 2%  to $336.3  in Fiscal
       1996 from $330.7 million due primarily  to a 2% increase in same  store
       sales (stores in existence  for one year or  more). During the  period,
       the number  of transactions  decreased 2%  while the  average sale  per
       transaction increased 4%  to $85. Furniture  sales continue  to be  the
       predominant component in the sales mix representing 49% of the business
       as compared to 47% last year. All regions of the Company contributed to
       the sales gain  except the Midwest  which showed  slight declines.  The
       Company's sales performance was driven in part by the promotions needed
       to reduce its over inventory position.
       
       Net sales, excluding Alex  & Ivy, were $330.7  million in Fiscal 1995
       compared to $331.4  million during  the comparable  twelve months.  The
       sales decline for Bombay was the result of a 9% decrease in same  store
       sales, which was offset by sales increases from new stores equal to 5%.
       The period showed a 1% decrease in the number of customer transactions,
       while the average sale per transaction increased approximately 1%.

       For the  Seven Month  Period, new  stores  were the  most significant
       component of the 16%  sales increase for Bombay  with same store  sales
       declining 1%.  The Seven  Month Period  showed a  16% increase  in  the
       number of customer  transactions but the  average sale per  transaction
       was  the  same  from  period  to  period.  Furniture  sales   increased
       approximately 3% of the sales mix for the Seven Month Period.

       The Bombay sales  increase  in  Fiscal 1994  was  attributable  to new
       stores and  increased  same  store  sales  of  11%.  Same  store  sales
       increased 15% in the first six months and 6% in the last six months  of
       Fiscal 1994. The  sales increase  in Fiscal  1994 resulted  from a  39%
       increase  in  customer   transactions  while  the   average  sale   per
       transaction decreased  5%.  The  lower  average  sale  per  transaction
       reflects a change in sales mix. Accessories, which are generally  lower
       priced items, accounted  for a  2% increase  in the  sales mix  whereas
       furniture  declined  approximately  1%.  Geographically,  all   regions
       contributed substantially to the positive sales increases in 1994  with
       the Southern Region being the strongest performer.

</TABLE>

       Excluding Alex & Ivy, new store openings for Fiscal 1996, Fiscal  1995,
       the Seven Month  Period and Fiscal  1994 were 9,  11, 20  and 39.  Also
       during these periods, 3, 10, 38 and 56 small format Bombay stores  were
       converted to  larger  format  stores  while  16,  5,  1  and  4  stores
       (predominately smaller format stores) were closed. Most new stores were
       opened in existing market areas for Bombay.

       Cost Of Sales, Buying And Store Occupancy Costs
       
       Excluding Alex & Ivy,  cost of sales, including  buying and occupancy
       costs, for Fiscal  1996 were $233.9  million or 7%  higher than  Fiscal
       1995. As  a percentage  of sales,  these costs  increased to  69.6%  in
       Fiscal 1996  compared  to  66.1%  in  Fiscal  1995.  The  increase  was
       primarily the result of a higher cost of sales as the Company  disposed
       of  excess  inventory  through   a  series  of  aggressive   promotions
       especially during the second half of the year. The excessive  inventory
       levels also contributed  to higher  warehouse and  freight costs  which
       adversely impacted margins.  Occupancy costs as  a percentage of  sales
       and total retail square footage were relatively flat compared to Fiscal
       1995.

       Excluding Alex  & Ivy,  costs of  sales,  including buying  and store
       occupancy costs  for Fiscal 1995 were $218.7 million, or 6% higher than
       the comparable twelve  month period. As  a percentage  of sales,  these
       costs increased to 66.1%  in Fiscal 1995 from  62.5% in the  comparable
       period of the prior year.  The increase in costs  for Bombay is due  to
       higher occupancy  costs  (2.7%) and  higher  product costs  (.9%).  The
       occupancy costs percentage increase is the result of the retail  square
       footage added during the previous two years and the effect of declining
       same store  sales relative  to the  fixed  nature of  occupancy  costs.
       During Fiscal 1995, retail square  footage for Bombay stores  increased
       only 4% to 1,256,000 square feet. The lower product margin is primarily
       due to  the  effect  of lowering  selected  retail  prices,  increasing
       warehouse and freight costs, and a shift in the sales mix as  consumers
       tended to purchase a greater portion of merchandise on sale compared to
       full price merchandise.

       Bombay costs  were $31.8  million, or  31%,  higher during  the Seven
       Month  Period  than  the  comparable  prior  seven  month  period.  The
       percentage of sales increase of 6.7% compared to the same period in the
       prior year reflects lower product margin of 4.6% and higher buying  and
       store occupancy costs of 2.1%. The  lower product margin was  primarily
       due  to:  (1)  $5  million  Bombay  inventory  writedown,   principally
       nonfurniture products (see  Note 9 of  Notes To Consolidated  Financial
       Statements); (2) costs associated with a new distribution center opened
       September 1994, as well as  inefficiencies related to excess  inventory
       levels and (3)  the acceleration  of programs  to discontinue  selected
       furniture products from  normal sale period  in January  1995 to  begin
       October 1994.  The  higher  occupancy costs  reflect  increased  square
       footage.
<F9>

       For Fiscal 1994,  Bombay's costs  increased 33%  over the  prior year
       while sales increased 32%. As a  percentage of sales, costs were  58.3%
       or .6% higher than Fiscal 1993  reflecting higher buying and  occupancy
       costs related to the store expansion programs undertaken. During Fiscal
       1994, retail square  footage increased approximately  40% to  1,028,000
       square feet. The slightly lower product margin reflects the mix between
       promotional and nonpromotional periods.


       Selling, General And Administrative Expenses
       
       For  Fiscal  1996,  Bombay's   selling,  general  and  administrative
       expenses were  $107.4  million or  31.9%  of sales  compared  to  $98.4
       million or 29.8%  last year.  The Fiscal  1996 amount  includes a  $4.2
       million  charge  (1.2%  of  sales)  recorded  in  connection  with  the
       management change which took  place in September 1996.  (See Note 8  of
       Notes To  Consolidated Financial  Statements.) The  remaining  increase
       relates  to  the  higher  payroll  costs  (1.2%),  costs  incurred   in
       connection with the closing of unprofitable Bombay stores (.2%), higher
       insurance costs (.2%)  and higher recruiting  and training costs  (.2%)
       which were offset by lower advertising expenses (.9%).
<F8>

       Excluding the cost associated with Alex & Ivy, Bombay costs increased
       to $98.4  million or  29.8%  of sales  during  Fiscal 1995  from  $95.5
       million or 28.8%  of sales  in the  comparable prior  year period.  The
       increase is due primarily to  higher advertising (1.3%), payroll  (.6%)
       and insurance costs  (.2%). Fixed payroll  costs increased relative  to
       sales but were  significantly offset by  declines in performance  based
       pay. Costs for  the prior  year include a  $4 million  charge (1.2%  of
       sales) for restructuring the Company's  operations for which there  was
       no corresponding expense in Fiscal 1995.

       Expenses for the  Seven Month  Period increased  $9.3 million  or 17%
       compared to the  same prior year  period. The .2%  percentage of  sales
       increase can be attributed to the $4 million recorded for consolidation
       of  divisional  and  corporate  overheads  (see  Note  9  of  Notes  To
       Consolidated Financial Statements) which  equals 1.8%, offset by  lower
       payroll and advertising costs.
<F9>

       Fiscal 1994 expenses increased $17.0 million  but decreased 1.6% as a
       percentage of sales compared to Fiscal 1993. Payroll costs resulted  in
       the most significant decrease (.7%) from prior year; the remaining  .9%
       decrease resulted from lower insurance, advertising and other expenses,
       as a percentage of sales.

       Interest
       
       Interest expense for  Fiscal 1996, Fiscal  1995, for  the Seven Month
       Period and for Fiscal 1994 was less than $.1 million, $.1 million,  $.4
       million and  $.1  million,  respectively.  The  decreases  in  interest
       expense during Fiscal 1996 and Fiscal  1995 reflect the lower  seasonal
       borrowings during the  periods. The interest  expense increase for  the
       Seven Month Period reflects the seasonal borrowing activity compared to
       Fiscal 1994 which had no seasonal borrowing.

       Interest income for  Fiscal 1996,  Fiscal 1995,  for the  Seven Month
       Period and for Fiscal  1994 was $.7 million,  $.8 million, $.2  million
       and $.9 million, respectively. The  decrease in interest during  Fiscal
       1996 is the result of excess inventory levels during the early  portion
       of the year which resulted in lower levels of cash available for short-
       term investments. The increase in interest income during Fiscal 1995 is
       the result  of higher  levels of  short-term investments  due to  funds
       generated by the liquidation  of Alex &  Ivy as well  as a decrease  in
       store expansion activity. The decrease in interest income for the Seven
       Month Period resulted from lower short-term investment levels.

       Store Closing Costs
       
       The January 1995  announcement to close  the Alex &  Ivy retail chain
       resulted in a $41 million expense  charge. The $41 million covered  the
       estimated cost  to buyout  lease  obligations, property  and  equipment
       write-offs, inventory  writedowns and  severance costs.  During  Fiscal
       1995, the estimated costs of Alex & Ivy store closings were reduced  by
       $6 million based  primarily on  favorable results  of negotiated  lease
       terminations  (see   Note  9   of  Notes   To  Consolidated   Financial
       Statements).
<F9>

       There were no sales from  Alex & Ivy stores  during Fiscal 1996 while
       sales during Fiscal 1995, the Seven  Month Period and Fiscal 1994  were
       $14.7 million, $24.1 million and $16.7 million, respectively. Excluding
       costs or credits relating to the closure, operating results for  Fiscal
       1995, the  Seven  Month Period  and  Fiscal 1994  were  breakeven,  and
       operating losses of  $1.5 million and  $2.9 million, respectively.  The
       Company opened 20 Alex & Ivy  stores during the Seven Month Period  and
       32 stores during  Fiscal 1994. All  58 of the  chain's existing  stores
       were closed during Fiscal  1995. The Company does  not expect to  incur
       any additional costs in connection with this operation.

       Income Taxes
       
       For Fiscal 1996  and the Seven  Month Period, income  tax benefit was
       $1.6 million, excluding the effect of  the accounting change, and  $9.6
       million, respectively. Income tax expense for Fiscal 1995 and 1994  was
       $8.0 million and  $14.7 million,  respectively. The effective tax  rate
       in  each  fiscal  period  was   (35.6%),  39.3%,  (39.5%)  and   39.2%,
       respectively.

       The effective income tax rate decreased  3.7% for Fiscal 1996 and .2%
       for Fiscal 1995 and increased .3% for the Seven Month Period  primarily
       due to  the  effect of  state  income  taxes. The  effective  tax  rate
       increased .2%  in  Fiscal 1994  due  to  the Federal  income  tax  rate
       increase, partially offset by tax exempt short-term investments.

       Liquidity and Capital Resources
       
       The primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows
       from operations and  bank borrowings. Bank  borrowings are utilized  to
       fund seasonal inventory purchases. In  addition, the bank credit  lines
       are used  for  overseas  merchandise purchases.  Unsecured  bank  lines
       aggregate $40  million,  of  which  $30  million  are  committed  under
       revolving credit agreements expiring on July 15, 1997. These lines  are
       expected to be renewed with existing banks.

       Fiscal 1996
       
       Cash and  short-term investments  were $63.1  million at  February 1,
       1997, an  increase of  $39.1  million over  the  prior year.  Net  cash
       provided by operations was  $41.2 million. The net  loss from the  year
       was $2.0  million  which included  $11.2  million of  depreciation  and
       amortization. The remainder  of the increase  related primarily to  the
       $18.7 million reduction in inventory levels  as well as the receipt  of
       income tax  refunds  and deposits  totaling  $10.5 million  during  the
       period. The decrease in inventory levels is the result of the Company's
       achieving its foremost objective  of correcting its inventory  position
       during the year.
       
       Capital expenditures were $4.4 million for  the year due primarily to
       opening nine new Bombay stores and converting three stores to the large
       format. Next year's capital expenditure program at approximately $8  to
       $10 million will be  slightly higher than the  Fiscal 1996 program  and
       includes up to 10 new stores and 9 large store conversions.

       Generally, a new or  converted store is profitable  in its first full
       year  of  operations.  The  Company  believes  that  its  current  cash
       position, cash  flows from  operations and  borrowings available  under
       bank credit lines will be sufficient to fund current operations and its
       capital expenditures.

       Fiscal 1995
       
       Cash and  short-term investments were  $24.1 milion  at February  3,
       1996, a decrease of $6.6 million over the prior comparable period.  Net
       cash used by operations was $4.1 million. Net income was $12.4  million
       which included $6.0 million relating to  the noncash adjustment to  the
       Alex & Ivy closing reserve. Other components of cash used by operations
       included a $15.0 million increase in  inventory levels offset by  other
       net sources of cash  totaling $4.5 million.  The increase in  inventory
       levels is  the result  of timing  of shipments  as well  as lower  than
       expected sales volumes during the year.

       Capital  expenditures  were  $5.9  million  during  Fiscal  1995  due
       primarily to opening  11 new  Bombay stores  and the  conversion of  10
       existing stores to the large format.

       Seven Months Ended January 28, 1995
       
       Cash increased $10.2 million  for the seven months  ended January 28,
       1995 to  $30.7  million. Net  cash  provided by  operations  was  $31.0
       million. The components of cash provided  by operations were: net  loss
       of $14.7 million; noncash  cost of $50  million relating to  operations
       realignments; and other net outflows of $4.3 million.

       Capital expenditures were  $22.1 million  for the seven  months ended
       January 28, 1995. The capital expenditures program included investments
       in: (1) 40  new stores; (2)  38 stores converted  to large format;  (3)
       purchase  of  home   office  headquarters  office   complex;  (4)   new
       distribution center and (5) information systems.

       Fiscal 1994
       
       Cash flows  from  operations  were  $10  million.  Net  income before
       noncash expenses generated  $34.3 million  of operating  cash flow  and
       other net  changes  added  $3.9  million.  These  were  offset  by  the
       increased inventory investment  of $28.2 million,  required to  support
       the increased number of new stores and large store conversions.

       Significant capital expenditures were  made in Fiscal  1994 for store
       growth programs, distribution center expansion and information systems.
       In Fiscal 1994, $35.3 million was invested primarily in the building of
       127 stores, including 71 new stores and 56 large store conversions.

       Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements
<F1>
       Note 1 - Statement Of Accounting Policies


       Basis Of Presentation
       
       The consolidated  financial statements  include the  accounts  of the
       Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
       transactions, balances and  profits have been  eliminated. The  Company
       has a retail (52-53 week) fiscal year  which was changed to end on  the
       Saturday nearest January  31, beginning with  the seven months  (thirty
       weeks) ended January  28, 1995 ("Seven Month Period"). For previous
       periods, the  fiscal year  ended on  the Sunday  nearest June  30.  The
       period ended February  3, 1996 ("Fiscal 1995") represents 53  weeks.
       The periods ended February 1,  1997 ("Fiscal 1996") and July 3, 1994
       ("Fiscal 1994") represent 52 weeks.

       Use of Estimates
       
       The preparation of financial statements  in conformity with generally
       accepted accounting principles requires  management to make  estimates.
       Actual results could differ from those estimates.

       Foreign Currency Translation
       
       Fiscal year  end  exchange rates  are  used to  translate  assets and
       liabilities to U.S. dollars. Monthly average exchange rates are used to
       translate  income  and  expenses.  The  cumulative  effect  of  foreign
       currency translation adjustments is reported in stockholders' equity.

       Cash And Cash Equivalents
       
       Cash in  stores, deposits  in banks  and short-term  investments with
       original maturities of three months or less are considered as cash  and
       cash equivalents for the purposes  of the financial statements.  Short-
       term investments  are recorded  at the  lower of  cost or  fair  market
       value.

       Inventories
       
       Inventories are primarily finished merchandise and  are valued at the
       lower of average cost or market.

       Accounting Change
       
       During the quarter ended May 4,  1996, the Company changed the timing
       of allocation of overhead costs to distribution center inventories. The
       change more  accurately  reflects  inventory  costs  and  represents  a
       preferable method of  accounting for  distribution center  inventories.
       The cumulative effect of this change was $835,000, net of tax, or  $.02
       per share. This amount  is presented in  the consolidated statement  of
       operations as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. The impact
       of this change on Fiscal 1996 results, excluding the cumulative effect,
       was not significant. The pro forma effect of the change on prior years'
       net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share is not significant.

       Property And Equipment
       
       Property and  equipment  are depreciated  over  the  estimated useful
       lives of  the assets  using the  straight-line  method over  the  lives

       Maintenance and repairs are charged to  expense as incurred. Renewals
       and betterments which materially prolong the useful lives of the assets
       are capitalized.  The  cost  and related  accumulated  depreciation  of
       property retired or sold  are removed from the  accounts, and gains  or
       losses are recognized in the statement of operations.

       Advertising Costs
       
       Advertising costs are expensed  the first time  the advertising takes
       place. During  Fiscal 1996,  Fiscal 1995,  the Seven  Month Period  and
       Fiscal  1994,   advertising  expense   was  $19,887,000,   $22,859,000,
       $15,733,000 and $21,422,000, respectively.

       Goodwill
       
       Goodwill recorded  in  association  with  acquisitions  accounted for
       using the purchase method is  amortized using the straight-line  method
       over the estimated useful life of 40 years. The amortization policy  is
       reviewed annually and impairments, if any,  would be recognized if  the
       expected future  undiscounted operating  cash flows  derived from  such
       assets are less than their carrying value.

       Income Taxes
       
       The Company uses  the liability  method of computing  deferred income
       taxes on all material temporary differences. Temporary differences  are
       the differences between the reported amounts of assets and  liabilities
       and their tax bases. The Company assesses realizability of deferred tax
       assets and, if necessary, a valuation allowance is provided.

       Earnings Per Share
       
       Net income (loss) per share is based upon the weighted average number
       of shares  outstanding  plus  the  shares  that  would  be  outstanding
       assuming exercise of dilutive stock options which are considered to  be
       common share equivalents.

       Note 3 - Debt
       
       The Company  has  unsecured  revolving credit  agreements  with  banks
       aggregating $40,000,000 at  February 1,  1997 of  which $30,000,000  is
       committed. These credit facilities are  for working capital and  letter
       of credit purposes, primarily  to fund seasonal merchandise  purchases,
       and bear interest at market rates based on prime. The credit agreements
       restrict dividend  payments, and  require  the maintenance  of  various
       financial ratios  and the  payment of  negotiated fees. The  revolving
       credit agreements expire July 15, 1997  and are expected to be  renewed
       under similar terms.   At February  1, 1997, there  were $7,904,000  in
       letters of  credit  outstanding  under all  credit  facilities,  issued
       principally  in  conjunction   with  overseas  merchandise   purchases.
       Interest expense and negotiated fees for Fiscal 1996, Fiscal 1995,  the
       Seven Month Period and Fiscal 1994 totaled $138,000, $67,000,  $380,000
       and $80,000, respectively.

       Note 4 - Commitments And Contingencies
       
       Store, distribution  and  field office  facilities  are  leased under
       operating leases expiring through 2011. The store leases are  generally
       based upon a  minimum rental plus  a percentage of  the store sales  in
       excess  of  specified  levels.  Store  lease  terms  generally  require
       additional payments  covering taxes,  common area  charges and  certain
       other costs. Rental  expense for Fiscal  1996, Fiscal  1995, the  Seven
       Month  Period  and  Fiscal   1994  totaled  $39,502,000,   $40,181,000,
       $25,140,000 and $31,850,000, respectively.

        The minimum rental commitments for future fiscal years are as follows

       The  Company  has  certain   contingent  liabilities  resulting  from
       litigation and  claims incident  to the  ordinary course  of  business.
       Management believes that the probable resolution of such contingencies
       will not  materially  affect the  financial  position or results  of
       operations of the Company.


       Note 5 - Employee Benefit Plans
       
       The Bombay Company, Inc. Employee 401(k)  Savings and Stock Ownership
       Plan ("401(k) Plan") is open to substantially all  employees who have
       been employed for one year and who work at least 1,000 hours per  year.
       Under the  401(k) Plan,  a  participant may  contribute  up to  14%  of
       earnings with the Company matching the first 5% at a rate of 150%.  The
       employee contributions are paid to a corporate trustee and invested  in
       various funds.  Company contributions  are  generally invested  in  its
       common stock, and contributions  made to participants' accounts  become
       fully vested upon completion of two  years of service. Similar  benefit
       plans are in effect for eligible foreign employees.

       To the extent employees  are unable to  contribute up to  5% of their
       earnings to  the 401(k)  Plan because  of  limitations imposed  by  IRS
       regulations, a  Supplemental  Stock  Program was  adopted.  Under  this
       program, employee  contributions in  excess of  IRS limitations,  along
       with Company matching  contributions, are distributed  annually in  the
       form of common stock.

       The Bombay Company, Inc. Stock Purchase  Program is open to all full-
       time  employees  who  have  at  least  six  months  of  service.   Each
       participant may contribute  5% or 10%  of qualifying compensation.  For
       participants with at least  two years of  service, the Company  matches
       50% of  the  participant's  contribution.  Contributions  are  used  to
       purchase shares of Company common stock, which are distributed annually
       to all participants.  The participants'  shares are  fully vested  upon
       purchase.

       Total Company contributions  to these  plans for Fiscal  1996, Fiscal
       1995,  the  Seven  Month  Period  and  Fiscal  1994  were   $1,667,000,
       $1,665,000, $992,000 and $1,857,000, respectively. For Fiscal 1997, the
       Company reduced its  401(k) and Supplemental  Stock Program match  from
       150% to  75% and  has  temporarily suspended  its  match on  the  Stock
       Purchase Program.

       Note 6 - Common Stock And Stock Options
       
       On December 1, 1993, the Board  of Directors declared a three-for-two
       common stock  split. The  split was  payable on  December 31,  1993 to
       holders of  record on  December 14,  1993.  Average common  shares and
       common equivalent shares outstanding,  income per average common  share
       and common equivalent  share, stock option  shares and exercise  prices
       reflect all splits paid through December 31, 1993.

       Non-employee directors are eligible to participate  in the 1993 Stock
       Deferral Plan for Non-Employee  Directors, which allows such  directors
       the option  to defer  receipt of  annual  retainer payments  which  are
       credited to an account for such director in units equivalent to Company
       common stock.

       Each share  of  Company  common stock  includes one  Preferred  Share
       Purchase Right  ("Right") entitling  the  holder  to  buy  one  one-
       thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred  Stock
       of the Company at an exercise  price of $50.00. The Rights, which  have
       ten year terms expiring in 2005,  are exercisable if a person or  group
       acquires 15% or more of the common stock of the Company or announces  a
       tender offer for 15% or more of the common stock. If a person or  group
       acquires 15% or more  of the outstanding common  stock of the  Company,
       each Right will entitle the holder to purchase, at the Right's exercise
       price, a number of shares of Company common stock having a market value
       of twice the Right's  exercise price. If the  Company is acquired in  a
       merger or  other business  combination transaction  after a  person  or
       group acquires 15% or  more of the Company's  common stock, each  Right
       will entitle its holder to purchase,  at the Right's exercise price,  a
       number of  shares of  the acquiring  company's  common stock  having  a
       market value  of  twice the  Right's  exercise price.  The  Rights  are
       redeemable at  one  cent per  Right  at  any time  before  they  become
       exercisable.

       The Bombay Company,  Inc. 1986 Stock  Option Plan and  1996 Long Term
       Incentive Stock Plan ("Employee Plans") provide for the  granting of
       options (and other types of stock-related  awards under the 1996  plan)
       to officers  and key  management employees.  At February  1, 1997,  the
       option shares  reserved  for the  Employee  Plans were  3,663,066.  The
       option price is fixed at the market price or higher on the date of  the
       grant. Options are generally exercisable annually at a rate of 20%  per
       year beginning at least one year after the grant date. Shares available
       for additional grants were 1,096,403;  388,387; 506,194 and 478,175  at
       February 1, 1997, February 3, 1996, January 28, 1995 and  July 3, 1994,
       respectively.

       The Bombay Company, Inc. 1991  Director Stock Option Plan  ("Director
       Plan") provides for the granting of options to members of the Board of
       Directors who are  neither employees nor  officers of  the Company.  At
       February 1, 1997, the option shares reserved for the Director Plan were
       195,192. The option price is fixed at  the market price on the date  of
       the grant. The maximum grant, initial and annual, is 4,000 shares.  The
       initial grant becomes exercisable at a  rate of 20% per year  beginning
       one year after the  grant date and includes  past Board service  toward
       full vesting of the initial grant. Each additional annual grant becomes
       fully exercisable six months after the grant date. Shares available for
       additional grants were 18,633; 52,883; 73,133 and 93,383 at February 1,
       1997,  February  3,  1996,   January  28,  1995   and  July  3,   1994,

       The Company has  adopted the disclosure-only  provisions of Statement
       of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123. "Accounting for Stock-Based
       Compensation."  Accordingly, no compensation  cost has been  recognized
       for options  granted. Had  compensation cost  for the  Company's  stock
       option plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant  date
       for awards  in Fiscal  1995  and Fiscal  1996  in accordance  with  the
       provisions of SFAS  No. 123, the  Company's net income  (loss) and  net
       income (loss)  per share  would  have been  reduced  to the  pro  forma
       amounts indicated below (in thousands, except per share amounts):

       The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
       using the Black-Scholes option-pricing  model based upon the  following
       assumptions: expected  volatility  of 78.6%;  risk-free  interest  rate
       ranging from 5.44% to 7.12%; expected lives of 6 years and no  expected
       dividend payments. The weighted average  fair value of options  granted
       during Fiscal 1996 and Fiscal 1995 was $4.96 and $6.66, respectively.

       The exercise of  non-qualified stock  options in Fiscal  1996, Fiscal
       1995, the Seven  Month Period and  Fiscal 1994 resulted  in income  tax
       benefits of $558,000,  $832,000, $7,000  and $6,114,000,  respectively,
       which were  credited  to additional  paid-in  capital. The  income  tax
       benefits are the tax effect of the difference between the market  price
       on the date of exercise and the option price.

       Note 7 - Geographic Areas  
       
       The Company operates  in one  industry segment,  specialty retailing.
       Substantially all revenues result from the sale of home furnishings and
       accessories through  retail stores  in the  United States  and  Canada.
       Operating profit by  geographic area  is total  revenue less  operating
       expenses. Area  operating expenses  exclude  interest expense,  net  of
       interest income,  and income  taxes. Identifiable  assets by  area  are
       those assets used in the area's operations, including intangibles.

       On  January   12,  1995,   the  Board   of  Directors   approved  the
       establishment of $50  million in pre-tax  reserves, equal  to $.80  per
       share after tax, for the closing of  the Company's Alex & Ivy chain  of
       retail stores,  inventory writedowns  and streamlining  divisional  and
       corporate structure. The components of the $50 million are $41  million
       representing the estimated costs  of closing the Alex  & Ivy chain,  $5
       million for inventory writedowns to reposition Bombay merchandise lines
       and sell off discontinued items, and $4 million  representing  estimated
       costs,  principally  severance,  to streamline operations, including the
       consolidation  of divisional and corporate overheads. During  Fiscal
       1995,  $6 million  of the  original reserve  was  reversed  based
       primarily  upon  favorable  results of negotiated lease  terminations,
       thereby reflecting  lower  costs  than originally projected. All Alex &
       Ivy  stores were closed as of May  10, 1995 and all store lease
       termination agreements were fully executed  as of July 29, 1995.
       Approximately 880  full and part-time employees  were affected by the
       closing of the Alex & Ivy chain. Alex & Ivy sales  were $14,729,000,
       $24,128,000  and $16,704,000  for Fiscal  1995, the  Seven Month Period
       and Fiscal 1994, respectively. Excluding costs or  credits relating to 
       the  closure  of  the  division,  operating  results  were breakeven in
       Fiscal 1995 and losses before income taxes were $1,548,000 and
       $2,863,000  for the Seven Month Period and Fiscal 1994, respectively.
       

       The following table sets forth the  components of the reserve to  close
       Alex & Ivy stores:

       Note 11 - Store Conversion Costs
       
       On February  18, 1993,  the Board  of  Directors approved  a  plan to
       convert substantially all existing Bombay stores to a large format.  In
       the quarter ended March 28, 1993, a charge of $13,000,000 was recorded,
       principally relating to the noncash cost  of writing off the  remaining
       book value  of leasehold  improvements at  the time  Bombay stores  are
       converted. The reserve balance at February  1, 1997, February 3,  1996,
       January 28,  1995  and July  3,  1994 totaled  $3,640,000,  $5,323,000,
       $6,953,000 and $8,426,000, respectively.



       Management's Report
       
       The management of  The Bombay  Company, Inc.  is responsible  for the
       preparation, integrity and fair presentation of its published financial
       statements. The financial statements, presented on pages 16 to 24, have
       been  prepared  in  accordance   with  generally  accepted   accounting
       principles and,  as  such,  include  amounts  based  on  judgments  and
       estimates made  by  management. The  Company  also prepared  the  other
       information included in the  report to shareholders and is  responsible
       for its accuracy and consistency with the financial statements.

       The Company maintains internal accounting control systems and related
       policies and procedures designed  to provide reasonable assurance  that
       assets are safeguarded,  that transactions are  executed in  accordance
       with management's  authorization and  are properly  recorded, and  that
       accounting records may be relied upon for the preparation of  financial
       statements and other financial information. The design, monitoring  and
       revision of internal  accounting control systems  involve, among  other
       things, management's judgment  with respect to  the relative costs  and
       expected benefits  of  specific  control measures.  Also,  an  internal
       auditing function which evaluates and formally reports on the  adequacy
       and  effectiveness  of  internal  accounting  controls,  policies   and
       procedures is maintained.

       There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any  system of
       internal control,  including the  possibility of  human error  and  the
       circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective
       internal control  system can  provide  only reasonable  assurance  with
       respect  to   financial   statement   preparation.   Furthermore,   the
       effectiveness  of   an  internal   control  system   can  change   with
       circumstances.

       The Audit and Finance  Committee of the Board  of Directors, which is
       composed solely of directors who are  not officers or employees of  the
       Company, meets  regularly with  corporate management,  internal  audit,
       legal counsel and Price Waterhouse LLP to review the activities of each
       and  to  satisfy   itself  that  each   is  properly  discharging   its
       responsibility. In  addition, the  Audit  and Finance  Committee  meets
       formally with  Price Waterhouse  LLP,  without management  present,  to
       discuss the audit of the financial statements as well as other auditing
       and financial reporting matters.

       The financial statements have  been audited by  Price Waterhouse LLP,
       the  independent  accountants,  whose  report  herein  expresses  their
       opinion with  respect  to  the fairness  of  the  presentation  of  the
       statements.

<AUDIT-REPORT>
       Independent Accountants' Report

       To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
       The Bombay Company, Inc.

       In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated  balance sheets and the
       related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders'  equity
       and of  cash  flows  present fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the
       financial position of The Bombay Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries  at
       February 1,  1997  and February  3,  1996,  and the  results  of  their
       operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period
       ended February 1, 1997, for the seven months ended January 28, 1995 and
       for the year ended July 3, 1994, in conformity with generally  accepted
       accounting   principles.   These    financial   statements   are    the
       responsibility of the  Company's management; our  responsibility is  to
       express an opinion on these financial  statements based on our  audits.
       We  conducted  our  audits  of  these  statements  in  accordance  with
       generally accepted auditing  standards which require  that we plan  and
       perform the  audit to  obtain reasonable  assurance about  whether  the
       financial statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement.  An  audit
       includes examining, on  a test basis,  evidence supporting the  amounts
       and disclosures in the  financial statements, assessing the  accounting
       principles used  and  significant  estimates made  by  management,  and
       evaluating the  overall financial  statement presentation.  We  believe
       that our audits provide  a reasonable basis  for the opinion  expressed
       above.

       As discussed  in  Note 1  to  the financial  statements,  the Company
       changed its method of  accounting for inventory  during the year  ended
       February 1, 1997.

                 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants
            hereinafter set forth for other good and valuable
            consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                 1.   Grant of Award.  The Company hereby grants to
            Employee the right and option (the "Option") to purchase
            an aggregate of         shares of  the Company's Shares,
                             ------
            such Shares being subject to adjustment as provided in
            paragraph 8 hereof, and on the terms and conditions herein
            set forth.  The Shares granted pursuant to this Option (the
            "Option Shares") are granted as a nonqualified option.

                  2.   Purchase Price.  The purchase price of the Option
            Shares shall be $4.75 per Share, such purchase price being
            100% of the fair market value of such Shares on the
            date first appearing above (the "Date of the Grant").

                 3.   Exercise of Award.  Unless expired as provided in
            paragraph 5 below, and subject to the special provisions of
            paragraph 6 below, the Award for Option Shares may be
            exercised from time to time in whole or in part for not more
            than 20% of the entire number of Option Shares at any time
            after the first annaiversary of the Date of Grant, and an
            additional 20% of the total Option Shares on, or after the
            first each of the four (4) succeeding anniversaries of the
            Date of Grant.

                 4.   Manner of Exercise; Payment of Purchase Price.
                      A.   Subject to the terms and conditions of this
            Agreement, the Award shall be exercised by written notice to
            the Company at its principal office.  Such notice shall
            state the election to exercise the Award and shall specify
            the number of Option Shares sought to be exercised pursuant
            to the notice.  Such notice of exercise shall be signed by
            Employee and shall be irrevocable when given.
                      B.   The notice of exercise shall be accompanied
            by the full payment of the purchase price for the Option
            Shares in cash by certified check or bank cashiers check or
            through satisfactory arrangements for payment by a broker
            representing the Employee in the sale of some or all of the
            Option Shares.  Subject to approval of an authorized
            Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee"),
            payment of the purchase price may be accomplished by the
            surrender of stock certificates representing Shares having
            an aggregate fair market value on the date of exercise equal
            to the purchase price of the Option Shares, or by a
            combination of cash and Shares.

                      C.   Upon receipt of the purchase price, and
            subject to the terms of paragraph 11, a certificate
            representing the Option Shares exercised shall be registered
            in the name of the person or persons so exercising the
            Award.  In the event the Award shall be exercised pursuant
            to paragraph 7, by any person or persons other than the
            Employee, such notice shall be accompanied by appropriate
            proof satisfactory to the Company of the right of such
            person or persons to exercise the Award.  All Shares issued
            as a result of an exercise of an Award as provided herein
            shall be fully paid and non-assessable.

                      D.   The payment of witholding tax liability by
            Employee shall be a condition precedent to the Company's
            obligation to issue any certificates for Shares  resulting
            from an exercise of an Award.

                 5.   Exercise and Expiration of Award.  This Award, if
            not exercised, shall expire and become null and void upon
            the expiration of three (3) months after Employee ceases to
            be employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries unless
            such termination shall have been for cause, as determined by
            the Committee, in which event the Award shall be null and
            void as of the date of such termination.  Notwithstanding
            the above, if Employee retires from the Company or any of
            its subsidiaries (as determined by the Committee in its sole
            discretion), the Award may, at the Committee's discretion
            remain exercisable for a period not to exceed 36 months
            following such retirement.  In the event of Employee's death
            or permanent disability, the Award shall be exercisable for
            a period of 12 months following such death or disability.
            Notwithstanding the above, the Award shall, without
            exception, become null and void once a period of 10 years
            shall have lapsed since the Date of Grant.  Except as
            provided in paragraph 6 below, only those portions of this
            Award vested as of the date of  termination of Employee's
            employment may be exercised.

                 6.   Acceleration of Exercise Dates.   Notwithstanding
            the provisions of paragraph 3 above relating to the vesting
            of this Award in installments, the Committee may, in its
            discretion, permit this Award to be immediately exercisable,
            until the expiration date provided in paragraph 5 above, for
            the entire number of Option Shares covered hereby upon the
            retirement of Employee or any Change in Control of  the
            Company (as defined in the Plan).

                 7.   Award Nontransferable.  Unless permitted by law
            regulation and approved by the Committee, the Award and any
            right related thereto shall not be transferable by Employee
            otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and
            distribution and may be exercised during Employee's
            lifetime, only by Employee.  Upon the death of employee, the
            award may be exercised by Employee's executor,
            administrator, legatee or distributee, as the case may be.

                 8.   Adjustments of Shares Subject to Award.  If any
            Shares shall at any time be changed or exchanged by reason
            of reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization,
            reclassification, stock split, combination of shares or a
            dividend payable in stock, then the aggregate number of
            Option Shares subject to this Agreement and the purchase
            price of such Option Shares shall be automatically adjusted
            such that Employee's proportionate interest shall be
            maintained as before the occurrence of  such event.  The
            determination of any such adjustment by the Committee shall
            be final, binding and conclusive.

                 9.   No Contract.  This Agreement does not constitute a
            contract for employment and  shall not affect the right of
            the Company to terminate Employee's employment for any
            reason whatsoever.

                10.   Rights as Shareholder.  This Award shall not
            entitle Employee or any permitted transferee to any rights
            of a shareholder of  the Company or to any notice of
            proceedings of the Company with respect to any Option Shares
            issuable upon exercise of this Award unless and until the
            Award has been exercised for such Shares.

                11.   Restriction on Issuance of Shares.  The
            Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any
            certificates for Shares purchased upon the exercise of an
            Award prior to the obtaining of any approval from any
            governmental agency which the Company shall, in its sole
            discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable, and the
            completion of any registration or other qualification of
            such Shares under any state or federal law or ruling or
            regulations of any governmental body which the Company
            shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or
            advisable.  In addition, if shares reserved for issuance
            upon exercise of Awards shall not then be registered under
            the Securities Act of 1933 the Company may, upon Employee's
            exercise of an Award, require Employee or his permitted
            transferee to represent in writing that the Shares being
            acquired are for investment and not with a view to
            distribution, and may mark the certificate for the Shares
            with a legend restricting transfer and may issue stop
            transfer orders relating to such certificate to the transfer
            agent.

                12.   Lapse of Award.  The Agreement shall be null and
            void in the event Employee shall fail to sign and return a
            counterpart hereof to the Company within thirty (30) days of
            its delivery to Employee.

                13.   Binding Effect.  This Agreement shall be binding
            upon this heirs, executors, administrators, and successors
            of  the parties hereto.

                14.   Governing Instrument and Law.  This Award and any
            Shares issued hereunder shall in all respects be governed by
            the terms and provisions of the Plan, and by the laws of the
            State of Texas, and in the event of a conflict between the
            terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms
            of the Plan shall control.

                     Letter re:  Change in Accounting Principles
                                     Exhibit 18




       March 11, 1997

       To the Board of Directors of
       The Bombay Company, Inc.

       Dear Directors:

       We have audited the consolidated financial statements incorporated by
       reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
       ended February 1, 1997 and issued our report thereon dated March 11,
       1997.  Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes a
       change in the Company's method of allocating overhead costs to
       inventory.  The change was made to improve the accuracy of inventory
       valuation by applying overhead costs to inventory as the costs are
       incurred.  It should be understood that the preferability of one
       acceptable method of inventory accounting over another has not been
       addressed in any authoritative accounting literature and in arriving at
       our opinion expressed below, we have relied on management's business
       planning and judgment.  Based on our discussions with management and
       the stated reasons for the change, we believe that such change
       represents, in your circumstances, the adoption of a preferable
       alternative accounting principle for inventories in conformity with
       Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20.

       Yours very truly,
