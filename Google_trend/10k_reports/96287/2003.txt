                                    PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

(a) General Development of Business

The Bombay Company, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries  (the  "Company"  or
"Bombay")  design,  source  and  market  a  unique  line  of  fashionable  home
accessories,  wall  decor  and  furniture through a network of retail locations
throughout the United States and  Canada,  through specialty catalogs, over the
Internet and internationally through licensing arrangements.

Bombay's  unique  position  in  the  market place  is  a  result  of  its  core
competencies  in  design, sourcing and importing.   Approximately  90%  of  its
product is sourced  from  approximately  20 foreign countries.  Over 95% of the
product has been designed or styled to Bombay's specifications.

The Company is taking the opportunity to expand  its product offering to a line
of children's furniture, textiles and accessories.  Following  its introduction
through catalog and Internet in Fiscal 2001, the Company opened  its first five
BombayKIDS  stores  during  Fiscal  2002.  Four  of  these  stores  reflect   a
combination  format  with  a  BombayKIDS store adjacent to a core Bombay store.
The Company intends to open 25  to  30  BombayKIDS stores in the next year, and
grow this portion of the business to over 100 stores over the next three years.

In addition to its primary retail operations,  the  Company has other operating
initiatives underway which contributed incrementally to profitability but which
were  not  significant  to  the  Company's operations in Fiscal  2002.   Unless
specified otherwise, the discussions  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relate
to the Bombay retail operations, including BombayKIDS and outlets.

 (b) Financial Information About Segments

The  Company  operates primarily in one business  segment  as  a  multi-channel
retailer selling decorative home furnishings, furniture and related items.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

Merchandise Sales, Purchasing and Distribution

Bombay operates  a  chain  of  stores,  located  primarily in regional shopping
malls, certain secondary malls and selected urban  and  suburban locations.  As
of February 1, 2003, there were 370 Bombay stores in 42 states  in  the  United
States  and  52  stores  in  nine  Canadian provinces.  Bombay also markets its
products through its mail order operations  in the United States and Canada and
through   e-commerce   over   the   Internet   at   www.bombaycompany.com   and
www.bombay.ca.

The Company offers a diverse selection of products consisting  of approximately
4,400  stock keeping units ("SKUs") of which over 95% of the product  has  been
designed  or  styled  to Bombay's specifications.  Bombay's proprietary product
offers unique design, quality  and  exceptional  value  to  a  wide audience of
consumers.   The  Company  regularly  updates  its  merchandise  assortment  by
introducing new products while discontinuing others.  The Company has a fashion
component  to  its  product  offerings,  primarily  in  the accessory and  wall
d{e'}cor  areas,  which is introduced seasonally.  Other products  with  longer
lives  are discontinued  as  they  approach  the  end  of  their  life  cycles.
Approximately  2,600  new  SKUs  were introduced in both Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal
2001.   Typically,  new  product  introductions  are  concentrated  during  the
Company's  spring,  fall  and  Christmas   marketing  periods.   The  principal
categories of merchandise include the following:

Furniture - The Company sells two broad categories  of  furniture  as described
below.   Bombay's  furniture is manufactured by contract manufacturers  located
principally in China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia and India.

     Occasional  Furniture  -  This category includes wood and metal hall
     tables, end and coffee tables, plant stands and other small accent tables,
     stands  and  curios  that  are  ready-to-assemble,   take  home  products.
     Occasional furniture represented 12%, 12% and 8% of total  sales in Fiscal
     2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     Large  Furniture  -  This  category  includes  both  wood and  metal
     furniture  focusing  on  the  bedroom, living room, dining room  and  home
     office.  Many of the larger items  are  displayed  in store and stocked in
     the Company's distribution centers, available for store delivery typically
     within ten days.  Large furniture represented 32%, 31%  and  37%  of total
     sales in Fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

<PAGE> 3

Accessories - This is the broadest category and represented 43%, 43% and 41% of
total  sales  in  Fiscal  2002,  2001  and  2000,  respectively.  This category
includes both functional and decorative accessories  including  lamps,  jewelry
and  memorabilia  boxes,  baskets, crystal, ceramics, frames and desktop items,
textiles, floral, candles and  holiday.   The  items  are imported from over 15
countries in Asia, North America and Europe.

Wall   Decor   -   This   category   includes   prints,   mirrors   and    wall
accessories, which represented 13%, 14% and 14% of total sales in Fiscal 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively.  This merchandise is sourced primarily from the
United States, various countries in Asia and Canada.

Merchandise  is  manufactured  to  Company  specifications through a network of
contract  manufacturers  located  principally  in   Asia   and  North  America.
Approximately 90% of production needs are sourced from foreign  countries.  The
Company  has branch offices located in Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia,  China  and
Vietnam and utilizes agents in various countries to locate prospective vendors,
coordinate  production  requirements  with  manufacturers and provide technical
expertise and quality control.

Bombay is not dependent on any particular supplier  and  has  had long standing
relationships with many of its vendors.  Over 65% of the Company's  merchandise
requirements  are  supplied  by 35 contract manufacturers in 11 countries.   No
long-term production agreements are in place; however, agreements are generally
in place with major manufacturers  that  prohibit the production of proprietary
product for other parties.  Additional manufacturing  capacity  and alternative
sources,  both  domestic  and  international, continue to be added through  new
vendors and plant expansions by  existing  vendors.   The Company does business
with its vendors principally in United States currency and has not historically
experienced  any  material  disruptions  as a result of any foreign  political,
economic or social instabilities.

Usually it takes several months from the time  a  merchandise  order  is placed
with  a  manufacturer  until  the  goods  are received at regional distribution
centers in the United States and Canada.  Depending on the category, the source
country and whether an item is new or a reordered  product, lead times can vary
from as little as two months to as much as twelve months  from  order placement
until arrival at the stores.  Order times are slightly less for North  American
manufacturers  principally due to shorter shipping times.  Lead times may  also
be impacted by seasonality  factors especially in months when manufacturers are
producing at or near peak capacity  to  meet  seasonal  demands.   As a result,
Bombay  strives  to maintain an adequate inventory position in its distribution
centers to ensure a sufficient supply of products to its customers.

Store inventories are replenished from regional distribution centers located in
Fort Worth, Texas;  McDonough, Georgia; Gilbertsville, Pennsylvania; Mira Loma,
California and Mississauga, Ontario. The Company plans to open a 300,000 square
foot distribution center  in  Plainfield,  Indiana  during the third quarter of
Fiscal 2003.  The distribution centers are strategically  located  and  provide
the  capability  to replenish the majority of store inventories within 48 hours
of when the order  is  processed.   The Company uses dedicated trucks and less-
than-truckload carriers to transport  its product from its distribution centers
to the stores.

Channels of Distribution

RETAIL

Stores and Real Estate

Historically, the Company has located its stores primarily in regional shopping
malls, certain secondary malls and selected  urban  and suburban locations that
satisfy  its  demographic and financial return criteria.   Over  the  next  two
years, 188 of the Company's store leases will come up for renewal.  The Company
is currently pursuing  an  off-mall  strategy  focusing  on  open-air lifestyle
centers,  high-end  strip  and  to  a  lesser  extent  street locations.   Such
locations  offer  the opportunity to lower occupancy costs,  improve  operating
efficiencies  and  provide  a  more  convenient  shopping  experience  for  our
customer.   The Company's  preference  is  to  identify  locations where it can
operate  a  combined  Bombay and BombayKIDS store, thereby realizing  economies
that come with a larger location while attracting a new and younger customer to
Bombay.

In selecting store locations,  the  Company's  real  estate department conducts
extensive  analyses of potential store sites and bases  its  selection  on  the
performance  of  other specialty retail tenants, the size of the market and the
demographics  of  the  surrounding  area.   In  evaluating  a  store  location,
placement of the store relative to retail traffic patterns and customer base of
other  retailers  in   the   nearby   vicinity  are  important  considerations.
Significant  attention  is  given  to  visual  merchandising  opportunities  to
maximize  the  ability  to display product  in  the  most  attractive  setting.
Currently 79% of the stores are mall based.  The Company will seek out the most
potentially profitable locations  for  the  opening of new stores regardless of
the venue. The Company is currently targeting 8,500 square foot locations where
it  can  construct a Bombay store of approximately  4,500  square  feet  and  a
BombayKIDS  store  of  approximately 4,000 square feet.  Bombay mall stores are
slightly smaller in size  currently  averaging approximately 3,600 square feet.
New Bombay off-mall locations are expected  to  be in the 4,000 to 5,000 square

<PAGE> 4

foot range while mall stores are expected to be in  the  3,500  to 4,500 square
foot range.   In addition to building new stores, the Company will  continue to
selectively  convert  its  existing regular stores, which average approximately
1,800 square feet to the larger  format.  As of February 1, 2003, there were 37
regular stores left in the chain.

At February 1, 2003, the store chain included a total of 46 outlet stores.  The
Company views the use of outlets as  an  opportunity  to  increase  sales  to a
different  customer base, to assist in the orderly clearance of merchandise and
to further capitalize  on  its  strength  in designing and sourcing proprietary
product.

Following is a table summarizing the Company's store activity and composition:

</TABLE>

During  Fiscal  2003, the Company plans to open  approximately  75  to  85  new
stores, which includes  25  to  30  BombayKIDS stores and two outlet locations.
The Company plans to close 30 to 35 stores,  ending the year with approximately
465 to 475 stores.   For store count purposes, a combined Bombay and BombayKIDs
location represents two stores.

The Company's average cost of leasehold improvements,  furniture,  fixtures and
machinery  for  stores (excluding outlets) opened or converted in Fiscal  2002,
net of landlord allowances,  was  approximately  $250,000  per store or $55 per
square  foot.   In  addition,  other  investments, which consist  primarily  of
inventory  in  the store location, averaged  approximately  $95,000  per  large
format store. The Company expects the average net cost of a BombayKIDs store to
be slightly higher  than  a  Bombay  large  format store, in total and on a per
square  foot  basis  due to higher fixturing costs.   Inventory  investment  is
expected to average $100,000 for  a  BombayKIDs  store.   The  average  cost of
leasehold  improvements,  furniture,  fixtures  and machinery for outlet stores
opened in Fiscal 2002, net of landlord allowances,  was  approximately $105,000
per  store  while the inventory investment averaged approximately  $75,000  per
store.  Inventory physically in store is approximately 40% of the total
inventory investment on a per store basis. Bombay  stores  typically  achieve
store level operating profitability during their first full year of operations
and reach maturity in three years.

Internet

The Company offers virtually all its retail SKUs for electronic commerce
through its websites for Bombay, BombayKIDS, Bombay Outlets and Bombay Canada,
which was launched in 2003.  The Company continues to pursue various online
marketing partnerships to broaden its reach to additional customers.  Business
to consumer revenues over the Internet were approximately $8 million in Fiscal
2002.  The Company also maintains websites supporting its wholesale activities.

WHOLESALE

Bailey Street Trading Company - During Fiscal 2000, the Company created a
wholesale division, Bailey Street Trading Company ("Bailey Street").  The brand
is separate from Bombay and allows the Company to capitalize on its strengths
in product design, sourcing and importing.  Current product offerings are
focused on furniture but may be expanded to include wall decor and accessories
in the future.  Bailey Street distributes its merchandise to a variety of
customers including independent gift stores, catalogers, department stores,
furniture stores and mass merchants through a network of independent regional
sales representatives.  During Fiscal 2002, Bailey Street exceeded its revenue
goals, reaching $8.4 million compared to $2.2 million in Fiscal 2001.

International - Bombay International, Inc. ("International") is the Company's
international licensing distribution channel.  International operations have
extended to ten licensed stores as of the end of Fiscal 2002 operating in the
Middle East and the Caribbean. International revenues more than doubled to $3.5
million.  In the short-term, the Company plans to continue expansion abroad
through licensing and distribution agreements in existing markets or with
current partners.  During Fiscal 2003, approximately six to eight additional
International stores are planned to open by our licensees.

Intangibles

The Company  owns  a  number  of  the  trademarks and service marks used in its
business, including federal registrations  for  the  marks "The Bombay Company"
and  "Bombay",  and  the  palm  tree logo.  The Company's trademarks  are  also
registered or are the subject of  pending  applications  in a number of foreign
countries.   Each registration is renewable indefinitely if  the  mark is still
in  use at the time of renewal.  Appropriate applications are on file  for  the
new wholesale business.

The Company  believes that its trademarks have significant value and that these
marks enhance  the  Bombay{reg-trade-mark}  brand  and  are instrumental in the
Company's ability to create, sustain demand for and market  its  product.  From
time  to  time,  the  Company  discovers  products in the marketplace that  are
counterfeit reproductions of the Company's  product  or that otherwise infringe
upon trademark or tradedress rights held by the Company.   The  Company has and
will continue to vigorously defend it rights under the marks as necessary.

Seasonality

Operating results are subject to seasonal variation.  Historically, the largest
proportion  of sales and substantially all of the income occurs in  the  fiscal
quarter that  includes  the Christmas season.  Inventory balances are generally
built  to  their  highest  levels   prior  to  the  Christmas  selling  season.
Inventories decline and cash balances increase significantly in December due to
the Christmas business.

Leases generally have 10 year terms,  expiring  between  2003  and 2013.  Rents
under  the  store  leases  are  generally  based upon a minimum rental  plus  a
percentage of the store sales in excess of specified  levels. Store lease terms
generally require additional payments covering taxes, common  area  charges and
certain  other  costs.  Rental expense for Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and  Fiscal
2000 totaled $50,669,000, $47,366,000 and $45,137,000, respectively.

years related to real estate properties  totaling  $206,508,000.  Subsequent to

adequate.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

The  Company  has certain contingent liabilities resulting from litigation  and
claims incident  to  the  ordinary course of business. Management believes that
the probable resolution of  such  contingencies  will not materially affect the
financial position or results of operations of the Company.

On February 13, 2003, the Company agreed to settle  a  wage and hour lawsuit in
California.  The action alleged that the Company had improperly  classified its
California store managers as exempt from overtime pay and sought to recoup such
pay  on behalf of the class.  In order to avoid the expense of the  litigation,
the Company  agreed  to settle the action for approximately $1,350,000, subject
to final documentation and judicial approval in due course.  The settlement was
included in selling, general  and  administrative expenses during the Company's
Fiscal 2002 fourth quarter.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of Fiscal 2002.

ITEM  7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

General
The Bombay Company, Inc. ("Company" or "Bombay") designs, sources and markets a
unique  line  of  fashionable  home  accessories,  wall  d{e'}cor and furniture
through 422 retail stores in 42 states in the United States  and  nine Canadian
provinces, through specialty catalogs and over the Internet principally  in the
U.S. and Canada. Merchandise is manufactured to Company specification through a
network  of  contract  manufacturers  in  approximately  20  countries  located
principally in Asia and North America.

In  addition  to  its  primary retail operations, the Company has several other
operating initiatives underway,  all  of  which  contributed  incrementally  to
profitability  but  which  were  not significant to the Company's operations in
Fiscal 2002.

Following its introduction through  catalog  and  Internet  in Fiscal 2001, the
first BombayKIDS stores, featuring children's furniture, textile  and accessory
collections,  were  opened  in  Fiscal  2002.  Four  of these stores reflect  a
combination format with a BombayKIDS store adjacent to  a  core  Bombay  store.
Sales  of  BombayKIDS  product,  both through store locations as well as direct
marketing, increased to $8.2 million  from  $1.9  million  last  year. With the
success and potential of this product line, the Company intends to  open  25 to
30 BombayKIDS stores in the next year, and grow this portion of the business to
over 100 stores over the next three years.

Bailey Street Trading Company ("Bailey Street"), which represents the Company's
wholesale  operations,  began in Fiscal 2000. During Fiscal 2002, Bailey Street
exceeded its revenue goals,  reaching  $8.4  million in Fiscal 2002 compared to
$2.2 million in Fiscal 2001.  Bailey Street continues  to  expand  its customer
base  which  includes  independent gift stores, catalogers, department  stores,
furniture stores and mass merchants.

Bombay International, Inc.  ("International")  has  expanded  to  ten  licensed
stores  currently operating in the Middle East and the Caribbean. International
revenues  more than doubled in Fiscal 2002, to $3.5 million. By partnering with
strong licensees in opportunistic markets, International continues to offer the
Company the potential for growth with limited capital investment. During Fiscal
2003, approximately six to eight additional International stores are planned to
open.

The largest  percentage of the Company's sales and operating income is realized
in the fiscal quarter that includes December (Christmas season).

Because the majority  of  the Company's products are proprietary, the impact of
inflation on operating results  is  typically  not  significant.    The Company
attempts  to  alleviate  inflationary  pressures  by improving designs, finding
alternative production sources in lower cost countries  and  increasing selling
prices (subject to competitive conditions).

The  Company  has a retail (52-53 week) fiscal year that ends on  the  Saturday
nearest January 31. Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001 represent 52 week periods while
Fiscal 2000 included 53 weeks.

Net  revenues increased $56.5 million, or 13%, to $494.0 million,  compared  to
$437.5  million in Fiscal 2001. Revenues from retail operations increased $48.3
million, or 11%, from the prior year. Same store sales (stores in existence for
one year  or  more)  increased  5% for the year. New stores also contributed to
revenue growth, as the Company opened  14  large format stores, 9 outlets and 5
BombayKIDS  stores  while expanding 2 stores from  the  regular  to  the  large
format. Sales growth  from  new  real  estate  activity was partially offset by
store closures. Internet and mail order revenues grew 73% to $20.6 million from
$11.9 million last year, fueled by sales of BombayKIDS  product and improvement
made to the Company's website. The remainder of the increase  was the result of
growth in the Company's wholesale operations. Bailey Street revenues  increased
to  $8.4  million  in  Fiscal  2002  from its prior year level of $2.2 million.
International revenues more than doubled  to  approximately $3.5 million in the
current year.

From  a  merchandise  mix  standpoint,  all categories  increased  in  dollars.
However, growth in furniture outpaced the  other categories due to the improved
in-stock position and the improved selling environment  for  big  ticket  items
compared  to  last  year.  Sales in Fiscal 2002 consisted of 44% furniture, 43%
accessories and 13% wall decor.  In  Fiscal  2001,  the  sales  mix  was 43%
furniture,  43%  accessories  and  14%  wall  decor.  The  number  of retail
transactions for the year increased 7% and the average ticket increased  4%  to
$82 from $79 last year.

All  regions  of the U.S. and Canada reported mid single-digit same store sales
increases. At the  end  of  Fiscal  2002,  the Company had 334 large stores, 37
regular stores, 46 outlets and five BombayKIDS  stores.   During  the  year, 25
stores were closed. Total retail square footage increased 5% compared to  year-
end Fiscal 2001, while the number of stores increased by a net 3 units.

Fiscal 2001

Net  revenues  increased  $14.0  million, or 3%, to $437.5 million, compared to
$423.5 million in Fiscal 2000 primarily  due  to new store openings. During the
year, the Company opened 32 new stores, including  12  outlets,  and 18 regular
stores were converted to the large store format. These increases were partially
offset by the closure of 21 stores. Same store sales declined 2% for  the year.
The lack of a 53rd week during Fiscal 2001 adversely impacted sales comparisons
by  approximately  2%.  At  the  end  of Fiscal 2001, the Company had 324 large
stores, 59 regular stores and 36 outlets  resulting in a 10% increase in retail
square footage.

Our customers' resistance to big-ticket purchases during the year resulted in a
shift in the overall product mix. Furniture  sales were 43% of the total during
Fiscal  2001  compared  to  45%  in  Fiscal 2000. Accessories  represented  43%
compared to 41% in the prior year, while  wall  d{e'}cor  (principally  prints,
mirrors  and  sconces) accounted for 14% in both years. Total transactions  for
the year increased  2%  while  the average ticket remained constant at $79. The
growth in the accessories business  resulted  in  an  increase  in  the average
number of items per transaction year over year, offsetting the impact of shifts
in the product mix.

All regions of the U.S. and Canada reported low single-digit same store sales
declines for the year.  Outlet stores continued to perform well during Fiscal
2001, reporting low single-digit same store sales gains.

</TABLE>


Fiscal 2002

Cost of sales, including buying and store occupancy costs, for Fiscal  2002 was
$349.6  million or 70.8% of revenues. As a percentage of revenues, these  costs
declined from 71.7% in Fiscal 2001. Product margins declined 40 basis points as
the Company  targeted  key  price  points to drive volume. Buying and occupancy
costs were 19.1% of revenues, a 130  basis  points  decline,  as  a  result  of
leveraging costs against the stronger sales levels.  Buying and occupancy costs
included impairment charges totaling $.7 million to write down the fixed assets
related to six unprofitable stores.

Fiscal 2001

Cost  of sales, including buying and store occupancy costs, for Fiscal 2001 was
$313.5  million  or 71.7% of revenues. As a percentage of revenues, these costs
increased from 69.4%  in Fiscal 2000. Product margins declined 130 basis points
as a result of the more  promotionally  driven  retail environment.  Same store
sales declines, which contributed to lower sales  per  square foot, resulted in
negative leverage of the buying and occupancy costs.

These costs were 20.4% of revenues, an increase of 90 basis  points compared to
the prior year. Buying and occupancy costs included an impairment charge of $.7
million to write down the fixed assets related to eleven unprofitable stores.


SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Fiscal 2002

Selling,  general and administrative expenses were $132.3 million  compared  to
$117.6 million in Fiscal 2001. As a percentage of sales, expenses were slightly
lower at 26.8%  in  Fiscal  2002  compared to 26.9% in Fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2002
included  a charge of $1.1 million relating  to  the  departure  of  the  Chief
Executive Officer  and  a  $1.3  million  charge related to the settlement of a
California wage and hour lawsuit.  Excluding  these  charges,  selling, general
and  administrative  costs  were  26.3%  of revenues. The Company was  able  to
leverage  costs  such  as store payroll, depreciation  and  other  fixed  costs
against the higher revenue  base. However, this leverage was somewhat offset by
increases  in  other areas including  investments  made  in  marketing,  higher
insurance costs and higher credit card costs as a result of a change in private
label credit card provider.

Fiscal 2001

Selling, general  and  administrative  expenses were $117.6 million compared to
$115.6 million in Fiscal 2000. Although  the  dollars increased $2.0 million or
1.8%, as a percentage of revenues, selling, general  and  administrative  costs
declined  from 27.3% in Fiscal 2000 to 26.9% in Fiscal 2001. The 40 basis point
decline is the result of strong controls over expenses throughout the year.


INTEREST

Fiscal 2002

During Fiscal  2002,  the  Company had interest income of $331,000 and interest
expense of $152,000, compared  to  interest  income  of  $248,000  and interest
expense  of $566,000 in Fiscal 2001.  Improvement resulted from higher  average
cash balances  generated  through  higher  sales  and  profits,  lower  capital
expenditures and lower average inventory levels, resulting in lower utilization
of the credit facility. In addition, borrowings were at lower interest rates.

Fiscal 2001

The  Company  had interest income of $248,000 and interest expense of $566,000,
compared to interest  income  of  $967,000  and interest expense of $424,000 in
Fiscal  2000.  Changes in interest amounts resulted  from  lower  average  cash
balances and greater  utilization  of  credit  facilities  due to the Company's
lower   operating   profits,  higher  average  inventory  levels  and   capital
expenditures.

<PAGE> 14

INCOME TAXES

The Company provided  income  taxes  of  $5.1  million,  $2.3  million and $5.8
million  in  Fiscal  2002,  Fiscal  2001  and  Fiscal  2000, respectively.  The
effective  rates  were  41.2%,  38.6%  and  40.0%  in  the respective  periods.
Fluctuations in the effective rate were primarily related to foreign taxes that
change in accordance with earnings in the Canadian subsidiary  and in state tax
expenses that have not changed proportionately to income before  income  taxes.
The  increased  effective rate during Fiscal 2002 was due primarily to a multi-
year tax settlement in Canada.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The primary sources  of  liquidity  and  capital  resources are cash flows from
operations  and  a  line of credit with banks. The Company  has  an  unsecured,
revolving credit agreement  with a group of banks, with an aggregate commitment
of up to $50.0 million for working  capital  and letter of credit purposes. The
bank commitment is limited to 45% of saleable  inventory.  At February 1, 2003,
the  bank  commitment  was $46.0 million, and $38.3 million was  available  for
borrowings or additional letters of credit. The credit facility expires July 5,
2005.

Fiscal 2002

At February 1, 2003, cash  and short-term investments were $56.6 million, $18.2
million higher than at February  2,  2002. The primary sources of cash were net
income including non-cash depreciation  and  amortization expense, increases in
payables including those related to higher inventory  purchases, taxes, payroll
and  insurance as well as proceeds from the exercise of  stock  options.  These
sources   were   partially  offset  by  higher  inventory  levels  and  capital
expenditures for store construction and routine equipment purchases.

At February 1, 2003,  inventory  levels  were  $13.0 million higher than at the
previous year end due to improved flow of product  to  support the strong sales
trend  experienced  during  the  second  half of Fiscal 2002,  and  to  support
continued growth into Fiscal 2003.

Capital expenditures totaled $10.2 million  and  included  the  costs of 28 new
stores and the conversion of two regular stores to the larger format,  as  well
as  continued  investments  in software and equipment. The capital expenditures
program for Fiscal 2003 is planned at approximately $30 to $35 million with the
majority relating to the Company's  store  opening  plans. The Company plans to
open approximately 75 to 85 new stores including 25 to  30  BombayKIDS  stores.
Generally,  a  new  or converted store is profitable in its first full year  of
operations. Approximately  $4 to $5 million of the capital expenditures program
relates  to  improvement in information  systems  including  the  point-of-sale
software and communication  infrastructure upgrades.  Another $4 million of the
program  has  been allocated for  distribution  center  investment  to  support
Company growth.  A  300,000  square  foot  leased  facility  in  the Midwest is
expected  to open in the early fall, and the Company also plans to  expand  its
East Coast  distribution  center  and  replace  outdated  scanning devices. The
remainder relates to other routine purchases required in the  normal  course of
business.

In  connection  with continuing operations, the Company has various contractual
obligations and commercial  commitments  requiring  payment  in future periods,
summarized in the table below.

The  Company  intends  to  fund its operations and planned capital expenditures
program through its current  cash  position,  cash  flows  from  operations and
credit facility. With its current growth plans, the Company may have  a need to
increase its credit facility or obtain alternative financing arrangements given
the current, favorable interest rate environment.

Fiscal 2001

At February 2, 2002, cash and short-term investments were $38.4 million, $16.3
million higher than at February 3, 2001. The primary sources of cash were net
income, including non-cash depreciation and amortization expense, and decreases
in inventory levels.  These sources were partially offset by capital
expenditures for store construction and routine equipment purchases.

At February 2, 2002, inventory levels were $15.1  million  lower  than  at  the
previous   year   end  reflecting  the  Company's  conservative  balance  sheet
management  during  the   second   half  of  the  year  in  light  of  economic
uncertainties and the events of September  11th.  Capital  expenditures totaled
$14.1 million and included the costs of 32 new stores and the  conversion of 18
regular  stores  to  the  larger  format,  as well as continued investments  in
software and equipment.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In the course of preparing the financial statements,  management  makes certain
judgments   relative  to  accounting  policies  that  are  appropriate  in  the
circumstances  and  the  application of those policies.  The following policies
are those deemed to be most critical.

Inventory Valuation Policy

Inventories are valued at  the  lower  of cost or market, cost being determined
based upon the weighted average inventory method. Cost is calculated based upon
the actual landed cost of an item at the  time  it is received in the warehouse
based upon actual vendor invoices or estimates of costs for which an invoice is
not  present  or  for  which  an allocation of shared  costs  is  required.  In
addition, the Company includes the cost of warehousing and transporting product
to the stores in its costs.

The Company regularly evaluates its compliance with the lower of cost or market
principle. Items are evaluated  by stock keeping unit ("SKU") and to the extent
that the cost of the item exceeds  the current selling price, provision is made
to reduce the carrying cost of the item.  Additionally, the Company reviews the
aging of its inventory by SKU. The carrying  cost  of the item is reduced based
upon  certain  age criteria and product category. Since  the  determination  of
carrying value of  inventory  involves both estimation and judgment of cost and
market value, differences in these  estimates  could  result in valuations that
vary from the recorded asset.

Each month, the Company records an allowance for shrinkage  to  provide for the
cost  of  lost  or stolen inventory. The amount of the allowance is  determined
based upon the historical  shrinkage  results and is adjusted at least annually
to  reflect  current circumstances. Inventory  is  physically  counted  at  all
locations at least  once  each year, at which time actual results are reflected
in the financial statements.   Physical counts were taken at all stores and all
the distribution centers during January 2003.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets with definite  lives  are  reviewed  at  least  annually  and
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
the  asset  may  not  be  recoverable.   This review includes the evaluation of
individual under-performing retail stores  and  assessing the recoverability of
the carrying value of the fixed assets related to  the store. Future cash flows
are  projected  for  the  remaining  lease  life  using  a probability-weighted
approach  to  estimate the fair value of the store assets.   These  projections
consider such factors  as  future  sales levels, gross margins, changes in rent
and other expenses as well as the overall  operating  environment  specific  to
that store. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value
of  the assets, a charge equal to the difference between the assets' fair value
and carrying value is recorded as an impairment. Since the projection of future
cash  flows  involves  judgment  and estimates, differences in circumstances or
estimates could produce different results.

Deferred Taxes

The  Company  currently has recorded  $11.2  million  of  deferred  tax  assets
representing  the  difference  between  the  timing  of  deductions  taken  for
financial statement  purposes  and  for tax purposes. Underlying the assumption
that the benefit of those assets will  be  recoverable in some future period is
the  concept  that  the  Company will have future  taxable  income.  If  future
conditions indicate that the  benefit  of  the  deferred tax assets will not be
fully realized, a valuation allowance will be recorded  to reduce the assets to
their estimated realizable value.

Insurance

The  Company  is  self-insured  with  respect  to medical and dental  insurance
coverage offered to its eligible employees, up to  a  maximum  of  $125,000 per
claim.   Above  that  amount,  medical  insurance  coverage  is  in  place.  In
connection with the self-insured portion, the Company maintains a liability for
claims  that are in the process of being paid and those that have been incurred
but not yet  reported  to  the  Company's insurance carrier.  The amount of the
liability is estimated based upon  historical  claims  experience and actuarial
estimates regarding the exposure for claims incurred but  not  yet reported. At
February  1,  2003,  the balance of the medical and dental liability  was  $1.1
million.

<PAGE> 16

Beginning in Fiscal 2001,  the  Company  also  maintains  workers' compensation
insurance  coverage  with a deductible of $100,000 per claim.  At  February  1,
2003, the Company had  recorded  a  liability  of $2.3 million representing the
estimated amount that will have to be paid in future  periods  related  to  the
settlement  of  claims  under the insurance policies for Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal
2001.  The  amount  of  the  liability  reflects  expected  remaining  workers'
compensation  claims based upon  actuarial  estimates  made  by  the  Company's
insurance carrier,  utilizing  historical  claims experience and other relevant
information  and  trends.   Prior  to  Fiscal  2001,   the  Company's  workers'
compensation insurance was not subject to a deductible.

If circumstances change or if information becomes available that would indicate
that future payments with respect to insurance liabilities  would  be different
than   what  was  previously  estimated,  such  liabilities  will  be  adjusted
accordingly.   Since  the  amounts recorded for insurance liabilities are based
upon various estimates, actual future requirements could vary from the recorded
liabilities.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  143,  Accounting  for  Asset  Retirement
Obligations  ("FAS  143").  FAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability
for an asset retirement obligation  be  recognized in the period in which it is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair  value  can  be made. The standard is
effective for the Company's financial statements beginning in the first quarter
of Fiscal 2003, and its adoption is not expected to have  a  significant impact
on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued  Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
- -  Transition  and  Disclosure  - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123  ("FAS
148").   FAS   148  requires  additional   disclosure   regarding   stock-based
compensation both  in  annual and interim financial statements. The Company has
adopted the disclosure provisions of FAS 148.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS




To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Bombay Company, Inc.

In  our  opinion,  the   consolidated   financial   statements  listed  in  the
accompanying  index on page 23 present fairly, in all  material  respects,  the
financial position of The Bombay Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries at February
1, 2003 and February  2,  2002,  and  the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 1, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally  accepted  in the United States
of America. These financial statements are the responsibility  of the Company's
management;  our  responsibility  is  to express an opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted  our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted  in  the United States of
America which require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain  reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,  assessing  the
accounting principles  used  and  significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement  presentation.  We  believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The consolidated financial  statements  include the accounts of the Company and
its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  All  significant  intercompany  transactions,
balances and profits have been eliminated.  The  Company  has  a  retail (52-53
week)  fiscal  year which ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. The  periods
ended February 1,  2003  ("Fiscal  2002")  and February 2, 2002 ("Fiscal 2001")
represent  52  weeks.   The  period  ended February  3,  2001  ("Fiscal  2000")
represents 53 weeks.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements  in  conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make  estimates.  These  estimates
affect  reported  amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expense and related
disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

The functional currency  of  the  Company's Canadian operations is the Canadian
dollar.  Fiscal  year end exchange rates  are  used  to  translate  assets  and
liabilities to U.S.  dollars.  Monthly  average  exchange  rates  are  used  to
translate  income  and  expenses.  The  cumulative  effect  of foreign currency
translation  adjustments is reported in accumulated other comprehensive  income
(loss) within stockholders' equity.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash in stores,  deposits  in  banks  and  short-term investments with original
maturities of three months or less are considered  as cash and cash equivalents
for  the  purposes  of  the financial statements.  Short-term  investments  are
recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are primarily  finished  merchandise and are valued at the lower of
cost or market, cost being determined based upon the weighted average inventory
method.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are depreciated  over  the estimated useful lives of the
assets using the straight-line method over the lives shown:

 Building                      Forty years
 Furniture and equipment       Two to ten years
 Leasehold improvements        The lesser of the life of the lease or asset

Maintenance  and  repairs  are charged to expense  as  incurred.  Renewals  and
betterments which materially  prolong  the  useful  lives  of  the  assets  are
capitalized.  The cost and related accumulated depreciation of property retired
or sold are removed  from  the  accounts, and gains or losses are recognized in
the statements of income.

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS

The Company capitalizes certain external  and  internal  costs  associated with
computer software and significant enhancements to software features of existing
products. The costs are amortized utilizing the straight-line method  over  the
estimated  economic  lives  of  the  software,  which range from three to seven
years. Total costs capitalized were $19,500,000 and  $18,703,000 at February 1,
2003 and February 2, 2002, respectively.  Accumulated  amortization  related to
these  assets  was $15,236,000 and $12,517,000 in Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal  2001,
respectively.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

During Fiscal 2002,  the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, Accounting  for  Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
("FAS 144"). FAS 144 requires that long-lived  assets  with  definite  lives be
evaluated  for impairment whenever conditions indicate that the carrying  value
of the assets  may  not be recoverable. In determining if an impairment exists,
assets must be grouped  at  the  lowest  level for which there are identifiable
cash flows that are largely independent of  cash  flows  from  other  groups of
assets.  In  performing this impairment test, the Company groups its assets  at
the store level.  If  an  impairment  exists,  the  amount of the impairment is
measured as the difference between the carrying value  and  the  estimated fair
value of the assets. The adoption of FAS 144 did not have a significant  impact
on the Company's financial statements.

For periods prior to Fiscal 2002, assessment of impairment of long-lived assets
was  determined  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 121, which were similar to the provisions of FAS 144.

<PAGE> 31

GOODWILL

During  Fiscal  2002,  the  Company  adopted  the  provisions of  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 142, Accounting for  Goodwill  and  Other
Intangibles ("FAS 142"). FAS 142 provides  that  goodwill  should  no longer be
amortized, but should be tested for impairment at least annually, and  whenever
conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist. Goodwill is tested for
impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the Company's net assets to
their  carrying  value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value,
the implied value of goodwill will be calculated and an impairment loss will be
recognized. No impairment  was recorded in Fiscal 2002. The adoption of FAS 142
did not have a significant impact  on  the  Company's financial statements, nor
would it have had a significant impact on prior  years if the provisions of FAS
142 had been applied.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue is recognized when delivery has occurred,  the  sales price is fixed or
determinable,  and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenues  are  net  of
returns and exclude sales tax.

The Company includes  in revenues amounts collected from customers for shipping
and handling orders. In  Fiscal  2002,  Fiscal  2001  and  Fiscal  2000,  these
revenues  totaled  $4,626,000,  $2,779,000  and  $1,945,000,  respectively. The
associated shipping and handling expenses are included in cost of sales.

GIFT CERTIFICATES

Proceeds  from  the  sale  of  gift  cards and certificates are recorded  as  a
liability  at the time they are received.  When  the  holder  of  the  card  or
certificate  redeems  it for merchandise, the liability is relieved and revenue
is recognized.

ADVERTISING COSTS

Advertising costs are expensed  the  first  time  the  advertising takes place.
During  Fiscal  2002,  Fiscal  2001  and Fiscal 2000, advertising  expense  was
$20,258,000, $14,597,000 and $14,701,000, respectively.

INCOME TAXES

The Company uses the liability method of computing deferred income taxes on all
material  temporary  differences. Temporary  differences  are  the  differences
between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. The
Company assesses realizability  of  deferred  tax  assets  and, if necessary, a
valuation allowance is provided.

All  unremitted  earnings  of  the  foreign  subsidiary  are considered  to  be
permanently reinvested. Accordingly, no U.S. deferred taxes  have been provided
on such earnings.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

Comprehensive income represents the change in equity (net assets) of a business
enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances
from  non-owner  sources.  It  includes all changes in equity during  a  period
except those resulting from investments  by owners and distributions to owners.
Such  amounts  are included in accumulated other  comprehensive  income  (loss)
within stockholders'  equity  and  consist  of the cumulative effect of foreign
currency translation adjustments.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In  June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards  Board  issued  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  143,  Accounting  for  Asset  Retirement
Obligations  ("FAS  143").  FAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability
for an asset retirement obligation  be  recognized in the period in which it is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair  value  can be made.  The standard is
effective for the Company's financial statements beginning in the first quarter
of Fiscal 2003, and its adoption is not expected to  have  a significant impact
on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued  Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
- -  Transition  and  Disclosure  - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123  ("FAS
148").   FAS   148  requires  additional   disclosure   regarding   stock-based
compensation both  in  annual and interim financial statements. The Company has
adopted the disclosure provisions of FAS 148.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share  are  based upon the weighted average number of shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings per  share  are  based  upon the weighted average
number of shares outstanding plus the shares that would be outstanding assuming
exercise of dilutive stock options, unissued restricted  stock and distribution
of deferred director compensation.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The  Company  applies  the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion  No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related  interpretations  and   the  disclosure-only  provisions  of  Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation  ("FAS
123")  in  accounting  for  its  stock-based  incentive  plans. No compensation
expense related to grants of stock options has been reflected in net income, as
all options granted under the plans had an exercise price  equal  to the market
price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Compensation  expense
related to grants of restricted stock is measured as the quoted market price of
the  Company's common stock at the measurement date, amortized to expense  over
the vesting  period.  The  following table illustrates the effect on net income
and earnings per share if the  Company  had  applied the fair value recognition
provisions of FAS 123 to stock-based compensation (in thousands):

NOTE 2 - STORE IMPAIRMENTS AND CLOSING LIABILITY

Following the holiday selling season, the Company reviewed its real estate
portfolio for impairment, focusing on store locations with operating losses.  Of
the 422 Company owned stores open as of February 1, 2003, six stores were
identified for which the carrying amount of the store assets were not expected
to be recoverable.  As a result of the review, the Company recorded an
impairment charge to buying and occupancy costs of $693,000.  A similar review,
performed in Fiscal 2001, in accordance with FAS 121, resulted in a  charge to
buying and occupancy costs of $715,000.

The Company previously had accrued a liability for obligations associated with
closing under-performing stores.  At February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002, the
liability was $0 and $342,000, respectively.  Costs of $80,000 and $373,000 were
charged against the liability in Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, respectively, and
the remaining balance of $262,000 was credited to buying and occupancy costs in
Fiscal 2002.

<PAGE> 33

NOTE 3 - DEBT

The Company has an unsecured, revolving credit agreement with a group of banks,
with  an aggregate commitment of up to $50,000,000. The Company has the  option
to request  an  increase in the aggregate commitment to $75,000,000, subject to
approval  by the banks,  through  the  addition  of  another  lending  bank  or
increased commitment by the existing lending banks. The facility, which expires
July 5, 2005,  is for working capital, inventory financing and letter of credit
purposes. Borrowings  under  the  facility can be made, at the Company's option
and subject to certain limitations,  in the form of loans or by the issuance of
bankers'  acceptances  with respect to inventory  purchases.  Loans  under  the
facility bear interest,  at  the  Company's  option,  at either the lead bank's
prime lending rate plus a margin of .5% to 1.0% or the LIBOR rate plus a margin
of  1.25% to 2.0%, with the margin depending on the Company's  leverage  ratio.
Under  the  terms of the agreement, the Company is required to maintain certain
financial ratios  and  other  financial conditions. The agreement prohibits the
Company from making certain investments,  advances  or  loans,  and  limits the
dollar  amounts  of  capital  expenditures, purchases of treasury shares,  cash
dividends and asset sales. In the  event  that  the  Company  is  in default of
certain  provisions  of the agreement, the lenders would be permitted  to  file
liens against the Company's  inventory located in the United States and perfect
the pledge of 65% of the stock  of  the  Company's Canadian subsidiary, thereby
securing the indebtedness.

The bank commitment is limited to 45% of saleable  inventory.  At  February  1,
2003,   the  bank  commitment  was  $46,020,000.  Letters  of  credit  totaling
$7,694,000  were  outstanding under the facility, and $38,326,000 was available
for borrowings or additional letters of credit. Interest expense and negotiated
fees for Fiscal 2002,  Fiscal  2001 and Fiscal 2000, totaled $617,000, $884,000
and $610,000, respectively.

NOTE 5 -  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Store, distribution and field  office facilities and equipment are leased under
operating leases expiring through  2013.   The store leases are generally based
upon  a minimum rental plus a percentage  of  the  store  sales  in  excess  of
specified  levels.   Store  lease  terms  generally require additional payments
covering taxes, common area changes and certain  other  costs.   Rental expense
for  Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000 totaled $50,669,000,  $47,366,000
and $45,137,000, respectively.

The minimum  rental  commitments  for  future  fiscal  years are as follows (in
thousands):

On February 13, 2003, the Company agreed to settle a wage  and  hour lawsuit in
California.  The action alleged that the Company had improperly classified  its
California store managers as exempt from overtime pay and sought to recoup such
pay  on  behalf of the class.  In order to avoid the expense of the litigation,
the Company  agreed  to settle the action for approximately $1,350,000, subject
to final documentation and judicial approval in due course.  The settlement was
included in selling, general  and  administrative expenses during the Company's
Fiscal 2002 fourth quarter.

The Company has certain contingent liabilities  resulting  from  litigation and
claims  incident to the ordinary course of business.  Management believes  that
the probably  resolution  of  such contingencies will not materially affect the
financial position or results of operations of the Company.

The Company is party to employment  agreements  with  certain  executives which
provide  for  compensation  and  certain  other benefits.  The agreements  also
provide for severance payments under certain circumstances.

NOTE 6 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The  Bombay  Company, Inc. Employee 401(k) Savings  and  Stock  Ownership  Plan
("401(k) Plan")  is  open to substantially all employees who have been employed
for one year and who work at least 1,000 hours per year. Under the 401(k) Plan,
a participant may contribute  up  to  75% of earnings with the Company matching
100% of the initial 3% contribution, and  50% of the next 2% contributed by the
participant.   Participant  contributions and  Company  match  are  paid  to  a
corporate trustee and invested  in  various funds or Company stock, as directed
by  the  participant.  Company matching  contributions  made  to  participants'
accounts are fully vested  immediately. Similar benefit plans are in effect for
eligible foreign employees.

To the extent employees are  unable to contribute up to 5% of their earnings to
the  401(k)  Plan  because  of  limitations   imposed  by  IRS  regulations,  a
Supplemental   Stock  Program  was  adopted.  Under  this   program,   employee
contributions in  excess  of  IRS  limitations,  along  with  Company  matching
contributions, are distributed annually in the form of Company common stock.

The  Bombay  Company,  Inc. Stock Purchase Program ("SPP") is open to all full-
time employees who have  at  least  90  days  of  service. Each participant may
contribute  1%  to  10%  of  qualifying  compensation,  to   a  maximum  annual
contribution of $21,250. Contributions are used to purchase shares  of  Company
common  stock at a discount of 15% from current market rates. The participants'
shares are  fully  vested  upon  purchase.   Participants` shares are held by a
third-party  administrator  until  the  respective   participant   requests   a
distribution.

Total  Company  contributions  to  these plans for Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and
Fiscal 2000 were $723,000, $644,000 and  $738,000, respectively.


NOTE 7 - COMMON STOCK AND STOCK OPTIONS

The Company's Board of Directors has  authorized  a stock repurchase program to
purchase up to an aggregate of $30 million of the Company's  stock.  The shares
may be purchased from time to time, through open market purchases and privately
negotiated  transactions.   During  Fiscal  2002,  Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000,
13,000,  39,000  and  3,039,550  shares,  respectively,  were  acquired  at  an
aggregate  cost  of $31,000, $103,000 and $10,303,000, respectively.   Treasury
shares are used for  various  employee  and  director  stock  plans as the need
arises.

The  Bombay  Company, Inc. 1986 Stock Option Plan and 1996 Long Term  Incentive
Stock Plan ("Employee  Plans")  provide  for the granting of options (and other
types  of  stock-related  awards  under the 1996  plan)  to  officers  and  key
management employees. At February 1,  2003,  the option shares reserved for the
Employee Plans were 5,678,763. The option price is fixed at the market price or
higher on the date of the grant. Options are generally  exercisable annually at
a  rate  of  33%  per  year  beginning  one year after the grant  date.  Shares
available  for additional grants were 2,432,019;  1,459,552  and  1,732,538  at
February 1, 2003, February 2, 2002 and February 3, 2001, respectively.

During Fiscal  2001,  restricted  stock  aggregating 200,000 shares was granted
under the 1996 Long Term Incentive Stock Plan  to  three  key  executives.  The
respective  shares  were  to  become vested in designated increments contingent
upon continued employment of the  respective  executive  after  12  months,  24
months  and  36  months. During Fiscal 2002, 40,000 of the shares became vested
and were distributed.   Also  in  Fiscal  2002,  two of the executives left the
employment of the Company and 120,000 restricted shares  expired  unvested.  If
the  third  executive  remains employed by the Company under the terms  of  the
grant, 15,000 and 25,000  shares will be vested in Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2004,
respectively.  Compensation  expense  of  $285,000 was recognized during Fiscal
2001, and in Fiscal 2002 net expenses of $87,000  were  reversed  in connection
with the restricted stock.

During Fiscal 2002, 75,000 shares of restricted stock were granted  and  issued
to  the  Chairman  of  the  Board.   One  third  of  the shares vested upon his
acceptance of the position.  Contingent upon continued Board service, one third
of the shares will become vested after 12 months and 24  months,  respectively.
Compensation  expense  of  $153,000  was  recognized  during  Fiscal  2002   in
connection  with  the  restricted stock.  The Bombay Company, Inc. Non-Employee
Director Equity Plan ("Director  Plan") provides for the granting of options to
members of the Board of Directors who are neither employees nor officers of the
Company. At February 1, 2003, the  option shares reserved for the Director Plan
were 626,585. The option price is fixed  at the market price on the date of the
grant.  For Fiscal 2002, the option grant,  initial  and annual, was the lesser
of 8,000 shares or $75,000 in face value. The initial grant becomes exercisable
at  a  rate  of  20%  per year beginning one year after the  grant  date.  Each
additional annual grant  becomes  fully  exercisable six months after the grant
date. Shares available for additional grants  were 325,196; 354,210 and 481,696
at February 1, 2003, February 2, 2002 and February 3, 2001 respectively.

The exercise of non-qualified stock options in Fiscal 2002 resulted in income
tax benefits of $155,000 which were credited to additional paid-in capital. The
income tax benefits are the tax effect of the difference between the market
price on the date of exercise and the option price.

The  Company  has  adopted  the  disclosure-only  provisions  of  Statement  of
Financial   Accounting   Standards  No.  123,  Accounting  for  Stock  -  Based
Compensation ("FAS 123"). Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized
for options granted. Had compensation cost for the Company's stock option plans
been determined based on the  fair value at the grant date for awards in Fiscal
1995 through Fiscal 2002 in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  FAS 123, the
Company's net income  and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro

NOTE 8 - SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS PLAN

The  Company has a shareholders' rights plan under which each share of  Company
common  stock  includes  one Preferred Share Purchase Right ("Right") entitling
the  holder  to  buy  one  one-thousandth   of  a  share  of  Series  A  Junior
Participating Preferred Stock of the Company  at  an exercise price of $50. The
Rights, which have ten year terms expiring in 2005, are exercisable if a person
or group acquires 15% or more of the common stock of the Company or announces a
tender offer for 15% or more of the common stock. If a person or group acquires
15% or more of the outstanding common stock of the  Company,  each  Right  will
entitle  the  holder  to  purchase,  at the Right's exercise price, a number of
shares of Company common stock having  a  market  value  of  twice  the Right's
exercise  price.  If  the  Company  is  acquired  in a merger or other business
combination transaction after a person or group acquires  15%  or  more  of the
Company's common stock, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase, at  the
Right's  exercise  price,  a number of shares of the acquiring company's common
stock having a market value of twice the Right's exercise price. The Rights are
redeemable at one cent per Right at any time before they become exercisable.

NOTE 9 - STOCK PURCHASE LOANS

On  May 16, 2002, the Board of  Directors  elected  to  abolish  the  Company's
Executive  Stock  Loan  Program,  which  originated  in  August 1999. Under the
program, certain executive officers were given the opportunity  to borrow funds
for  up  to  specified amounts to be used to purchase shares of Company  common
stock at current market prices. All principal and accrued interest on the loans
were payable at the end of a three year term. The loans were not collateralized
by the common  stock,  but  the program provided that if any of the shares were
sold within three years following  the date of purchase, any sales proceeds per
share over the purchase price per share  would be payable to the Company unless
at the time of the sale all principal and  accrued interest on the loan used to
purchase the common stock had been paid to the Company.

As of May 16, 2002, participants owned 189,031  shares  of Company common stock
purchased under the program.  The Company reacquired, at  current market prices
aggregating $864,000, the Company common stock that was previously purchased by
the  executive  officers  under  the program, and the notes were  extinguished.
Amounts owed to the Company or the  participants  as a result of the difference
between  the  market  value  of  the stock and the loan  balance  plus  accrued
interest have been paid in full.

During Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000, $17,000, $53,000 and $60,000
respectively, in interest income was recognized related to the loans.


NOTE 10 - GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

Substantially all revenues result from the sale of home furnishings and

       definitions in the Agreement shall be the same in the Amendment except
       as specifically revised by the Amendment.

1.  REVISION.   The section in the Agreement entitled "Change of Rights Agent"
    is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

       Change of Rights Agent.  The Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent
       may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement upon
       30 days' notice in writing mailed to the Company and to each transfer
       agent of the Common Shares or Preferred shares by registered or
       certified mail and to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-
       class mail.  The Company may remove the Rights Agent or any successor
       Rights Agent upon 30 days' notice in writing mailed to the Rights Agent
       or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer
       agent of the Common Shares or Preferred Shares by registered or
       certified mail, and to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-
       class mail.  If the Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall
       otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company shall appoint a
       successor to the Rights Agent.  If the Company shall fail to make such
       appointment within a period of 30 days after giving notice of such
       removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or
       incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated rights Agent or by the
       holder of a Right Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit such
       holder's Right Certificate for inspection by the company), then the
       registered holder of any Right Certificate may apply to any court of
       competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent.  Any
       successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a
       court, shall be a corporation or trust company organized and doing
       business under the laws of the United States, in good standing, which is
       authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust or stock transfer
       powers and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state
       authority and which has individually or combined with an affiliate at
       the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and
       surplus of at least $100 million dollars.  After appointment, the
       successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights,
       duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights
       Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent
       shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at
       the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further
       assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose.  Not later
       than the effective date of any such appointment the Company shall file
       notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each
       transfer agent of the Common Shares or Preferred Shares, and mail a
       notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Right
       Certificates.  Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section
       21, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or
       validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the
       appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.

4.     Except as amended hereby, the Agreement and all schedules or exhibits
       thereto shall remain in full force and effect.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Amendment to be
executed in their names and on their behalf by and through their duly
authorized officers, as of this 22nd day of February, 2002.

<TEXT>

                                                                 EXHIBIT 10(a)


                             INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT



      THIS  AGREEMENT  is  made  and  entered  into  as  of  the  ____  day  of
______________,  2003 ("Agreement"), by and between The Bombay Company, Inc., a
Delaware   corporation    ("Company"),   and   ________________________________
("Indemnitee").


                                   RECITALS:

      WHEREAS, highly competent  persons  have  become  more reluctant to serve
publicly-held  corporations  as  directors or officers or in  other  capacities
unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate
indemnification against inordinate  risks  of  claims  and actions against them
arising out of their service to, and activities on behalf  of, the corporation;
this is because such persons in service to corporations are  being increasingly
subjected to expensive and time-consuming litigation relating  to,  among other
things,  matters  that  traditionally would have been brought only against  the
corporation or business enterprise itself; and

      WHEREAS,  the Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  (the  "Board")  has
determined that,  to attract and retain qualified individuals, the Company will
attempt to maintain  on  an  ongoing  basis,  at  its  sole  expense, liability
insurance  to  protect  persons  serving the Company and its subsidiaries  from
certain liabilities; and

      WHEREAS,  the  Board has determined  that  the  increased  difficulty  in
attracting and retaining  such  persons is detrimental to the best interests of
the Company's stockholders and that  the  Company  should  act  to  assure such
persons  that  there  will  be  increased  certainty of such protection in  the
future; and

      WHEREAS,  it  is  reasonable,  prudent  and  necessary  for  the  Company
contractually  to obligate itself to indemnify,  and  to  advance  expenses  on
behalf of, such  persons  to  the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so
that they will serve or continue  to  serve the Company free from undue concern
that they will not be so indemnified; and

      WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement  to  and  in  furtherance  of the
Bylaws  of  the Company and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall
not be deemed  a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of
Indemnitee thereunder; and

      WHEREAS, each  of Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware ("DGCL") and the Bylaws is nonexclusive, and therefore contemplates
that  contracts  may  be  entered  into  with  respect  to  indemnification  of
directors, officers and employees; and

      WHEREAS, Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take on
additional service for  or  on  behalf  of  the  Company  on the condition that
Indemnitee be so indemnified;

      NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of  the premises and  the  covenants
contained  herein,  the Company and Indemnitee hereby  covenant  and  agree  as
follows:

      1.    SERVICES  BY INDEMNITEE.  Indemnitee agrees to continue to serve as
a director or officer of  the  Company.  Indemnitee may at any time and for any
reason resign from such position  (subject  to any other contractual obligation
or any obligation imposed by operation of law),  in  which  event  the  Company
shall  have  no  obligation under this Agreement to continue Indemnitee in such
position.  This Agreement  shall  not  be deemed an employment contract between
the Company (or any of its subsidiaries)  and Indemnitee.  This Agreement shall
continue in force after Indemnitee has ceased to serve as a director or officer
of the Company.

      2.    INDEMNIFICATION  -  GENERAL.   The  Company  shall  indemnify,  and
advance Expenses (as hereinafter defined) to,  Indemnitee  (i)  as  provided in
this  Agreement and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable  law  in
effect  on  the  date  hereof  and as amended from time to time.  The rights of
Indemnitee provided under the preceding  sentence  shall include, but shall not
be limited to, the rights set forth in the other Sections of this Agreement.

      3.    PROCEEDINGS  OTHER  THAN PROCEEDINGS BY OR  IN  THE  RIGHT  OF  THE
COMPANY.  Indemnitee shall be indemnified under this Section 3 if, by reason of
Corporate Status (as hereinafter  defined),  Indemnitee is, or is threatened to
be made, a party to or a participant in any threatened,  pending,  or completed
Proceeding (as hereinafter defined), other than a Proceeding by or in the right
of  the  Company.   Pursuant to this Section 3, Indemnitee shall be indemnified
against  all  Expenses,   judgments,  penalties,  fines  and  amounts  paid  in
settlement actually and reasonably  incurred  by  Indemnitee  or  on  behalf of
Indemnitee  in  connection  with  such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter
therein, if Indemnitee acted in Good  Faith and in a manner reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests  of the Company and, with respect
to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause  to believe the conduct was
unlawful.

      4.    PROCEEDINGS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY.  Indemnitee shall be
indemnified under this Section 4 if, by reason of Corporate  Status, Indemnitee
is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any threatened,
pending or completed Proceeding brought by or in the right of  the  Company  to
procure  a judgment in its favor.  Pursuant to this Section 4, Indemnitee shall
be indemnified  against  all  Expenses  actually  and  reasonably  incurred  by
Indemnitee  or  on  behalf  of Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding if
Indemnitee acted in Good Faith  and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or
not opposed to the best interests  of  the Company; provided that if applicable
law so provides, no indemnification against  such  Expenses  shall  be  made in
respect of any claim, issue or matter in such Proceeding as to which Indemnitee
shall  have  been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and to the extent
that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or the court in which such
Proceeding shall  have  been  brought  or is pending, shall determine that such
indemnification may be made.

      5.    INDEMNIFICATION FOR EXPENSES  OF  A  PARTY  WHO IS WHOLLY OR PARTLY
SUCCESSFUL.   Notwithstanding  any other provision of this  Agreement,  to  the
extent that Indemnitee is, by reason  of  Corporate  Status,  a  party to (or a
participant  in)  and  is  successful,  on  the  merits  or  otherwise, in  any
Proceeding  (including  dismissal  without  prejudice),  Indemnitee   shall  be
indemnified  to  the  maximum  extent  permitted  by  law  against all Expenses
actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on behalf  of  Indemnitee  in
connection   therewith.   If  Indemnitee  is  not  wholly  successful  in  such
Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but
less than all  claims,  issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall
indemnify Indemnitee against  all  Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by
Indemnitee or on behalf of Indemnitee  in  connection  with  each  successfully
resolved  claim,  issue  or  matter.   For purposes of this Section and without
limitation, the termination of any claim,  issue or matter in such a Proceeding
by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall  be  deemed  to  be a successful
result as to such claim, issue or matter.

      6.    INDEMNIFICATION  FOR  EXPENSES  OF A WITNESS.  Notwithstanding  any
other provision of this Agreement, to the extent  that Indemnitee is, by reason
of Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding to  which  Indemnitee is not a
party,  Indemnitee  shall  be  indemnified  against  all Expenses actually  and
reasonably  incurred  by  Indemnitee or on behalf of Indemnitee  in  connection
therewith; provided that Indemnitee shall not be paid for time spent as such.

      7.    ADVANCEMENT OF  EXPENSES.   Notwithstanding  any  provision of this
Agreement  to  the contrary, the Company shall advance all reasonable  Expenses
incurred by or on  behalf  of  Indemnitee  in connection with any Proceeding in
which Indemnitee is involved by reason of Indemnitee's  Corporate Status within
10  days  after  the receipt by the Company of a statement or  statements  from
Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior
to or after final disposition of such Proceeding.  Such statement or statements
shall reasonably evidence  the  Expenses  incurred  by  Indemnitee.  Indemnitee
hereby  undertakes  to  repay any Expenses advanced if it shall  ultimately  be
determined that Indemnitee  is  not  entitled  to  be  indemnified against such
Expenses.  Any advances and undertakings to repay pursuant  to  this  Section 7
shall be unsecured and interest free.

      8.    PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINATION OF ENTITLEMENT TO INDEMNIFICATION.

      (a)   To  obtain  indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee  shall
submit to the Company a written  request,  including  therein or therewith such
documentation and information as is reasonably available  to  Indemnitee and is
reasonably  necessary  to  determine  whether and to what extent Indemnitee  is
entitled to indemnification.  The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon
receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board in writing that
Indemnitee has requested indemnification.

      (b)   Upon written request by Indemnitee  for indemnification pursuant to
the first sentence of Section 8(a), a determination,  if required by applicable
law,  with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall  be  made  in  the
specific   case,   unless  Indemnitee  and  the  Company  agree  otherwise,  by
Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined) in a written opinion to the Board,
a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee; and, if it is determined that
Indemnitee is entitled  to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made
within 10 days after such  determination.   Indemnitee shall cooperate with the
person,  persons or firm making such determination with respect to Indemnitee's
entitlement to indemnification, including providing  to such person, persons or
firm upon reasonable advance request any documentation  or  information that is
not  privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and that  is  reasonably
available  to  Indemnitee  and reasonably necessary to such determination.  Any
costs or expenses (including  attorneys'  fees  and  disbursements) incurred by
Indemnitee  in  so cooperating with the person, persons  or  firm  making  such
determination shall  be  paid by the Company (irrespective of the determination
as to Indemnitee's entitlement  to  indemnification)  and  the  Company  hereby
indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.

      (c)   The  Independent  Counsel  referred  to  in  Section  8(b) shall be
selected  as provided in this Section 8(c).  The Independent Counsel  shall  be
selected by  the Board, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee
advising of the  identity  of  the  Independent Counsel so selected.  Within 10
days after such written notice of selection  shall  have been given, Indemnitee
may deliver to the Company a written objection to such selection; provided that
such objection may be asserted only on the ground that  the Independent Counsel
so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent  Counsel" as defined
in Section 17, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual
basis of such assertion.  Absent a proper and timely objection,  the  person so
selected  shall  act  as Independent Counsel.  If such written objection is  so
made, the Independent Counsel  so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel
unless and until such objection  is  withdrawn  or  a court has determined that
such  objection  is  without  merit.  If, within 20 days  after  submission  by
Indemnitee of a written request  for  indemnification pursuant to Section 8(a),
no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, Indemnitee
may petition the Court of Chancery of the  State  of Delaware or other court of
competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection  that  shall  have  been
made by Indemnitee to the Company's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for
the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Court or  by
such  other person as the Court shall designate, and the person with respect to
whom all  objections  are so resolved or the person so appointed shall then act
as Independent Counsel  under  Section  8(b).  Upon the due commencement of any
judicial  proceeding  or arbitration pursuant  to  Section  10(a),  Independent
Counsel shall be discharged  and relieved of any further responsibility in such
capacity (subject to the applicable  standards  of  professional  conduct  then
prevailing).

      (d)   The  Company  shall  not  be  required  to  obtain  the  consent of
Indemnitee  to  the settlement of any Proceeding the Company has undertaken  to
defend if the Company  assumes full and sole responsibility for such settlement
and the settlement grants  Indemnitee  a  complete  and  unqualified release in
respect of the potential liability.  The Company shall not  be  liable  for any
amount  paid  by  the  Indemnitee  in  settlement of any Proceeding that is not
defended by the Company, unless the Company  has  consented to such settlement,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

      9.    PRESUMPTIONS; RELIANCE AND EFFECT OF CERTAIN PROCEEDINGS.

      (a)   In  making  a  determination  with  respect   to   entitlement   to
indemnification   hereunder,   the   person,   persons   or  firm  making  such
determination  shall  presume  that  Indemnitee is entitled to  indemnification
under this Agreement if Indemnitee has  submitted a request for indemnification
in accordance with Section 8(a), and the Company shall have the burden of proof
to overcome that presumption by clear and  convincing  evidence  in  connection
with the making by any person, persons or firm of any determination contrary to
that  presumption.   Neither  the failure of Independent Legal Counsel to  have
made a determination prior to the  commencement  of any action pursuant to this
Agreement   that  indemnification  is  proper  in  the  circumstances   because
Indemnitee  has   met  the  applicable  standard  of  conduct,  nor  an  actual
determination thereby  that  Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of
conduct,  shall  be a defense to  the  action  or  create  a  presumption  that
Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

      (b)   If the  person,  persons  or  firm  empowered  under  Section  8 to
determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made
a  determination  within  60  days  after receipt by the Company of the request
therefor, the requisite determination  of  entitlement to indemnification shall
be  deemed  to  have  been  made  and  Indemnitee shall  be  entitled  to  such
indemnification, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or
an omission of a material fact necessary  to  make  Indemnitee's  statement not
materially  misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification,  or
(ii) a prohibition  of such indemnification under applicable law; provided that
such 60-day period may  be  extended  for  a  reasonable time, not to exceed an
additional  30 days, if the person, persons or firm  making  the  determination
with respect  to  entitlement  to  indemnification  in  good  faith requests in
writing  such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of  documentation
and/or information relating thereto.

      (c)   The  termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter
therein, by judgment,  order,  settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided
in  this Agreement) of itself adversely  affect  the  right  of  Indemnitee  to
indemnification  or  create  a  presumption that Indemnitee did not act in Good
Faith and in a manner reasonably  believed  to be in or not opposed to the best
interests  of the Company or, with respect to  any  criminal  Proceeding,  that
Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful.

      (d)   For  purposes  of any determination of Good Faith, Indemnitee shall
be deemed to have acted in Good  Faith  if  Indemnitee's action is based on the
records or books of account of the Enterprise,  including financial statements,
or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers,  agents  or employees
of  the  Enterprise  in  the course of their duties, or on the advice of  legal
counsel for the Enterprise  or  on information or records given or reports made
to  the Enterprise by an independent  certified  public  accountant  or  by  an
appraiser,  financial  advisor  or  other  expert or professional selected with
reasonable care by the Enterprise.  The provisions  of  this Section 9(d) shall
not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in
which  the  Indemnitee  may  be deemed to have met the applicable  standard  of
conduct set forth in this Agreement.

      (e)   The knowledge and/or  actions,  or failure to act, of any director,
officer, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee
for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.


      10.   REMEDIES OF INDEMNITEE.

      (a)   If  (i)  a  determination  is  made  pursuant  to  Section  8  that
Indemnitee  is  not  entitled  to indemnification under  this  Agreement,  (ii)
advancement of Expenses is not timely  made  pursuant  to  Section  7, (iii) no
determination  of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made  pursuant
to Section 8(b)  within 90 days after receipt by the Company of the request for
indemnification, (iv)  payment  of  indemnification  is  not  made  pursuant to
Section 5, Section 6, the last sentence of Section 8(b) or the last sentence of
Section 17(f) within 10 days after receipt by the Company of a written  request
therefor,  or (v) payment of indemnification pursuant to Section 3 or Section 4
is not made  within 10 days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee
is entitled to indemnification, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication
by the Court of  Chancery  of  the  State  of  Delaware  of entitlement to such
indemnification or advancement of Expenses.  Alternatively,  Indemnitee, at his
or  her option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted  by  a  single
arbitrator  pursuant  to  the  Commercial  Arbitration  Rules  of  the American
Arbitration Association.  Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding  seeking an
adjudication or an award in arbitration within 180 days following the  date  on
which  Indemnitee  first  has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to
this Section 10(a); provided  that  the  foregoing  clause  shall  not apply in
respect  of a proceeding brought by Indemnitee to enforce rights under  Section
5.   The  Company  shall  not  oppose  Indemnitee's  right  to  seek  any  such
adjudication or award in arbitration.

      (b)   If  a  determination  shall have been made pursuant to Section 8(b)
that Indemnitee is not entitled to  indemnification, any judicial proceeding or
arbitration commenced pursuant to this  Section  10  shall  be conducted in all
respects as a de novo trial, or arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee shall
not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination.

      (c)   If a determination shall have been made pursuant  to  Section  8(b)
that  Indemnitee  is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by
such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant
to this Section 10, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact,
or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's statements not
materially misleading,  in  connection with the request for indemnification, or
(ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law.

      (d)   If Indemnitee, pursuant  to  this  Section  10,  seeks  a  judicial
adjudication  of  or  an  award  in  arbitration to enforce rights under, or to
recover damages for breach of, this Agreement,  Indemnitee shall be entitled to
recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified  by the Company against, any
and  all  expenses  (of the types described in the definition  of  Expenses  in
Section 17 of this Agreement) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in
such judicial adjudication or arbitration unless it shall be finally determined
by the court or arbitrator  before  which  such  claim  was brought that it was
brought  in  bad  faith.   Even  if  it  shall be determined in  such  judicial
adjudication or arbitration that Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not
all of the indemnification or advancement  of  Expenses  sought,  the  expenses
incurred  by  Indemnitee  in  connection  with  such  judicial  adjudication or
arbitration shall be paid in full.

      (e)   The  Company  shall  be  precluded  from asserting in any  judicial
proceeding  or  arbitration  commenced pursuant to this  Section  10  that  the
procedures and presumptions of  this  Agreement  are  not  valid,  binding  and
enforceable  and hereby stipulates, and shall so stipulate in any such court or
before any such  arbitrator, that the Company is bound by all the provisions of
this Agreement.

      11.   NONEXCLUSIVITY; INSURANCE; SUBROGATION.

      (a)   The  rights  of  indemnification  and  to  receive  advancement  of
Expenses as provided  by  this  Agreement  shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which Indemnitee may at any  time  be entitled under applicable
law,  the  Company's Certificate of Incorporation, the  Company's  Bylaws,  any
agreement, a  vote  of stockholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise.
No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof
shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect
of any action taken or  omitted  by  such  Indemnitee with respect to Corporate
Status prior to such amendment, alteration or  repeal.   To  the  extent that a
change  in  the DGCL, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits  greater
indemnification  or  advancement  of  Expenses than would be afforded currently
under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and this Agreement, it
is the agreement and intent of the parties  hereto  that Indemnitee shall enjoy
by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change.  No right or
remedy  herein  conferred is intended to be exclusive of  any  other  right  or
remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to
every other right  and  remedy  given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at
law or in equity or otherwise.  The  assertion  or  employment  of any right or
remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent  assertion  or
employment of any other right or remedy.

      (b)   To  the  extent  that  the Company maintains an insurance policy or
policies providing liability insurance  for  directors, officers, employees, or
agents of the Company or of any other corporation,  partnership, joint venture,
trust,  employee benefit plan or other enterprise such  person  serves  at  the
request of  the Company, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies
in accordance  with  its  or  their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage
available for any such director,  officer,  employee or agent under such policy
or policies.

      (c)   In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall
be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of
Indemnitee,  who  shall  execute all documents required  and  take  all  action
necessary to secure such rights,  including  execution of such documents as are
necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.

      (d)   The Company shall not be liable under  this  Agreement  to make any
payment  of  amounts  otherwise  indemnifiable  (or  for  which advancement  is
provided  hereunder)  hereunder  if  and  to  the  extent  that Indemnitee  has
otherwise  theretofore  actually  received  such  payment  under any  insurance
policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.

      (e)   The Company's obligation to indemnify or advance Expenses hereunder
to  Indemnitee  who  is  or  was  serving  at the request of the Company  as  a
director,  officer, employee or agent of any  other  corporation,  partnership,
joint venture,  trust,  employee  benefit  plan  or  other  enterprise shall be

of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing  by  both  of the
parties hereto.  No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall  be
deemed  or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or
not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

not  relieve  the Company of any obligation it may have to the Indemnitee under
this Agreement  or  otherwise,  except  to the extent the Company is materially
prejudiced by such failure.

      21.   NOTICES.  All notices, requests,  demands  and other communications

      22.   CONTRIBUTION.  To the fullest  extent  permissible under applicable
law, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement  is  unavailable  to

Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred  by Indemnitee, whether for

indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion  as is deemed fair

otherwise inconvenient forum.

Mr. James D. Carreker

Dear Jim:

I  am  very  pleased and excited by our conversations to date and would like to
offer you the  opportunity  to  join  The  Bombay  Company,  Inc.  ("Bombay" or
"Company")  as  Non-Executive  Chairman  of  the Board.  We believe Bombay  has
tremendous  potential,  and  that  you have skill  sets  complementary  to  the
existing Board of Directors and management  team  that  would help maximize the
potential  of  the Company.  With this letter, I would like  to  formalize  the
offered terms of employment we have discussed.

      1.    Title  -  Non-Executive  Chairman  of  the  Board of Directors, The
            Bombay Company, Inc.

      2.    Reporting - This role will report into the Board of Directors.

      3.    Term and Commitment - Three years based upon  shareholder  election
            in May 2003, plus the interim period prior to the shareholder vote.
            It   is  expected  that  this  position  will  require  an  initial
            commitment of approximately two days per week.

      4.    Annual Cash Retainer -  $100,000 paid quarterly in arrears.

      5.    Restricted  Stock  Grant  -  75,000  shares  of Bombay stock, to be
            awarded at the rate of 25,000 shares at the time  of  election  and
            25,000  shares  per  year  on each of the next two anniversaries of
            this agreement.

      6.    Annual Stock Option Grant - 20,000 stock options will be awarded on
            election to the Board and thereafter annually in March of each year
            during service on the Board.   The  option  grant at election vests
            20% per year over a five-year period and the  annual  option  grant
            vests six months following the grant.

As  we  have  discussed,  we would like to see you start as soon as possible in
December 2002, with an understanding  that  you  will  need  to  terminate your
position as Director of Pier1 Imports.

To  indicate  your  agreement  with  and acceptance of the terms of our  offer,
please sign this letter and return to me at your earliest convenience.  We will
then work through a complete contract as a next step.

On behalf of The Bombay Company, we look  forward  to working with you to build
an exciting value proposition for our customers and  wealth  creation  for  our
shareholders.

Sincerely,

/s/ Nigel Travis

                           THE BOMBAY COMPANY, INC.



                          RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT


      This Restricted Stock Agreement (the "Agreement"), is made as of the 16th
day  of  December,  2002  (the  "Effective  Date"),  by  and between The Bombay
Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and  James  D.  Carreker
("Director");

                                   RECITALS:

      WHEREAS,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  (the  "Board") has
determined that it is desirable to award shares of the Company's common  stock,
par  value $1.00 per share ("Common Stock"), held in the Company's treasury  to
Director  in  connection  with Director's appointment as Chairman of the Board;
and

      WHEREAS, the Board has  determined that the Common Stock so awarded shall
be subject to the restrictions, terms and conditions of this Agreement;

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, the  receipt  and  sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:

      1.    RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD.

      (a)   On the terms and conditions of this Agreement,  the  Company  shall
issue  to  Director  75,000  shares  of  Common  Stock  (the "Shares") from the
treasury  stock  of the Company; provided that 50,000 of the  Shares  shall  be
subject to the restrictions  on transfer hereinafter set forth (the "Restricted
Shares").   The  remaining  25,000   Shares   shall   not  be  restricted  (the
"Unrestricted  Shares") and Director shall be free to sell,  transfer,  assign,
pledge or otherwise  dispose  of  such Shares, subject to applicable securities
laws and the policies of the Company then in effect.

      (b)   Director  hereby agrees  that  the  certificates  representing  the
Restricted Shares shall be held in escrow by the Company until the restrictions
on transfer hereinafter set forth lapse as set forth herein.

      2.    VESTING/FORFEITURE.

      (a)   Director shall not have the right to sell, transfer, assign, pledge
or otherwise dispose of the Restricted Shares (the "Restrictions"), except that
the Restrictions shall be removed as to 25,000 of the Restricted Shares on each
anniversary of the Effective  Date  until the Restrictions have been removed as
to all Restricted Shares; provided that  the removal of the Restrictions on any
such anniversary date shall occur if and only  if  Director  is  on such date a
director  of  the  Company.   Following  removal  of  the  Restrictions on  any
Restricted  Shares,  the  Company  shall  deliver  to  Director from  escrow  a
certificate representing such Restricted Shares and Director  shall  be free to
sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of such Restricted  Shares,
subject  to applicable securities laws and the policies of the Company then  in
effect.

      (b)   Subject  to  the  provisions of paragraph (c) of this Section, upon
termination of Director's service  on  the Board for any reason whatsoever, (i)
Director shall have no rights whatsoever in and to any of the Restricted Shares
as to which the Restrictions have not by that time been removed pursuant to the
foregoing  paragraph,  (ii) all such Restricted  Shares  shall  revert  to  the
Company  at  no  cost  and  (iii) neither   Director  nor  any  of  his  heirs,
beneficiaries,  executors,  administrators  or other  personal  representatives
shall have any rights with respect thereto.

      (c)   All  Restrictions  with  respect to  the  Restricted  Shares  shall
terminate upon (i) Director's death while  serving  on  the  Board  or (ii) the
occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below).

      (d)   For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,  a  "Change of Control" of  the
Company,  unless otherwise determined by the Board, shall  be  deemed  to  have
occurred upon the happening of any of the following events:

            (i)   the   acquisition,  other  than  from  the  Company,  by  any
individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2)
of the Securities Exchange  Act  of  1934  (the  "Exchange Act")) of beneficial
ownership of 20% or more of either the then outstanding  shares of Common Stock
of  the  Company  or  the combined voting power of the then outstanding  voting
securities of the Company  entitled  to  vote  generally  in  the  election  of
directors; provided, however, that any acquisition by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or
its  subsidiaries,  or  any  corporation  with  respect to which following such
acquisition, more than 50% of, respectively, the  then  outstanding  shares  of
common  stock  of  such  corporation  and the combined voting power of the then
outstanding voting securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors is then beneficially  owned,  directly or indirectly,
by  all  or  substantially  all of the individuals and entities  who  were  the
beneficial owners, respectively,  of  the Common Stock and voting securities of
the Company immediately prior to such acquisition  in  substantially  the  same
proportion  as  their  ownership, immediately prior to such acquisition, of the
then outstanding shares  of  Common Stock of the Company or the combined voting
power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote
generally  in  the  election of directors,  as  the  case  may  be,  shall  not
constitute a Change of Control; or

            (ii) individuals  who,  as  of  the  Effective Date, constitute the
Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason  to  constitute  at  least a
majority  of  the  Board,  provided  that  any  individual  becoming a director
subsequent  to  such  date  whose election, or nomination for election  by  the
Company's shareholders, was approved  by  a  vote of at least a majority of the
directors then comprising the Incumbent Board  shall  be  considered  as though
such  individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for  this
purpose,  any  such  individual  whose  initial  assumption  of  office  is  in
connection  with  an  actual  or  threatened  election  contest relating to the
election of the directors of the Company (as such terms are used in rule 14a-11
of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act); or

            (iii)   approval   by  the  shareholders  of  the  Company   of   a
reorganization, merger or consolidation  of  the  Company,  in  each case, with
respect  to  which  the  individuals  and  entities  who  were  the  respective
beneficial  owners  of  the  Common  Stock and voting securities of the Company
immediately  prior to such reorganization,  merger  or  consolidation  do  not,
following such  reorganization,  merger  or  consolidation,  beneficially  own,
directly  or  indirectly,  more than 50% of, respectively, the then outstanding
shares of Common Stock and the  combined  voting  power of the then outstanding
voting securities entitled to vote generally in the  election  of directors, as
the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such reorganization,  merger
or consolidation, or a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or of
the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of  the
Company.

      3.    RIGHTS  AS  STOCKHOLDER.   Subject to the terms hereof, Director is
for all purposes the record and beneficial  owner  of  the Shares.  Director is
entitled to vote the Shares at all meetings of stockholders  and is entitled to
receive and retain all dividends that may be paid with respect  to  the Shares.
If and to the extent the Company shall effect a stock split, stock dividend  or
similar   distribution   with  respect  to  the  Common  Stock,  (i) the  stock
distributed pursuant thereto shall be held by the Company with respect to those
Restricted Shares as to which  the  Restrictions  have  not  yet  been  removed
pursuant  to  Section  2; (ii) such additional stock shall enjoy the privileges
and be subject to the Restrictions  applicable  to  the  Restricted Shares; and
(iii) Director shall be entitled to sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise
dispose of such additional stock when the Restrictions on the Restricted Shares
to which the distribution relates have been removed pursuant to Section 2.

      4.    ADJUSTMENTS.  In the event of any reorganization, recapitalization,
stock split, stock dividend, merger, consolidation, combination  of  shares  or
other  change affecting the Common Stock, the Board shall make such adjustments
as it may  deem  appropriate  with  respect to the Shares.  Any such adjustment
made by the Board shall be conclusive.

      5.    WITHHOLDING TAXES.

      (a)   No later than the date of  the issuance of the Unrestricted Shares,
Director  will pay to the Company, or make  arrangements  satisfactory  to  the
Company with  respect  to  the payment of, any federal, state or local taxes of
any kind required by law to  be  withheld  with  respect  to  the  Unrestricted
Shares.

      (b)   Director  may make an election under Section 83(b) of the  Internal
Revenue Code (an "83(b) Election"), within 30 days after the Effective Date, to
realize income for federal  income  tax purposes equal to the fair market value
of the Restricted Shares as of the Effective  Date.   In  such  event, Director
shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company to pay in the calendar year
that includes the Effective Date any federal, state or local taxes  required to
be withheld with respect to the Restricted Shares.  If Director makes  an 83(b)
Election, he shall provide notice to the Company by providing the Secretary  of
the  Company  a  copy  of  the  Section  83(b) Election filed with the Internal
Revenue Service concurrently with the filing of same.

      (c)   In the event that Director does not make an 83(b) Election, then no
later than the date of the removal or termination of the Restrictions on any of
the Restricted Shares as set forth herein, Director will pay to the Company, or
make arrangements satisfactory to the Company  with  respect to the payment of,
any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required  by  law  to be withheld
with  respect  to  the Restricted Shares with respect to which the Restrictions
have been removed or have terminated.

      (d)   Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if
Director does not satisfy  his  obligation  under paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of
this Section, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right
to deduct from any payments of any kind otherwise  due  from the Company or its
subsidiaries to or with respect to Director, whether or not  pursuant  to  this
Agreement  or  otherwise  and  regardless  of the form of payment, any federal,
state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to
the Shares.

      6.    NO  RIGHT  TO  CONTINUE AS A DIRECTOR.   This  Agreement  does  not
constitute evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that
the Company will retain Director as a director for any period of time or at any
particular rate of compensation.

      7.    INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS.

      (a)   The Shares are being  received  for Director's own account with the
intent of holding them and without the intent  of  participating,  directly  or
indirectly,  in  a  distribution  of such Shares and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution  of  such  Shares  or  any  portion
thereof.

      (b)   Director  understands  that the offering and issuance of the Shares
will not have been registered pursuant  to  the  Securities  Act  of  1933 (the
"Securities Act") or any applicable state securities laws, that the Shares will
be characterized as "restricted securities" under federal securities laws,  and
that  under  such  laws and applicable regulations the Shares cannot be sold or
otherwise disposed of  without  registration  under  the  Securities  Act or an
exemption  therefrom.   In this regard, Director represents that he is familiar
with Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, as currently in effect, and
understands the resale limitations imposed thereby and by the Securities Act.

      (c)   A legend indicating  that  the  offering and issuance of the Shares
have not been registered under applicable federal and state securities laws and
referring to the restrictions on transferability of the Shares pursuant to this
Agreement may be placed on any certificate(s)  or  other  document delivered to
Director or any substitute therefor and any transfer agent of the Company shall
be instructed to require compliance therewith.

      8.    GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement shall be governed  by  and construed
and  enforced  in  accordance  with the laws of the State of Delaware,  without
regard to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

      9.    BINDING EFFECT.  This  Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the  benefit  of  the  parties  hereto and  their  respective  heirs,  personal
representatives, successors and permitted assigns; provided that Director shall
not assign or otherwise transfer  this Agreement or any of Director's rights or
obligations hereunder.

      10.   ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENT.  This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties hereto  with respect to the subject matter hereof
and  supersedes all prior agreements and  understandings,  whether  written  or
oral,  between  the  parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  To the
fullest extent provided  by  applicable  law,  this  Agreement  may be amended,
modified and supplemented by mutual consent of the parties hereto  at any time,
with  respect  to any of the terms contained herein, in such manner as  may  be
agreed upon in writing by such parties.

      11.   SEVERABILITY.   If  any  provision  of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable, this Agreement shall be considered  divisible and such provision
shall be deemed inoperative to the extent it is deemed  unenforceable,  and  in
all  other  respects  this  Agreement  shall  remain  in full force and effect;
provided  that  if  any  such provision may be made enforceable  by  limitation
thereof, then such provision  shall  be  deemed  to  be so limited and shall be
enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

      12.   COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be  deemed  an original, but
all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
