ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

(a) General Development of Business

     The Bombay Company, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the "Company"
or "Bombay") is a  specialty retailer marketing traditional and classic
furniture, prints and accessories for the home through a network of retail
locations throughout the United States and Canada, through mail order and over
the internet at www.bombayco.com.  During Fiscal 1998, the Company expanded its
operations through the addition of 15 new stores and relocated or enlarged 16
additional stores while closing 18 locations.

     In 1995, the Company changed its year end to the Saturday nearest the end
of January.  Prior to that time, the Company's fiscal year ended the Sunday
nearest the end of June.  To effect the change, the Company's financial
statements are reported for a 30 week or seven month period ended January 28,
1995.

    In January 1995, the Company announced the closing of its Alex & Ivy
division and completed the closing in May 1995.  The following discussions
relate only to its on-going Bombay operations.


(b) Financial Information About Segments
     The Company operates in one business segment consisting of the retail sale
of decorative home furnishings and related items.


(c) Narrative Description of Business

Merchandise Sales, Purchasing and Distribution

     Bombay operates a chain of stores, located primarily in regional shopping
malls, certain secondary malls and selected urban and suburban locations.  As of
January 30, 1999, there were 361 Bombay stores in 42 states in the United States
and 51 stores in nine Canadian provinces.  Bombay also markets its products
through its mail order operations in the United States and Canada and through e-
commerce over the internet at www.bombayco.com.

     The Company offers a diverse selection of  products consisting of
approximately 3,500 SKUs of which over 95% of the product has been designed or
styled to Bombay's specifications.  Bombay's proprietary product offers unique
design, quality and exceptional value to a wide audience of consumers.  While
furniture is the Company's core competency and will remain as such, more focus
has recently and will continue to be given to the smaller "take with" items such
as wood and decorative accessories, crystal, candles and a wide assortment of
gift items.

     The Company regularly updates its merchandise assortment through
introducing new products and discontinuing others as they approach the end of
their life cycles.  During Fiscal 1998, approximately 2,200 SKUs were introduced
as compared to 1,200 SKUs in Fiscal 1997.  Typically, new product introductions
are concentrated during the Company's spring, fall and Christmas marketing
periods.  The principal categories of merchandise include the following:

     Furniture - This category includes both wood and metal ready-to-assemble
furniture focusing on the bedroom, living room, dining room and home office as
well as occasional pieces.  Furniture represented 49% of total sales for each of
the past three fiscal years.  Bombay's furniture is manufactured by contract
manufacturers located principally in China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Mexico, Indonesia,
India and the United States.  During 1997, the Company introduced a limited
offering of upholstered furniture which represents less than 1% of the total
sales.

     Accessories - This is the broadest category and represented 27%, 26% and 27
% of total sales in Fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  This category
includes both functional and decorative accessories including jewelry and
memorabilia boxes, baskets, candles and scents, crystal, ceramics, frames and
desktop, textiles, floral and holiday.  The items are imported from 14 countries
in Asia, North America and Europe.

     Wall Decor - This category includes prints, mirrors and sconces which
represented 15%, 17% and 16% of total sales in Fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.  This merchandise is sourced primarily from the United States,
Canada, Italy and Korea.

     Lamps and Other - This category includes lamps and seasonal offerings which
are sourced primarily from China, Taiwan and the United States.  These items
accounted for approximately 9%, 8% and 8% of total sales in Fiscal 1998, 1997
and 1996, respectively.

     Merchandise is manufactured to Company specifications through a network of
contract manufacturers located principally in Asia and North America.
Approximately 60% of production needs are provided from overseas sources.
Branch offices located in Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and China and agents in
various countries locate prospective vendors, coordinate production requirements
with manufacturers and provide technical expertise and quality control.

     Bombay is not dependent on any particular supplier and has had long
standing relationships with many of its vendors.  Approximately 70% of the
Company's merchandise requirements are supplied by 35 contract manufacturers in
eight countries.  No long-term production agreements are in place; however,
agreements are in place with major manufacturers that prohibit the production of
proprietary product for other parties.  Additional manufacturing capacity and
alternative sources, both domestic and international, continue to be added
through new vendors and plant expansions by existing vendors.  The Company does
business with its vendors principally in United States currency and has not
historically experienced any material difficulties as a result of any foreign
political, economic or social instabilities.

     Usually it takes several months from the time a merchandise order is placed
with a manufacturer until the goods are received at centralized distribution
centers in the United States and Canada.  Depending on the category, the source
country and whether an item is new or a reordered product, lead times can vary
from as little as two months to as much as twelve months from order placement
until arrival at the stores.  Order times are slightly less for North American
manufacturers principally due to shorter shipping times.  Lead times may also be
impacted by seasonality factors especially in months when manufacturers are
producing at or near peak capacity to meet seasonal demands.  As a result,
Bombay maintains a substantial inventory position in its distribution centers to
ensure a sufficient supply of products to its customers.

     Store inventories are replenished from regional distribution centers
located in Fort Worth, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Gilbertsville, Pennsylvania and
Mississaugua, Ontario.  The distribution centers are strategically located and
provide the capability to replenish the majority of store inventories within 48
hours of when the order is processed.  The Company uses dedicated trucks and
less-than-truckload carriers to transport its product from its distribution
centers to the stores.  The Company also leases two vehicles used to transport
product locally in the major metropolitan Toronto area.

Stores and Real Estate

     The Company bases its stores primarily in regional shopping malls, certain
secondary malls and selected urban and suburban locations that satisfy its
demographic and financial return criteria.  Significant attention is given to
visual merchandising opportunities to maximize the ability to display product in
the most attractive setting.

     In selecting store locations, the Company's real estate department conducts
extensive analyses of potential store sites and bases its selection on the
performance of other specialty retail tenants, the size of the market and the
demographics of the surrounding area.  In evaluating a store location, placement
of the store relative to retail traffic patterns and  customer base of other
retailers in the nearby vicinity are important considerations.  Although  90% of
the current stores are mall based, the Company has opened stores in alternative
locations including street and upscale, open air strip locations.  The Company
will continue to seek out the most potentially profitable locations for the
opening of new stores regardless of the venue.

     Prior to 1992, the Company operated stores that were typically 1,500 to
1,800 square feet in size.  In 1992, to accommodate the increasing number of
products, the Company introduced a large format store which was approximately
4,000 square feet in total size.  Between 1992 and 1995, the Company underwent a
dramatic period of growth expanding the total retail square footage relating to
Bombay stores from 504,000 square feet to 1,206,000 square feet and increasing
its Bombay store count from 309 to 428.  Beginning in 1995, the Company adopted
a more conservative approach to expansion, reducing both the number of stores
opened or converted to the large format and the targeted size of the stores from
4,000 square feet to 3,000 to 3,500 square feet.  As of January 30, 1999,  251
large format stores were in operation including 155 stores that have been
converted from regular stores since Fiscal 1992.

     During Fiscal 1997, the Company undertook a program to update its store
design and introduced the new design in three locations.  In Fiscal 1998, the
Company opened 15 new stores and converted 16 others from the regular format to
the large format, all of which were constructed in the new design.  In addition,
21 stores underwent major remodeling, including new paint, flooring and
lighting, while an additional 11 stores underwent minor updates in keeping with
the new design.  During the year, 18 underperforming stores were also closed.
In Fiscal 1999 and forward, the Company will continue its efforts to update the
appearance of its stores with all new store openings and conversions being
constructed in the new design.  The store expansion plan includes approximately
20 stores openings and 15 to 20 conversions in Fiscal 1999.

     During Fiscal 1998, the Company's store openings included five outlet
stores which were typically located in traditional outlet malls.  The Company
views the use of outlets as an opportunity to increase sales to a different
customer base, to assist in the orderly clearance of merchandise and to further
capitalize on its strength in designing and sourcing proprietary product.
Bombay's store opening plans for Fiscal 1999 include 5 to 8 outlet locations.

     The Company's average cost of leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures
and machinery for stores (excluding outlets) opened or converted in Fiscal 1998,
net of landlord allowances, was approximately $300,000 per store or $85 per
square foot.  In addition, other investments which consist primarily of
inventory in the store location, averaged approximately $86,000 per large format
store. The average cost of leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and
machinery for outlet stores opened in Fiscal 1998, net of landlord allowances,
was approximately $65,000 per store while the inventory investment also averaged
approximately $65,000 per store.  Bombay stores typically achieve store
operating level profitability during their first year of operations.

     As of January 30, 1999, 361 stores were operating in 42 states in the
United States and 51 stores were operating in nine provinces in Canada as
illustrated in the map below.

Competition

    The home furnishings and decorative accessories market is highly fragmented.
The Company faces competition from furniture stores, department stores and other
specialty retailers.  The Company believes that it competes primarily on the
basis of selection, quality and value of merchandise.

Employees

    The Company has approximately 5,000 employees, which include approximately
3,000 part-time employees, and is not a party to any union contract.  Employee
relations are considered to be good.

Seasonality

    Operating results are subject to seasonal variation.  Historically, the
largest proportion of sales and substantially all of the income occurs in the
fiscal quarter the Christmas season.  Cash balances increase significantly in
December due to the Christmas business.

Intangibles

     The Company owns a number of the trademarks and service marks used in its
business, including federal registrations for the marks "The Bombay Company" and
"Bombay" and the palm tree logo.  The Company's trademarks are also registered
or are the subject of pending applications in a number of foreign countries.
Each registration is renewable indefinitely if the mark is still in use at the
time of renewal.

     The Company believes that its registered trademarks have significant value
and that these marks enhance the Bombay brand and are instrumental in the
Company's ability to create, sustain demand for and market its product.  From
time to time, the Company discovers products in the marketplace that are
counterfeit reproductions of the Company's product or that otherwise infringe
upon trademark or tradedress rights held by the Company.  The Company has and
will continue to vigorously defend it rights under the marks as necessary.

     INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT
     To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
     The Bombay Company, Inc.
     
       In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance
     sheets and the related consolidated statements of
     operations, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows
     present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
     position of The Bombay Company, Inc. and its
     subsidiaries at January 30, 1999 and January 31, 1998,
     and the results of their operations and their cash
     flows for the three years ended January 30, 1999, in
     conformity with generally accepted accounting
     principles. These financial statements are the
     responsibility of the Company's management; our
     responsibility is to express an opinion on these
     financial statements based on our audits. We conducted
     our audits of these statements in accordance with
     generally accepted auditing standards which require
     that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
     assurance about whether the financial statements are
     free of material misstatement. An audit includes
     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
     amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
     assessing the accounting principles used and
     significant estimates made by management, and
     evaluating the overall financial statement
     presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
     reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
     
       As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the
     Company changed its method of accounting for inventory
     during the year ended February 1, 1997.

     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

     General
          The Bombay Company, Inc. ("Company") is a
     specialty retailer which markets traditional and
     classic furniture, prints and accessories through its
     412 locations of The Bombay Company ("Bombay") retail
     stores in 42 states in the United States and nine
     Canadian provinces, through mail order and over the
     internet at www.bombayco.com.

          The largest percentage of the Company's sales and
     operating income is realized in the fiscal quarter that 
     includes December (Christmas season). Merchandise is
     manufactured to Company specification through a network
     of contract manufacturers located principally in Asia
     and North America.  Because the majority of the Company's
     products are proprietary, the impact of inflation on operating
     results is typically not significant.  The Company attempts to
     alleviate inflationary pressures by increasing selling prices
     (subject to competitive conditions), improving designs and finding
     alternative production sources in lower cost countries.  
     
          See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
     Statements for fiscal reporting periods.

     Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
          Certain statements in this Annual Report to
     Shareholders under "Management's Discussion and
     Analysis" constitute "forward-looking statements"
     within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
     Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements
     involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
     other factors which may cause the actual results,
     performance or achievements of the Company to be
     materially different from any future results,
     performance or achievements expressed or implied by
     such forward-looking statements. Such factors include,
     among others, the following: competition; seasonality;
     success of operating initiatives; new product
     development and introduction schedules; acceptance of
     new product offerings; advertising and promotional
     efforts; adverse publicity; expansion of the store
     chain; availability, locations and terms of sites for
     store development; changes in business strategy or
     development plans; availability and terms of capital;
     labor and employee benefit costs; changes in government
     regulations; risks associated with international
     business; regional weather conditions and the effects
     of Year 2000 issues.
     
     Net Sales
          During Fiscal 1998, the Company recorded net sales
     of $356.7 million, an increase of  $24.1 million or 7%,
     over net sales of $332.6 million in Fiscal 1997. The
     increase is due to a 6% increase in same store sales
     (stores in existence for one year or more) as well as
     opening 15 new stores during the year and converting
     another 16 regular stores to the larger format. These
     increases were partially offset by the closure of 18
     underperforming stores. The same store sales increase
     was driven by promotional selling of old and
     discontinued merchandise as new management purged
     inventory of items that no longer were consistent with
     the Company's direction. From a sales mix standpoint,
     furniture represented 49% of the sales, accessories
     were 27%, wall decor (principally prints, mirrors and
     sconces) was 15% and lamps and other categories
     represented 9% of the business. In order to broaden the
     customer base and increase the sales per square foot in
     the stores, new management has focused on developing
     the non - furniture portion of the business which
     resulted in a shift in the mix toward the latter part
     of the year. This emphasis resulted in an 11% increase
     in the number of transactions this year and a 3% decline
     in the average ticket to $88. All regions of the United 
     States contributed to the sales gains with relatively 
     little variation in same store sales performance.  Canadian
     sales were adversely impacted by the unfavorable 
     changes in the Canadian exchange rate which resulted in
     their reporting flat comparable store sales for the year 
     measured in U.S. dollars.
     
          In Fiscal 1997, net sales declined by $3.7 million
     or 1% to $332.6 million from $336.3 million in Fiscal
     1996. The most significant contributor to the sales
     decline was the closure of 14 underperforming stores.
     Same store sales were flat for the year while new
     stores accounted for a 1% increase in sales over Fiscal
     1996. The Fiscal 1997 sales mix consisted of: 49%
     furniture, 26% accessories, 17% wall decor and 8% lamps
     and other categories, essentially the same as Fiscal
     1996. The average ticket sale increased by 7%; however,
     the number of transactions also declined by 7%. On a
     regional basis, Canada and the Northeastern United
     States reported the strongest results although the
     results across all regions were within a very small
     range.
     
     Cost of Sales, Buying and Store Occupancy Costs
          Cost of sales, including buying and store
     occupancy costs, for Fiscal 1998 was $252.9 million or
     70.9% of sales. As a percentage of sales, these costs
     increased from 69.1% of sales in Fiscal 1997. Product
     margins declined 240 basis points compared to the prior
     year as the new management team aggressively cleared
     old and discontinued merchandise. The decline in
     product margin was partially offset by a 60 basis point
     improvement in buying and occupancy costs due to the
     relatively fixed nature of costs measured against sales
     increases.
     
          In Fiscal 1997, cost of sales, including buying
     and store occupancy costs, was $229.9 million or 69.1%
     of sales. As a percentage of sales, these costs
     improved from 69.6% in Fiscal 1996. Product margins
     improved 60 basis points compared to the prior year as
     inventory overstock was sold and new products were
     introduced. The increase in product margin was somewhat
     offset by a 10 basis point increase in buying and
     occupancy costs due to the relatively fixed nature of
     costs measured against sales declines.
     
     Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
          Selling, general and administrative expenses in
     Fiscal 1998 were $98.9 million, an increase of $1.2
     million or 1%,  compared to $97.7 million in Fiscal
     1997. Although expense amounts increased, as a
     percentage of sales, selling, general and
     administrative expenses declined from 29.4% to 27.7%.
     Improvements were realized primarily in advertising (63
     basis points), payroll and payroll related costs (40
     basis points) and insurance (31 basis points) as a
     result of higher sales levels and continued cost
     control efforts.
     
          In Fiscal 1997, selling, general and
     administrative expenses were reduced $9.7 million to
     $97.7 million compared to $107.4 million in Fiscal
     1996. As a percentage of sales, expenses declined to
     29.4% of sales in Fiscal 1997 from 31.9% of sales in
     Fiscal 1996.  Excluding charges related to management
     changes of $.8 million in Fiscal 1997 and $4.2 million 
     in Fiscal 1996 (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated
     Financial Statements), selling, general and
     administrative expenses were $96.9 million, or 29.1% of
     sales, in Fiscal 1997 compared to $103.2 million, or 
     30.7% of sales, in Fiscal 1996.  The decrease was primarily
     due to lower payroll and payroll related costs (110 basis 
     points) and lower supplies costs (20 basis points) as a result
     of more stringent cost control initiatives.
     
     Interest
          Interest income in Fiscal 1998 was $1.9 million
     compared to $2.3 million in Fiscal 1997. There was no
     interest expense in either period. The decline in
     interest income was due primarily to lower average cash
     balances as the Company increased its capital
     expenditures to $17.3 million during Fiscal 1998
     compared to $4.0 million in Fiscal 1997. Additionally,
     $6.2 million of cash was utilized for repurchasing
     Company stock during Fiscal 1998. The decline in the
     cash balance was somewhat offset by higher interest
     rates earned during the year resulting from changes in
     the Company's investment mix.
     
          Interest income increased $1.6 million in Fiscal
     1997 compared to Fiscal 1996 when interest income was
     $.7 million with interest expense less than $.1
     million. The increase in interest income relates to
     higher average balances in short-term investments as
     inventory levels were controlled to significantly lower
     levels than in Fiscal 1996.
     
     Income Taxes
          The Company provided $2.8 million for income taxes
     in Fiscal 1998 and $2.9 million in Fiscal 1997 while
     reflecting a benefit of $1.6 million in Fiscal 1996.
     The effective rate was 41.0%, 39.3% and (35.6%) in
     Fiscal 1998, Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1996, respectively.
     Fluctuations in the effective rate are primarily
     related to state taxes. In Fiscal 1998 the effective
     state tax rate was higher, and in Fiscal 1996 the
     Company realized an operating loss without reflecting a
     corresponding state tax benefit.
     
     Liquidity and Capital Resources
          The primary sources of liquidity and capital
     resources are cash flows from operations and bank lines
     of credit. Bank borrowings are available to fund
     seasonal inventory purchases. In addition, the bank
     credit lines are used for overseas merchandise
     purchases.  Unsecured bank lines aggregate $45 million,
     of which $30 million are committed under revolving
     credit agreements expiring April 13, 1999. These lines
     are expected to be renewed with existing banks under
     similar terms.
     
     Fiscal 1998
          At January 30, 1999, cash and short-term
     investments were $52.8 million, a decrease of $3.3
     million from January 31, 1998. Net cash provided by
     operations of $19.4 million is comprised primarily of
     $4.0 million in net income which included non-cash
     depreciation and amortization totaling $10.3 million as
     well as a decrease in inventories of $8.8 million. The
     decline in inventories is primarily related to aggressive
     moves to clear old and discontinued merchandise. These 
     sources of cash were partially offset by an increase in other
     noncurrent assets of $3.3 million related to current year 
     software purchases as well as the acquisition of 1.2 million 
     shares of Company stock acquired at a cost of $6.2 million
     under a stock buy back program approved by the Board of 
     Directors in June 1998.
     
          Capital expenditures totaled $17.3 million and
     included the costs of 15 new stores, 16 store
     conversions, purchases of additional store fixtures and
     routine purchases of machinery and equipment. The
     capital expenditure program for Fiscal 1999 is planned
     at approximately $22 million and includes approximately
     20 store openings and 15 to 20 conversions. Generally,
     a new or converted store is profitable in its first
     full year of operations. The planned Fiscal 1999
     capital expenditures also include approximately $6
     million for the replacement of store point of sale
     equipment. The Company believes that its current cash
     position, cash flows from operations and borrowings
     available under bank credit lines will be sufficient to
     fund current operations, stock buy back and capital
     expenditure programs.
    
     Fiscal 1997
          At January 31, 1998, cash and short-term
     investments were $56.1 million, a decrease of $7.0
     million from February 1, 1997. Net cash used by
     operations was $4.1 million. Cash was used primarily
     for the increase in inventories of $16.8 million and
     decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of
     $5.6 million. These were partially offset by net income
     of $4.5 million which included non-cash depreciation
     and amortization totaling $9.9 million.
    
          Capital expenditures totaled $3.9 million and
     included the costs of two new stores, five store
     conversions and routine purchases of machinery and
     equipment.
    
     Year 2000 Conversion
          The Company recognizes the need to ensure that it
     will be prepared for Year 2000 issues and is engaged in
     an ongoing and comprehensive effort to mitigate such
     risks. While the Year 2000 impact on  information
     technology has been addressed and remediation efforts
     have been in process since 1997, during Fiscal 1998 a
     "Y2K" team consisting of key employees representing all
     functional areas of the Company was developed to
     address all other potential areas of Year 2000 impact,
     investigate solutions and develop contingency plans.
     The overall objective of the Company's efforts to date
     has been to identify and remediate Year 2000 related
     conditions that could reasonably be expected to cause a
     mission critical failure if not addressed. Efforts
     related to this objective have focused on a review of
     all proprietary and third-party systems and software,
     as well as an analysis of the risks inherent in
     significant business partner and vendor relationships.
     The Company's Year 2000 program and associated
     resources are primarily directed toward ensuring that
     the Company will be able to effect sales, order and
     receive merchandise, and pay its vendors and employees.

          The Company's merchandising system was implemented
     in 1994 and was designed to be Year 2000 compliant;
     however, testing was not performed at that time to
     determine its readiness.  An eight-tiered project, the
     Company's most extensive effort related to Year 2000,
     to identify and remediate Year 2000 issues with this
     software and other ancillary systems began in Summer
     1997 and is scheduled for completion by Fall 1999.
    
          The Company is in the process of replacing the
     majority of its store environment software and hardware
     including the current proprietary point of sale system,
     polling and operating systems.  Portions of the
     hardware are already Year 2000 compliant and will
     remain in use. The new vendor supported store
     environment infrastructure is currently undergoing
     testing and is scheduled for a complete rollout during
     the second and third quarters of Fiscal 1999. Those
     portions of the store environment systems that are
     affected by Year 2000 are scheduled for completion in
     the third quarter of Fiscal 1999.
    
          The existing financial accounting and reporting
     software has recently been upgraded by its vendor. The
     vendor has certified that, with this upgrade, the
     system is Year 2000 compliant.
    
          This year the Company has also implemented new
     payroll and human resources systems, each of which is
     certified by the respective vendor to be Year 2000
     compliant and which replaces a non-compliant system.
    
          For those systems which the respective vendor has
     certified as Year 2000 compliant, the Company is still
     assessing what additional testing is needed to ensure
     their readiness.
    
          The Company is also in the process of contacting
     its significant business partners and vendors in an
     effort to identify those that will not or may not be
     Year 2000 compliant. They include landlords,
     international and domestic vendors who supply
     merchandise to the Company for resale, suppliers of
     services such as banks and financial services, data
     processing services, advertising services,
     telecommunications services and utilities. The strategy
     for addressing our vendors is risk based. Each
     functional area of the Company is currently engaged in
     ranking each of its vendors as "critical", "essential"
     or "non-essential". Surveys are being sent primarily to
     critical and essential vendors with exceptions made for
     selected non-critical vendors that may serve in a
     contingency role.  As vendors who are unable or
     unwilling to provide certification of Year 2000
     readiness are identified, alternatives and
     contingencies intended to mitigate Year 2000 risks
     perceived to be material will be considered.
    
          Primary attention is being given to the Company's
     overseas vendors, and purchasing agents are expected to
     play a major role in identifying, assessing and
     mitigating potential Year 2000 issues that are
     foreseeable. Significant emphasis in this area is vital
     as many of our primary vendors are concentrated in
     regions ofthe world that are commonly perceived to be
     potentially less prepared for the Year 2000.
          
          During the year, the Company spent approximately
     $1.0 million on the installation of its new payroll and
     human resources systems and has incurred approximately
     $.7 million in connection with the design and testing
     of its new store environment systems. The Company
     expects to incur an additional $6.0 million in Fiscal
     1999 in connection with the implementation of the new
     store environment technology. In addition to the cost
     of purchasing and implementing compliant replacement
     systems, the Company incurred approximately $.4
     million in Fiscal 1998 and expects to incur
     approximately $.8 million in Fiscal 1999 for ancillary
     testing and remediation of Year 2000 issues, consisting
     primarily of normal salaries paid to existing employees
     through the redirection of internal programming
     resources. These costs and expenditures were included
     in the Company's operating budget and have not had a
     material effect on the results of operations, liquidity
     or financial position.  Purchased hardware, software
     and the costs of their implementation are capitalized
     and amortized over their useful lives while other costs
     of remediation associated with the Year 2000 conversion
     are being expensed as incurred.
     
          The Company is actively engaged in the process of
     developing contingency plans to address situations that
     may result if the Company is unable to achieve Year
     2000 readiness of its critical operations. Operational
     and information technology functions are being
     identified and classified according to their degree of
     risk.  Development of contingency plans is expected to
     continue through the third quarter of Fiscal 1999.
     There can be no assurance that the Company will be able
     to develop a contingency plan that will adequately
     address issues that may arise in Year 2000 or that the
     failure to develop such a plan will not have a material
     impact on the operations of the Company.
     
          Because of the pervasiveness of potential Year
     2000 impact, there can be no assurance that all
     associated issues have been fully identified and
     addressed. In fact, reliance on the technical skills of
     employees and independent contractors and on the
     representations of third parties are among the factors
     that could cause the Company's efforts to be less than
     fully effective. While it has realistically examined
     its exposure to Year 2000 issues and has taken steps to
     address those issues over which it has direct control,
     the Company acknowledges that there are considerable
     risks that are beyond its reasonable control. These
     risks include the potential failure of domestic and
     international utility companies to deliver power, of
     domestic and international telecommunications companies
     to render voice and data services, of financial
     institutions to process transactions or transfer funds,
     and of vendors to deliver merchandise ordered or to
     perform services required by the Company. Additionally,
     the Company acknowledges that it is vulnerable to the
     impact that Year 2000 may have on domestic and
     international economies to the extent that such
     economies may negatively impact the Company's vendors,
     business partners, customers or agents. Although the
     Company believes that it has taken appropriate and
     and reasonable actions to identify and mitigate risks
     associated with the Year 2000 issues that are within its
     ability to control, there can be no assurance that its
     efforts will be fully effective. Furthermore, there can
     be no assurance that the systems of other companies and
     agencies on which the Company relies will be timely 
     converted or that such failure to convert by another 
     entity would not have an adverse impact on the Company's
     operations.

     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
<F1>
     Note 1 - Statement of Accounting Policies  
     _______________________________________________________
     Basis of Presentation
          The consolidated financial statements include the
     accounts of the Company and its wholly - owned
     subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
     transactions, balances and profits have been
     eliminated. The Company has a retail (52 - 53 week)
     fiscal year which ends on the Saturday nearest January
     31. The periods ended January 30, 1999 ("Fiscal 1998"),
     January 31,1998 ("Fiscal 1997") and February 1, 1997
     ("Fiscal 1996") represent 52 weeks.
     
     Use of Estimates
          The preparation of financial statements in
     conformity with generally accepted accounting
     principles requires management to make estimates.
     Actual results could differ from those estimates.
     
     Foreign Currency Translation
          Fiscal year end exchange rates are used to
     translate assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars.
     Monthly average exchange rates are used to translate
     income and expenses. The cumulative effect of foreign
     currency translation adjustments is reported in
     accumulated other comprehensive income within
     stockholders' equity.
     
     Cash and Cash Equivalents
          Cash in stores, deposits in banks and short-term
     investments with original maturities of three months or
     less are considered as cash and cash equivalents for
     the purposes of the financial statements. Short - term
     investments are recorded at the lower of cost or fair
     market value.
     
     Inventories
          Inventories are primarily finished merchandise and
     are valued at the lower of average cost or market, cost
     being determined based upon the weighted average
     inventory method.
     
     Accounting Change
          During the quarter ended May 4, 1996, the Company
     changed the timing of allocation of overhead costs to
     distribution center inventories. The change more
     accurately reflects inventory costs and represents a
     preferable method of accounting for distribution center
     inventories. The cumulative effect of this change was
     $835,000, net of tax, or $.02 per share. This amount is
     presented in the Consolidated Statement of Operations
     as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. The
     impact of this change on Fiscal 1996 results, excluding
     the cumulative effect, was not significant. The pro
     forma effect of the change on prior years' net income
     (loss) and net income (loss) per share is not
     significant.
     
     Property and Equipment
          Property and equipment are depreciated over the
     estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight
     line method over the lives shown:

            Building                    Forty years
            Furniture and Equipment     Two to ten years
            Leasehold improvements      The lesser of the life
                                        of the lease or asset
                                        
          Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
     incurred. Renewals and betterments which materially
     prolong the useful lives of the assets are capitalized.
     The cost and related accumulated depreciation of
     property retired or sold are removed from the accounts,
     and gains or losses are recognized in the statement of
     operations.
     
     Advertising Costs
          Advertising costs are expensed the first time the
     advertising takes place. During Fiscal 1998, Fiscal
     1997 and Fiscal 1996, advertising expense was
     $19,273,000, $20,096,000 and $19,887,000, respectively.
     
     Goodwill
          Goodwill recorded in association with acquisitions
     accounted for using the purchase method is amortized
     using the straight - line method over the estimated
     useful life of 40 years. The amortization policy is
     reviewed annually and impairments, if any, would be
     recognized if the expected future undiscounted
     operating cash flows derived from such assets are less
     than their carrying value.
     
     Income Taxes
          The Company uses the liability method of computing
     deferred income taxes on all material temporary
     differences. Temporary differences are the differences
     between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
     and their tax bases. The Company assesses realizability
     of deferred tax assets and, if necessary, a valuation
     allowance is provided.
     
     Comprehensive Income
          Effective February 1, 1998, the Company adopted
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.130,
     Reporting Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive income is
     defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a
     business enterprise during a period from transactions
     and other events and circumstances from non-owner
     sources. It includes all changes in equity during a
     period except those resulting from investments by
     owners and distributions to owners. Such amounts are
     included in accumulated other comprehensive income
     within stockholders' equity and consist of the
     cumulative effect of foreign currency translation
     adjustments.
     
     Earnings per Share
          In March 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards
     Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
     Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share ("FAS 128"),
     which superceded Accounting Principles Board Opinion
     No. 15. FAS 128 requires presentation of basic and
     diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share
     are based upon the weighted average number of shares
     outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are based upon
     the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus
     the shares that would be outstanding assuming exercise
     of dilutive stock options and distribution of
     restricted stock and deferred director compensation.  
     The Company adopted FAS 128 in Fiscal 1997 on a 
     retrospective basis
       
        
          The computations for basic and diluted earnings
     from continuing operations per share follow (in
     thousands, except per share amounts):

     Note 3 - Debt
     _______________________________________________________
            
          The Company has unsecured revolving credit
     agreements with a group of banks aggregating $45
     million at January 30, 1999 of which $30 million is
     committed. The credit facilities are for working
     capital and letter of credit purposes, primarily to
     fund seasonal merchandise purchases, and bear interest
     at market rates based on prime. The credit agreements
     restrict dividend payments, and require the maintenance
     of various financial ratios and the payment of
     negotiated fees. The revolving credit agreements expire
     April 13, 1999 and are expected to be renewed under
     similar terms. At January 30, 1999, there were
     $13,561,000 in letters of credit outstanding under the
     credit facilities, issued principally in conjunction
     with overseas merchandise purchases. Interest expense
     and negotiated fees for Fiscal 1998, Fiscal 1997 and
     Fiscal 1996 totaled $247,000, $182,000 and $138,000,
     respectively.

     Note 4 - Commitments and Contingencies
     _______________________________________________________
     
          Store, distribution and field office facilities
     are leased under operating leases expiring through
     2013. The store leases are generally based upon a
     minimum rental plus a percentage of the store sales in
     excess of specified levels. Store lease terms generally
     require additional payments covering taxes, common area
     charges and certain other costs. Rental expense for
     Fiscal 1998, Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1996 totaled
     $40,244,000, $39,051,000 and $39,502,000, respectively.
     
          The minimum rental commitments for future fiscal
     years are as follows (in thousands):

     
     Fiscal
     1999                             $38,373

        The Company has certain contingent liabilities
     resulting from litigation and claims incident to the
     ordinary course of business. Management believes that
     the probable resolution of such contingencies will not
     materially affect the financial position or results of
     operations of the Company.

     Note 5 - Employee Benefit Plans
     _______________________________________________________
     
          The Bombay Company, Inc. Employee 401(k) Savings
     and Stock Ownership Plan ("401(k) Plan") is open to
     substantially all employees who have been employed for
     one year and who work at least 1,000 hours per year.
     Under the 401(k) Plan, a participant may contribute up
     to 14% of earnings with the Company matching the first
     5% at a rate of 75%. Contributions are paid to a
     corporate trustee and invested in various funds.
     Company matching contributions made to participants'
     accounts become fully vested upon completion of two
     years of service. Similar benefit plans are in effect
     for eligible foreign employees.
     
          To the extent employees are unable to contribute
     up to 5% of their earnings to the 401(k) Plan because
     of limitations imposed by IRS regulations, a
     Supplemental Stock Program was adopted. Under this
     program, employee contributions in excess of IRS
     limitations, along with Company matching contributions,
     are distributed annually in the form of Company common
     stock.
     
          The Bombay Company, Inc. Stock Purchase Program is
     open to all full-time employees who have at least six
     months of service. Each participant may contribute 5%
     or 10% of qualifying compensation. Contributions are
     used to purchase shares of Company common stock, which
     are distributed annually to all participants. The
     participants' shares are fully vested upon purchase.
     There is currently no Company match on the Stock
     Purchase Program.
     
          Total Company contributions to these plans for
     Fiscal 1998, Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1996 were $544,000,
     $681,000 and $1,667,000,  respectively.
     
          During Fiscal 1998, the Company modified its
     vacation policy in order to be more competitive with
     the retail industry. As a result of the change, the
     Company recorded a one time pre - tax credit of
     $700,000, equivalent to $.01 per share after tax, relating to
     expenses that had been accrued under the previous policy
     but were no longer required under the revised policy.
     
     Note 6 - Common Stock and Stock Options
     _______________________________________________________
     
          On June 17,1998, the Company announced that its
     Board of Directors had approved a stock buy back
     program with initial authorization to purchase up to
     $10 million of the Company's stock. The shares may be
     purchased from time to time, through open market
     purchases and privately negotiated transactions. As of
     January 30, 1999, 1,207,200 shares had been purchased
     at a cost aggregating $6,170,000 of which 36,270 had
     been sold to the Company's employee stock plans or used
     for distributions of deferred director fees.
     
          Non - employee directors are eligible to
     participate in the 1993 Stock Deferral Plan for Non -
     Employee Directors, which allows such directors the
     option to defer receipt of retainer payments and
     meeting fees which are credited to an account for such
     director in units equivalent to Company common stock.
     
          The Company has a shareholders' rights plan under
     which each share of Company common stock includes one
     Preferred Share Purchase Right ("Right") entitling the
     holder to buy one one-thousandth of a share of Series A
     Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Company at
     an exercise price of $50. The Rights, which have ten
     year terms expiring in 2005, are exercisable if a
     person or group acquires 15% or more of the common
     stock of the Company or announces a tender offer for
     15% or more of the common stock. If a person or group
     acquires 15% or more of the outstanding common stock of
     the Company, each Right will entitle the holder to
     purchase, at the Right's exercise price, a number of
     shares of Company common stock having a market value of
     twice the Right's exercise price. If the Company is
     acquired in a merger or other business combination
     transaction after a person or group acquires 15% or
     more of the Company's common stock, each Right will
     entitle its holder to purchase, at the Right's exercise
     price, a number of shares of the acquiring company's
     common stock having a market value of twice the Right's
     exercise price. The Rights are redeemable at one cent
     per Right at any time before they become exercisable.
     
          The Bombay Company, Inc. 1986 Stock Option Plan
     and 1996 Long Term Incentive Stock Plan ("Employee
     Plans") provide for the granting of options (and other
     types of stock-related awards under the 1996 plan) to
     officers and key management employees. At January 30,
     1999, the option shares reserved for the Employee Plans
     were 4,523,299. The option price is fixed at the market
     price or higher on the date of the grant. Options are
     generally exercisable annually at a rate of 33% per
     year beginning one year after the grant date. Shares
     available for additional grants were 2,315,959,
     2,663,618 and 1,096,403  at January 30, 1999,  January
     31,1998 and February 1, 1997,  respectively.
     
          On March 12, 1997, the Board of Directors granted
     50,000 shares each of restricted stock under the 1996
     Long Term Incentive Stock Plan to two key executives. The
     respective shares were issuable at March 12, 2001 contingent
     upon the continued employment of each executive. Compensation
     expense of $105,000 was recognized during Fiscal 1997 in 
     connection with the restricted stock. The expense related 
     to each was reversed during Fiscal 1998 and the grants were
     canceled upon the respective departures of the excutives from
     the Company.
     
          During Fiscal 1998, restricted stock aggregating
     90,000 shares was granted under the 1996 Long Term
     Incentive Stock Plan to three key executives. The
     respective shares are issuable in designated increments
     contingent upon continued employment of the respective
     executive after 12 months, 24 months and 36 months. If
     each of the executives remains employed by the Company
     under the terms of the grant, 13,000, 27,500 and 49,500
     shares will be issuable during Fiscal 1999, Fiscal 2000
     and Fiscal 2001, respectively. Compensation expense of
     $214,000 was recognized during Fiscal 1998 in
     connection with the restricted stock.
     
          The Bombay Company, Inc. 1991 Director Stock
     Option Plan ("Director Plan") provides for the granting
     of options to members of the Board of Directors who are
     neither employees nor officers of the Company. At
     January 30, 1999, the option shares reserved for the
     Director Plan were 275,005. The option price is fixed
     at the market price on the date of the grant. The
     option grant, initial and annual, is currently the
     lesser of 5,000 shares or $75,000 in face value. The
     initial grant becomes exercisable at a rate of 20% per
     year beginning one year after the grant date and
     includes past Board service toward full vesting of the
     initial grant. Each additional annual grant becomes
     fully exercisable six months after the grant date.
     Shares available for additional grants were 56,946,
     6,946 and 18,633  at January 30, 1999, January 31,1998
     and February 1, 1997, respectively.

     Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock - Based
     Compensation ("FAS 123"). Accordingly, no compensation
     cost has been recognized for options granted. Had
     compensation cost for the Company's stock option plans
     been determined based on the fair value at the grant
     date for awards in Fiscal 1995 through Fiscal 1998 in
     accordance with the provisions of FAS 123, the

          The exercise of non - qualified stock options in
     Fiscal 1998, Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1996 resulted in
     income tax benefits of $17,000, $47,000 and $558,000,
     respectively, which were credited to additional paid -
     in capital. The income tax benefits are the tax effect
     of the difference between the market price on the date
     of exercise and the option price.

resolution of the Board of Directors.

     SECTION 6.   QUORUM.  One-third, but not less than two (2), of the
directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  If at any
meeting of the Board of Directors there shall be less than a quorum present, a
majority of those present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without
notice other than announcement of the adjournment at the meeting, and at such
adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present any business may be transacted
which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

     SECTION 7.   COMPENSATION.  The directors may be paid their expenses, if
any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors, a fixed sum for
attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and/or a stated fee as
director.  No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the
Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.  Members
of the Executive Committee and/or of other committees may be allowed like
compensation and reimbursement of expenses for attending committee meetings.

In case any officer or officers who shall have signed, or whose facsimile

certificates shall have ceased to be such, whether because of death, resignation
or otherwise, before such certificate or certificates shall have been issued and
delivered, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued and
delivered with the same effect as if such officer or officers had not ceased to
be such at the date of its issue and delivery.

     SECTION 2.   TRANSFER OF SHARES.  The shares of the stock of the
Corporation shall be transferred on the books of the Corporation by the holder
thereof in person or by his attorney lawfully constituted, upon surrender for
cancellation of certificates for the same number of shares, with an assignment
and power of transfer endorsed thereon or attached thereto, duly executed, with
such proof or guaranty of the authenticity of the signature as the Corporation
or its agents may reasonably require.  The Corporation shall be entitled to
treat the holder of record of any share or shares of stock as the holder in fact
thereof and accordingly shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other
claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person
whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as
otherwise  expressly provided by law.

     SECTION 3.   CLOSING OF TRANSFER BOOKS AND RECORD DATES.  The Board of
Directors may in its discretion prescribe, in advance, a record date not
exceeding sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days prior to the date of any
meeting of the stockholders or prior to the last day on which the consent or
dissent of stockholders may be effectively expressed for any purpose without a
meeting, during which no transfer of stock on the books of the Corporation may
be made; or in lieu of prohibiting the transfer of stock, may fix, in advance, a
record date not more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days prior to the
date of any meeting of stockholders or prior to the last day on which the
consent or dissent of stockholders may be effectively expressed for any purpose
without a meeting, as the time as of which stockholders entitled to notice of
and to vote at such a meeting or whose consent or dissent is required or may be
expressed for any purpose, as the case may be, shall be determined; and all
persons who were holders of record of voting stock at such time and no others
shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting or to express their
consent or dissent, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any
stock on the books of the Corporation after any record date fixed as aforesaid.
The Board of Directors may also, in its discretion, fix in advance a date not
exceeding sixty (60) days preceding the date fixed for the payment of any
dividend or the making of any distribution, or for the delivery of evidence of
rights, or evidences of interests arising out of any issuance, change,
conversion or exchange of capital stock, as a record date for the determination
of the stockholders entitled to receive or participate in any such dividend,
distribution, rights or interests, notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on
the books of the Corporation after any record date fixed as aforesaid, or, at
its option, in lieu of so fixing a record date, may prescribe in advance a
period not exceeding sixty (60) days prior to the date for such payment,
distribution or delivery during which no transfer of stock on the books of the
Corporation may be made.

     SECTION 4.   LOST OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES.  In case of the loss or
destruction of any outstanding certificate of stock, a new certificate may be
issued upon the following conditions:

     The owner of said certificate shall file with the Secretary of the
Corporation an affidavit giving the facts in relation to the ownership, and in
relation to the loss or destruction of said certificate, stating its number and
the number of shares represented thereby; such affidavit to be in such form and
contain such statements as shall satisfy the President and Secretary that said
certificate has been accidentally destroyed or lost, and that a new certificate
ought to be issued in lieu thereof.  Upon being so notified, the President and
Secretary shall require such owner to file with the Secretary a bond in such
penal sum and in such form as they may deem advisable, and with a surety or
sureties approved by them, to indemnify and save harmless the Corporation from
any claim, loss, damage or liability which may be occasioned by the issuance of
a new certificate in lieu thereof.  Upon such bond being so filed, a new
certificate for the same number of shares shall be issued to the owner of the
certificate so lost or destroyed; and the transfer agent and registrar of stock,
if any, shall countersign and register such new certificate upon receipt of a
written order signed by the said President and Secretary, and thereupon the
Corporation will save harmless said transfer agent and registrar in the
premises.  Any Vice President may act hereunder in the stead of the President,
and an Assistant Secretary in the stead of the Secretary.  In case of the
surrender of the original certificate, in lieu of which a new certificate has
been issued, or the surrender of such new certificate, for cancellation, the
bond of indemnity given as a condition of the issue of such new certificate may
be surrendered.  A new certificate may be issued without requiring any bond when
in the judgment of the Board of Directors it is proper to do so.

                             NON QUALIFIED OPTIONS
                                  PURSUANT TO
          THE BOMBAY COMPANY, INC. 1996 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN

     This Award Agreement (the "Agreement") is made this ___ day of ________,
199_, between THE BOMBAY COMPANY, INC., a Delaware Corporation (the "Company"),
and _____________, an employee of the Company or one of its subsidiaries (the
"Employee").

     WHEREAS, the Company desires to carry out the purposes of The Bombay
Company, Inc. 1996 Long Term Incentive Stock Plan (the "Plan") by affording
Employee the opportunity to purchase shares of the Company's $1.00 par value
common stock (the "Shares").

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set
forth for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

     1.   Grant of Award.  The Company hereby grants to Employee the right and
option (the "Option") to purchase an aggregate of  _______ shares of  the
Company's Shares, such Shares being subject to adjustment as provided in
paragraph 8 hereof, and on the terms and conditions herein set forth.  The
Shares granted pursuant to this Option (the "Option Shares") are granted as a
non-qualified option.

     2.   Purchase Price.  The purchase price of the Option Shares shall be
$________ per Share, such purchase price being 100% of the fair market value of
such Shares on the date first appearing above (the "Date of the Grant").

     3.   Exercise of Award.  Unless expired as provided in paragraph 5 below,
and subject to the special provisions of paragraph 6 below, the Award for Option
Shares may be exercised from time to time in whole or in part for not more than
33% of the entire number of Option Shares at any time after the first
anniversary of the Date of Grant, and an additional 33% of the total Option
Shares on, or after each of the two (2) succeeding anniversaries of the Date of
Grant.

     4.   Manner of Exercise; Payment of Purchase Price.

          A.   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Award
shall be exercised by written notice to the Company at its principal office.
Such notice shall state the election to exercise the Award and shall specify the
number of Option Shares sought to be exercised pursuant to the notice.  Such
notice of exercise shall be signed by Employee and shall be irrevocable when
given.

          B.   The notice of exercise shall be accompanied by the full payment
of the purchase price for the Option Shares in cash by certified check or bank
cashiers check or through satisfactory arrangements for payment by a broker
representing the Employee in the sale of some or all of the Option Shares.
Subject to approval of an authorized Committee of the Board of Directors (the
"Committee"), payment of the purchase price may be accomplished by the surrender
of stock certificates representing Shares having an aggregate fair market value
on the date of exercise equal to the purchase price of the Option Shares, or by
a combination of cash and Shares.

          C.   Upon receipt of the purchase price, and subject to the terms of
paragraph 11, a certificate representing the Option Shares exercised shall be
registered in the name of the person or persons so exercising the Award.  In the
event the Award shall be exercised pursuant to paragraph 7, by any person or
persons other than the Employee, such notice shall be accompanied by appropriate
proof satisfactory to the Company of the right of such person or persons to
exercise the Award.  All Shares issued as a result of an exercise of an Award as
provided herein shall be fully paid and non-assessable.

          D.   The payment of witholding tax liability by Employee shall be a
condition precedent to the Company's obligation to issue any certificates for
Shares  resulting from an exercise of an Award.

     5.   Exercise and Expiration of Award.  This Award, if not exercised, shall

expire and become null and void upon the expiration of three (3) months after
Employee ceases to be employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries unless
such termination shall have been for cause, as determined by the Committee, in
which event the Award shall be null and void as of the date of such termination.
Notwithstanding the above, if Employee retires from the Company or any of its
subsidiaries (as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), the Award
may, at the Committee's discretion remain exercisable for a period not to exceed
36 months following such retirement.  In the event of Employee's death or
permanent disability, the Award shall be exercisable for a period of 12 months
following such death or disability.  Notwithstanding the above, the Award shall,
without exception, become null and void once a period of 10 years shall have
lapsed since the Date of Grant.  Except as provided in paragraph 6 below, only
those portions of this Award vested as of the date of  termination of Employee's
employment may be exercised.

     6.   Acceleration of Exercise Dates.   Notwithstanding the provisions of
paragraph 3 above relating to the vesting of this Award in installments, the
Committee may, in its discretion, permit this Award to be immediately
exercisable, until the expiration date provided in paragraph 5 above, for the
entire number of Option Shares covered hereby upon the retirement of Employee or
any Change in Control of  the Company (as defined in the Plan).

     7.   Award Nontransferable.  Unless permitted by law regulation and
approved by the Committee, the Award and any right related there to shall not be
transferable by Employee otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution and may be exercised during Employee's lifetime, only by Employee.
Upon the death of employee, the award may be exercised by Employee's executor,
administrator, legatee or distributee, as the case may be.

     8.   Adjustments of Shares Subject to Award.  If any Shares shall at any
time be changed or exchanged by reason of reorganization, merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, combination of shares or a
dividend payable in stock, then the aggregate number of Option Shares subject to
this Agreement and the purchase price of such Option Shares shall be
automatically adjusted such that Employee's proportionate interest shall be
maintained as before the occurrence of  such event.  The determination of any
such adjustment by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive.

     9.   No Contract.  This Agreement does not constitute a contract for
employment and  shall not affect the right of the Company to terminate
Employee's employment for any reason whatsoever.

          10.  Rights as Shareholder.  This Award shall not entitle Employee or
any permitted transferee to any rights of a shareholder of  the Company or to
any notice of proceedings of the Company with respect to any Option Shares
issuable upon exercise of this Award unless and until the Award has been
exercised for such Shares.

          11.  Restriction on Issuance of Shares.  The Company shall not be
required to issue or deliver any certificates for Shares purchased upon the
exercise of an Award prior to the obtaining of any approval from any
governmental agency which the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine
to be necessary or advisable, and the completion of any registration or other
qualification of such Shares under any state or federal law or ruling or
regulations of any governmental body which the Company shall, in its sole
discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable.  In addition, if shares
reserved for issuance upon exercise of Awards shall not then be registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 the Company may, upon Employee's exercise of an
Award, require Employee or his permitted transferee to represent in writing that
the Shares being acquired are for investment and not with a view to
distribution, and may mark the certificate for the Shares with a legend
restricting transfer and may issue stop transfer orders relating to such
certificate to the transfer agent.

     12.  Lapse of Award.  The Agreement shall be null and void in the event
Employee shall fail to sign and return a counterpart hereof to the Company
within thirty (30) days of its delivery to Employee.

     13.  Binding Effect.  This Agreement shall be binding upon this heirs,
executors, administrators, and successors of  the parties hereto.

     14.  Governing Instrument and Law.  This Award and any Shares issued
hereunder shall in all respects be governed by the terms and provisions of the
Plan, and by the laws of the State of Texas, and in the event of a conflict
between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the
Plan shall control.

                              THE BOMBAY COMPANY, INC.

employment provides actual payments during that period of time that are less
than those severance payments provided herein by Bombay, then Mehrlander shall
still be paid the difference in such amounts by Bombay; and ii.) if such
subsequent new employment provides actual payments during that period of time
that are equal to or more than those severance payments provided herein by
Bombay, then Mehrlander shall be paid no additional severance by Bombay.

          B)   During the second year of employment, if Mehrlander's employment

employment for cause shall be governed by the following provisions.

hereinbelow, all stock options granted to Mehrlander shall immediately vest
commencing on such date of Change of Control and be exercisable by Mehrlander at
any time during the ninety (90) days following the event of Change of Control,
subject to an enlargement of such exercise period by the Company.  Additionally,
in the event of a Change of Control of the Company, as defined in Paragraph 8.02
hereinbelow, the severance provisions provided in Paragraph 7.01 hereinabove
shall be operational, at the election of Mehrlander, at any time after such
Change of Control, allowing her to terminate her employment with the Company and

the Company shall be deemed to have occurred upon the happening of any one of
the following events:

          A)   the acquisition, other than from the Company, by any individual,
entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the
Exchange Act) of beneficial ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of either
the then outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company or the combined
voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled
to vote generally in the election of directors; provided however, that any
acquisition by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any employee benefit
plan (or related trust) of the Company or its subsidiaries, or any corporation
with respect to which following such acquisition, more than fifty percent (50%)
of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of such
corporation and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or
substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial
owners, respectively, of the Common Stock and voting securities of the Company
immediately prior to such acquisition in substantially the same proportion as
their ownership, immediately prior to such acquisition, of the then outstanding
shares of Common Stock of the Company or the combined voting power of the then
outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors, as the case may be, shall not constitute a Change of
Control;

          B)   individuals who, as of January 1, 1996, constitute the Board (the
"Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the
Board, provided that any individual becoming a director subsequent to such date
whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, was
approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the
Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of
the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose
initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened
election contest relating to the election of the directors of the Company (as
such terms are used in rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the
Exchange Act); or

          D)   approval by the shareholders of the Company of a reorganization,
merger or consolidation of the Company, in each case, with respect to which the
individuals and entities who were the respective beneficial owners of the Common
Stock and voting securities of the Company immediately prior to such
reorganization, merger or consolidation do not, following such reorganization,
merger or consolidation, beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than
fifty percent (50%) of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of Common
Stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case may be, of
the corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation, or
a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or of the sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.

     9.   CONFLICT WITH OTHER EMPLOYMENT.  Mehrlander agrees and represents that
her acceptance of this employment with Bombay as set forth herein does not
conflict with any prior contract or agreement of employment to which she is a
party.

     10.  SUCCESSORSHIP.  This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the
parties hereto shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of each of
the parties hereto, and any individual, company, corporation, entity or other
business enterprise that shall succeed to the interest of the Company, through
merger, consolidation, divestiture or otherwise, shall be bound by the terms of
this Agreement.

     11.  MISCELLANEOUS.

     11.01     Entire Agreement.  This Agreement embodies the entire agreement
and understanding between the Company and Mehrlander relating to the subject
matter hereof.  This Agreement supersedes and cancels all prior agreements
between the Company and Mehrlander, whether written or oral, relating to the
employment of Mehrlander.

     11.02     Amendment and Waiver.  This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or waived, except in writing, signed by both parties to this
Agreement.  The waiver by either party of a breach of this Agreement shall not
operate to, or be construed as a waiver of, any other breach of that provision,
nor as a waiver of any other provision.

     11.03     Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be construed in accordance
with, and governed for all purposes by the laws of the State of Texas.

     11.04     Severability.  If any paragraph, subparagraph, or provision
hereof is found for any reason whatsoever to be invalid, illegal, unenforceable,
void, voidable, or inoperative, that paragraph, subparagraph, or provision shall
be deemed severable and shall not affect the force and validity of any other
provision of this Agreement.

     11.05     Notices.  Any notice, request, or instruction to be given herein,
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, shall be in writing and shall be deemed
given when personally delivered, or upon signature of the addressee on a

arising during the term of this Agreement, shall continue to have full force and
effect after the date that this Agreement terminates or expires.

     11.07     Interpretation and Construction.  Should any provision of this
Agreement require interpretation or construction, it is agreed by the parties
that the entity interpreting or construing this Agreement shall not apply a
presumption that the provisions herein shall be more strictly construed against
one party by reason of the legal rule of construction that a document is to be
more strictly construed against the party who prepared it, as it is expressly
understood and agreed by Bombay and Mehrlander that both parties have
participated in the negotiation, drafting, and preparation of all provisions of
this Agreement.

     11.08     Duplicate Originals.  This Agreement shall be executed in
