                                    PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

(a) General Development of Business

The Bombay  Company,  Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries design, source and
market a unique line of  fashionable home accessories, wall decor and furniture
through a network of retail  locations throughout the United States and Canada,
through  specialty  catalogs,  the   Internet   and   international   licensing
arrangements.   We  also  have  a small wholesale operation that distributes  a
separate  line of occasional furniture.   Throughout  this  report,  the  terms
"our," "we,"  "us"  and   "Bombay" refer to The Bombay Company, Inc., including
its subsidiaries.

Bombay's  unique  position in  the  market  place  is  a  result  of  our  core
competencies in design,  sourcing  and  importing.   Over 90% of our product is
sourced  from  over  20 foreign countries.  Over 90% of the  product  has  been
designed or styled to Bombay's specifications.

During Fiscal 2001, we  expanded  our  product  offering  to  include a line of
children's furniture, textiles and accessories via catalog and Internet.  As of
January 31, 2004, BombayKIDS has expanded to 35 stores of which  thirty-one are
combination locations, with a BombayKIDS store adjacent to a core Bombay store.
We intend to open approximately 15 additional BombayKIDS stores in  Fiscal 2004
and approximately 30 in Fiscal 2005.

In  addition  to  our  primary  retail  operations,  Bombay has other operating
enterprises which contributed incrementally to profitability but which were not
significant to our operations in Fiscal 2003.  Unless  specified otherwise, the
discussions  in  this Annual Report on Form 10-K relate to  the  Bombay  retail
operations, including BombayKIDS, outlets, Internet and catalog.

 (b) Financial Information About Segments

Bombay operates primarily  in  one business segment as a multi-channel retailer
selling decorative home furnishings, furniture and related items.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

Merchandise Sales, Purchasing and Distribution

Bombay operates stores, primarily  located  in regional shopping malls, certain
secondary malls and selected urban and suburban  locations.   As of January 31,
2004, there were 415 stores in 42 states in the United States and  56 stores in
nine  Canadian  provinces.  We also market our products through our mail  order
operations  in  the   United  States  and  Canada  and  over  the  Internet  at
www.bombaycompany.com and www.bombay.ca.

We offer a diverse selection  of  products  consisting  of  approximately 4,800
stock keeping units ("SKUs") of which over 90% of the product has been designed
or  styled to our specifications.  Bombay's proprietary product  offers  unique
design,  quality  and  exceptional  value  to a wide audience of consumers.  We
regularly update our merchandise assortment  by  introducing new products while
discontinuing others.  We have a fashion component  to  our  product offerings,
primarily   in  the  accessory  and  wall  decor  areas,  which  is  introduced
seasonally.  Other products with longer lives are discontinued as they approach
the end of their  life  cycles.   Approximately  2,600  and 2,300 new SKUs were
introduced  in  Fiscal  2003  and  Fiscal 2002, respectively.   Typically,  new
product  introductions  have been concentrated  during  our  spring,  fall  and
Christmas selling periods.   Going forward, we intend to introduce product more
frequently to increase newness in the store and to level spikes in inventory as
new product is introduced.  The principal categories of merchandise include the
following:

     Furniture - We sell  two  broad categories of furniture as described
     below.   Our furniture is manufactured  by  third  party  vendors  located
     principally in China, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia and India.

     Large  Furniture  -  This  category  includes  both  wood  and metal
     furniture  focusing  on  the  bedroom,  living  room, dining room and home
     office.  Many of the larger items are displayed in  store  and  stocked in
     our  distribution  centers  and are available for store delivery typically
     within ten days.  Large furniture  represented  31%,  32% and 31% of total
     sales in Fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

     Occasional Furniture - This category includes wood  and  metal  hall
     tables, end and coffee tables, plant stands and other small accent tables,
     stands   and  curios  that  are  ready-to-assemble,  take  home  products.
     Occasional furniture represented 14%, 12% and 12% of total sales in Fiscal
     2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

<PAGE> 2

     Accessories  -  This is the broadest category and represented 43% of
     total sales in Fiscal 2003,  2002  and  2001.  This category includes both
     functional  and  decorative  accessories  including   lamps,  jewelry  and
     memorabilia boxes, crystal, ceramics, frames and desktop  items, textiles,
     floral,  candles  and  holiday.   The  items  are  imported  from over  20
     countries in Asia, North America and Europe.

     Wall  Decor  -  This  category  includes  prints,  mirrors and  wall
     accessories  that  represented 12%, 13% and 14% of total sales  in  Fiscal
     2003, 2002 and 2001,  respectively.  This merchandise is sourced primarily
     from the United States and various countries in Asia.

Merchandise is manufactured  to  Bombay's  specifications  through a network of
third party vendors principally located in Asia and North America.  Over 90% of
production needs are sourced from foreign countries.  We have branch offices in
Taiwan,  Malaysia,  China,  Vietnam  and India, and utilize agents  in  various
countries  to locate prospective vendors,  coordinate  production  requirements
with manufacturers and provide technical expertise and quality control.

We are not dependent  on  any  particular  supplier  and have had long standing
relationships with many of our vendors. Thirty manufacturers in eight countries
supply  almost 65% of our merchandise requirements.  Bombay  has  no  long-term
production  agreements;  however,  we  generally  have  agreements  with  major
manufacturers  that  prohibit  the  production of proprietary product for other
parties.   Additional  manufacturing capacity  and  alternative  sources,  both
domestic and international,  continue to be added through new vendors and plant
expansions by existing vendors.  We do business with our vendors principally in
United  States currency and historically  have  not  experienced  any  material
disruptions   as  a  result  of  any  foreign  political,  economic  or  social
instabilities.

The product development  process  takes between three months and twelve months,
beginning with the original idea and concluding with the final product received
at regional distribution centers in the United States and Canada.  Depending on
the category, the source country and  whether an item is new or reordered, lead
times generally vary from two to six months  from order placement until arrival
at the stores.  Order times are slightly less  for North American manufacturers
principally due to shorter shipping times.  Lead  times may also be impacted by
seasonality factors especially in months when manufacturers  are  producing at,
or  near,  peak  capacity to meet seasonal demands.  As a result, we strive  to
maintain an adequate inventory position in our distribution centers to ensure a
sufficient supply of products to our customers.

We have regional distribution centers in Fort Worth, Texas; McDonough, Georgia;
Gilbertsville, Pennsylvania;  Mira  Loma,  California;  Plainfield, Indiana and
Mississauga,  Ontario. The distribution centers are strategically  located  and
provide the capability to replenish the majority of store inventories within 48
hours of when the  order  is processed.  We use dedicated trucks and less-than-
truckload carriers to transport  product  from  our distribution centers to the
stores.

Channels of Distribution

RETAIL

Stores and Real Estate

Historically, we have located our stores primarily  in regional shopping malls,
certain  secondary  malls  and  selected  urban  and  suburban  locations  that
satisfied  our  demographic  and financial return criteria.  Approximately  one
hundred of our store leases expired  in  Fiscal  2003, and approximately 80 are
scheduled  to  expire in Fiscal 2004.  We are currently  pursuing  an  off-mall
strategy for new  and  relocated  stores focusing on open-air lifestyle centers
and high-end strip centers (especially  those  with  a  concentration  of  home
furnishings  retailers).   Such  locations  offer  us  the opportunity to lower
occupancy costs, improve operating efficiencies and provide  a  more convenient
shopping experience for our customer.   Our preference is to identify locations
where we can operate a combined Bombay and BombayKIDS store, thereby  realizing
economies  that  come with a larger location while attracting a new and younger
customer to Bombay.   As  of January 31, 2004, approximately 26% of our stores,
excluding outlets, were in off-mall locations.

In selecting store locations,  our  real  estate  department conducts extensive
analyses of potential store sites.  We base our selection  on  the  existing or
planned  co-tenancy  of the center, the size of the market and the demographics
of the surrounding area.   In  evaluating  a  store  location, placement of the
store relative to retail traffic patterns and customer  base of other retailers
in the nearby vicinity are important considerations.  Significant  attention is
given to visual merchandising opportunities to maximize the ability  to display
product  in  the  most  attractive  setting.   We seek out the most potentially
profitable locations for the opening of new stores  regardless of the venue. We
are  currently  targeting  8,500 to 9,000 square foot locations  where  we  can
construct a Bombay store of  approximately  4,500  square feet and a BombayKIDS
store  of  approximately 4,000 square feet.  Bombay mall  stores  are  slightly
smaller in size,  currently  averaging  approximately  3,600  square feet.  New
Bombay off-mall locations are expected to be in the 4,000 to 5,000  square foot
range.  In addition to building new stores, we continue to selectively  convert
our

<PAGE> 4

existing  regular stores, which average approximately 1,800 square feet to  the
larger format.   As  of  January 31, 2004, there were 25 regular stores left in
the chain.

At January 31, 2004, the store  chain included a total of 46 outlet stores.  We
view the use of outlets as an opportunity  to  increase  sales  to  a different
customer base, to assist in the orderly clearance of merchandise and to further
capitalize on our strength in designing and sourcing proprietary product.

Following is a table summarizing our store activity and composition:

     Total........................................   1,847          1,578          1,502
</TABLE>


During  Fiscal  2004,  we  plan  to  open  approximately  75  to 80 new stores,
including  approximately  15  BombayKIDS  stores.  We plan to close  35  to  40
stores,  ending  the year with approximately  510  stores.    For  store  count
purposes, a combined Bombay and BombayKIDS location represents two stores.

Our average cost of  leasehold  improvements, furniture, fixtures and machinery
for  Bombay  stores  opened  in  Fiscal  2003,  net  of  landlord  construction
allowances, was approximately $205,000  per  store, or $44 per square foot.  In
addition, other investments, which consist primarily  of inventory in the store
location, averaged approximately $100,000 per large format  store.  The average
net  cost  of  a  BombayKIDS  store  is approximately $195,000 but, at $47,  is
slightly higher than a Bombay large format store on a per square foot basis due
to higher fixturing costs.  During Fiscal  2003,  inventory investment averaged
$100,000  for  a  BombayKIDS  store.   During  Fiscal 2003,  average  inventory
physically in store was approximately 40% of the  total  inventory  investment.
Our  mall-based  stores  typically  achieve store level operating profitability
during their first full year of operations  and  reach maturity in three years.
Off-mall stores are typically profitable during their  first year of operation.
However,  based  upon  our  limited  experience, it appears that  it  may  take
slightly  longer for these stores to mature.   Further,  whether  a  store  was
relocated from  a  local  mall  or  is  a  new store in a market may also be an
influencing factor as to profitability and maturity.

Direct

We offer virtually all our retail SKUs for electronic commerce through our U.S.
websites  at http://www.bombaycompany.com for Bombay, http://www.bombaykids.com
for BombayKIDS  and  http://www.bombayoutlet.com  for  Bombay  Outlets.  During
Fiscal  2003,  we  launched  our  Bombay Canada website at http://www.bombay.ca
which currently sells core product  and  a limited selection of outlet product,
with  plans to add a BombayKIDS site in the  future.   We  continue  to  pursue
online  marketing  partnerships  to  broaden our reach to additional customers.
Business-to-consumer revenues over the  Internet were approximately $17 million
in Fiscal 2003.  We also maintain websites supporting our wholesale activities.

Bombay has a catalog business which primarily  serves as a marketing vehicle to
drive  customers  into  stores  and  to  the Internet.   Direct  catalog  sales
represent less than 2.5% of revenues.

WHOLESALE

Bailey Street Trading Company - During Fiscal  2000,  we  created  a  wholesale
subsidiary,  Bailey  Street  Trading  Company ("Bailey Street").  The brand  is
separate from Bombay and allows us to capitalize  on  our  strengths in product
design,  sourcing  and  importing.   Current product offerings are  focused  on
furniture but may be expanded to include  wall  decor  and  accessories  in the
future.   We distribute our Bailey Street merchandise to a variety of customers
including independent  gift  stores,  catalogers,  department stores, furniture
stores  and  mass  merchants  through a network of independent  regional  sales
representatives.  During Fiscal 2003, Bailey Street revenues increased to $15.8
million compared to $8.4 million in Fiscal 2002.

International   -  Bombay  International,   Inc.   ("International")   is   our
international licensing  and  distribution  channel.   International operations
have extended to 14 licensed stores as of the end of Fiscal  2003, operating in
the Middle East and the Caribbean. International revenues totaled  $3.7 million
compared  to  $3.5  million  in  Fiscal  2002.   In the short-term, we plan  to
continue  expansion  abroad  through licensing and distribution  agreements  in
existing markets or with current  partners.   During Fiscal 2004, approximately
five to six additional International stores are  planned  to  be  opened by our
licensees.

Intangibles

We  own  a  number  of  the  trademarks and service marks used in our business,
including    federal    registrations     for     the    marks    The    Bombay
Company{reg-trade-mark},   Bombay{reg-trade-mark},   the    palm   tree   logo,
BombayKIDS{reg-trade-mark}  and  Bailey Street Trading Company{reg-trade-mark}.
Our trademarks are also registered  or  are the subject of pending applications
in a number of foreign countries.  Each registration  is renewable indefinitely
if the mark is still in use at the time of renewal.

We  believe  that our trademarks have significant value and  that  these  marks
enhance the Bombay{reg-trade-mark} brand and are instrumental in our ability to
create, sustain  demand  for  and  market  our  product.  From time to time, we
discover products in the marketplace that are counterfeit  reproductions of our
product or that otherwise infringe upon our trademark or tradedress rights.  We
have  and  will  continue to vigorously defend our rights under  the  marks  as
necessary.

Seasonality

Operating results are subject to seasonal variation.  Historically, the largest
proportion of sales  and  substantially  all  of the income occur in the fourth
fiscal quarter, which includes the Christmas season.   Inventory  balances  are
generally  built to their highest levels prior to the Christmas selling season.
Inventories  decline,  short-term  borrowings  are  repaid  and  cash  balances
increase significantly in December due to the Christmas business.

Competition

The home furnishings and decorative accessories market is highly fragmented and
very competitive.  We face competition from furniture stores, department stores
and  other  specialty  retailers,  including  national  chains  and independent
retailers.   We  believe  that  we  compete  primarily  on the basis of  style,
selection, quality and value of merchandise.

Employees

We have approximately 5,500 employees, which include approximately  3,000 part-
time employees, and are not a party to any union contract.  Employee  relations
are considered to be good.

</TABLE>


Leases generally  have  10-year  terms,  expiring between 2004 and 2015.  Rents
under  the  store leases are generally based  upon  a  minimum  rental  plus  a
percentage of  the store sales in excess of specified levels. Store lease terms
generally require  additional  payments covering taxes, common area charges and
certain other costs. Rental expense  for  Fiscal  2003,  Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal
2001 totaled $58,712,000, $50,669,000 and $47,366,000, respectively.

The minimum rental commitments for future fiscal years related  to  real estate
properties are as follows (in thousands):

management personnel.

Executive Overview
Bombay  markets  a  line  of  proprietary  home furnishings that includes large
furniture, occasional furniture, wall decor  and decorative accessories that is
timeless and classic in its styling.   Over 90% of the items are imported, with
more  than  half  of the product coming from China.   We  are  a  multi-channel
retailer with store  locations, Internet and mail order operations, so that the
customer can shop at her convenience.  We have a small wholesale operation that
is   immaterial  to  overall   revenue   but   contributes   incrementally   to
profitability.

We focus  on  several  key  metrics  in  managing  and evaluating our operating
performance and financial condition including the following:  same store sales,
sales  and  gross  margins  by merchandise categories, operating margins  as  a
percentage of revenues, earnings  per  share,  cash  flow, return on assets and
inventory turn.

We  are  currently  executing  a  multi-phase  turnaround intended  to  improve
Bombay's profitability and generate competitive  operating results in-line with
current market leaders in the sector.  For the year,  our  operating margin was
2.7% of revenues compared to industry leaders in the 8% to 12%  range.   We  do
not  believe that, long-term, there is anything structurally that would prevent
us from improving our operating results to approach those of industry leaders.

Phase I of the turnaround commenced during the third quarter of Fiscal 2002 and
continued  into  Fiscal 2003.  Our goal was to reclaim market share, generating
above average same store sales and validating our positioning within the market
place.  We reported  13  consecutive  months  of  double-digit same store sales
increases beginning in September 2002 and continuing  through  September  2003.
As  a  result  of the strength of these sales, we were able to leverage many of
our fixed costs  including  our  buying  and occupancy costs, which declined to
16.8% of revenues during Fiscal 2003 from 19.1% of revenues during Fiscal 2002.

Phase  I was also characterized by the aggressive  repositioning  of  our  real
estate portfolio.   During the 1980s and 1990s, our focus was on opening stores
in "A" malls throughout  North  America.  As shopping habits have evolved, with
alternative venues such as lifestyle  centers and big box strip centers gaining
popularity, we have begun to migrate our  stores  to  off-mall  locations.   In
addition to being more convenient for customers and suitable for  the  sale  of
large  items,  such locations typically have lower cost structures, both from a
fixed rent perspective  and for other common area expenses billed by landlords.
Management believes that the movement to the off-mall locations will ultimately
result in lower fixed costs  for  Bombay  and  will help improve profitability.
During Fiscal 2003, approximately 100 leases expired,  and we took advantage of
that opportunity to close some of our mall stores and move  to  nearby off-mall
locations.   We  are currently focusing on our top 25 markets to obtain  market
density and leverage  fixed  logistics  and  advertising  costs in those areas.
Additionally,  we  have restarted net store growth, which has  been  relatively
flat in number since  1996.   A total of 88 real estate projects, including new
stores and relocations, were completed  during the year resulting in opening 75
new off-mall locations.  The total number of stores grew to 471, a net increase
of 49 stores.

</TABLE>

Another key aspect of Phase I included aggressively  investing  in marketing to
attract  new  customers  to Bombay and support the move from mall to  off-mall.
During the late 1990s and  early  2000s,  we had become increasingly reliant on
periodic catalogs to drive customers into the  store and did not have marketing
vehicles  with  a  broader  reach. In Fiscal 2001, the  marketing  expenditures
reached their historical low  of  3.4%  of  revenues.   During  Fiscal 2002 and
Fiscal  2003,  we  increased  our  marketing  to  4.1%  and  4.6%  of revenues,
respectively, with much of the incremental spending going to support  a program
for monthly inserts in Sunday newspapers in our top 21 markets.

In addition to investing in new stores, we began making some key investments in
our infrastructure that will serve as the foundation upon which we plan to grow
to become a billion dollar company with competitive operating margins.   During
Fiscal  2003,  we  rolled  out  a  new  point-of-sale  system  and  a broadband
communication network to our U.S. stores, completed the implementation  of  the
first  phase  of  a  new  planning  and allocation system, opened a new 300,000
square foot distribution center in the  Midwest  and  made  key  investments in
leadership  positions,  including  the  appointment  of  a  new Chief Executive
Officer and a new Chief Information Officer.

Investments in product margin, inventory, infrastructure and advertising led to
a 21% increase in revenues, improvement in operating margins  from 2.5% to 2.7%
of revenue, and improvement in return on assets from 3.3% to 4.0%.

As we enter Fiscal 2004 and the second phase of the turnaround,  we are focused
on six critical success factors .

     DRIVE SAME STORE SALES AT A COMPETITIVE RATE - Average  store  level
     productivity was increased as a result of last year's 13% same store sales
     performance.   Longer-term, we need to continue to defend our market share
     and ultimately grow sales at a rate at, or above, the competition.

     SUCCESSFULLY  CONTINUE THE MIGRATION OF OUR STORES FROM MALL TO OFF-
     MALL LOCATIONS - We expect  to  improve operating margins 200 to 500 basis
     points  over  time  as  stores  are  relocated   to  lower-cost,  off-mall
     locations.   During Fiscal 2004, approximately 80 additional  leases  will
     expire and the  migration  will continue at an accelerated pace with plans
     to end the year with over 40% of our stores being off-mall.

     GROW STORE COUNT - Our goal is to increase the number of core Bombay
     stores 5% annually and continue  to  open new concepts such as BombayKIDS.
     The focus will be on our top 25 markets where we believe we can add almost
     100 Bombay stores without exceeding current  penetration  limits.   Market
     density  is  expected  to  result  in leveraging fixed costs and improving
     operating efficiencies.

     DEVELOP BOMBAYKIDS - By the end of Fiscal 2004, we expect to have 50
     BombayKIDS stores, providing the critical mass to yield better returns for
     the  business.   Success in the BombayKIDS  business  will  enable  us  to
     demonstrate  our  ability  to  organically  develop  other  concepts  that
     leverage our core competencies and provide new growth vehicles.

     BUILD THE PROPER  INFRASTRUCTURE  TO  SUPPORT  FUTURE GROWTH - It is
     essential that we invest in systems, our logistics network  and  corporate
     competencies in order to avoid the pitfalls that scale and complexity  can
     create.   While  it  is  tempting  to  forego such investments in favor of
     short-term profits, we believe that they are critical for long-term growth
     and  will  be  accretive  to  future  earnings.   Planned   infrastructure
     investments  will  include supply chain improvements, further enhancements
     to  the  U.S.  point-of-sale  system  and  its  rollout  to  the  Canadian
     subsidiary,  SKU   level   planning   and   plannogramming,  expansion  of
     distribution  facilities  in the Northeast, and  the  addition  of  a  new
     general merchandise manager and a new vice president of financial planning
     and analysis.

     GENERATE PROFIT MARGIN  EXPANSION  - This, in many ways, will be the
     result of executing the first five critical success factors well.  The key
     to profit margin expansion will be the focus  on  and  delivery  of profit
     flow-through  and  return on new stores.  Half of the opportunity lies  in
     migrating to off-mall  as  we  reduce  fixed occupancy costs and lower our
     overall cost structure.  Approximately 25%-30%  of  our future improvement
     lies  in leveraging our top line growth in the areas of  selling,  general
     and administrative  expenses  and logistics.  The remainder will come from

<PAGE> 13

     improving product margins as we  reap the benefits of new systems designed
     to  help  ensure better flow of product  from  source  to  store,  improve
     inventory turn and manage promotional activities.

The infrastructure  that  we  develop and the investments that we make will be
critical to the third phase of  our  turnaround  strategy.    Our  plan  is to
organically  develop  other retail concepts and areas of operations that would
leverage our core competencies  and  become  new  growth  vehicles for Bombay.
This longer term strategy is several years in the future and  is  dependent on
successfully accomplishing earlier phases, which will be the focus  for Fiscal
2004 and beyond.

Fiscal  2004  will  result  in  the  second  consecutive  year  of  accelerated
investment in Bombay with capital expenditures planned to be in the $30  to $35
million range.  Our strategy from a balance sheet perspective is to utilize our
credit facilities with banks to finance our seasonal working capital needs, and
to  fund  our  capital growth from working capital from operations and from our
balance sheet.

Other Disclosures
The largest percentage  of  our  sales  and operating income is realized in the
fourth fiscal quarter, which includes December (Christmas season).

The  impact  of inflation on operating results  is  typically  not  significant
because the majority of our products are proprietary.   We attempt to alleviate
inflationary pressures  by  improving  designs,  finding alternative production
sources  in  lower  cost countries and increasing selling  prices  (subject  to
competitive conditions).

One of the risks we are  currently  facing  relates  to the recent anti-dumping
petition against Chinese furniture makers for alleged dumping of wooden bedroom
furniture.  The petition is currently working its way through the United States
International  Trade Commission and the United States Department  of  Commerce.
The final determinations  of  the  Commission  will  not be made until 2005 but
imposition of preliminary duties will begin in Spring 2004.  Slightly more than
10% of our assortment is classified as bedroom furniture,  not  all of which is
imported from China or may be subject to such duties.  Our sourcing  offices in
Asia  have  been  identifying  alternative vendors in other countries including
Vietnam, where some of our existing  vendors  have chosen to open manufacturing
facilities.  We have already begun to move production  of  many  of the bedroom
furniture items to these alternate factories.   We cannot predict  what amount,
if any, of disruption there might be as manufacturers shift their production to
other locales or what level of duties-related price increases we will  be  able
to  pass  on  to  our  customers  for those items that we choose to continue to
source from China.  We believe that,  with  our  established network of offices
throughout Asia and the strength of our relationships with our vendors, we will
be able to negotiate arrangements that will allow  us  to continue offering all
product categories on a competitive basis.

We  have  a retail (52-53 week) fiscal year that ends on the  Saturday  nearest
January 31.  All periods presented reflect 52 weeks.


NET REVENUES
Net revenues  consist  of  sales to retail customers, through store, mail order
and  Internet,  and  wholesale   sales,   through  Bailey  Street  and  to  our
international licensees, as well as shipping fees and other revenues.  Shipping
fees  reflect  revenue  from  customers for delivery  of  merchandise.    Other
includes royalties and territory fees from international licensees.

Fiscal 2003
Net revenues increased $102.4 million,  or  21%, to $596.4 million, compared to
$494.0 million in Fiscal 2002.  Revenues from retail operations increased $94.9
million, or 20%, from the prior year.  Both new  stores  and  same  store sales
increases  contributed to the growth.  Same store sales increased 13%  for  the
year as we increased the number of stores by 49.  During the year, we opened 53
large format  stores,  30  BombayKIDS  stores  and one outlet.  In addition, we
converted four regular stores to the large format.   Increases  from additional
stores  were  partially offset by the closing of 26 large format stores,  eight
regular stores  and  one  outlet.  Direct-to-customer revenues increased 44% to
$29.8 million, from $20.6 million,  due  to  strong  Internet  sales, partially
offset by a decrease of approximately 10% in mail order sales.   The  remainder
of  the  increase relates to growth in our wholesale operations, in particular,
Bailey Street, where revenues increased 88%, to $15.8 million from $8.4 million
in Fiscal 2002.

All regions of the U.S. and Canada reported positive same store sales, with all
but the Midwest  reporting  double-digit sales increases.  At the end of Fiscal
2003, we had 365 large format  stores,  25  regular  stores,  46 outlets and 35
BombayKIDS stores.  Total retail square footage increased 17% compared to year-
end Fiscal 2002, while the store count increased by a net 49 units.  The number
of  retail  transactions for the year increased by almost 15% and  the  average
ticket increased to $86 from $82 in Fiscal 2002.

Fiscal 2002
Net revenues  increased  $56.5  million, or 13%, to $494.0 million, compared to
$437.5 million in Fiscal 2001.  Revenues from retail operations increased $48.3
million, or 11%, from the prior year.   Same  store  sales increased 5% for the
year.  New stores also contributed to revenue growth,  as  we  opened  14 large
format  stores,  9  outlets  and 5 BombayKIDS stores while expanding two stores
from the regular to the large  format.   Sales  growth  from  new  real  estate
activity  was  partially  offset  by  store  closures.  Internet and mail order
revenues grew 73% to $20.6 million from $11.9 million in the prior year, fueled
by  sales  of BombayKIDS product and improvement  made  to  our  website.   The
remainder of the increase was the result of growth in our wholesale operations.

All regions  of  the U.S. and Canada reported mid single-digit same store sales
increases.  At the  end  of  Fiscal  2002,  we had 334 large stores, 37 regular
stores, 46 outlets and five BombayKIDS stores.   During  the year, we closed 25
stores.  Total retail square footage increased 5% compared  to  year-end Fiscal
2001,  while  the number of stores increased by a net 3 units.  The  number  of
retail transactions  for the year increased 7% and the average ticket increased
4% to $82 from $79 in the prior year.

</TABLE>

Fiscal 2003
Cost of sales, including  buying and store occupancy costs, for Fiscal 2003 was
$421.3 million, or 70.6% of revenues.  As a percentage of revenues, these costs
improved from 70.8% in Fiscal  2002.  Product margins declined 210 basis points
as we focused on our value offerings  at  key price points designed to increase
market  share  and  drive  sales volumes.  Buying  and  store  occupancy  costs
declined as a percentage of  revenues  to  16.8%  from  19.1%  in  Fiscal 2002,
reflecting  the  significant  leverage gained as a result of higher same  store
sales.  Buying and store occupancy  costs  included impairment charges totaling
$.2  million  to  write  down the fixed assets related  to  eight  unprofitable
stores.

Fiscal 2002
Cost of sales, including buying  and store occupancy costs, for Fiscal 2002 was
$349.6 million, or 70.8% of revenues.  As a percentage of revenues, these costs
declined from 71.7% in Fiscal 2001.   Product  margins declined 40 basis points
as we targeted key price points to drive volume.   Buying  and  occupancy costs
were  19.1% of revenues, a 130 basis points decline, as a result of  leveraging
costs against  the  stronger sales levels.  Buying and occupancy costs included
impairment charges totaling  $.7 million to write down the fixed assets related
to six unprofitable stores.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Fiscal 2003
Selling, general and administrative  expenses  were  $158.4 million compared to
$132.3  million  in  Fiscal 2002.  As a percentage of revenues,  expenses  were
slightly lower at 26.6%  in  Fiscal  2003  compared  to  26.8%  in Fiscal 2002.
Excluding charges related to the departure of the Chief Executive  Officer  and
the  settlement  of a California wage and hour lawsuit in Fiscal 2002, selling,
general and administrative  expenses in Fiscal 2002 were 26.3% of revenues.  At
the store level, costs declined  slightly  as  a  percentage  of  sales.  Store
payroll productivity gains were offset by higher costs associated with  the new
broadband  communication  network  and  store  opening  and  closing  expenses.
Marketing  costs increased over $7 million, or 50 basis points, as we increased
our distribution of monthly Sunday newspaper inserts from three markets in late
Fiscal 2002 to 21 markets in Fiscal 2003, in order to attract new customers and
drive traffic  into  the  stores.   Corporate office general and administrative
expenses declined approximately 40 basis  points  as we leveraged insurance and
payroll costs against the higher revenue base.  Foreign  exchange gains related
to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar also helped offset costs associated
with infrastructure investment in systems.

Fiscal 2002
Selling,  general and administrative expenses were $132.3 million  compared  to
$117.6 million  in  Fiscal  2001.   As  a percentage of revenues, expenses were
slightly  lower  at 26.8% in Fiscal 2002 compared  to  26.9%  in  Fiscal  2001.
Fiscal 2002 included  a charge of $1.1 million relating to the departure of the
Chief Executive Officer  and a $1.3 million charge related to the settlement of
a California wage and hour  lawsuit.  Excluding these charges, selling, general
and administrative costs were  26.3% of revenues, a 60 basis point decline.  At
the store level, we were able to  successfully  leverage  payroll costs against
the higher revenue base.  Marketing costs increased by over  $5  million  or 70
basis  points  to 4.1% of revenues as we invested in advertising to drive sales
through increased direct marketing and testing broader reach vehicles including
a color newspaper  insert.  Corporate general and administrative costs declined
slightly as a percentage  of  revenue  primarily due to leverage in payroll and
depreciation and amortization of systems  partially  offset by higher insurance
costs.


INTEREST
Fiscal 2003
During Fiscal 2003, we had interest income of $176,000  and interest expense of
$621,000,  compared  to  interest  income of $331,000 and interest  expense  of
$152,000 in Fiscal 2002.  Decline in  interest  income  and increase in expense
are the result of lower invested cash balances and greater  utilization  of the
credit facility in the current year.  Funds were primarily used to finance  our
capital expansion plan, with the addition of 49 locations, and higher inventory
levels  to  support  both the higher store count and the increase in same store
sales.

Fiscal 2002
During Fiscal 2002, we  had interest income of $331,000 and interest expense of
$152,000, compared to interest  income  of  $248,000  and  interest  expense of
$566,000  in  Fiscal  2001.   Improvement  resulted  from  higher  average cash
balances generated through higher sales and profits, lower capital expenditures
and  lower  average  inventory  levels,  resulting in lower utilization of  the
credit facility.  In addition, borrowings were at lower interest rates.


INCOME TAXES
We provided income taxes of $6.3 million,  $5.1  million  and  $2.3  million in
Fiscal  2003,  Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, respectively.  The effective  rates
were 38.7%, 41.2%  and  38.6%  in  the respective periods.  Fluctuations in the
effective  rate  were  primarily  related  to  foreign  taxes  that  change  in
accordance with earnings in the Canadian  subsidiary  and in state tax expenses
that have not changed proportionately to income before income taxes.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The  primary sources of liquidity and capital resources  are  cash  flows  from
operations  and  a  line of credit with banks.  We have an unsecured, revolving
credit agreement with  a  group of banks, with an aggregate commitment of up to
$75 million for working capital  and  letter  of  credit  purposes.   The  bank
commitment  is  limited to 45% of saleable inventory.  At January 31, 2004, the
bank  commitment was  $62.2  million,  and  $55.3  million  was  available  for
borrowings  or  additional letters of credit.  The credit facility expires July
5, 2005.

Fiscal 2003
During Fiscal 2003,  we  used $31.0 million of cash, ending the year with $25.6
million in cash and long-term  investments.   The  decline in the level of cash
from Fiscal 2002, for both year-end comparisons and  throughout  the period, is
due  to our higher capital expenditures and corresponding inventory  levels  in
Fiscal  2003  to  support the additional stores and growth in same store sales.
The primary sources  of  cash were net income, including non-cash depreciation,
amortization expense and deferred tax expense, as well as the exercise of stock
options.  Cash was primarily  used  for  capital expansion, partially offset by
construction  allowances  granted  by landlords,  and  to  purchase  additional
inventory to support the larger store  base  and  increased  same  store sales.

<PAGE> 16

Other significant uses of cash included the payment of federal income taxes and
a decrease in other current assets, primarily due to a decrease in prepaid rent
resulting from the timing of the end of the fiscal period.

Capital expenditures totaled $41.1 million and included the costs of opening 53
large  format  stores,  30  KIDS  stores, one outlet, a distribution center  in
Plainfield, Indiana, investments in  new point-of-sale, planning and allocation
and other systems and routine purchases  of equipment.  These expenditures were
partially  offset  by  construction allowances  of  $11.9  million  granted  by
landlords.

At January 31, 2004, inventory  levels  were  $138.9  million  or $36.2 million
higher  than  at  February  1,  2003.  This increase represents investments  to
support the additional number of  stores and higher sales levels.  The year end
level was above desired levels as a  result of aggressively buying to Christmas
sales that did not materialize.  The investments  were  made  primarily in core
merchandise which will continue to be offered as part of the product  offering.
As  a  result,  future  orders  will  be adjusted to reflect the higher on hand
quantities.  We do not expect the higher  inventory  levels  to have a material
impact  on  gross  margins.   However, we will closely monitor inventory  sell-
through  and take appropriate actions,  as  necessary,  to  maximize  inventory
productivity.

Long-term,  our  strategy is to utilize our credit facility to finance seasonal
borrowings and to  utilize  cash  flow from operations and our balance sheet to
finance our capital programs.  For  Fiscal  2004, the capital expenditures plan
is estimated to be $30 to $35 million and includes the addition 64 large format
stores and 15 BombayKIDS stores.  We expect to  close  35  large  format  and 4
regular stores, and to end Fiscal 2004 with approximately 511 locations.  Other
capital  expenditure  plans  include  further enhancements to the point-of-sale
system and its roll out to the Canadian  subsidiary,  expansion of distribution
facilities in the Northeast and routine purchases of equipment.

In   connection  with  continuing  operations,  we  have  various   contractual
obligations  and  commercial  commitments  requiring payment in future periods,
summarized in the table below.

With our current growth plans, we anticipate that we will need to increase  our
borrowing  capabilities  to  finance  our  pre-holiday build up of inventory in
Fiscal 2004.  We currently intend to take advantage  of  the  favorable  credit
environment  to  increase our overall borrowing capabilities.  We are exploring
various alternatives,  including  increasing  our  existing  facility, and will
assess our options during the upcoming months.

Fiscal 2002
At February 1, 2003, cash and short-term investments were $56.6  million, $18.2
million higher than at February 2, 2002. The primary sources of cash  were  net
income  including  non-cash depreciation and amortization expense, increases in
payables including those  related to higher inventory purchases, taxes, payroll
and insurance as well as proceeds  from  the  exercise of stock options.  These
sources  were  partially  offset  by  higher  inventory   levels   and  capital
expenditures for store construction and routine equipment purchases.

At  February  1, 2003, inventory levels were $13.0 million higher than  at  the
previous year end  due  to improved flow of product to support the strong sales
trend experienced during  the  second  half  of  Fiscal  2002,  and  to support
continued growth into Fiscal 2003.

Capital  expenditures  totaled  $10.2 million and included the costs of 28  new
stores and the conversion of two  regular  stores to the larger format, as well
as continued investments in software and equipment.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
In the course of preparing the financial statements,  management  makes certain
judgments   relative  to  accounting  policies  that  are  appropriate  in  the
circumstances  and  the  application of those policies.  The following policies
are those deemed to be most critical.

Inventory Valuation Policy
Inventories are valued at  the  lower  of cost or market, cost being determined
based upon the weighted average inventory method. Cost is calculated based upon
the actual landed cost of an item at the  time  it is received in the warehouse
based upon actual vendor invoices or estimates of costs for which an invoice is
not  present  or  for  which an allocation of shared  costs  is  required.   In
addition, we include the  cost  of  warehousing and transporting product to the
stores in our costs.

We  regularly  evaluate  our compliance  with  the  lower  of  cost  or  market
principle.  Items are evaluated  by  SKU and to the extent that the cost of the
item  exceeds  the current selling price,  provision  is  made  to  reduce  the
carrying cost of  the item.  Additionally, we review the aging of our inventory
by SKU.  The carrying  cost  of  the  item  is  reduced  based upon certain age
criteria and product category.  Since the determination of  carrying  value  of
inventory  involves  both  estimation  and  judgment  of cost and market value,
differences in these estimates could result in valuations  that  vary  from the
recorded asset.

Each  month,  we  record an allowance for shrinkage to provide for the cost  of
lost or stolen inventory.  The amount of the allowance is determined based upon
the historical shrinkage  results  and is adjusted at least annually to reflect
current circumstances.  Inventory is  physically  counted  at  all locations at
least  once  each  year,  at  which  time actual results are reflected  in  the
financial statements.  Physical counts  were  taken  at  all stores and all the
distribution centers during January 2004.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We review long-lived assets with definite lives at least annually  and whenever
events  or  changes  in circumstances indicate that the carrying value  of  the
asset  may  not  be  recoverable.   This  review  includes  the  evaluation  of
individual under-performing  retail  stores and assessing the recoverability of
the carrying value of the fixed assets related to the store.  Future cash flows
are  projected  for  the  remaining lease  life  using  a  probability-weighted
approach to estimate the fair  value  of  the  store assets.  These projections
consider such factors as future sales levels, gross  margins,  changes  in rent
and  other  expenses  as well as the overall operating environment specific  to
that store.  If the estimated  future  cash  flows  are  less than the carrying
value  of  the assets, we record a charge equal to the difference  between  the
assets' fair  value  and carrying value as an impairment.  Since the projection
of  future  cash  flows  involves   judgment   and  estimates,  differences  in
circumstances or estimates could produce different results.

Deferred Taxes
We currently have recorded $8.1 million of deferred tax assets representing the
difference  between  the  timing of deductions taken  for  financial  statement
purposes and for tax purposes.   In  order to take the benefit of those assets,
we must have future taxable income.  If  future  conditions  indicate  that the
benefit of the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized, we will record a
valuation allowance to reduce the assets to their estimated realizable value.

Insurance
We  are  self-insured  with  respect  to  medical and dental insurance coverage
offered  to our eligible employees, up to a  maximum  of  $125,000  per  claim.
Above that  amount, medical insurance coverage is in place.  In connection with
the self-insured  portion,  we  maintain a liability for claims that are in the
process of being paid and those that have been incurred but not yet reported to
our insurance carrier.  We base the  amount  of  the  liability upon historical
claims  experience and actuarial estimates regarding the  exposure  for  claims
incurred but not yet reported.  At January 31, 2004, the balance of the medical
and dental liability was $772,000.

Since Fiscal  2001,  we  have  also  maintained workers' compensation insurance
coverage with a deductible of up to $150,000  per  claim.  At January 31, 2004,
we had recorded a liability of $2.9 million representing  the  estimated amount
that will have to be paid in future periods related to the settlement of claims
under the insurance policies for Fiscal 2001 through Fiscal 2003.   The  amount
of the liability reflects expected remaining workers' compensation claims based
upon  actuarial  estimates,  utilizing  historical  claims experience and other
relevant  information  and  trends.   Prior  to  Fiscal  2001,   our   workers'
compensation insurance was not subject to a deductible.

If circumstances change or if information becomes available that would indicate
that  future  payments with respect to insurance liabilities would be different
than  what  was  previously   estimated,   we   will  adjust  such  liabilities
accordingly.  Since the amounts recorded for insurance  liabilities  are  based
upon various estimates, actual future requirements could vary from the recorded
liabilities.

New Accounting Pronouncements
During  Fiscal  2003,  we  adopted  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS")  No.  143,  Accounting for Asset  Retirement  Obligations.   SFAS  143
requires that the fair  value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation
be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of
fair value can be made.   The  adoption  of  SFAS  143  did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

We  have  also  adopted  the  provisions  of  SFAS  146, Accounting  for  Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, for exit  or  disposal  activities
initiated  after  December 31, 2002.  SFAS No. 146 requires that certain  costs
associated with exit  or  disposal  activities  be  recognized  when  they  are
incurred  rather  than  at  the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan.
The adoption of SFAS 146 did  not  have  a  material impact on our consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards  Board ("FASB") issued FASB
Interpretation Number ("FIN") 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities -
An  Interpretation of ARB No. 51.  FIN 46 addresses consolidation  by  business
enterprises  of  variable  interest entities that have certain characteristics.
In December 2003, the FASB amended  and  clarified  FIN  46 by issuing FIN 46R.
The FASB has postponed the effective date of FIN 46R to the  first  quarter  of
Fiscal 2004, at which time we will adopt the provisions of the standard.  We do
not  expect  the  adoption  of  the  standard  to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Market risk represents the potential loss arising  from  adverse changes in the
value of financial instruments.  The risk of loss is assessed  based  upon  the
likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.

We have exposure to interest rate risk, as borrowings under our credit facility
are  based upon LIBOR, prime and other benchmark rates which may fluctuate with
market  conditions.   Based upon our seasonal borrowing levels, management does
not believe that a change  in  interest  rates of 100 basis points would have a
significant  impact  on  our  consolidated financial  position  or  results  of
operations.

As  of  January  31,  2004  we had no  debt  or  other  market  risk  sensitive
instruments.


ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

The index to the consolidated  financial  statements  is found on page 26.  Our
consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  to the consolidated  financial
statements follow the index.


ITEM  9.   CHANGES  IN  AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS  ON  ACCOUNTING  AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES.

There have been no changes in or disagreements with accountants on accounting
or financial disclosures.


ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Within 90 days prior to the  date  of  this filing, an evaluation was performed
under  the  supervision  and  with the participation  of  Bombay's  management,
including the Chief Executive Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  of  the
effectiveness  of  the  design  and  operation  of  our disclosure controls and
procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934.
Based  upon  that  evaluation,  the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in
timely  alerting  them to material  information  relating  to  Bombay  that  is
required to be included  in  periodic  filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  There have been no significant changes in our internal controls or
in other factors that could significantly  affect  internal controls subsequent
to the date of the evaluation.

(3) The 1996 Plan includes an "evergreen" feature  which  replenishes  the Plan
    with  newly  available  shares  on an annual basis.  The added shares equal
    1.25% of the total number of issued shares of Bombay common stock as of the
    last day of each fiscal year.

(4) Consists of the Directors' Equity  Plan.   The  material  features  of  the
    Directors' Equity Plan are as follows:

Members  of  the Board receive stock options and may opt to receive fees in the
form of Bombay  common  stock or to defer those fees in the form of stock units
pursuant to the Directors'  Equity  Plan.   The Directors' Equity Plan provides
for an initial grant of a nonqualified option to new directors and an automatic
annual  grant  of nonqualified options to continuing  directors  on  the  third
business day after  Bombay  issues  its press release summarizing our operating
results for the prior fiscal year.  The  initial  and  automatic  annual option
grants  are  10,000 shares.  Committee chairs are awarded an additional  option
grant covering  2,500  shares on an annual basis beginning in Fiscal 2004.  The
initial grant vests 20%  per year over a five-year period and the annual grants
vest in full six months after the grant.

Non-employee directors may  opt  to  be  paid  their fees in the form of Bombay
common stock distributed to such director on a quarterly basis.  Alternatively,
non-employee directors may choose to defer the receipt  of annual and committee
chair  retainers  and  meeting  fees, which are then credited  in  stock  units
equivalent to Bombay common stock  and  held  by  Bombay  in an account for the
benefit  of  each  participating  director.  The stock units, which  are  fully
vested, become payable in the form  of Bombay common stock upon retirement from
the Board or otherwise as specified in  the  director's  election  notice.  The
stock  units  are  adjusted  for  stock  dividends, stock splits, combinations,
reclassifications, recapitalizations or other capital adjustments.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS




To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Bombay Company, Inc.

In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated   financial   statements   listed  in  the
accompanying  index  on  page 24 present fairly, in all material respects,  the
financial position of The  Bombay Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries at January
31, 2004 and February 1, 2003,  and  the  results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2004, in
conformity with accounting principles generally  accepted  in the United States
of America. These financial statements are the responsibility  of the Company's
management;  our  responsibility  is  to express an opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted  our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted  in  the United States of
America which require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain  reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,  assessing  the
accounting principles  used  and  significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement  presentation.  We  believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   The Bombay Company, Inc. and Subsidiaries


NOTE 1 - STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The Bombay Company, Inc. and  its  wholly-owned subsidiaries design, source and
market a unique line of fashionable  home accessories, wall decor and furniture
through a network of retail locations  throughout the United States and Canada,
through  specialty  catalogs,  over the Internet  and  internationally  through
licensing  arrangements.   We  also  have  a  small  wholesale  operation  that
distributes a separate line of occasional  furniture.   Throughout this report,
the terms  "our," "we," "us" and  "Bombay" refer to The Bombay  Company,  Inc.,
including its subsidiaries.

The  consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of Bombay and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions, balances
and profits have been eliminated.   Bombay  has  a  retail  (52-53 week) fiscal
year,  which  ends  on the Saturday nearest January 31.  All periods  presented
reflect 52 weeks.

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial  statements  in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to  make  estimates.  These estimates
affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,  expense  and related
disclosures.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The  functional  currency  of  our  Canadian operations is the Canadian dollar.
Fiscal year end exchange rates are used  to translate assets and liabilities to
U.S. dollars.  Monthly average exchange rates  are used to translate income and
expenses.   We  record  the cumulative effect of foreign  currency  translation
adjustments  in  accumulated   other   comprehensive   income   (loss)   within
stockholders' equity.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
We  consider  cash in stores, deposits in banks and short-term investments with
original maturities  of  three  months or less as cash and cash equivalents for
the purposes of the financial statements.   Short-term investments are recorded
at the lower of cost or fair market value.

INVENTORIES
Inventories are primarily finished merchandise  and  are valued at the lower of
cost or market, cost being determined based upon the weighted average inventory
method.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property  and  equipment  are  recorded  at cost and are depreciated  over  the
estimated useful lives of the assets using  the  straight-line  method over the
lives shown:

 Building...............  Forty years
 Furniture and equipment  Two to ten years
 Leasehold improvements.  The lesser of the life of the lease or asset

Landlord  construction  allowances  are recorded as other liabilities  and  are
amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the life of the related lease.

We  charge  maintenance  and repairs to  expense  as  they  are  incurred.   We
capitalize renewals and betterments  which  materially prolong the useful lives
of the assets.  As property is retired or sold,  we remove the cost and related
accumulated depreciation from the accounts, and we recognize gains or losses in
the statements of income.

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS
We  capitalize  certain external and internal costs  associated  with  computer
software  and  significant   enhancements  to  software  features  of  existing
products.  We amortize the costs  utilizing  the  straight-line method over the
estimated  economic  lives of the software, which range  from  three  to  seven
years.  Total costs capitalized were $15,128,000 and $19,500,000 at January 31,
2004 and February 1, 2003,  respectively.   Accumulated amortization related to
these assets was $10,016,000 and $15,236,000  in  Fiscal  2003 and Fiscal 2002,
respectively.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
During  Fiscal  2002,  we  adopted  the  provisions of Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived  Assets.  SFAS 144 requires that  long-lived  assets  with  definite
lives  be evaluated  for  impairment  whenever  conditions  indicate  that  the
carrying  value  of  the  assets  may not be recoverable.  In determining if an
impairment exists, assets must be grouped  at  the lowest level for which there
are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent  of  cash  flows  from
other  groups  of  assets.   In  performing  this impairment test, we group our
assets  at  the  store  level.  If  an impairment exists,  the  amount  of  the
impairment is measured as the difference  between  the  carrying  value and the
estimated  fair value of the assets.  The adoption of SFAS 144 did not  have  a
significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

For periods  prior  to Fiscal 2002, we assessed impairment of long-lived assets
in accordance with the  provisions  of  SFAS No. 121, which were similar to the
provisions of SFAS 144.

GOODWILL
During Fiscal 2002, we adopted the provisions  of  SFAS No. 142, Accounting for
Goodwill  and  Other Intangibles.  SFAS 142 provides that  goodwill  should  no
longer be amortized, but should be tested for impairment at least annually, and
whenever conditions  indicate that such an impairment could exist.  Goodwill is
tested for impairment  by  comparing the estimated fair value of our net assets
to their carrying value.  If  the  carrying  value  exceeds  the estimated fair
value, we calculate the implied value of goodwill and recognize  an  impairment
loss.  No impairment was recorded in Fiscal 2003 or Fiscal 2002.  The  adoption
of SFAS 142 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements,  nor
would it have had a significant impact on prior years if the provisions of SFAS
142 had been applied.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
We  recognize  revenue  when delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and collectibility  is  reasonably  assured.  Revenues are net of
returns and exclude sales tax.

We  include  in  revenues  amounts collected from customers  for  shipping  and
handling orders.  In Fiscal  2003,  Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, these revenues
totaled $6,566,000, $4,626,000 and $2,779,000,  respectively.   The  associated
shipping and handling expenses are included in cost of sales.

GIFT CERTIFICATES
We  record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and certificates as a liability
at the  time  we  receive  them.   When  the  holder of the card or certificate
redeems it for merchandise, we relieve the liability and recognize revenue.

ADVERTISING COSTS
We expense advertising cost the first time the advertising takes place.  During
Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, advertising  expense was $27,604,000,
$20,258,000 and $14,597,000, respectively.

INCOME TAXES
We use the liability method of computing deferred income  taxes on all material
temporary differences.  Temporary differences are the differences  between  the
reported  amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  We assess the
realizability  of  deferred  tax  assets and, if necessary, provide a valuation
allowance.

All  unremitted  earnings  of  the foreign  subsidiary  are  considered  to  be
permanently reinvested.  Accordingly, no U.S. deferred taxes have been provided
on such earnings.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Comprehensive income represents the change in equity (net assets) of a business
enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances
from non-owner sources.  It includes  all  changes  in  equity  during a period
except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions  to owners.
Such  amounts  are  included  in  accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
within stockholders' equity and consist  of  the  cumulative  effect of foreign
currency translation adjustments.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
During  Fiscal  2003, we adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset  Retirement
Obligations.  SFAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation  be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a
reasonable estimate of fair  value  can  be made.  The adoption of SFAS 143 did
not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

We  have  also  adopted  the  provisions  of SFAS  146,  Accounting  for  Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,  for  exit  or disposal activities
initiated after December 31, 2002.  SFAS No. 146 requires  that  certain  costs
associated  with  exit  or  disposal  activities  be  recognized  when they are
incurred  rather  than  at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal  plan.
The adoption of SFAS 146  did  not  have  a material impact on our consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards  Board ("FASB") issued FASB
Interpretation Number ("FIN") 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities -
An  Interpretation of ARB No. 51.  FIN 46 addresses consolidation  by  business
enterprises  of  variable  interest entities that have certain characteristics.
In December 2003, the FASB amended  and  clarified  FIN  46 by issuing FIN 46R.
The FASB has postponed the effective date of FIN 46R to the  first  quarter  of
Fiscal 2004, at which time we will adopt the provisions of the standard.  We do
not  expect  the  adoption  of  the  standard  to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share are based upon the weighted  average  number of shares
outstanding.   Diluted  earnings per share are based upon the weighted  average
number of shares outstanding plus the shares that would be outstanding assuming
exercise  of dilutive stock  options  and  distribution  of  deferred  director
compensation.

The computation  for  basic and diluted earnings from continuing operations per
share are as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
We apply the recognition  and  measurement  principles of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued  to  Employees,  and  related
interpretations and the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation,  in  accounting for our stock-based incentive plans.
No compensation expense related to  grants  of stock options has been reflected
in net income, as all options granted under the  plans  had  an  exercise price
equal  to  the  market  price  of  Bombay's common stock on the date of  grant.
Compensation expense related to grants  of  restricted stock is measured as the
quoted market price of Bombay's common stock at the measurement date, amortized
to expense over the vesting period.  The following table illustrates the effect
on  net  income  and  earnings  per  share if we had  applied  the  fair  value
recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based compensation (in thousands):

NOTE 2 - STORE IMPAIRMENTS

Following the holiday selling season, we reviewed our real estate portfolio for
impairment,  focusing on store locations with operating  losses.   Of  the  471
company-owned  stores open as of January 31, 2004, eight stores were identified
for which the carrying  amounts  of  the  store  assets were not expected to be
recoverable.  As a result of the review, we recorded  an  impairment  charge to
buying  and occupancy costs of $244,000.  Similar reviews, performed in  Fiscal
2002 and  Fiscal  2001,  resulted  in  charges to buying and occupancy costs of
$693,000 and $715,000, respectively.


NOTE 3 - DEBT

We have an unsecured, revolving credit agreement  with  a  group  of banks.  On
July  10,  2003,  the  credit  agreement  was amended to increase the aggregate
commitment by $25,000,000 to $75,000,000 through  the  addition  of one lending
party and an increased commitment on the part of two existing banks.   We  have
the  option to request an increase in the aggregate commitment to $100,000,000,
subject  to approval by the banks, through the addition of another lending bank
or increased  commitment  by  the  existing  lending banks. The facility, which
expires July 5, 2005, is for working capital, inventory financing and letter of
credit purposes.  Borrowings under the facility  can be made, at our option and
subject to certain limitations, in the form of loans  or  by  the  issuance  of
bankers'  acceptances  with  respect  to  inventory purchases.  Loans under the
facility bear interest, at our option, at either  the lead bank's prime lending
rate plus a margin of .25% to 1.25% or the LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.75% to
2.75%, with the margin depending on our leverage ratio.  Under the terms of the
agreement,  we  are  required to maintain certain financial  ratios  and  other
financial  conditions.    The   agreement  prohibits  us  from  making  certain
investments,  advances or loans, and  limits  the  dollar  amounts  of  capital
expenditures, purchases of treasury shares, cash dividends and asset sales.  In
the event that  we  are  in default of certain provisions of the agreement, the
lenders would be permitted  to  file liens against our inventory located in the
United States and perfect the pledge  of  65%  of  the  stock  of  our Canadian
subsidiary, thereby securing the indebtedness.

The  bank  commitment is limited to 45% of saleable inventory.  At January  31,
2004,  the  bank   commitment  was  $62,157,000.  Letters  of  credit  totaling
$6,840,000 were outstanding  under  the facility, and $55,317,000 was available
for  borrowings  or  additional  letters   of  credit.   Interest  expense  and
negotiated  fees  for  Fiscal  2003,  Fiscal  2002  and  Fiscal  2001,  totaled
$1,086,000, $617,000 and $884,000, respectively.

NOTE 5 -  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

We have store, distribution  and  field  office facilities and equipment leased
under operating leases expiring through 2015.    The store leases are generally
based upon a minimum rental plus a percentage of the  store  sales in excess of
specified  levels.   Store  lease  terms generally require additional  payments
covering taxes, common area charges  and  certain  other costs.  Rental expense
for Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001 totaled  $58,712,000,  $50,669,000
and $47,366,000, respectively.

The  minimum  rental  commitments  for  future fiscal years are as follows  (in

We have certain contingent liabilities resulting  from  litigation  and  claims
incident  to  the  ordinary  course  of business.  Management believes that the
probable  resolution  of such contingencies  will  not  materially  affect  our
financial position or results of operations.

We are party to employment agreements with certain executives which provide for
compensation and certain  other  benefits.   The  agreements  also  provide for
severance payments under certain circumstances.


NOTE 6 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The  Bombay  Company,  Inc.  Employee  401(k) Savings and Stock Ownership  Plan
("401(k) Plan") is open to substantially  all  employees who have been employed
for  one year and who work at least 1,000 hours per  year.   Under  the  401(k)
Plan,  a  participant may contribute up to 75% of earnings with Bombay matching
100% of the  initial 3% contribution, and 50% of the next 2% contributed by the
participant.   Participant  contributions  and  Company  match  are  paid  to a
corporate trustee and invested in various funds or Bombay stock, as directed by
the participant.  Company matching contributions made to participants' accounts
are fully vested immediately.  Similar benefit plans are in effect for eligible
foreign employees.

To the extent employees are unable to contribute up to 5% of their earnings  to
the   401(k)  Plan  because  of  limitations  imposed  by  IRS  regulations,  a
Supplemental   Stock   Program  was  adopted.   Under  this  program,  employee
contributions  in excess  of  IRS  limitations,  along  with  Company  matching
contributions, are distributed annually in the form of Bombay common stock.

The Bombay Company,  Inc.  Stock  Purchase Program ("SPP") is open to all full-
time employees who have at least 90  days  of  service.   Each  participant may
contribute   1%  to  10%  of  qualifying  compensation,  to  a  maximum  annual
contribution of  $21,250.  Contributions  are used to purchase shares of Bombay
common stock at a discount of 15% from current market rates.  The participants'
shares are fully vested upon purchase.  Participants'  shares  are  held  by  a
third-party   administrator   until   the  respective  participant  requests  a
distribution.

Total Bombay contributions to these plans  for  Fiscal  2003,  Fiscal  2002 and
Fiscal 2001 were $714,000, $723,000 and $644,000, respectively.


NOTE 7 - COMMON STOCK AND STOCK OPTIONS

Our Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up
to  an aggregate of $30 million of Bombay's stock.  The shares may be purchased
from  time  to  time,  through  open  market purchases and privately negotiated
transactions.  During Fiscal 2003, Fiscal  2002  and Fiscal 2001, 9,000, 13,000
and 39,000 shares, respectively, were acquired at an aggregate cost of $70,000,
$31,000  and  $103,000, respectively.  Treasury shares  are  used  for  various
employee and director stock plans as the need arises.

The Bombay Company,  Inc.  1986  Stock Option Plan and 1996 Long Term Incentive
Stock Plan ("Employee Plans") provide  for  the  granting of options (and other
types  of  stock-related  awards  under  the 1996 plan)  to  officers  and  key
management employees. At January 31, 2004,  the  option shares reserved for the
Employee Plans were 4,492,494.  The option price is  fixed  at the market price
or higher on the date of the grant.  Options are generally exercisable annually
at  a  rate  of 33% per year beginning one year after the grant  date.   Shares
available for  additional  grants  were  1,795,138;  2,432,019 and 1,459,552 at
January 31, 2004, February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002, respectively.

During  Fiscal 2001, restricted stock aggregating 200,000  shares  was  granted
under the  1996  Long  Term  Incentive Stock Plan to three key executives.  The
respective shares were to become  vested  in  designated  increments contingent
upon  continued  employment  of the respective executive after  12  months,  24
months and 36 months.  During  Fiscal  2002, 40,000 of the shares became vested
and were distributed.  Also in Fiscal 2002,  two  of  the  executives  left the
employment  of  Bombay  and 120,000 restricted shares expired unvested.  During
Fiscal 2003, 15,000 of the  shares  became  vested  and  were distributed.  The
remaining  25,000 shares have become vested and will be distributed  in  Fiscal
2004.  Compensation  expense  of  $23,000  and  $285,000  was recognized during
Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2001, respectively, and in Fiscal 2002  net  expenses of
$87,000 were reversed in connection with the restricted stock.

During  Fiscal 2002, 75,000 shares of restricted stock were granted and  issued
to the Chairman  of  the  Board.   One  third  of  the  shares  vested upon his
acceptance of the position.  Contingent upon continued Board service, one third
of the shares was to become vested after 12 months and 24 months, respectively.
During Fiscal 2003, the Chairman of the Board accepted the appointment  to also
become  our  Chief  Executive  Officer.  Under the terms of his employment, the
unvested shares under his initial  restricted  stock  grant were canceled and a
new  grant  of  81,256  shares  was  issued.   Contingent  upon  his  continued
employment, the shares will become fully vested after 36 months.  During Fiscal
2003  and Fiscal 2002, $136,000 and $153,000, respectively, was  recognized  as
compensation expense in conjunction with the restricted stock grants.

During  Fiscal  2003, 50,000 shares of restricted stock were granted and issued
under the 1996 Long  Term  Incentive  Stock  Plan  to  a  key  executive.   The
respective shares are to become vested in designated increments contingent upon
continued employment of the executive after 12 months, 24 months and 36 months.
Compensation   expense  of  $170,000  was  recognized  during  Fiscal  2003  in
connection with the restricted stock.

The Bombay Company,  Inc.  Non-Employee  Director Equity Plan ("Director Plan")
provides for the granting of options to members  of  the Board of Directors who
are neither Bombay employees nor officers.  At January  31,  2004,  the  option
shares  reserved for the Director Plan were 464,978.  The option price is fixed
at the market  price  on  the  date  of the grant.  For Fiscal 2003, the option
grant, initial and annual, was the lesser  of  10,000 shares or $75,000 in face
value.   The  initial grant becomes exercisable at  a  rate  of  20%  per  year
beginning one year  after the grant date.  Each additional annual grant becomes
fully exercisable six  months  after  the  grant  date.   Shares  available for
additional  grants  were  116,469;  325,196  and  354,210 at January 31,  2004,
February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002, respectively.

The  Director Plan also allows directors the option  to  receive  retainer  and
meeting  fees  in  the  form of Bombay common stock or to defer receipt of such
fees.  Deferred amounts are  credited  to an account for such director in units
equivalent to Bombay common stock.

The following table includes option information  for  the  Employee  Plans  and
Director Plan:

The  exercise  of  non-qualified  stock  options in Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002
resulted in income tax benefits of $3,283,000 and $155,000, respectively, which
were credited to additional paid-in capital.   The  income tax benefits are the
tax effect of the difference between the market price  on  the date of exercise
and the option price.


NOTE 8 - SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS PLAN

We  have  a shareholders' rights plan under which each share of  Bombay  common
stock includes  one  Preferred  Share  Purchase  Right  ("Right") entitling the
holder  to  buy one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior  Participating
Preferred Stock  of the Company at an exercise price of $50.  The Rights, which
have ten year terms  expiring  in  2005,  are  exercisable if a person or group
acquires 15% or more of the common stock of Bombay  or announces a tender offer
for 15% or more of the common stock.  If a person or group acquires 15% or more
of the outstanding common stock of Bombay, each Right  will  entitle the holder
to purchase, at the Right's exercise price, a number of shares of Bombay common
stock having a market value of twice the Right's exercise price.   If Bombay is
acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after  a  person
or group acquires 15% or more of our common stock, each Right will entitle  its
holder  to  purchase,  at the Right's exercise price, a number of shares of the
acquiring company's common  stock  having  a  market value of twice the Right's
exercise price.  The Rights are redeemable at one  cent  per  Right at any time
before they become exercisable.


NOTE 9 - STOCK PURCHASE LOANS

On May 16, 2002, the Board of Directors elected to abolish our  Executive Stock
Loan  Program,  which  originated  in  August 1999.  At that date, participants
owned 189,031 shares of Bombay common stock  purchased  under  the program.  We
reacquired,  at  then  current market prices aggregating $864,000,  the  Bombay
common stock that was previously  purchased by the executive officers under the
program,  and the notes were extinguished.   Amounts  owed  to  Bombay  or  the
participants  as  a  result  of  the difference between the market value of the
stock and the loan balance plus accrued interest were paid in full.

During  Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001,  $17,000  and  $53,000,  respectively,  in
interest income was recognized related to the loans.

                           INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT


      THIS  AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of the ____ day
of ____________,  2004,  by  and  between  The Bombay Company, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), and _________________________ ("Indemnitee").

                                   RECITALS:

      WHEREAS, highly competent persons have  become  more  reluctant  to serve
publicly-held  corporations  as  directors  or  officers or in other capacities
unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate
indemnification against inordinate risks of claims  and  actions  against  them
arising  out of their service to, and activities on behalf of, the corporation;
this is because  such persons in service to corporations are being increasingly
subjected to expensive  and  time-consuming litigation relating to, among other
things, claims that traditionally  would  have  been  brought  only against the
corporation or business enterprise itself; and

      WHEREAS,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  (the "Board")  has
determined that, to attract and retain qualified individuals,  the Company will
attempt  to  maintain  on  an  ongoing  basis,  at  its sole expense, liability
insurance  to  protect persons serving the Company and  its  subsidiaries  from
certain liabilities; and

      WHEREAS, the  Board  has  determined  that  the  increased  difficulty in
attracting  and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests  of
the Company's  stockholders  and  that  the  Company  should act to assure such
persons  that  there  will  be increased certainty of such  protection  in  the
future; and

      WHEREAS,  it  is  reasonable,  prudent  and  necessary  for  the  Company
contractually to obligate  itself  to  indemnify,  and  to  advance expenses on
behalf  of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable  law  so
that they  will  serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern
that they will not be so indemnified; and

      WHEREAS, this Agreement is separate from and in addition to the Bylaws of
the Company and any  resolutions  adopted  pursuant  thereto,  and shall not be
deemed  a  substitute  therefor,  nor  to  diminish  or abrogate any rights  of
Indemnitee thereunder; and

      WHEREAS, each of Section 145 of the General Corporation  Law of the State
of  Delaware  ("DGCL")  and  the  Bylaws  of  the Company is nonexclusive,  and
therefore  contemplates  that contracts may be entered  into  with  respect  to
indemnification of directors, officers and employees; and

      WHEREAS, Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take on
additional service for or  on  behalf  of  the  Company  on  the condition that
Indemnitee be so indemnified;

      NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of  the  premises and the  covenants
contained  herein,  the  Company and Indemnitee hereby covenant  and  agree  as
follows:

      1.    SERVICES BY INDEMNITEE.   Indemnitee agrees to continue to serve as
            a director or officer of the  Company, provided that Indemnitee may
            at any time and for any reason  resign  from  such position and the
            Company shall have no obligation under this Agreement  to  continue
            Indemnitee   in   such  position  (subject,  in  the  case  of  any
            resignation by Indemnitee  or  termination  by  the Company, to any
            rights  and  obligations they may have under contracts  other  than
            this Agreement  or under applicable law).  This Agreement shall not
            be deemed an employment contract between the Company (or any of its
            subsidiaries) and  Indemnitee.   This  Agreement  shall continue in
            force after Indemnitee has ceased to serve as a director or officer
            of the Company.

      2.    INDEMNIFICATION-GENERAL.  The Company shall indemnify,  and advance
            Expenses (as hereinafter defined) to, Indemnitee (i) as provided in
            this  Agreement,  and  (ii)  to  the  fullest  extent permitted  by
            applicable  law in effect on the date hereof and  as  amended  from
            time to time  (but  in  the case of any such amendment, only to the
            extent that such amendment  permits  the Company to provide broader
            indemnification rights than were permitted prior to the amendment).
            The  rights  of Indemnitee provided under  the  preceding  sentence
            shall include, but shall not be limited to, the rights set forth in
            the other Sections of this Agreement.

      3.    PROCEEDINGS OTHER  THAN  PROCEEDINGS  BY  OR  IN  THE  RIGHT OF THE
            COMPANY.  Indemnitee shall be indemnified under this Section  3 if,
            by reason of Indemnitee's Corporate Status (as hereinafter defined)
            or by reason of any act done or not done by Indemnitee by reason of
            or  on account of Indemnitee's Corporate Status, Indemnitee is,  or
            is threatened  to  be  made,  a  party  to  or a participant in any
            threatened,  pending,  or  completed  Proceeding   (as  hereinafter
            defined),  other  than  a  Proceeding  by  or in the right  of  the
            Company.   Pursuant  to  this  Section  3,  Indemnitee   shall   be
            indemnified  against  all  Expenses,  judgments,  penalties, fines,
            liabilities and amounts paid in settlement actually  and reasonably
            incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection with
            such  Proceeding  or  any  claim,  issue  or  matter  therein,   if
            Indemnitee acted in Good Faith.

      4.    PROCEEDINGS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY.  Indemnitee shall be
            indemnified  under  this  Section  4  if, by reason of Indemnitee's
            Corporate  Status  or by reason of any act  done  or  not  done  by
            Indemnitee by reason  of  or  on  account of Indemnitee's Corporate
            Status, Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a
            participant  in  any threatened, pending  or  completed  Proceeding
            brought by or in the  right of the Company to procure a judgment in
            its  favor.   Pursuant to  this  Section  4,  Indemnitee  shall  be
            indemnified against  all  Expenses actually and reasonably incurred
            by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's  behalf  in  connection  with such
            Proceeding  if  Indemnitee  acted  in Good Faith; provided that  if
            applicable  law  so  provides,  no  indemnification   against  such
            Expenses shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or  matter in
            such Proceeding as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged  to
            be liable to the Company unless and to the extent that the Court of
            Chancery  of  the  State  of  Delaware,  or the court in which such
            Proceeding shall have been brought or is pending,  shall  determine
            that such indemnification may be made.

      5.    INDEMNIFICATION  FOR  EXPENSES  OF  A PARTY WHO IS WHOLLY OR PARTLY
            SUCCESSFUL.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
            to  the  extent  that  Indemnitee  is, by  reason  of  Indemnitee's
            Corporate  Status or by reason of any  act  done  or  not  done  by
            Indemnitee by  reason  of  or  on account of Indemnitee's Corporate
            Status, a party to (or a participant  in) and is successful, on the
            merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding (including dismissal without
            prejudice), Indemnitee shall be indemnified  to  the maximum extent
            permitted  by  law  against  all  Expenses actually and  reasonably
            incurred  by  Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's  behalf  in  connection
            therewith.   If   Indemnitee  is  not  wholly  successful  in  such
            Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one
            or  more but less than  all  claims,  issues  or  matters  in  such
            Proceeding,  the  Company  shall  indemnify  Indemnitee against all
            Expenses  actually  and  reasonably  incurred by Indemnitee  or  on
            Indemnitee's behalf in connection with  each  successfully resolved
            claim, issue or matter.  For purposes of this Section  and  without
            limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a
            Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed
            to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.

      6.    INDEMNIFICATION  FOR  OTHER  EXPENSES;  PER  DIEM  WHEN  NO  LONGER
            DIRECTOR, OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE.  Notwithstanding any other provision
            of  this  Agreement,  Indemnitee  shall  be indemnified against all
            Expenses actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by Indemnitee
            or  on  Indemnitee's  behalf  if  Indemnitee  is,   by   reason  of
            Indemnitee's  Corporate Status, a witness or otherwise involved  in
            any manner in any  threatened,  pending  or completed Proceeding to
            which Indemnitee neither is, nor is threatened to be made, a party;
            provided  that  Indemnitee shall not otherwise  be  compensated  or
            reimbursed for the  value of Indemnitee's time spent as such unless
            (i) Indemnitee no longer serves as an officer, director or employee
            of the Company and (ii)  Indemnitee has spent more than 10 business
            days as a witness or other non-party participant in such Proceeding
            by reason of Indemnitee's  prior Corporate Status.  After such 10th
            business day, the Indemnitee  shall  be  entitled  to receive a per
            diem  rate  of  $1,500  for  each  additional  business  day   that
            Indemnitee  is required to spend as a non-party participant in such
            Proceeding.  If Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party
            to such Proceeding,  then  the  provisions of Section 3, 4 or 5, as
            appropriate, shall apply in accordance with the terms thereof.

      7.    ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  this
            Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall advance all reasonable
            Expenses  incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with
            any Proceeding  referred  to in Section 3, 4, 5 or 6 within 10 days
            after the receipt by the Company  of a statement or statements from
            Indemnitee requesting such advance  or  advances from time to time,
            whether  prior to or after final disposition  of  such  Proceeding.
            Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses
            incurred by  Indemnitee.  Indemnitee hereby undertakes to repay any
            Expenses advanced  if  it  shall  ultimately be determined by final
            judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction  that  Indemnitee  is
            not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses.  Any advances
            and  undertakings  to  repay  pursuant  to  this Section 7 shall be
            unsecured and interest free.  Advances shall  include  any  and all
            reasonable  Expenses  incurred by Indemnitee pursuing an action  to
            enforce   this   Agreement,   including   Indemnitee's   right   of
            advancement, and Expenses  incurred  in  preparing  and  forwarding
            statements   to  the  Company  to  support  the  advances  claimed;
            provided, that  the  Company  shall  only  be  obligated to advance
            Expenses  incurred by Indemnitee in pursuing an action  to  enforce
            this Agreement  to  the extent that the Expenses previously paid by
            Indemnitee in such action exceed $10,000.  In any legal proceedings
            commenced by Indemnitee in a court of competent jurisdiction in the
            State of Delaware to  secure a determination that Indemnitee should
            be  indemnified  under applicable  law,  or  as  provided  in  this
            Agreement, any determination  made  by  the  Reviewing  Party  that
            Indemnitee   would   not  be  permitted  to  be  indemnified  under
            applicable law or under this Agreement shall not be binding.

      8.    PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINATION OF ENTITLEMENT TO INDEMNIFICATION.

            (A)To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall
      submit to the Company a written  request,  including therein or therewith
      such  documentation  and  information  as  is  reasonably   available  to
      Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and  to  what
      extent Indemnitee is entitled to such indemnification.  The Secretary  of
      the   Company  shall,  promptly  upon  receipt  of  such  a  request  for
      indemnification,   advise  the  Board  in  writing  that  Indemnitee  has
      requested indemnification.

            (B)The person,  persons or entity (the "Reviewing Party") who shall
      determine whether Indemnitee  is entitled to indemnification in the first
      instance  shall  be  (i)  the  Board,   acting  by  a  majority  vote  of
      Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined),  whether  or  not  such
      majority  constitutes  a  quorum  of  the  Board,  (ii)  a  committee  of
      Disinterested   Directors   designated   by   a   majority  vote  of  the
      Disinterested  Directors,  whether  or  not such majority  constitutes  a
      quorum,  or  (iii)  if  there  are  no  Disinterested  Directors,  or  if
      Indemnitee   so   directs  in  writing  at  the  time   a   request   for
      indemnification is made, an Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined).
      Promptly after making  the determination the Reviewing Party shall render
      its written opinion to the  Company  and  Indemnitee as to whether and to
      what extent Indemnitee should be permitted  to  be indemnified under this
      Agreement.  If the Reviewing Party determines that Indemnitee is entitled
      to indemnification, payment shall be made by the  Company  within 10 days
      after such determination.  Indemnitee shall cooperate with the  Reviewing
      Party  with  respect  to  Indemnitee's  entitlement  to  indemnification,
      including  providing  to  the  Reviewing  Party  upon reasonable  advance
      request  any  documentation  or  information  that is not  privileged  or
      otherwise protected from disclosure and that is  reasonably  available to
      Indemnitee   and   reasonably   necessary  to  such  determination.   All
      reasonable   costs   or   expenses   (including   attorneys'   fees   and
      disbursements)  incurred  by  Indemnitee   in  so  cooperating  with  the
      Reviewing  Party  shall  be  paid  by the Company  (irrespective  of  the
      determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement  to indemnification) and the
      Company  hereby  indemnifies  and  agrees  to  hold  Indemnitee  harmless
      therefrom.

            (C)If Indemnitee directs that an Independent Counsel  be appointed,
      the  Independent  Counsel  shall  be  selected by the Board, and promptly
      following  such  selection  the  Company shall  give  written  notice  to
      Indemnitee advising Indemnitee of the identity of the Independent Counsel
      so selected.  Within 10 days after  such  written notice of selection has
      been given, Indemnitee may deliver to the Company  a written objection to
      such selection; provided that such objection may be  asserted only on the
      ground  that  the  Independent  Counsel  so  selected does not  meet  the
      requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined  in  Section 18, and the
      objection shall set forth with particularity the factual  basis  for such
      assertion.   Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected
      shall act as Independent  Counsel.  If such written objection is so made,
      the Independent Counsel so  selected may not serve as Independent Counsel
      unless and until such objection  is  withdrawn  or a court has determined
      that such objection is without merit.  If within 45 days after submission
      by  Indemnitee  of  a  written  request for indemnification  pursuant  to
      Section  8(a) that directs the Board  to  appoint an Independent Counsel,
      no Independent Counsel has been selected and  not objected to, either the
      Company or Indemnitee may petition the Court of  Chancery of the State of
      Delaware or other court of competent jurisdiction  for the appointment of
      such  person  or  entity  as   Independent  Counsel  as the  court  shall
      designate,  and  the  person with respect to whom all objections  are  so
      resolved or the person  so  appointed  by  the  court  shall  then act as
      Independent  Counsel under this Agreement.  Upon the due commencement  of
      any judicial proceeding  or  arbitration  pursuant  to Section 10(a), the
      Independent  Counsel  shall  be discharged and relieved  of  any  further
      responsibility in such capacity  (subject  to the applicable standards of
      professional conduct then prevailing).

      1.    PRESUMPTIONS; RELIANCE AND EFFECT OF CERTAIN PROCEEDINGS.

            (A)In  making  a  determination  with  respect  to  entitlement  to
      indemnification  hereunder,  the  Reviewing  Party   shall  presume  that
      Indemnitee  is  entitled  to  indemnification  under  this  Agreement  if
      Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with
      Section 8(a), and the Company shall have the burden of proof  to overcome
      that presumption by clear and convincing evidence in connection  with the
      making  by  any person, persons or firm of any determination contrary  to
      that presumption.   Neither  the  failure  of the Reviewing Party to have
      made a determination prior to the commencement  of any action pursuant to
      this  Agreement  that  indemnification  is  proper in  the  circumstances
      because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard  of  conduct,  nor any
      determination  thereby  that  Indemnitee  has  not  met  such  applicable
      standard of conduct, shall be a defense or admissible as evidence  in any
      action  for  any  purpose or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not
      acted in Good Faith or met any other applicable standard of conduct.

            (B)If the Reviewing  Party  shall  not  have  made  a determination
      within 60 days after receipt by the Company of the request  therefor, the
      requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed
      to   have   been   made   and   Indemnitee  shall  be  entitled  to  such
      indemnification, absent (i) a misstatement  by  Indemnitee  of a material
      fact,  or  an  omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's
      statement not materially  misleading,  in connection with the request for
      indemnification,  or  (ii) a prohibition of  such  indemnification  under
      applicable law; provided  that  such  60-day period may be extended for a
      reasonable time, not to exceed an additional  30  days,  if the Reviewing
      Party  in  good  faith requests in writing such additional time  for  the
      obtaining or evaluating  of  documentation  and/or  information  relating
      thereto.

            (C)The  termination  of  any  Proceeding or of any claim, issue  or
      matter therein , by judgment, order,  settlement (whether with or without
      court approval) or conviction, or upon  a  plea of nolo contendere or its
      equivalent,  shall not (except as otherwise expressly  provided  in  this
      Agreement)  of  itself  adversely  affect  the  right  of  Indemnitee  to
      indemnification  or  create a presumption that (i) Indemnitee did not act
      in Good Faith or failed to meet any other applicable standard of conduct,
      or (ii) a court has determined  that  indemnification  is  not  permitted
      under applicable law.

            (D)The  knowledge  and/or  actions,  or  failure  to  act,  of  any
      director,  officer,  agent  or  employee  of  the Enterprise shall not be
      imputed  to  Indemnitee  for  purposes  of  determining   the   right  to
      indemnification under this Agreement.

      1.    REMEDIES OF INDEMNITEE.

            (A)If  (i)  a  determination  is  made  pursuant  to Section 8 that
      Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this  Agreement, (ii)
      advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section  7,  (iii)
      no  determination  of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made
      pursuant to Section  8(b)  within 90 days after receipt by the Company of
      the request for indemnification,  (iv)  payment of indemnification is not
      made  pursuant to Section 5, Section  6, the  last  sentence  of  Section
       8(b) or  the last sentence of Section 18(j) within 10 days after receipt
      by  the Company  of  a  written  request  therefor,  or  (v)  payment  of
      indemnification pursuant to Section 3 or Section  4 is not made within 10
      days  after  a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to
      indemnification,  Indemnitee  shall be entitled to an adjudication by the
      Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware of Indemnitee's entitlement to
      such  indemnification  or  advancement   of   Expenses.    Alternatively,
      Indemnitee,  at Indemnitee's option, may seek an award in arbitration  to
      be  conducted  by   a   single  arbitrator  pursuant  to  the  Commercial
      Arbitration Rules of the  American  Arbitration  Association.  Indemnitee
      shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication  or  an  award  in
      arbitration  within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first
      has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 10(a);
      provided that  the  foregoing  clause  shall  not  apply  in respect of a
      proceeding  brought  by  Indemnitee to enforce Indemnitee's rights  under
      Section 5.  The Company shall  not  oppose Indemnitee's right to seek any
      such adjudication or award in arbitration.

            (B)If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 8(b)
      that  Indemnitee  is  not  entitled  to  indemnification,   any  judicial
      proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section  10 shall be
      conducted  in  all  respects  as a de novo trial, or arbitration, on  the
      merits and Indemnitee shall not  be  prejudiced by reason of that adverse
      determination.

            (C)If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 8(b)
      that  Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification,  the  Company  shall  be
      bound by  such  determination  in  any judicial proceeding or arbitration
      commenced  pursuant to this Section 10,  absent  (i)  a  misstatement  by
      Indemnitee of  a  material  fact,  or  an  omission  of  a  material fact
      necessary  to make Indemnitee's statements not materially misleading,  in
      connection with  the  request for indemnification, or (ii)  a prohibition
      of such indemnification under applicable law.

            (D)If Indemnitee,  pursuant  to  this  Section 10, seeks a judicial
      adjudication of or an award in arbitration to enforce Indemnitee's rights
      under,  or to recover damages for breach of, this  Agreement,  Indemnitee
      shall be  entitled  to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified
      by the Company against,  any  and all expenses (of the types described in
      the definition of Expenses in Section  18 of this Agreement) actually and
      reasonably  incurred  by  Indemnitee  in such  judicial  adjudication  or
      arbitration  unless  it  shall be finally  determined  by  the  court  or
      arbitrator before which such claim was brought that it was brought in bad
      faith.  Even if it shall be  determined  in such judicial adjudication or
      arbitration that Indemnitee is entitled to  receive  part  but not all of
      the  indemnification  or  advancement  of  Expenses  sought, the expenses
      incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such judicial  adjudication  or
      arbitration shall be paid in full.

            (E)The  Company  shall  be precluded from asserting in any judicial
      proceeding or arbitration commenced  pursuant to this Section 10 that the
      procedures and presumptions of this Agreement  are not valid, binding and
      enforceable and hereby stipulates, and shall so  stipulate  in  any  such
      court or before any such arbitrator, that the Company is bound by all the
      provisions of this Agreement.

      1.    NOTIFICATION AND DEFENSE OF PROCEEDING.

            (A)Indemnitee  shall  promptly  notify  the Company in writing upon
      being served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment,
      information or other document relating to any Proceeding  or  matter that
      may be subject to indemnification or advancement of Expenses pursuant  to
      this  Agreement,  but  subject to the last sentence of Section 11(c), the
      omission so to notify the  Company will not relieve it from any liability
      that it may have to Indemnitee.

            (B)In the event Indemnitee notifies the Company of the commencement
      of a Proceeding, the Company  will  be  entitled  to  participate  in the
      Proceeding at its own expense, and except as otherwise provided below, if
      the  Company  so  wishes,  it may assume the defense thereof with counsel
      reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee.   After notice from the Company to
      Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense  of  any Proceeding, the
      Company  will  not  be  liable  to  Indemnitee  under  this Agreement  or
      otherwise  for  any  Expenses  subsequently  incurred  by  Indemnitee  in
      connection  with  the  defense  of  such Proceeding other than reasonable
      costs of investigation or as otherwise  provided below.  Indemnitee shall
      have the right to retain Indemnitee's own counsel in such Proceeding, but
      Indemnitee  shall  be  obligated  to  pay all  Expenses  related  thereto
      incurred by Indemnitee after notice from the Company of its assumption of
      the defense unless:  (i) the retention  of counsel by Indemnitee has been
      authorized  by the Company, (ii) Indemnitee  has  reasonably  determined,
      based upon a  written  opinion  of  Indemnitee's counsel, that there is a
      substantial possibility that a conflict  of  interest  will arise between
      Indemnitee and the Company in the defense of the Proceeding,  (iii) after
      a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), the retention of counsel by
      Indemnitee  has  been  approved  by  an Independent Counsel, or (iv)  the
      Company  shall  not  within  60  calendar  days   have  retained  counsel
      reasonably  satisfactory  to  Indemnitee to assume the  defense  of  such
      Proceeding, in each of which cases all Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in
      connection with such Proceeding  shall  be  borne by the Company.  In the
      event separate counsel is retained by Indemnitee pursuant to this Section
      11(b), the Company shall cooperate with Indemnitee  with  respect  to the
      defense  of  the  Proceeding,  including  making documents, witnesses and
      other  reasonable  information  related  to  the   defense  available  to
      Indemnitee and such separate counsel pursuant to joint-defense agreements
      or  confidentiality  agreements,  as  appropriate.   Notwithstanding  any
      provision herein to the contrary, the Company shall not  be  entitled  to
      assume  the  defense  of  any  Proceeding  brought by or on behalf of the
      Company  or  as  to which Indemnitee shall have  made  the  determination
      provided for in (ii) above.

            (C)The Company  shall  not  be liable to indemnify Indemnitee under
      this Agreement or otherwise for any  amounts  paid  in  settlement of any
      Proceeding effected without the Company's prior written consent; provided
      that if a Change of Control has occurred, the Company shall be liable for
      indemnification  of  Indemnitee  for  amounts  paid in settlement  if  an
      Independent Counsel has approved the settlement.   The  Company shall not
      settle  any  Proceeding  in  any  manner  that would impose any  penalty,
      liability or limitation on Indemnitee without  Indemnitee's prior written
      consent; provided that the Company shall not be  required  to  obtain the
      consent of Indemnitee to the settlement of any Proceeding the Company has
      undertaken  to defend if the settlement grants Indemnitee a complete  and
      unqualified release  in  respect of the potential liability.  The Company
      shall not be liable for any  amount  paid  by Indemnitee in settlement of
      any Proceeding that is not defended by the Company unless the Company has
      consented to such settlement.  Neither the Company  nor  Indemnitee  will
      unreasonably  withhold  their  consent  to  any proposed settlement.  The
      Company  shall  have  no obligation to indemnify  Indemnitee  under  this
      Agreement with regard to  any  judicial  award issued in a Proceeding, or
      any  related  Expenses of Indemnitee, if the  Company  was  not  given  a
      reasonable and  timely opportunity, at its expense, to participate in the
      defense of such Proceeding,  except  to  the  extent  the Company was not
      materially prejudiced thereby.

      1.    NONEXCLUSIVITY; INSURANCE; SUBROGATION.

            (A)The  rights  of  indemnification  and to receive advancement  of
      Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall  not  be deemed exclusive of
      any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time  be  entitled  under
      applicable law, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, the Company's
      Bylaws, any other agreement, any vote of stockholders, any resolution  of
      the  Board,  or  otherwise.   No  amendment, alteration or repeal of this
      Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of
      Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted
      by  such  Indemnitee  in Indemnitee's  Corporate  Status  prior  to  such
      amendment, alteration or repeal.  To the extent that a change in the DGCL
      or the manner in which  the  DGCL is judicially construed permits greater
      indemnification  or  advancement  of  Expenses  than  would  be  afforded
      currently under the Company's  Certificate  of  Incorporation, Bylaws and
      this Agreement, it is the agreement and intent of the parties hereto that
      Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded
      by such change.  No right or remedy herein conferred  is  intended  to be
      exclusive  of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy
      shall be cumulative  and  in  addition  to  every  right and remedy given
      hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in  equity or otherwise.
      The  assertion  or  employment  of  any  right  or  remedy hereunder,  or
      otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion  or  employment  of
      any other right or remedy.

            (B)The  Company  shall  use  reasonable  best  efforts  to  provide
      directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage for the benefit  of
      Indemnitee   and  Indemnitee's  estate  at  all  times  while  Indemnitee
      continues to serve  as  a director or an executive officer of the Company
      on the same terms and in the same amount as the Company then provides for
      its other directors and executive  officers.   Upon  the  termination  of
      Indemnitee's  service  as  a director or executive officer of the Company
      and for a period thereafter equal to the shorter of (i) six years or (ii)
      the  expiration of the applicable  statute  of  limitations  (the  "Post-
      Termination  Coverage  Period"),  the  Company  will  use reasonable best
      efforts to maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage
      for its directors and executive officers in a manner that  will  continue
      to   provide   coverage   for  Indemnitee's  acts  and  omissions  during
      Indemnitee's service as a director  or  executive officer of the Company.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing sentences of  this  Section 12(b), from and
      after  the  occurrence  of  a  Change  of Control, the Company  shall  be
      obligated  to  use  best  efforts to maintain  directors'  and  officers'
      liability insurance coverage  while  Indemnitee  continues  to serve as a
      director  or  an  executive  officer of the Company and during the  Post-
      Termination Coverage Period on terms and in amounts substantially similar
      to those maintained by the Company  immediately  prior  to  the Change of
      Control.

            (C)In  the  event of any payment under this Agreement, the  Company
      shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of
      recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all documents required and take
      all actions necessary  to secure such rights, including execution of such
      documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce
      such rights.

            (D)The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any
      payment of amounts otherwise  indemnifiable  (or for which advancement is
      provided hereunder) hereunder if and to the extent  that  Indemnitee  has
      already  received  payment  of  such  amounts under any insurance policy,
      contract, agreement or otherwise.

            (E)The  Company's  obligation  to  indemnify  or  advance  Expenses
      hereunder to Indemnitee due to the fact that Indemnitee is or was serving
      at the request of the Company as a director,  officer,  employee or agent
      of  any  other  corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,  employee
      benefit  plan  or  other  enterprise  shall  be  reduced  by  any  amount
      Indemnitee has already  received  as  indemnification  or  advancement of
      expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture,  trust,
      employee benefit plan or other enterprise.

      1.    DURATION  OF  AGREEMENT.   This  Agreement shall continue until and
            terminate upon the later of:  (i) the  expiration of the applicable
            limitations periods as to all possible claims  in  respect of which
            Indemnitee  is granted rights of indemnification or advancement  of
            Expenses hereunder  upon  commencement  of a related Proceeding, or
            (ii)  the  final  termination  of any Proceeding  then  pending  in
            respect of which Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or
            advancement of Expenses hereunder  and  of any proceeding commenced
            by  Indemnitee  pursuant  to  Section  10 relating  thereto.   This
            Agreement shall be binding upon the Company  and its successors and
            assigns   and  shall  inure  to  the  benefit  of  Indemnitee   and
            Indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators.

      2.    SEVERABILITY.   If  any  provision  or provisions of this Agreement
            shall  be  held to be invalid, illegal  or  unenforceable  for  any
            reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of
            the remaining  provisions  of  this  Agreement  (including  without
            limitation each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing
            any  such  provision  held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable,
            that is not itself invalid,  illegal or unenforceable) shall not in
            any  way  be  affected  or  impaired   thereby   and  shall  remain
            enforceable  to  the  fullest extent permitted by law,  (ii)   such
            provision or provisions  shall  be  deemed  reformed  to the extent
            necessary  to  conform  to  applicable law and to give the  maximum
            effect  to the intent of the parties  hereto,  and  (iii)   to  the
            fullest  extent   possible,   the   provisions  of  this  Agreement
            (including without limitation each portion  of  any Section of this
            Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal
            or   unenforceable,   that  is  not  itself  invalid,  illegal   or
            unenforceable) shall be  construed  so  as  to  give  effect to the
            intent manifested thereby.

      3.    EXCEPTION  TO RIGHT OF INDEMNIFICATION OR ADVANCEMENT OF  EXPENSES.
            Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement, but subject
            to Section 10, Indemnitee  shall not be entitled to indemnification
            or advancement of Expenses under this Agreement with respect to any
            Proceeding brought by Indemnitee,  or any claim therein, unless the
            bringing of such Proceeding or making of such claim shall have been
            approved by the Board.

      4.    IDENTICAL COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement  may  be executed in one or
            more counterparts, each of which shall for all  purposes  be deemed
            to  be  an original but all of which together shall constitute  one
            and the same  Agreement.   Only  one such counterpart signed by the
            party against whom enforceability is sought needs to be produced to
            evidence the existence of this Agreement.

      5.    HEADINGS.   The  headings of the Sections  of  this  Agreement  are
            inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute
            part of this Agreement or to affect the construction thereof.

            purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption  of office is
            in  connection  with  an  actual  or  threatened  election  contest
            relating  to the election of the directors of the Company (as  such
            terms are used  in  Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under

            (D)"Corporate  Status"  describes  the status of a person who is or

      conduct was unlawful.  For  purposes  of any determination of Good Faith,
      Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted  in  Good  Faith if Indemnitee's
      action  is  based on the records or books of account of  the  Enterprise,
      including financial  statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee
      by a committee of the  Board  upon  which Indemnitee does not serve as to

      provisions of this  Section  18(i) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or

      agreements), or (ii)   any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a
      claim for indemnification  hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
      term "Independent Counsel" shall  not  include  any person who, under the
      applicable standards of professional conduct then  prevailing, would have
      a conflict of interest in representing the Company or  Indemnitee  in  an
      action  to  determine  Indemnitee's  rights  under  this  Agreement.  The
      Company  shall  promptly  pay  the  reasonable fees and expenses  of  the
      Independent Counsel referred to above  and  shall  fully  indemnify  such
      counsel  against  any  and  all Expenses, claims, liabilities and damages
      arising out of or relating to  this  Agreement or its engagement pursuant
      hereto.

            (K)"Post-Termination Coverage Period"  shall have the meaning given
      in Section 12(b) hereof.

            (L)"Proceeding" includes any claim seeking  money  or other relief,
      however  made  or  presented,  as  well  as  any  threatened, pending  or

Dear Lucretia:

      It is a pleasure to confirm our discussion offering you the position of
Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer for The Bombay Company,
Inc. ("Company" or "Bombay"), effective October 3, 2003.  In this capacity you

      Your  annualized base salary will be $210,000 per year. Your compensation
will be evaluated in February 2004.

      As a member  of our Executive Committee, you will also participate in the
Company Executive Bonus  Program.  Your  targeted  fiscal year bonus is $84,000
(40% of base salary).    Seventy-five percent (75%) of your bonus will be based
upon the Company achieving its profit goals and twenty-five  percent (25%) will
be  based  upon  accomplishment  of  your  Personal  Performance Objectives  as
established  by  you  and  me.  For the balance of fiscal  2003,  you  will  be
eligible for the Company results portion of your targeted bonus (75% of target)
on a pro-rated basis.  Bonuses are paid in a lump sum following the end of each
fiscal year.

      You will receive an initial grant of options covering 30,000 shares of
Bombay stock, which will be priced at the closing price of Bombay stock on your
Hire Date. These options shall vest and may be exercised in whole or in part at
the rate of 33.33% per year, commencing with the first anniversary of your Hire
Date. The options have a term of ten years from the date of grant. The Board
will consider additional grants at the beginning of fiscal 2004. The first
$100,000 in face value will be granted in the form of incentive stock options
(no taxes exercised; taxed when shares are sold and, if holding period is met,
results in capital gains tax treatment) and the balance as non-qualified
options.

      You will receive three (3) weeks vacation per year, which are earned per
our vacation policy.

      Your employment is at-will and may be terminated by the Board of
Directors of the Company at any time, with or without cause. Nevertheless, if
you are terminated, not for cause, you shall be paid six (6) months
continuation of base salary. You agree that for a period of six months
following separation, you will not solicit, induce or attempt to induce
directly or indirectly, any employee of the Company to leave the employ of the
Company.

      In the event of a Change of Control, as defined in Exhibit "A", attached
hereto, the stock options granted to you shall immediately vest and be
exercisable by you commencing on such date the Change of Control event.

      You are eligible to participate in The Bombay Company 401(K) Savings and
Stock Ownership Plan after one year of employment. Under the plan, Bombay
currently contributes 100% of up to 3% of your compensation and 50% for the
next 2% of compensation (Federal Government salary limit is $200,000.) Under
our plan, you are allowed to contribute a maximum of $13,000 ($16,000 if fifty
years of age or over), which may be invested in the various options available
in the plan.

      You are eligible to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Program at
the next available investment period, July 1, 2004, whereby you may purchase
Bombay stock at a 15% discount from the lower fair market value on the first or
last day of the period.

effective on your Date of Hire. The Company and the employee share the cost of
the plans. The premiums are currently tax exempt under a section of the IRS tax
code. There is a one-year waiting period for any pre-existing conditions.

      After 90 days of employment you will receive Company paid life insurance
equal to 1  1/2 times your compensation at plan (salary plus target bonus).
Also, after 60 days of employment you will be covered under the Executive Short
Term Disability Income Protection plan, which pays 100% of your salary for a
maximum of 13 weeks and the Executive Long Term Income Protection Plan which
pays 60% of your salary up to $15,000 per month for as long as you remain
totally disabled up to age 65. If disability begins after age 62, payments
would commence on a sliding scale based on your age at time of disability. Your
net cost will be limited to the amount of personal income taxes you pay on the
Company reimbursement of the premium. The Company also offers supplemental life
to you at group rates.

      You agree and represent that your acceptance of employment with Bombay as
set forth in this letter does not conflict with any prior contract or agreement
of employment to which you are a party.

                                  EXHIBIT "A"

      A "Change of Control" of the Company, unless otherwise determined by the
Board shall be deemed to have occurred upon the happening of any of the
following events:

      (i)   the acquisition,  other  than  from  the Company, by any individual
            entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2)
            of the Exchange Act) of beneficial ownership  of  20%  or  more  of
            either  the  then outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company
            or  the combined  voting  power  of  the  then  outstanding  voting
            securities  of  the  Company  entitled  to  vote  generally  in the
            election  of directors; provided, however, that any acquisition  by
            the Company  or  any  of  its subsidiaries, or any employee benefit
            plan (or related trust) of  the Company or its subsidiaries, or any
            corporation with respect to which  following such acquisition, more
            than 50% of, respectively, the then  outstanding  shares of  common
            stock of such corporation and the combined voting power of the then
            outstanding voting securities of such corporation entitled  to vote
            generally  in the election of directors is then beneficially owned,
            directly  or  indirectly,  by  all  of  substantially  all  of  the
            individuals   and   entities   who   were  the  beneficial  owners,
            respectively,  of the Common Stock and  voting  securities  of  the
            Company  immediately   prior  to  such  acquisition,  of  the  then
            outstanding shares of Common  Stock  of the Company or the combined
            voting  power  of  the then outstanding voting  securities  of  the
            Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as
            the case may be, shall not constitute a Change of Control;

      (ii)  individuals who, as  of  January 1, 1996, constitute the Board (the
            "Incumbent Board") cease for  any  reason  to constitute at least a
            majority  of  the  Board, provided that any individual  becoming  a
            director subsequent  to such date whose election, or nomination for
            election by the Company's  shareholders,  was approved by a vote of
            at least a majority of the directors then comprising  the Incumbent
            Board shall be considered as though such individual were  a  member
            of  the  Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such
            individual whose initial assumption of office is in connection with
            an actual  or  threatened election contest relating to the election
            of the directors  of  the  Company  (as such terms are used in rule
            14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act); or

      (iii) approval by the shareholders of the Company  of  a  reorganization,
            merger or consolidation of the Company, in each case,  with respect
            to  which  the  individuals  and  entities  who were the respective
            beneficial owners of the Common Stock and voting  securities of the
            Company  immediately  prior  to  such  reorganization,  merger   or
            consolidation  do  not,  following  such  reorganization, merger or
            consolidation, beneficially own, directly or  indirectly, more than
            50% of,  respectively, the then outstanding shares  of Common Stock
            and  the  combined  voting  power  of  the then outstanding  voting
            securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors,
            as  the  case  may  be,  of  the  corporation resulting  from  such
            reorganization, merger or consolidation,  or a complete liquidation
            or dissolution of the Company or of the sale  or  other disposition
            of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.

                           THE BOMBAY COMPANY, INC.

                      CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS


INTRODUCTION

      This  Code  of  Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") describes Bombay
policies for conducting  its  business  in  a legal, ethical and honest manner.
This Code is intended to meet the requirements  of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of
2002  and  the  related rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

      The purpose  of  this Code is to establish standards the Company believes
are reasonably necessary to:

      Prevent  the   occurrence  of  illegal,  unethical  or  dishonest
      behavior;

      Detect and stop  any behavior of this type that may occur as soon
      as
      reasonably possible after the behavior is discovered; and

      Take  appropriate actions  to  discipline  those  who  engage  in
            illegal,  unethical  or dishonest behavior or who otherwise violate
            this Code.

      All Bombay directors, officers,  employees or agents, are responsible for
reading and understanding this Code.  Your  failure  to read or understand this
Code  will not excuse violations.  You should contact your  supervisor  or  the
other persons  indicated  in this Code if you have any questions regarding your
obligations under this Code.

      The Company has personnel  policies,  rules  and  standards  for employee
performance  that  continue in force.  This Code is intended to supplement  and
amplify those established personnel policies, rules and standards.

      The Governance  and  Nomination  Committee of the Board of Directors (the
"Committee")  is  responsible  for overseeing  the  policies,  procedures,  and
compliance of this Code.  The Committee must approve any amendment to the Code.
Any waiver of the Code provisions  must  also  be approved by the Committee and
will  be promptly disclosed on the Company's Internet  website  or  in  an  SEC
filing.   The  Company's  Internet  address  and its commitment to disclose any
waiver will be documented in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K.

      The  Committee will periodically review the  Code  and  make  appropriate
additions or changes.  You will be fully informed of all changes to the Code.

USE OF TERMS AND INTERPRETATION

      Some of  the  terms  used  in  this  Code  are  intended to have specific
meanings.  These meanings are described in this section.
      The terms "Bombay" and "Company" are used in this Code to mean The Bombay
Company, Inc., its divisions, subsidiaries, and branch offices.

      The  term  "associates" is used in this Code to refer  to  the  Company's
directors, officers, employees and agents.

      The  term  "laws"  as  used  in  this  Code  includes  the  laws,  rules,
regulations  and  other  legal  requirements  of  each  jurisdiction  that  are
applicable to the activities  of  the  Company.   These may include the laws of
jurisdictions other than the United States.

      The term "Senior Officer" is used in this Code  to  cover  the  principal
executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller,  or  persons  performing similar functions, with respect to actions
and decisions in their capacities as officers and employees of the Company.

      This Code is not a contract and is not intended to create any contractual
obligations on the part of  the  Company.   This  Code  also does not alter the
existing at-will or other applicable employment relationship  between  you  and
the Company or the legal relationship between the Company and its agents.

STANDARDS OF CONDUCT

      You  are expected to adhere to the following standards in connection with
the performance of your duties as an associate of the Company in order to deter
wrongdoing and to promote:

            actual  or  apparent  conflicts of interest  between  personal  and
            professional relationships;

      Avoidance of conflicts  of  interest, including disclosure to the
            persons identified in this Code  of  any  material  transaction  or
            relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to such
            a conflict;

      Full,  fair,  accurate,  timely  and understandable disclosure in

      fundamental to the continuation of the free enterprise system.

            The  Company will not enter into  arrangements  that  restrict  its

      business organization to compete fairly with the Company.

            You  may  not  enter  into,  or  even  discuss any  arrangement  or
      understanding with any third party which restricts  the Company's pricing
      policies,  terms  upon which its products and services  may  be  sold  to
      others, the number  and  type  of products manufactured or sold, or which
      might in any way be construed as  dividing customers or sales territories
      with a competitor.

      B.    DEALINGS WITH SUPPLIERS

            The Company is a valuable customer  for many suppliers.  People who
      want to do business or to continue to do business  with  the Company must
      understand that all purchases by the Company will be made  exclusively on
      the  basis  of  price, quality, service and suitability to the  Company's
      needs.

      C.    RECIPROCITY

            Reciprocity  is  a  harmful  practice  and  a hindrance to assuring
      purchase  of  the  best  available materials or services  at  the  lowest
      possible prices.  A supplier of goods or services to the Company will not
      be asked to buy goods and services from the Company in order to become or
      to continue as a supplier.

            You should not try to influence the Company's suppliers to purchase
      goods or services from the Company or from any customer of the Company in
      order to get its business.   In  arriving  at  purchasing  decisions  you
      should not favor firms who are customers of the Company.

      D.    PROTECTION AND PROPER USE OF COMPANY ASSETS

            You  should  protect  the  Company's assets and ensure their proper
      use.  Theft, carelessness and waste  have  direct impact on the Company's
      profitability.   All Company assets should therefore  be  used  only  for
      legitimate business purposes.

      E.    INTEGRITY OF RECORDS AND FINANCIAL REPORTS

            The integrity of the Company's record keeping and reporting systems
      will be respected at all times.  No one in the Company is allowed to use,
      authorize, or condone  the  use  of  "off-the-books"  bookkeeping, secret
      accounts, unrecorded bank accounts, slush funds, falsified  books, or any
      other devices that could be utilized to distort records or reports of the
      Company's true operating results and financial conditions.

II.   AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

      You must avoid situations where your personal interests may conflict with
the   interests   of  the  Company.   Conflicts  of  interest  arise  where  an
individual's  position   or   responsibilities  with  the  Company  present  an
opportunity for personal gain apart  from  the  normal  rewards  of employment.
They  also arise where an associate's personal interests are inconsistent  with
those of  the  Company  and  create  conflicting  loyalties.   Such conflicting
loyalties  may  cause  Company  personnel  to  compromise their principles  and
responsibilities to the Company for personal gain.

      It is not possible to detail every situation where conflicts of interests
may arise.  However, the following policies cover some of the areas that have a
significant potential for conflict:

      A.    SPECULATION IN BOMBAY SECURITIES AND MISUSE OF INSIDE INFORMATION

            If you know of any material fact about  the  Company  which has not
      been  disclosed  to the public (commonly known as "insider information"),
      you are prohibited  by  law  from  taking  advantage  of any purchaser or
      seller of the Company's securities who is not privy to  such information.
      You  may not engage in any transaction in the Company's securities  based
      upon inside  information  until  such  information  is  disclosed  to the
      public.  In addition, you must not provide insider information to others.
      Misuse  of insider information may result in civil and criminal penalties
      as well as disciplinary action.

            Generally,  a  material  fact  is one that a prudent investor would
      consider in reaching a decision to buy  or  sell  the  security involved.
      Examples of materials facts are:  knowledge of significant  new  products
      or  discoveries,  unexpected  changes in sales or earnings figures, major
      contracts and plans for stock splits, acquisitions or mergers.

            These restrictions also apply  to  insider  information relating to
      the Company's customers and suppliers.

            If  you  have questions regarding the sale or purchase  of  Company
      stock under circumstances  where  these laws and regulations might apply,
      you should review the Company's insider  trading  policy  or consult with
      the Company's General Counsel.

            It is very important that you not disclose data or information of a
      confidential nature concerning the Company or its products  to anyone not
      employed by the Company except where such information is disclosed in the
      course  of  normal business activities and the Company has obtained  from
      the  recipient   a   written  undertaking  to  protect  the  confidential
      information  from  misuse  or  unauthorized  disclosure.   Disclosure  of
      confidential information  can  be harmful to the Company and could be the
      basis for legal action against both the Company and the person disclosing
      the information.

            You should not acquire any  interest  in  real  estate  or  in  any
      business which you know the Company is interested in acquiring.

      B.    PERSONAL FINANCIAL INTEREST

            You  should  avoid  any  outside  financial  interests  which might
      influence   your   decisions   or  actions  as  a  Company  associate  or
      representative.  Such outside interests could include among other things:

            A personal or family  interest  in  an  enterprise that has
               business relations with the Company, either as  a  customer or a
               supplier, if such financial interest represents a material  part
               of the person's net worth or income.

            An  investment  in  another business that competes with the
               Company if the investment  represents  a  material  part  of the
               income or net worth of the person.

      C.    CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES

            You  are  not allowed to take for yourself personally opportunities
      that are discovered  through  the use of Company property, information or
      position,  or use Company property,  information  or  position  for  your
      personal gain,  or  compete  with  the Company.  Company associates owe a
      duty  to  the  Company  to  advance  its legitimate  interests  when  the
      opportunity to do so arises.

      D.    OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES

            You  should  avoid  outside employment  or  activities  that  would
      interfere with the effective  performance of your responsibilities to the
      Company either because of excessive  demands  on  your time or because of
      the nature of the employment or activity.  If you desire to practice your
      trade or profession for which you have been hired by  the Company outside
      the  scope  of  your  Company  employment, you must obtain prior  written
      approval from your Company supervisor.

      E.    KICKBACKS AND REBATES

            Corporate purchases of goods  or services must not lead to personal
      kickbacks or rebates.  You and/or your family must not accept any form of
      undisclosed payment or favor.

      F.    GIFTS AND ENTERTAINMENT

            Even when gifts and entertainment  are  exchanged out of the purest
      motives  of  personal  friendship, they may be misunderstood.   They  may
      appear as attempts to bribe  an  associate to direct the Company business
      to a particular supplier.  To avoid  both  the reality and the appearance
      of  improper  relations  with  suppliers  or  potential   suppliers,  the
      following standards apply to the receipt of gifts or entertainment:

            You  may  not  solicit  gifts,  gratuities,  or  any other personal
      benefit  or  favor  of any kind from any supplier or potential  supplier.
      Gifts  include  not only  merchandise  and  products  but  also  personal
      services, theater  tickets,  and  tickets  to  sporting events.  Gifts of
      money may not be accepted.

            Associates may accept unsolicited non-money gifts provided they are
            items   of  nominal  intrinsic  value,  such  as   advertising   or
            promotional materials, clearly marked with company and brand names.
            Any other  gifts  shall  be  considered property of the Company and
            should  be  delivered  to  your  department   Vice   President  for
            appropriate handling.

            The  Company's General Counsel should be consulted where  gifts  of
      more than nominal  value  are  offered to you by a company with which the
      Company does business.

            You  should  not  encourage  or   solicit  entertainment  from  any
      individual   or   company   with   which  the  Company   does   business.
      Entertainment includes, but is not limited  to, activities such as dinner
      parties, theater parties or sporting events.

            From  time  to time you may accept unsolicited  entertainment,  but
      only under the following conditions:

            The acceptance will foster goodwill and successful business
            relations;

            The entertainment occurs infrequently;

            It involves reasonable, not lavish, expenditures; and

            The  entertainment   takes   place  in  settings  that  are
                  appropriate and fitting to associates and their hosts.

            If  you  are uncertain about the appropriateness  of  the  business
      entertainment, you  should  review  the  matter with your department Vice
      President.




      G.    USE OF AGENTS AND NON-EMPLOYEES

            You may not use agents or others to circumvent the law or to engage
      in practices that run contrary to this Code.


III.  ACCURACY OF PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS

      All Company associates are encouraged and  instructed to provide reliable
and  accurate data to, and otherwise assist the Company's  Senior  Officers  as
they discharge  their responsibilities of establishing and maintaining adequate
and effective disclosure  controls and procedures.  These controls are designed
to provide assurances to the  Company  and its shareholders that disclosures of
material information related to the Company  and  its consolidated subsidiaries
in its periodic reports filed with, or submitted to,  the  SEC and other public
communications are full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable.

IV.   COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, RULES, AND REGULATIONS

      It  is  the Company's policy to proactively promote compliance  with  all
applicable laws,  rules  and  regulations  in  connection  with  the  Company's
business.   You and all other associates are expected to comply fully with  the
laws of each country or other jurisdiction that are applicable to the Company's
business.  You  should  familiarize  yourself  with  the  legal  standards  and
restrictions  applicable  to  your  assigned  duties and responsibilities.  The
Company requires and encourages compliance with  the  spirit,  as  well  as the
letter, of the law.  Even the appearance of illegal, dishonest or inappropriate
behavior could have a negative impact on the Company and its associates.

      If there is a conflict between the requirements of the laws applicable in
the United States and those of any other country or jurisdiction, the Company's
policy  is  that  you should consult with the General Counsel before taking any
actions that might violate United States law.

      A.    DEALINGS WITH PUBLIC OFFICIALS

            Laws and  regulations sometimes require associates to be in contact
      with public officials on a variety of matters.  Associates who make these
      contacts  have  a  special   responsibility   to   uphold  the  Company's
      reputation.

            If you have a business reason to contact public officials, you need
      to  understand  lobbying  laws and public disclosure requirements.   This
      information may be obtained from the Company's General Counsel.

            No form of payment, direct or indirect, shall be made to any public
      official as inducement to having a law or regulation enacted or defeated.

            From time to time associates  may  entertain  public officials, but
      only under the following circumstances:

            The entertainment is not solicited by the public official.

            The entertainment occurs infrequently.

            It does not involve lavish expenditures.

            The  setting  and  type  of  entertainment   is
                  appropriate  and  fitting  to  our  associates and the public
                  official.

      B.    APPLICATION OF THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT

            The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was enacted  in  1977 and amended
      in  1998 to penalize United States companies and their employees,  agents
      and consultants  for  bribing  or  attempting to bribe foreign officials,
      governments and political parties in  order  to  secure  business  or any
      improper  advantage.  Among other things, it made foreign bribery a crime
      and mandated  accounting  control  requirements  to  prevent off-the-book
      slush  fund payments, kickbacks and other forms of unlawful  or  improper
      renumeration.   While  certain  facilitating payments, where necessary to
      expedite or secure performance of  routine  governmental  actions outside
      the  United States, are not illegal, prior approval by senior  management
      must be obtained before a facilitating payment may be offered.

            Violations  of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act carry criminal and
      civil penalties.  Criminal  penalties  include fines up to $2,000,000 per
      company and $250,000 per individual, plus  a maximum imprisonment of five
      years.  The Company expects strict compliance  with  this  law as well as
      the other laws of the United States and of any foreign country  in  which
      the  Company  operates or conducts business.  Any uncertainties regarding
      the application  of  a  law,  whether  domestic  or  foreign,  should  be
      clarified with the Company's General Counsel.

      C.    POLITICAL ACTIVITIES AND CONTRIBUTIONS

            Federal  law and the statutes of most states prohibit a corporation
      from contributing  to  a  political  campaign  or  to  a political party.
      Improper corporate contributions could take the form of  use of corporate
      facilities (for example, use of a photocopy machine to reproduce campaign
      literature)  as  well  as  cash.  Associates who participate in  partisan
      political activities, you must  never imply that you speak or act for the
      Company.

            No corporate action, direct  or  indirect,  will  be  allowed  that
      infringes  on the right of each associate individually to decide whether,
      to whom, and  in  what  amount,  he  or  she will make personal political
      contributions of money or personal service.

V.    COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES

      Upon approval by the Board of Directors, a  copy  of  this  Code  will be
distributed  to  all  current associates.  Future associates will receive their
copies at the time of hire.

      You may be required to prepare a written disclosure if you have knowledge
of or are currently not  in  compliance  with  the  Code.   Subsequently,  upon
request  of  your supervisor, you may be required to correct the variance to be
in full compliance  with  the  Code.  A verification of compliance will then be
signed and turned in to your supervisor  who  will  make  it  a  part  of  your
permanent corporate records.

      To maintain compliance, you must read and develop an understanding of the
Code and agree to comply with it.  Supervisors will develop an awareness on the
part of their associates of the importance of adhering to the Code.  Associates
should  resolve  any doubts or questions pertaining to the Code with his or her
supervisor or, when appropriate, the General Counsel.  Associates should inform
his or her supervisor  of  any existing holdings or activities that might be or
may  appear  to be at variance  with  the  Code.   Senior  Officers  and  other
designated employees  will  annually acknowledge in writing their understanding
of the Code and their compliance with it.

      Senior Officers shall inform  the  Committee  of  any actual or potential
conflicts of interest, and the Committee will resolve any  questions  regarding
conflicts of interest involving any of the Senior Officers.

      Regular  audits  of the Company may include procedures to test compliance
with this Code.

VI.   REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS

      You should immediately report any suspected violation of the Code to your
supervisor or the Company's  General  Counsel  at  817-347-8244.   You may also
report a violation through the Bombay Careline (1-877-BOMBAY-7) on an anonymous
basis if you so choose.  Supervisors receiving such reports should promptly and
thoroughly  investigate  such  reports  and  consult with the Company's General
Counsel.   Any report of a disputed violation by  a  Senior  Officer  shall  be
immediately   reported  to  the  Committee.   If  a  violation  is  discovered,
appropriate corrective action will be taken promptly.

      The Company prohibits any kind of retaliation for good faith reporting of
actual or possible  violations  of  this Code.  Retaliation in any form against
any Company associate who reports a possible  violation  of  this  Code, or who
assists in the investigation of a possible violation of this Code, is  itself a
violation of this Code and will be disciplined appropriately.

VII.  ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ADHERENCE TO THIS CODE

      You and all other associates are individually responsible for adhering to
the  standards  set  forth  in  this Code.  The following types of conduct will
result in appropriate disciplinary actions:


   Violating this Code or asking others to violate this Code;

   Failing to report a known or suspected violation of this Code;

   Failing to cooperate in a Company investigation of possible
      violations of this Code;

   Failing to appropriately supervise subordinates in order to detect
      and report possible violations of this Code; and

   Retaliating against other Company personnel for reporting a possible
      violation of this Code.

Upon  receiving a report of a violation  of  this  Code,  the  supervisor,  the
Company's  General  Counsel,  or  the  Committee, including its legal and other
advisors, will have the full power and authority  to investigate the report and
to determine what steps, if any, should be taken to  resolve  the  problem  and
avoid  the  likelihood  of its recurrence.  These steps may, where appropriate,
include the termination of  an  individual's  employment by the Company and the
commencement of appropriate legal proceedings.

period covered by this annual report based on such evaluation; and

   c)  Disclosed in this annual report any change in the registrant's  internal
control  over  financial  reporting  that occurred during the registrant's most
recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an
annual  report)  that  has materially affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely  to
materially affect, the registrant's  internal control over financial reporting;
and

5. The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our
most recent evaluation of internal control  over  financial  reporting,  to the
registrant's  auditors  and  the  audit  committee of the registrant's board of
directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

   a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
       operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
       reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
       record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

   b) Any fraud, whether or not material,  that  involves  management  or other
employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting.
