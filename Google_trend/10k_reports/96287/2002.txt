                                  PART I
ITEM 1. Business.

(a) General Development of Business

The  Bombay Company, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the  "Company"
or  "Bombay")  design, source and market a unique line of home accessories,
wall  decor  and furniture through a network of retail locations throughout
the United States and Canada, through specialty catalogs, over the internet
and internationally through licensing arrangements.

Bombay's  unique  position in the market place is  a  result  of  its  core
competencies in design and sourcing.  Approximately 80% of its  product  is
sourced  from over 20 foreign countries.  Over 95% of the product has  been
designed or styled to Bombay's specifications.

To  capitalize  on  its strengths in design and sourcing,  the  Company  is
developing  other  business opportunities in addition to  its  core  retail
operations. Bailey  Street  Trading  Company,  the  Company's   wholesale
operations, was introduced  in  Fiscal  2000  and  reached   sales   of
approximately $2 million in Fiscal 2001.  Bailey Street is proving to be  a
viable, low-risk growth vehicle for the Company, with sales projected at $5
million for Fiscal 2002.

International  expansion has progressed with licensed international  stores
currently  operating  in the Dominican Republic, Puerto  Rico  and  Kuwait.
There are commitments with the Company's current international licensees to
open  three  additional stores in Fiscal 2002 including  one  each  in  the
Dominican Republic, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  The Company plans to continue
expansion  abroad through licensing and distribution agreements in  markets
identified as appropriate for the Bombay brand.

In  the third quarter of Fiscal 2001, the Company launched Bombay KIDS, its
new  line of children's furniture, textiles and accessory collections, with
initial offerings  exclusively  through  separate  catalog  and  internet
channels.  During Fiscal 2002, Bombay KIDS will be tested in several retail
stores with the first opening in Dallas, TX in March.

To  date, the operations and financial results of the wholesale operations,
international licenses and Bombay KIDS have been immaterial to the  Company
as  a  whole.   Unless specified otherwise, the discussions in this  Annual
Report on Form 10-K relate to the Bombay retail operations.

 (b) Financial Information About Segments

The  Company operates primarily in one business segment consisting  of  the
retail sale of decorative home furnishings, furniture and related items.


(c) Narrative Description of Business

Merchandise Sales, Purchasing and Distribution

Bombay operates a chain of stores, located primarily in regional  shopping
malls, certain secondary malls and selected urban and suburban  locations.
As  of February 2, 2002, there were 365 Bombay stores in 41 states in  the
United States  and  54  stores in nine Canadian  provinces.   Bombay  also
markets its products through its mail order operations in the United States
and Canada and through   e-commerce   over   the    internet    at
www.bombaycompany.com.

The   Company  offers  a  diverse  selection  of  products  consisting   of
approximately 5,000 SKUs  (stock keeping units) of which over  95%  of  the
product  has been designed or styled to Bombay's specifications.   Bombay's
proprietary product offers unique design, quality and exceptional value  to
a   wide  audience  of  consumers.   While  furniture  has  always  been  a
significant  part  of the business and will continue to play  an  important
role  in  the  merchandise assortment, more focus  has  recently  and  will
continue  to  be given to the smaller "take with" items such  as  wood  and
decorative accessories, crystal, florals, candles and a wide assortment  of
gift items.

The Company regularly updates its merchandise assortment by introducing new
products  and discontinuing others as they approach the end of  their  life
cycles.   Approximately 2,600 new SKUs were introduced in both Fiscal  2001
and  Fiscal  2000.   Typically, new product introductions are  concentrated
during  the  Company's spring, fall and Christmas marketing  periods.   The
principal categories of merchandise include the following:

<PAGE> 3

Furniture  -  This  category includes both wood and metal ready-to-assemble
furniture focusing on the bedroom, living room, dining room and home office
as  well as occasional pieces.  Furniture represented 43%, 45% and  45%  of
total  sales  in  Fiscal  2001,  2000  and  1999,  respectively.   Bombay's
furniture is manufactured by contract manufacturers located principally  in
China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Indonesia, India and  the
United States.

Accessories  - This is the broadest category and represented 43%,  41%  and
40%  of  total  sales  in Fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999,  respectively.   This
category  includes  both  functional and decorative  accessories  including
lamps, jewelry and memorabilia boxes, baskets, candles and scents, crystal,
ceramics, frames and desktop, textiles, floral and holiday.  The items  are
imported from over 15 countries in Asia, North America and Europe.

Wall  Decor  - This category includes prints, mirrors and wall  accessories
which represented 14%, 14% and 15% of total sales in Fiscal 2001, 2000  and
1999,  respectively.  This merchandise is sourced primarily from the United
States, various countries in Asia, Canada and Italy.

Merchandise is manufactured to Company specifications through a network  of
contract  manufacturers  located principally in  Asia  and  North  America.
Approximately  80% of production needs are provided from foreign countries.
Branch  offices located in Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, China  and  Vietnam
and  agents  in  various countries locate prospective  vendors,  coordinate
production requirements with manufacturers and provide technical  expertise
and quality control.

Bombay  is  not  dependent  on any particular supplier  and  has  had  long
standing relationships with many of its vendors.  Approximately 70% of  the
Company's   merchandise   requirements  are   supplied   by   35   contract
manufacturers  in seven countries.  No long-term production agreements  are
in  place;  however, agreements are in place with major manufacturers  that
prohibit   the  production  of  proprietary  product  for  other   parties.
Additional  manufacturing capacity and alternative sources,  both  domestic
and  international,  continue to be added through  new  vendors  and  plant
expansions by existing vendors.  The Company does business with its vendors
principally  in United States currency and has not historically experienced
any material difficulties as a result of any foreign political, economic or
social instabilities.

Usually it takes several months from the time a merchandise order is placed
with   a   manufacturer  until  the  goods  are  received  at   centralized
distribution  centers in the United States and Canada.   Depending  on  the
category,  the  source country and whether an item is new  or  a  reordered
product,  lead times can vary from as little as two months to  as  much  as
twelve  months  from order placement until arrival at  the  stores.   Order
times are slightly less for North American manufacturers principally due to
shorter  shipping  times.  Lead times may also be impacted  by  seasonality
factors  especially in months when manufacturers are producing at  or  near
peak  capacity  to meet seasonal demands.  As a result, Bombay  strives  to
maintain  an  adequate  inventory position in its distribution  centers  to
ensure a sufficient supply of products to its customers.

Store  inventories  are  replenished  from  regional  distribution  centers
located   in   Fort   Worth,   Texas;  Atlanta,   Georgia;   Gilbertsville,
Pennsylvania;  Mira  Loma,  California  and  Mississaugua,  Ontario.    The
distribution  centers are strategically located and provide the  capability
to  replenish the majority of store inventories within 48 hours of when the
order  is  processed.   The Company uses dedicated  trucks  and  less-than-
truckload  carriers to transport its product from its distribution  centers
to the stores.

Channels of Distribution

Stores and Real Estate

The  Company  locates  its  stores primarily in  regional  shopping  malls,
certain  secondary  malls  and selected urban and suburban  locations  that
satisfy   its  demographic  and  financial  return  criteria.   Significant
attention  is  given to visual merchandising opportunities to maximize  the
ability to display product in the most attractive setting.

In selecting store locations, the Company's real estate department conducts
extensive analyses of potential store sites and bases its selection on  the
performance of other specialty retail tenants, the size of the  market  and
the  demographics of the surrounding area.  In evaluating a store location,
placement  of  the store relative to retail traffic patterns  and  customer
base   of   other   retailers  in  the  nearby   vicinity   are   important
considerations.

During  Fiscal 2000, the Company, working closely with Thompson Associates,
the  largest, independent full-service retail-consulting firm in the United
States  specializing  in store location and market  research,  developed  a
comprehensive real estate strategy.  Based upon the analysis,  the  Company
believes  that it has the opportunity to increase its total square  footage
through  both an increase in store counts and through larger  stores.   The
strategy  incorporates  an off-mall opportunity that  will  complement  the
current real estate portfolio.  Currently 83% of the stores are mall based,
down  from  approximately 90% last year, reflecting the  Company's  current
real  estate strategy.  The Company has opened stores in, and will continue

<PAGE> 4

to  seek  alternative  locations including street  and  upscale,  open  air
lifestyle  centers.   The  Company  will  seek  out  the  most  potentially
profitable locations for the opening of new stores regardless of the venue.

The Company is currently targeting store sizes in the 4,000 to 5,000 square
foot range.   In addition to building new stores, the Company will continue
to   selectively  convert  its  existing  regular  stores   which   average
approximately  1,800 square feet to the larger format.  As of  February  2,
2002, there were 59 regular stores left in the chain.

During Fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company opened 32 new stores, 10 new
stores  and  19  new stores, respectively.  An additional  18  stores  were
converted to the larger format in Fiscal 2001, 20 in Fiscal 2000 and 11  in
Fiscal 1999.  The store expansion plan includes approximately 25 new  store
openings and four to six conversions in Fiscal 2002.

During  Fiscal  2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company's store openings  included
twelve,  four  and eight outlet stores, respectively, which were  typically
located in traditional outlet malls.  At February 2, 2002, the store  chain
included a total of 36 outlet stores.  The Company views the use of outlets
as an opportunity to increase sales to a different customer base, to assist
in  the  orderly clearance of merchandise and to further capitalize on  its
strength  in designing and sourcing proprietary product.  Of the  estimated
25  stores  planned  for Fiscal 2002, Bombay expects to open  approximately
seven outlet locations.

The  Company's average cost of leasehold improvements, furniture,  fixtures
and  machinery for stores (excluding outlets) opened or converted in Fiscal
2001,  net of landlord allowances, was approximately $220,000 per store  or
$55  per  square  foot.   In  addition,  other  investments  which  consist
primarily  of  inventory  in  the  store location,  averaged  approximately
$115,000   per   large  format  store.  The  average  cost   of   leasehold
improvements, furniture, fixtures and machinery for outlet stores opened in
Fiscal  2001,  net  of landlord allowances, was approximately  $95,000  per
store  while  the inventory investment averaged approximately  $80,000  per
store.  Bombay stores typically achieve store level operating profitability
during their first year of operations.

As  of  February  2, 2002, 365 stores were operating in 41  states  in  the
United  States and 54 stores were operating in nine provinces in Canada  as
illustrated in the map below.

<PAGE> 5

Internet

The  Company has maintained a conservative posture on its investment in the
internet.  The current site utilizes IBM's net.commerce software running on
an  AS400  platform and is designed to be scaleable in order to respond  to
the  growing e-commerce demand.  Typically, the Company offers up to  1,200
SKUs  for  sale on its website each season.  Business to consumer  revenues
over  the internet were approximately $4.5 million in Fiscal 2001  and  are
expected  to grow to approximately $8 million in Fiscal 2002.  The  Company
is  also developing supporting websites to support its international growth
and wholesale distribution business.

Wholesale

During  Fiscal  2000, the Company created a new wholesale division,  Bailey
Street  Trading Company.  The brand is separate from Bombay and allows  the
Company to capitalize on its strengths in product design and sourcing.  The
initial  product offerings are focused on furniture but may be expanded  to
include  wall  decor and accessories in the future.  Bailey Street  Trading
Company  distributes  its merchandise to specialty gift  stores,  furniture
stores, department stores, customer-direct merchants and mass merchandisers
through a network of independent regional sales representatives.  To  date,
the  operations and financial results of Bailey Street Trading Company have
been immaterial to the Company as a whole.

International

International  expansion has progressed with licensed international  stores
currently  operating  in the Dominican Republic, Puerto  Rico  and  Kuwait.
There are commitments with the Company's current international partners  to
open  three  additional stores in Fiscal 2002 including  one  each  in  the
Dominican Republic, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  The Company plans to continue
expansion  abroad through licensing and distribution agreements with  local
partners  in  markets  identified  as appropriate  for  the  Bombay  brand,
limiting the Company's risk and capital requirements.

Intangibles

The  Company owns a number of the trademarks and service marks used in  its
business,  including  federal  registrations  for  the  marks  "The  Bombay
Company"  and  "Bombay", and the palm tree logo.  The Company's  trademarks
are  also registered or are the subject of pending applications in a number
of  foreign countries.   Each registration is renewable indefinitely if the
mark is still in use at the time of renewal.  Appropriate applications  are
on file for the new wholesale business.

The  Company believes that its trademarks have significant value  and  that
these  marks enhance the Bombay brand and are instrumental in the Company's
ability to create, sustain demand for and market its product.  From time to
time,   the  Company  discovers  products  in  the  marketplace  that   are
counterfeit  reproductions  of  the Company's  product  or  that  otherwise
infringe  upon  trademark or tradedress rights held by  the  Company.   The
Company  has  and  will continue to vigorously defend it rights  under  the
marks as necessary.

Seasonality

Operating  results  are subject to seasonal variation.   Historically,  the
largest  proportion of sales and substantially all of the income occurs  in
the  fiscal quarter that includes the Christmas season.  Inventory balances
are  generally built to their highest levels prior to the Christmas selling
season.   Inventories decline and cash balances increase  significantly  in
December due to the Christmas business.

Competition

The   home   furnishings  and  decorative  accessories  market  is   highly
fragmented.    The   Company  faces  competition  from  furniture   stores,
department stores and other specialty retailers.  The Company believes that
it  competes  primarily on the basis of selection,  quality  and  value  of
merchandise.

<PAGE> 6

Employees

The  Company has approximately 5,000 employees, which include approximately
3,000  part-time  employees,  and is not a party  to  any  union  contract.
Employee relations are considered to be good.

Leases  generally have 10 year terms, expiring between 2002 and 2013.   The
store leases are generally based upon a minimum rental plus a percentage of
the  store sales in excess of specified levels. Store lease terms generally
require additional payments covering taxes, common area charges and certain
other  costs. Rental expense for Fiscal 2001, Fiscal 2000 and  Fiscal  1999
totaled $47,366,000, $45,137,000 and $42,991,000, respectively.

The  minimum rental commitments for future fiscal years are as follows  (in

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
           Results of Operations.

General

The Bombay Company, Inc. ("Company" or "Bombay") designs, sources and
markets a unique line of home accessories, wall decor and furniture through
419 retail stores in 42 states in the United States and nine Canadian
provinces, through specialty catalogs and over the Internet in the U.S. and
internationally.  Merchandise is manufactured to Company specification
through a network of contract manufacturers located principally in Asia and
North America.

In addition to its primary retail operations, the Company has several other
initiatives underway. Bailey Street Trading Company ("Bailey Street")
represents the Company's wholesale operations, begun in Fiscal 2000.
Bailey Street reached the $2 million sales mark in Fiscal 2001 and is
proving to be a viable, low-risk growth vehicle for the Company. Sales are
projected at $5 million for 2002 and modest, positive earnings per share
contributions are expected as early as the current year.

International expansion has progressed with licensed international stores
currently operating in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Kuwait.
There are commitments with the Company's current international partners to
open three additional stores in Fiscal 2002 including one each in the
Dominican Republic, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The Company plans to continue
expansion of the Bombay brand abroad through licensing and distribution
agreements with local partners in various markets, limiting the Company's
risk by initially entering smaller, opportunistic markets with growth
potential.

Finally, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2001, the Company launched Bombay
KIDS ("KIDS"), its new line of children's furniture, textile and accessory
collections, with initial offerings exclusively through separate catalog
and Internet channels. During Fiscal 2002, KIDS will be tested in several
retail stores.

The largest percentage of the Company's sales and operating income is
realized in the fiscal quarter that includes December (Christmas season).

Because the majority of the Company's products are proprietary, the impact
of inflation on operating results is typically not significant. The Company
attempts to alleviate inflationary pressures by increasing selling prices
(subject to competitive conditions), improving designs and finding
alternative production sources in lower cost countries.

The Company has a retail (52-53 week) fiscal year which ends on the
Saturday nearest January 31.  Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 1999 represent 52 week
periods while Fiscal 2000 included 53 weeks.

Net Revenues

Net  revenues  consist  of sales to retail customers  and  wholesale  sales
through  Bailey  Street  and  to our international  licensees  as  well  as
shipping fees. Shipping fees reflect revenue from customers for delivery of
merchandise.  Wholesale sales are immaterial for all periods,  representing
less than 1% of total revenue and as such are not separately reported.

</TABLE>


Fiscal 2001

Net revenues increased $14.0 million, or 3%, to $437.5 million, compared
to $423.5 million in Fiscal 2000 primarily due to new store openings.
During the year, the Company opened 32 new stores, including 12 outlets,
and 18 regular stores were converted to the large store format. These
increases were partially offset by the closure of 21 stores.  Same store
sales (stores in existence for one year or more) declined 2% for the year.
The lack of a 53rd week during Fiscal 2001 adversely impacted sales
comparisons by approximately 2%.  At the end of Fiscal 2001, the Company
had 324 large stores, 59 regular stores and 36 outlets resulting in a 10%
increase in retail square footage.

Our customer's resistance to big-ticket purchases during the year resulted
in a shift in the overall product mix. Furniture sales were 43% of the
total during Fiscal 2001 compared to 45% in Fiscal 2000. Accessories
represented 43% in the current year compared to 41% last year, while wall
decor (principally prints, mirrors and sconces) accounted for 14% in both
years. Total transactions for the year increased 2% while the average
ticket remained constant at $79. The growth in the accessories business
resulted in an increase in the average number of items per transaction year
over year, offsetting the impact of shifts in the product mix.

All regions of the U.S. and Canada reported low single-digit same store
sales declines for the year. Outlet stores continued to perform well during
Fiscal 2001, reporting low single-digit same store sales gains.

Fiscal 2000

Net revenues increased $30.9 million, or 8%, to $423.5 million, compared to
$392.6 million in Fiscal 1999. Sales increases were attributable to a 5%
increase in same store sales. A 53rd week in the Fiscal 2000 calendar added
less than 2% to the total sales increase. Sales increases were also
realized with the opening of 10 new stores during the year and the
conversion of another 20 regular stores to the larger store format. These
increases were partially offset by the closure of 17 stores which were
either under-performing or at the end of their lease lives. On a net basis,
the number of stores went from 415 at the end of Fiscal 1999 to 408 at the
end of Fiscal 2000, including 291 large stores, 93 regular stores and 24
outlet stores, while total retail square footage increased approximately
2.5%.

Sales growth was fairly consistent across all categories with the product
mix remaining virtually unchanged. Sales in Fiscal 2000 consisted of 45%
furniture, 41% accessories and 14% wall decor. In Fiscal 1999 the product
mix was 45% furniture, 40% accessories and 15% wall decor. The number of
transactions increased by 9% and the average ticket remained virtually
unchanged at $79.

Same store sales gains were strongest in the Company's Canadian subsidiary,
with other strong performances in the western and northeastern portions  of
the  U.S.  All regions reported positive or flat same store sales.  Outlets
also  performed  well,  driven by the continued  infusion  of  outlet  only
merchandise.

</TABLE>


Fiscal 2001

Cost of sales, including buying and store occupancy costs, for Fiscal 2001
was $313.5 million or 71.7% of revenues.
As a percentage of revenues, these costs increased from 69.4% of revenues
in Fiscal 2000. Product margins declined 130
basis points as a result of the more promotionally driven retail
environment. Same stores sales declines which contributed to a lower sales
per square foot resulted in negative leverage of the buying and occupancy
costs. These costs were 20.4% of revenues, an increase of 90 basis points
compared to the prior year. Buying and occupancy costs included an
impairment charge of $715,000 to write down the fixed assets related to
eleven unprofitable stores.

Fiscal 2000

Cost of sales, including buying and store occupancy costs, for Fiscal 2000
was $294.0 million or 69.4% of revenues. As a percentage of revenues, these
costs decreased from 70.2% of revenues in Fiscal 1999. Product margins
improved 20 basis points from the prior year due to an improved product mix
and good in-stock positions of key merchandise, more than offsetting higher
distribution center and domestic freight costs. Buying and occupancy costs
declined 60 basis points to 19.5% of revenues while increasing $3.4
million. The higher dollar costs were primarily driven by investments in
new stores and technology. The improvement in buying and occupancy costs as
a percentage of revenues is due to the relatively fixed nature of these
costs measured against a higher revenue base.


Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Fiscal 2001

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $117.6 million compared
to $115.6 million in Fiscal 2000. Although the dollars increased $2.0
million or 1.8%, as a percentage of revenues, selling, general and
administrative costs declined from 27.3% in Fiscal 2000 to 26.9% in Fiscal
2001. The 40 basis point decline is the result of strong controls over
expenses throughout the year.

Fiscal 2000

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $115.6 million, an
increase of $9.6 million or 9%, compared to $106.0 million in Fiscal 1999.
The largest component of the dollar increase was higher payroll and related
costs. However, as a percentage of revenues these costs remained relatively
constant. The Company's investments in infrastructure and technology also
contributed to higher selling, general and administrative expenses with
increased depreciation, amortization and related costs. As a percentage of
revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 27.0%
in Fiscal 1999 to 27.3% in Fiscal 2000.

<PAGE> 13

Interest

Fiscal 2001

The Company had interest income of $248,000 and interest expense of
$566,000, compared to interest income of $967,000 and interest expense of
$424,000 in Fiscal 2000. Changes in interest amounts resulted from lower
average cash balances and greater utilization of credit facilities due to
the Company's lower operating profits, higher average inventory levels and
capital  expenditures.

Fiscal 2000

The Company had interest income of $967,000 and interest expense of
$424,000, compared to interest income of $1.1 million and interest expense
of $59,000 in Fiscal 1999.  The changes in these amounts are due to lower
average cash balances and greater utilization of seasonal borrowings to
support the Company's investments in store expansion, infrastructure and
technology, the stock repurchase program and higher inventory levels.

Income Taxes

The Company provided income taxes of $2.3 million, $5.8 million and  $4.8
million in Fiscal 2001, Fiscal 2000 and Fiscal 1999, respectively. The
effective rates were 38.6%, 40.0% and 39.6% in the respective periods.
Fluctuations in the effective rate are primarily related to foreign taxes
which change in accordance with earnings in the Canadian subsidiary and in
state tax expenses which have not changed proportionately to income before
income taxes.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

The primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from
operations and a line of credit with banks.
The Company has an unsecured, revolving credit agreement with a group of
banks, with an aggregate commitment of up to $50.0 million for working
capital and letter of credit purposes. The bank commitment is limited to
45% of eligible inventory. At February 2, 2002, the bank commitment was
$40.2 million, and $32.5 million was available for borrowings or additional
letters of credit. The credit facility expires June 5, 2002. The Company
expects to be able to renew or replace its current facility under similar
or more favorable terms upon expiration.

Fiscal 2001

At February 2, 2002, cash and short-term investments were $38.4 million,
$16.3 million higher than at February 3, 2001. The primary sources of cash
were net income, including non-cash depreciation and amortization expense,
and decreases in inventory levels. These sources were partially offset by
capital expenditures for store construction and routine equipment
purchases.

At February 2, 2002, inventory levels were $15.1 million lower than at the
previous year end reflecting the Company's conservative balance sheet
management during the second half of the year in light of economic
uncertainties and the events of September 11th. The lower inventory levels
resulted in less clearance product as of the end of the year and are
expected to contribute to improved gross margins and inventory turns for
Fiscal 2002. Capital expenditures totaled $14.1 million and included the
costs of 32 new stores and the conversion of 18 regular stores to the
larger format, as well as continued investments in software and equipment.
The capital expenditures program for Fiscal 2002 is planned at
approximately $12 million and includes approximately 25 store openings,
including 7 outlets and 6 KIDS stores. Additionally, approximately 4 to 6
stores are expected to be converted to the larger format.  Generally, a new
or converted store is profitable in its first full year of operations.

The Company's development of its wholesale business and international
opportunities are expected to have modest capital requirements during
Fiscal 2002. The Company anticipates funding the growth of these
initiatives through working capital.

In connection with continuing operations, the Company has various
contractual obligations and commercial commitments requiring payment in
future periods, summarized in the table below.

The Company did not incur any direct losses or significant expenses in
connection with the events of September 11, 2001. However, as a result of
those events and the surrounding economic uncertainties, the Company took a
conservative approach to managing its balance sheet. Inventory levels were
more tightly managed and less new product was introduced during January and
February 2002, which may have adversely impacted sales. After the first
quarter of Fiscal 2002, inventory receipts are expected to return to more
normalized levels and the Company expects the negative trend in same store
sales to reverse.

The Company believes that its current cash position, cash flows from
operations and credit line facilities will be sufficient to fund its
current operations and capital expenditures program.

Fiscal 2000

As of February 3, 2001, cash and short-term investments were $22.2 million,
a decrease of $17.0 million from January 29, 2000. The primary uses of cash
were inventory purchases, new store construction and information technology
upgrades, as well as purchases of treasury stock. These uses were partially
offset by net income, including non-cash depreciation and amortization
expense, and by increases in payables.

At February 3, 2001, inventory levels were $14.3 million higher than at
January 29, 2000, an increase of 16% compared to an 8% growth in sales.
Several factors contributed to this increase. Spring product arrived
earlier than in the previous year in order to ensure a good in-stock
position for the introduction of the catalog in early March.

Additionally, the timing of Chinese New Year shifted from February to
January resulting in more of this season's inventory requirement being
shipped just prior to the Company's fiscal year end. Finally, the inventory
mix changed with a larger investment in bedroom furniture and a refined
furniture assortment, which resulted in higher average price per unit.
Capital expenditures totaled $16.7 million and included the costs of 10 new
stores and the conversion of 20 regular stores to the larger format, as
well as routine purchases of machinery and equipment.

During Fiscal 2000, the Company spent $10.3 million under its stock
repurchase program to acquire approximately 3.0 million shares of the
Company's common stock.


Critical Accounting Policies

In the course of preparing the financial statements, management makes
certain judgments relative to accounting policies that are appropriate in
the circumstances and the application of those policies. The following
policies are those deemed to be most critical.

Inventory Valuation Policy

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost being
determined based upon the weighted average inventory method. Cost is
calculated based upon the actual landed cost of an item at the time it is
received in the warehouse based upon actual vendor invoices or estimates of
costs for which an invoice is not present or for which an allocation of
shared costs is required.
In addition, the Company includes the cost of warehousing and transporting
product to the stores in its costs.

The Company regularly evaluates its compliance with the lower of cost or
market principle. Items are evaluated by SKU (stock keeping unit) and to
the extent that the cost of the item exceeds the current selling price,
provision is made to reduce the carrying cost of the item. Additionally,
the Company reviews the aging of its inventory by SKU. The carrying cost of
the item is reduced based upon certain age criteria and product category.
Since the determination of carrying value of inventory involves both
estimation and judgment of cost and market value, differences in these
estimates could result in valuations that vary from the recorded asset.

<PAGE> 15

Each month, the Company records an allowance for shrinkage to provide for
the cost of lost or stolen inventory. The amount of the allowance is
determined based upon the historical shrinkage results and is adjusted at
least annually to reflect current circumstances.  Inventory is physically
counted at all locations at least once each year, at which time actual
results are reflected in the financial statements. Physical counts were
taken at all stores and the distribution centers during January 2002.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed at least annually and whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may
not be recoverable. This review includes the evaluation of individual under
- -performing retail stores and assessing the recoverability of the carrying
value of the fixed assets related to the store. Future cash flows are
projected for the remaining lease life considering such factors as future
sales levels, gross margins, changes in rent and other expenses as well as
the overall operating environment specific to that store. If the future
undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, a
charge is recorded to write down the cost of the assets. Since the
projection of future cash flows involves judgment and estimates,
differences in circumstances or estimates could produce different results.

During Fiscal 2002, the Company will adopt the provisions of Statement of
Accounting Standards No.144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-
Lived Assets ("FAS 144"). FAS 144 modifies previous guidance on the
impairment of long-lived assets. Among other provisions, it permits the use
of a probability-weighted estimation approach in evaluating future cash
flows for a group of assets. The impact of the adoption of FAS 144 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

Deferred Taxes

The Company currently has recorded $9.7 million of deferred tax assets
representing the difference between the timing of deductions taken for
financial statement purposes and for tax purposes. Underlying the
assumption that the benefit of those assets will be recoverable in some
future period is the concept that the Company will have future taxable
income. If future conditions indicate that the benefit of the deferred tax
assets will not be fully realized, a valuation allowance will be recorded
to reduce the assets to their estimated realizable value.

Insurance

The Company is self-insured with respect to medical and dental insurance
coverage offered to its eligible employees, up to a maximum of $125,000 per
claim. Above that amount, medical insurance coverage is in place. In
connection with the self-insured portion, the Company maintains a liability
for claims that are in the process of being paid and those that have been
incurred but not yet reported to the Company's insurance carrier. The
amount of the liability is estimated based upon historical claims
experience and upon information provided by the Company's independent
benefits broker regarding other similar insurance programs. At February 2,
2002, the balance of the medical and dental liability was $1.4 million.

Beginning in Fiscal 2001, the Company also maintains workers' compensation
insurance coverage with a deductible of $100,000 per claim. At February 2,
2002, the Company has a liability of $644,000 representing the estimated
amount that will have to be paid in future periods related to the
settlement of claims under the insurance policy. The amount of the
liability reflects expected remaining workers' compensation claims based
upon historical claims experience and other information obtained by the
Company, including projections made by the underwriters of the Company's
insurance carrier. As these claims are paid, the liability will be reduced.
Furthermore, the liability will be adjusted if circumstances change or if
information becomes available that would indicate that the future payments
would be different than what was previously estimated. Prior to Fiscal
2001, the Company's workers' compensation insurance was not subject to a
deductible.

Since the amounts recorded for insurance liabilities are based upon various
estimates, actual future requirements could vary from the recorded
liabilities.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated financial  statements  listed  in  the
accompanying index on page 20 present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial  position  of The Bombay Company, Inc. and  its  subsidiaries  at
February  2, 2002 and February 3, 2001, and the results of their operations
and  their  cash  flows for each of the three years  in  the  period  ended
February  2,  2002,  in  conformity  with accounting  principles  generally
accepted  in  the United States of America. These financial statements  are
the  responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility  is  to
express  an  opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We
conducted  our  audits  of  these statements in  accordance  with  auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America which  require
that  we  plan  and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance  about
whether  the  financial  statements are free of material  misstatement.  An
audit  includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and  disclosures  in  the  financial statements, assessing  the  accounting
principles   used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,   and
evaluating  the overall financial statement presentation. We  believe  that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

                Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


Note 1 - Statement of Accounting Policies
______________________________________________________________

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions, balances and profits have been eliminated. The Company has a
retail (52 - 53 week) fiscal year which ends on the Saturday nearest
January 31. The periods ended February 2, 2002 ("Fiscal 2001") and January
29, 2000 ("Fiscal 1999") represent 52 weeks. The period ended February 3,
2001 ("Fiscal 2000") represents 53 weeks. Certain prior year amounts have
been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of the Company's Canadian operations is the
Canadian dollar. Fiscal year end exchange rates are used to translate
assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars. Monthly average exchange rates are
used to translate income and expenses. The cumulative effect of foreign
currency translation adjustments is reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash in stores, deposits in banks and short-term investments with original
maturities of three months or less are considered as cash and cash
equivalents for the purposes of the financial statements. Short - term
investments are recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value.

Inventories

Inventories are primarily finished merchandise and are valued at the lower
of cost or market, cost being determined based upon the weighted average
inventory method.

Property and Equipment

Property  and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives  of
the assets using the straight - line method over the lives shown:

     Building                  Forty years
     Furniture and equipmen    Two to ten years
     Leasehold improvements    The lesser of the life of the lease or asset

Maintenance  and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.  Renewals  and
betterments  which materially prolong the useful lives of  the  assets  are
capitalized.  The  cost  and related accumulated depreciation  of  property
retired  or  sold are removed from the accounts, and gains  or  losses  are
recognized in the statements of income.

Capitalized Software Costs

The Company capitalizes certain external and internal costs associated with
computer software and significant enhancements to software features of
existing products, after technological feasibility has been established.
The costs are amortized utilizing the straight-line method over the
estimated economic lives of the software, which range from three to seven
years. Total costs capitalized were $18,703,000 and $17,287,000 at February
2, 2002 and February 3, 2001, respectively. Accumulated amortization
related to these assets was $12,517,000 and $9,103,000 in Fiscal 2001 and
Fiscal 2000, respectively.

<PAGE> 27

Goodwill

Goodwill recorded in association with acquisitions accounted for using the
purchase method is amortized using the straight - line method over the
estimated useful life of 40 years.

Effective February 3, 2002, the Company will adopt the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Accounting for
Goodwill and Other Intangibles ("FAS 142"). FAS 142 establishes accounting
and reporting standards for the valuation and impairment of goodwill and
other intangible assets.  The adoption of FAS 142 is not expected to have a
material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results
of operations. With the adoption of FAS 142, the Company will cease
amortization of goodwill.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, including goodwill, are reviewed whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may
not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the expected future
undiscounted net cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets.
The amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between
carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets.

Effective February 3, 2002, the Company will adopt the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ("FAS 144"). FAS 144 modifies
previous guidance on the impairment of long-lived assets.  Among other
provisions, it permits the use of a probability-weighted cash flow
estimation approach in assessing the expected future undiscounted net cash
flows for a group of assets. The impact of the adoption of FAS 144 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed
or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenues are net
of returns and exclude sales tax.

The Company includes in revenues amounts collected from customers for
shipping and handling orders. In Fiscal 2001, Fiscal 2000 and Fiscal 1999,
these revenues totaled $2,779,000, $1,945,000 and $1,697,000, respectively.
The associated shipping and handling expenses are included in cost of
sales.

Gift Certificates

Proceeds from the sale of gift cards and certificates are recorded as a
liability at the time they are received. When the holder of the card or
certificate redeems it for merchandise, the liability is relieved and
revenue is recognized.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed the first time the advertising takes place.
During Fiscal 2001, Fiscal 2000 and Fiscal 1999 advertising expense was
$14,597,000, $14,701,000 and  $14,645,000, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of computing deferred income taxes on
all material temporary differences. Temporary differences are the
differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
their tax bases. The Company assesses realizability of deferred tax assets
and, if necessary, a valuation allowance is provided.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income represents the change in equity (net assets) of a
business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and
circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity
during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and
distributions to owners. Such amounts are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity and consist of the
cumulative effect of foreign currency translation adjustments.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share are based upon the weighted average number of
shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are based upon the weighted
average number of shares outstanding plus the shares that would be
outstanding assuming exercise of dilutive stock options and distribution of
deferred director compensation.

The computations for basic and diluted earnings from continuing operations
per share are as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Note 2 - Store Impairments and Closing Liability

Long-lived assets are reviewed at least annually and whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be
recoverable. Following the holiday selling season, the Company reviewed its
real estate portfolio focusing on stores for which store profitability was
negative. Of the 419 Company owned stores open as of February 2, 2002, eleven
stores were identified for which the expected undiscounted future cash flows
were less than the net book value of the fixed assets related to those stores.
As a result of the review, the Company has recorded a charge to buying and
occupancy costs of $715,000 to write down the assets to fair value.

The Company has established a liability for obligations associated with closing
under-performing stores.  At February 2, 2002 and February 3, 2001, the
liability was $342,000 and $715,000, respectively.  Costs of $373,000 and
$222,000 were charged against the liability in Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000,
respectively.

Note 4 - Debt
______________________________________________________________

The Company has an unsecured, revolving credit agreement with a group of
banks, with an aggregate commitment of up to $50,000,000. The credit
facility is available for working capital and letter of credit purposes.
Borrowings under the facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at
either the lead bank's prime lending rate plus a margin of 0% to .5% or the
LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.0% to 2.0%, with the margin depending on the
Company's leverage ratio. Under terms of the agreement, the Company is
required to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial
conditions. The agreement prohibits the Company from making certain
investments, advances or loans and limits the dollar amounts of capital
expenditures, purchases of treasury shares, cash dividends and asset sales.
In the event that the Company is in default of certain provisions of the
agreement, the lenders would be permitted to file liens against the
Company's inventory located in the United States and perfect the pledge of
65% of the stock of the Company's Canadian subsidiary, thereby securing the
indebtedness. The agreement expires June 5, 2002 and is expected to be
renewed under similar terms.

The bank commitment is limited to 45% of eligible inventory. At February 2,
2002,  the  bank  commitment was $40,210,000. Letters  of  credit  totaling
$7,726,000  were  outstanding  under  the  facility,  and  $32,484,000  was
available for borrowings or additional letters of credit. Interest  expense
and  negotiated fees for Fiscal 2001, Fiscal 2000 and Fiscal  1999  totaled
$884,000, $610,000 and $257,000, respectively.

<PAGE> 30

Note 5 - Commitments and Contingencies
_____________________________________________________________

Store, distribution and field office facilities and equipment are leased
under operating leases expiring through 2013. The store leases are
generally based upon a minimum rental plus a percentage of  the store sales
in excess of specified levels. Store lease terms generally require
additional payments covering taxes, common area charges and certain other
costs. Rental expense for Fiscal 2001, Fiscal 2000 and Fiscal 1999 totaled
$47,366,000, $45,137,000 and $42,991,000, respectively.

The  minimum rental commitments for future fiscal years are as follows  (in

The Company has certain contingent liabilities resulting from litigation
and claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Management believes
that the probable resolution of such contingencies will not materially
affect the financial position or results of operations of  the Company.

The Company is party to employment agreements with certain executives which
provide for compensation and certain other
benefits. The agreements also provide for severance payments under certain
circumstances.

Note 6 - Employee Benefit Plans
_____________________________________________________________

The Bombay Company, Inc. Employee 401(k) Savings and Stock Ownership Plan
("401(k) Plan") is open to substantially all employees who have been
employed for one year and who work at least 1,000 hours per year. Under the
401(k) Plan, a participant may contribute up to 15% of earnings with the
Company matching 100% of the initial 3% contribution, and 50% of the next
2% contributed by the participant.  Participant contributions and Company
match are paid to a corporate trustee and invested in various funds or
Company stock, as directed by the participant. Company matching
contributions made to participants' accounts are fully vested immediately.
Similar benefit plans are in effect for eligible foreign employees.

To the extent employees are unable to contribute up to 5% of their earnings
to the 401(k) Plan because of limitations imposed by IRS regulations, a
Supplemental Stock Program was adopted. Under this program, employee
contributions in excess of IRS limitations, along with Company matching
contributions, are distributed annually in the form of Company common
stock.

The Bombay Company, Inc. Stock Purchase Program ("SPP") is open to all full-
time employees who have at least 90 days of service. Each participant may
contribute 1% to 10% of qualifying compensation, to a maximum annual
contribution of $21,250. Contributions are used to purchase shares of
Company common stock at a discount of 15% from current market rates. The
participants' shares are fully vested upon purchase.  Participants' shares
are held by a third-party administrator until the respective participant
requests a distribution.

Total Company contributions to these plans for Fiscal 2001, Fiscal 2000 and
Fiscal 1999 were $644,000, $738,000 and $480,000, respectively.

<PAGE> 31

Note 7 - Common Stock and Stock Options
_______________________________________________________________

The Company's Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program
to purchase up to an aggregate of $30 million of the Company' stock. The
shares may be purchased from time to time, through open market purchases
and privately negotiated transactions.  During Fiscal 2001, Fiscal 2000 and
Fiscal 1999, 39,000, 3,039,550, and 1,777,416 shares, respectively, were
acquired at an aggregate cost of $103,000, $10,303,000 and $8,527,000,
respectively.  Treasury shares are used for various employee and director
stock plans as the need arises.

Non - employee directors are eligible to participate in the Non-Employee
Director Equity Plan, which allows such directors the option to defer
receipt of retainer payments and meeting fees which are credited to an
account for such director in units equivalent to Company common stock.

The Bombay Company, Inc. 1986 Stock Option Plan and 1996 Long Term
Incentive Stock Plan ("Employee Plans") provide for the granting of options
(and other types of stock-related awards under the 1996 plan) to officers
and key management employees. At February 2, 2002, the option shares
reserved for the Employee Plans were 5,633,595. The option price is fixed
at the market price or higher on the date of the grant. Options are
generally exercisable annually at a rate of 33% per year beginning one year
after the grant date. Shares available for additional grants were
1,459,552; 1,732,538 and 2,046,273 at February 2, 2002, February 3, 2001
and January 29, 2000, respectively.

During Fiscal 1998, restricted stock aggregating 90,000 shares was granted
under the 1996 Long Term Incentive Stock Plan to three key executives. The
respective shares are issuable in designated increments contingent upon
continued employment of the respective executive after 12 months, 24 months
and 36 months. During Fiscal 2001, Fiscal 2000 and Fiscal 1999, 49,500,
27,500 and 13,000 shares, respectively, became vested and were issued under
these grants.  Compensation expense of $13,000, $98,000 and $174,000 was
recognized during Fiscal 2001, Fiscal 2000 and Fiscal 1999, respectively,
in connection with the restricted stock.

During Fiscal 2001, restricted stock aggregating 200,000 shares was granted
and issued under the 1996 Long Term Incentive Stock Plan to three key
executives.  The respective shares become vested in designated increments
contingent upon continued employment of the respective executive after 12
months, 24 months and 36 months.  If each of the executives remains
employed by the Company under the terms of the grant, 40,000, 60,000 and
100,000 shares will be vested in Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2004,
respectively.  Compensation expense of $285,000 was recognized during
Fiscal 2001 in connection with the restricted stock.

The  Bombay  Company,  Inc. Non-Employee Director  Equity Plan ("Director
Plan")  provides  for the granting of options to members of  the  Board  of
Directors  who  are  neither  employees nor officers  of  the  Company.  At
February  2,  2002, the option shares reserved for the Director  Plan  were
745,267. The option price is fixed at the market price on the date  of  the
grant.  The  option grant, initial and annual, is currently the  lesser  of
8,000   shares  or  $75,000  in  face  value.  The  initial  grant  becomes
exercisable  at a rate of 20% per year beginning one year after  the  grant
date.  Each  additional annual grant becomes fully exercisable  six  months
after  the grant date. Shares available for additional grants were 354,210,

The exercise of non-qualified stock options in Fiscal 1999 resulted in
income tax benefits of $25,000 which were credited to additional paid-in
capital. The income tax benefits are the tax effect of the difference
between the market price on the date of exercise and the option price.

The  Company  has  adopted the disclosure-only provisions of  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 123,  Accounting  for  Stock  -  Based
Compensation  ("FAS  123").  Accordingly, no  compensation  cost  has  been
recognized  for  options granted. Had compensation cost for  the  Company's
stock  option  plans been determined based on the fair value at  the  grant
date  for awards in Fiscal 1995 through Fiscal 2001 in accordance with  the
provisions  of  FAS 123, the Company's net income  and earnings  per  share
would  have  been  reduced  to the pro forma amounts  indicated  below  (in

Note 8 - Shareholders' Rights Plan
_______________________________________________________________

The Company has a shareholders' rights plan under which each share of
Company common stock includes one Preferred Share Purchase Right ("Right")
entitling the holder to buy one one-thousandth of a share of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Company at an exercise price of
$50. The Rights, which have ten year terms expiring in 2005, are
exercisable if a person or group acquires 15% or more of the common stock
of the Company or announces a tender offer for 15% or more of the common
stock. If a person or group acquires 15% or more of the outstanding common
stock of the Company, each Right will entitle the holder to purchase, at
the Right's exercise price, a number of shares of Company common stock
having a market value of twice the Right's exercise price. If the Company
is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a
person or group acquires 15% or more of the Company's common stock, each
Right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the Right's exercise price, a
number of shares of the acquiring company's common stock having a market
value of twice the Right's exercise price. The Rights are redeemable at one
cent per Right at any time before they become exercisable.

Note 9 - Stock Purchase Loans
______________________________________________________________

On August 26, 1999, the Board of Directors adopted an executive stock
purchase program as a vehicle to enable executive officers to increase
their ownership in the Company by purchasing Company stock, further
aligning the interests of the officers with those of the shareholders.
Under the program, certain key executive officers may be given the
opportunity to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at market
prices from time to time over a specified period of time, and the Company
will finance 100% of the purchase price of such stock. The unsecured, full
recourse loans bear interest at Applicable Federal Rates and have due dates
ranging from August 31, 2002 to May 31, 2003. At February 2, 2002 and
February 3, 2001, $846,000 and $931,000, respectively, were outstanding
under these terms, and the notes receivable are reflected as a reduction in
stockholders' equity. Of the total, $43,000 was used to purchase shares
through open market transactions while the remainder was purchased from the
Company's treasury at then current market prices.  The shares purchased
from the Company are unregistered and, therefore, are restricted when
received by participants. During Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000, $53,000 and
$60,000, respectively, in interest income was recognized related to the
loans.



Note 10 - Geographic Areas

                         EXHIBIT 10(i)


                    The Bombay Company, Inc.

                      Amended and Restated
            2001 Non-Employee Directors' Equity Plan


                          Introduction

      The  Bombay  Company, Inc. Amended and Restated  2001  Non-
Employee  Directors' Equity Plan (the "Plan") is  hereby  adopted
effective as of February 1, 2001 to amend and restate The  Bombay
Company,  Inc.  2000  Non-Employee Directors'  Equity  Plan  (the
"Original  Plan"), which was adopted to continue the purposes  of
the   expiring  1991  Directors'  Stock  Option  Plan  that   was
originally adopted by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of The
Bombay Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),  on
August  14,  1991, and approved by shareholders on  November  12,
1991, and subsequently amended by shareholder approval on October
13,  1994, and further amended by the Board on March 1, 1998  and
on April 17, 1998 and again by shareholders on May 21, 1998.  The
Original Plan incorporated and superseded the 1993 Stock Deferral
Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which was originally adopted  by
the  Board  on  August 5, 1993 and approved  by  shareholders  on
October 13, 1993, and subsequently amended by the Board on  March
12,  1997.  The Plan was subsequently amended by the Board on May
17, 2001.

1.   Purpose

      (a)  The purpose of the Plan is to provide a means by which
each member of the Board who is not an employee of the Company or
of any Affiliate (each such person being hereafter referred to as
a  "Non-Employee  Director")  will be  given  an  opportunity  to
purchase common stock of the Company.  The Plan also permits Non-
Employee Directors to elect to receive their annual and Committee
Chair  retainer fees and meeting attendance fees in the  form  of
common stock of the Company or to defer such payments.  The  word
"Affiliate"  as used in the Plan means any person or entity  that
directly  or  indirectly,  through one  or  more  intermediaries,
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with,  the
Company.

      (b)  The Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to retain the
services  of  persons now serving as Non-Employee  Directors,  to
secure  and retain the services of persons capable of serving  in
such  capacity,  and to provide incentives for  such  persons  to
exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company.

2.   Administration

      (a)  The Plan shall be administered by the Board unless and
until  the  Board  delegates administration to  a  committee,  as
provided in paragraph 2(c).

      (b)  The Board shall have the power, subject to, and within
the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan:

           (i)   To  construe and interpret the Plan and  options
granted under it ("Options"), and to establish, amend and  revoke
rules and regulations for its administration.  The Board, in  the
exercise  of  this  power, may correct any  defect,  omission  or
inconsistency in the Plan or in any Option agreement, in a manner
and  to  the extent it shall deem necessary or expedient to  make
the Plan fully effective;

           (ii)  To  amend,  suspend or  terminate  the  Plan  as
provided in paragraph 12; and

           (iii)      Generally, to exercise such powers  and  to
perform  such  acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient  to
promote the best interests of the Company.

      (c)  The Board may delegate administration of the Plan to a
committee  (the "Committee") composed of not fewer than  two  (2)
members of the Board who are "non-employee directors" under  rule
16b-3  promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  as
amended  (the  "Exchange Act"), as such  rule  may  be  hereafter
amended.   If  administration is delegated to  a  Committee,  the
Committee  shall  have, in connection with the administration  of
the Plan, the powers theretofore possessed by the Board, subject,
however,   to  such  resolutions,  not  inconsistent   with   the
provisions  of the Plan, as may be adopted from time to  time  by
the  Board.  The Board may abolish the Committee at any time  and
revest in the Board the administration of the Plan.

3.   Shares Subject to the Plan

      (a)  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 11 relating  to
adjustments  upon changes in stock, the stock that  may  be  sold
pursuant to Options or used to pay Fees (as defined below)  shall
not  exceed  in  the  aggregate Five Hundred  Thousand  (500,000)
shares  of  the  Company's  common stock,  plus  (i)  any  shares
available  for  delivery under the 1991 Directors'  Stock  Option
Plan  and  1993  Stock  Deferral Plan for Non-Employee  Directors
which  have  not  been committed for delivery by grants  made  or
stock  units  credited under either of such plans, and  (ii)  any
shares  subject  to options granted under either  of  such  plans
which  are  settled, forfeited, expired or canceled  without  the
delivery of shares.  If any Option shall for any reason expire or
otherwise  terminate without having been exercised in  full,  the
stock not purchased under the Option shall again become available
for issuance pursuant to the Plan.

      (b)  All stock sold or otherwise delivered pursuant to  the
Plan shall be treasury shares.

4.   Eligibility

     Only Non-Employee Directors may participate in the Plan.

5.   Non-Discretionary Option Grants

      (a)  Each person who is elected for the first time to be  a
Non-Employee Director shall, upon the date of his or her  initial
election  to  be  a  Non-Employee Director by the  Board  or  the
shareholders  of the Company, be granted an Option  (an  "Initial
Option")  to  purchase the lesser of (i) Eight  Thousand  (8,000)
shares  of common stock of the Company or (ii) a number of shares
of  common  stock of the Company having an aggregate Fair  Market
Value  on  the date of grant of $75,000 (rounded to  the  nearest
whole  number of shares), on the terms and conditions  set  forth
herein.   "Fair  Market Value" shall mean the last reported  sale
price of shares of the Company's common stock as reported on  the
applicable  stock exchange on the relevant date of valuation  or,
if  there is no such sale, the last reported sale price  of  such
shares so reported on the nearest preceding date upon which  such
a sale took place.

      (b)   On the third business day following issuance  of  the
Company's  annual  earnings release each year  each  Non-Employee
Director  shall  be  granted an Option (an  "Annual  Option")  to
purchase  the  lesser  of (i) Eight Thousand  (8,000)  shares  of
common  stock of the Company or (ii) a number of shares of common
stock of the Company having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the
date of grant of $75,000 (rounded  to the nearest whole number of
shares) on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

     (c)   The  Company intends that the Options not be incentive
stock options as that term is used in Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

6.   Option Provisions

     Each   Option   shall  contain  the  following   terms   and
conditions:

      (a)  No Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of
ten (10) years from the date it was granted.

      (b)   The per share exercise price of each Option shall  be
one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of the common
stock of the Company on the date the Option is granted.

      (c)   The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to  the
exercise  of an Option shall be paid, to the extent permitted  by
applicable  statutes and regulations, either (i) in cash  at  the
time the Option is exercised; (ii) by delivery to the Company  of
shares  of common stock of the Company valued at the Fair  Market
Value  of  such  shares on the date of exercise; or  (iii)  by  a
combination of such methods of payment.

      (d)  The Board or the Committee, as applicable, may, in its
sole  discretion,  provide  in  any  Option  agreement  (or   any
amendment  to  any  existing  Option agreement)  such  provisions
regarding transferability of the Option as the Committee  or  the
Board, as applicable, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.

      (e)   Options shall vest with respect to each  optionee  as
follows:    (i)  the  Initial  Option  shall  vest   and   become
exercisable  at  the rate of 20% per year over a  five  (5)  year
period after the grant date of the Initial Option, and (ii)  each
Annual  Option shall vest in full and become exercisable six  (6)
months  after the grant date of the Annual Option; provided  that
in  each case the optionee has, during the entire period prior to
such   vesting   date,  continuously  served  as  a  Non-Employee
Director, whereupon such Option shall become fully exercisable in
accordance  with its terms with respect to that  portion  of  the
shares represented by that installment; and provided further that
in  the  event  of  a  conflict between the  provisions  of  this
paragraph 6(e) and the provisions of paragraph 6(l) or 6(m),  the
provisions  of  paragraph  6(l) or  6(m),  as  applicable,  shall
control.

      (f)  The Company may require any optionee, or any person to
whom  an  Option  is  transferred  under  paragraph  6(d),  as  a
condition  of  exercising any such Option:  ()  to  give  written
assurances  satisfactory  to the Company  as  to  the  optionee's
knowledge  and experience in financial and business matters,  and
() to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating
that such person is acquiring the stock subject to the Option for
such  person's own account and not with any present intention  of
selling or otherwise distributing the stock.  These requirements,
and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, shall  be
inoperative  if (i) the issuance of the shares upon the  exercise
of  the  Option  has  been  registered  under  a  then-currently-
effective  registration statement under  the  Securities  Act  of
1933,  as  amended  (the "Securities Act"), or  (ii)  as  to  any
particular  requirement, a determination is made by  counsel  for
the  Company  that  such  requirement need  not  be  met  in  the
circumstances under the then-applicable securities laws.

      (g)   Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary  contained
herein,  an  Option may not be exercised unless the  issuance  of
shares upon exercise of the Option has been registered under  the
Securities  Act or, if such issuance has not been so  registered,
the  Company  has determined that such issuance would  be  exempt
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

     (h)  Neither an optionee nor any person to whom an Option is
transferred under paragraph 6(d) shall be deemed to be the holder
of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any
shares  subject to such Option unless and until such  person  has
satisfied all requirements for exercise of the Option pursuant to
its terms.

      (i)   Nothing  in  the  Plan or in any instrument  executed
pursuant  hereto shall confer upon any Non-Employee Director  any
right  to continue in the service of the Company or any Affiliate
or  shall  affect  any  right  of the  Company,  the  Board,  its
shareholders or any Affiliate to terminate the service of any Non-
Employee Director with or without cause.

      (j)   No Non-Employee Director, individually or as a member
of  a group, and no beneficiary or other person claiming under or
through him or her, shall have any right, title or interest in or
to  any  shares  of the Company's common stock reserved  for  the
purposes of the Plan except as to such shares of common stock, if
any,  as  shall have been reserved for such Non-Employee Director
pursuant  to  an Option granted to him or her or pursuant  to  an
election of such Non-Employee Director pursuant to paragraph 9 or
10.

     (k)  In connection with each Option, it shall be a condition
precedent to the Company's obligation to issue or transfer shares
to  a  Non-Employee  Director  that  such  Non-Employee  Director
acknowledge full responsibility for any federal or other tax with
respect to such issuance or transfer.

      (l)  If a Non-Employee Director shall terminate performance
of  services for the Company because of death or disability,  all
Options  outstanding as to such Non-Employee  Director  shall  be
fully exercisable, at any time, or from time to time, within  the
longer of (i) one (1) year after the date of death or termination
of  performance  of services because of disability  or  (ii)  the
exercise  period  presented in the second sentence  of  paragraph
6(m); provided that in no event shall such Options be exercisable
later  than  the expiration date specified pursuant to  paragraph
6(a).   In the case of death, exercise may be made by the  person
or  persons to whom the Non-Employee Director's rights under  the
Option  pass by will or applicable law, or if no such person  has
such   rights,  by  the  Non-Employee  Director's  executors   or
administrators; provided that such person(s) consent  in  writing
to  abide  by  and be subject to the terms of the  Plan  and  the
Option.

     (m)  If a Non-Employee Director's performance of services for the
Company  shall  terminate  for any reason  other  than  death  or
disability,  all  Options  outstanding as  to  such  Non-Employee
Director shall at the time of such termination, to the extent not
otherwise  exercisable, become immediately  exercisable  for  the
purchase  of  the full number of shares subject to such  Options;
provided that the Non-Employee Director has at the time  of  such
termination completed at least five (5) years of service  on  the
Board.  A departing Non-Employee Director shall have twelve  (12)
months  to exercise vested Options for each full three  (3)  year
term  and  any  partial term served on the Board,  to  a  maximum
exercise  period of thirty-six (36) months; provided that  in  no
event shall such Options be exercisable later than the expiration
date specified in paragraph 6(a).

7.   Covenants of the Company

     (a)  During the terms of the Options, the Company shall keep
available  at all times the number of shares of its common  stock
required to satisfy its obligations under such Options.

     (b)  So long as any Stock Units (as defined below) are in an
Account  (as defined below), the Company shall keep available  at
all  times  the number of shares of its common stock required  to
satisfy its obligations in respect of such Stock Units.

8.   Use of Proceeds from the Exercise of Options

      Proceeds  from  the  exercise of Options  shall  constitute
general funds of the Company.

9.   Payment of Fees in Common Stock

     (a)  A Non-Employee Director may elect to receive payment of
all  or  any portion of his or her annual retainer and  Committee
Chair retainer fees ("Retainer Fees") and meeting attendance fees
("Meeting Fees") (Retainer Fees and Meeting Fees are referred  to
collectively herein as "Fees") from the Company in  the  form  of
common stock of the Company.  Such an election shall be effective
with  respect  to  Fees payable commencing with the  next  fiscal
quarter  following  the  date of the election.   An  election  to
receive payment of Fees in the form of the Company's common stock
may  be  revoked only by a subsequent election to receive payment
of  Fees in cash or to defer such Fees pursuant to paragraph  10.
Such  election  shall be effective with respect to  Fees  payable
commencing  with  the  next fiscal quarter.  Notwithstanding  the
above,  no  election  permitted in  this  paragraph  9  shall  be
effective if such election would cause the payment of Fees in the
Company's common stock to be a non-exempt purchase under Rule 16b-
3  promulgated  under  the Exchange Act  or  terminate  the  Non-
Employee Director's status as a non-employee director under  Rule
16b-3, unless approved by the Board or the Committee.  The number
of  shares  of the Company's common stock to be paid  to  a  Non-
Employee  Director shall be determined by dividing the amount  of
Fees  payable  by  the Fair Market Value of the Company's  common
stock on the date such Fees would have been paid in cash but  for
the  Non-Employee Director's election to receive payment of  such
Fees  in the form of common stock of the Company.  The amount  of
any fractional share shall be paid in cash.

      (b)  If a Non-Employee Director has elected to receive  his
or  her  Fees  in  the form of common stock  of  the  Company,  a
certificate for the number of shares of common stock to which the
Non-Employee  Director is entitled shall be  issued  as  soon  as
reasonably  practicable following the date  the  director  is  to
receive the Fees.

10.  Deferral of Fees

     (a)  Commencing on the effective date of the Plan, payment of all
or  a portion of the Fees may be deferred by election of the Non-
Employee  Director  (a "Deferral Election").  Deferral  Elections
shall  be  made  on an annual basis; provided that such  election
shall satisfy the requirements of Rule 16b-3(d) promulgated under
the Exchange Act, as such rule may be hereafter amended.

      (b)  Amounts deferred pursuant to paragraph 10(a) shall  be
credited  at  the  end of each fiscal quarter  to  a  bookkeeping
reserve  account ("Account") maintained by the Company  in  stock
units  ("Stock Units"). The number of Stock Units credited to  an
Account  with  respect  to  any Non-Employee  Director  shall  be
determined by dividing the amount of Fees to be deferred  by  the
Fair  Market Value of the Company's common stock on the date such
Fees would have been paid in cash but for the Deferral Election.

      (c)   All Stock Units credited to a Non-Employee Director's
Account  pursuant to the Plan shall be at all times fully  vested
and nonforfeitable.

      (d)   Stock  Units  credited to a  Non-Employee  Director's
Account  shall be payable in an equal number of shares of  common
stock  of the Company in a single distribution made at such  time
as   may  be  specified  by  the  Non-Employee  Director  in  the
applicable   Deferral  Election;  provided  that  the  designated
payment  date with respect to any Deferral Election  must  be  no
earlier  than  the  first  day of the  calendar  year  after  the
calendar year in which the Fees would have been received but  for
the Deferral Election.  The amount of any fractional shares shall
be paid in cash.

     (e)  The Company shall issue and deliver to the Non-Employee
Director  a  certificate for the number of shares of  its  common
stock  due  such director as payment for Stock Units as  soon  as
practicable following the date on which Stock Units are payable.

      (f)   The  Plan  shall  be unfunded  with  respect  to  the
Company's  obligation to pay any amounts due  pursuant  to  Stock
Units,  and  a  Non-Employee Director's  rights  to  receive  any
payment of any Stock Unit shall be not greater than the rights of
an unsecured general creditor of the Company.

      (g)  Except as otherwise provided herein or approved by the
Board, the right to receive payment with respect to a Stock  Unit
is not assignable or transferable and shall not be subject to any
encumbrances,  liens,  pledges or  charges  of  the  Non-Employee
Director  or his or her creditors.  Any such attempt  to  assign,
transfer or hypothecate any Stock Unit or any right to receive  a
Stock Unit shall be void and of no force and effect whatsoever.

      (h)  A Non-Employee Director may designate a beneficiary or
beneficiaries  to receive any distributions under the  Plan  upon
his or her death.

      (i)   In the event a cash dividend is declared with respect
to  the Company's common stock, the Account of each participating
Non-Employee  Director shall be credited with a number  of  Stock
Units determined as follows: First, calculate the product of  (i)
the  cash  dividend payable with respect to each share of  common
stock  and (ii) the total number of Stock Units credited  to  the
Account  as  of  the record date for such dividend;  and  Second,
divide  such  product by the Fair Market Value of  the  Company's
common stock on the payment date for such dividend.

11.  Adjustments upon Changes in Stock

      If  any  change is made in the stock of the Company through
merger,  consolidation,  reorganization, recapitalization,  stock
dividend,  dividend  in property other than  cash,  stock  split,
liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of  shares,
change  in  corporate structure or otherwise, the Plan (including
the  total number of shares and kind of shares issuable under the
Plan  and  the  number of shares issuable pursuant to  grants  of
Options),  outstanding  Options (including  the  exercise  prices
thereof)  and Stock Units will be appropriately adjusted  by  the
Board  to account for the change.  The Options granted under  the
Plan  and the Stock Units created pursuant to the Plan shall  not
affect  in  any  way the right or power of the Company  to  issue
additional  common  stock or other securities, make  adjustments,
reclassifications,  reorganizations  or  other  changes  in   its
corporate,  capital or business structure, to  participate  in  a
merger, consolidation or share exchange or to transfer its assets
or dissolve or liquidate.

12.  Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan

     The  Board  may at any time, and from time to  time,  amend,
suspend  or terminate the Plan; provided that no amendment  shall
be  effective unless approved by the shareholders of the  Company
to  the extent the Board determines shareholder approval of  such
amendment  is  necessary or desirable; and provided further  that
rights  and  obligations under any Option granted or  Stock  Unit
credited  or  to be credited before any amendment, suspension  or
termination of the Plan shall not be altered or impaired by  such
amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan except with  the
consent  of  the person to whom the Option was granted  or  Stock
Unit credited.

13.  Changes  of  Control, Acceleration of Right to Exercise  and
     Distribution of Stock Units

     (a)  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or in an agreement
evidencing any Option to the contrary, in the event a  Change  of
Control (as defined below) occurs, then each Option shall  become
immediately  exercisable, on the date of the occurrence  of  such
Change  of Control, for the purchase of the full number of shares
subject to such Option for a period not to exceed the shorter  of
thirty-six  (36)  months or the remaining  life  of  the  Option;
provided  that immediately after the consummation of a Change  of
Control as defined under paragraph 13(b)(iii), all Options shall,
to the extent not previously exercised, terminate and cease to be
outstanding  except  to  the  extent  assumed  by  the  successor
corporation  (or  an  affiliate thereof) or  otherwise  expressly
continued in full force and effect pursuant to the terms  of  the
Change   of  Control.   In  addition,  and  notwithstanding   the
provisions  of  paragraph 10(d), all Stock Units credited  to  an
Account  for  a Non-Employee Director shall, on the date  of  the
occurrence of a Change of Control, be immediately payable to such
director  in  the form of shares of common stock of  the  Company
equal  in  number to the Stock Units held as of the date  of  the
Change of Control.

     (b)  "Change of Control" shall mean the occurrence of any of
the following events:

           (i)  the acquisition, other than from the Company,  by
any  individual, entity or group (within the meaning  of  Section
13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) of beneficial ownership
of  20%  or more of either the then outstanding shares of  common
stock  of  the Company or the combined voting power of  the  then
outstanding  voting securities of the Company  entitled  to  vote
generally  in  the  election  of  directors;  provided  that  any
acquisition  by  the Company or any of its subsidiaries,  or  any
employee  benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company  or  its
subsidiaries, or any corporation with respect to which  following
such  acquisition,  more  than 50%  of,  respectively,  the  then
outstanding  shares of common stock of such corporation  and  the
combined  voting power of the then outstanding voting  securities
of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly,  by
all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were
the  beneficial  owners, respectively, of the  common  stock  and
voting  securities  of  the  Company immediately  prior  to  such
acquisition  in  substantially  the  same  proportion  as   their
ownership,  immediately prior to such acquisition,  of  the  then
outstanding shares of common stock of the Company or the combined
voting  power  of the then outstanding voting securities  of  the
Company  entitled to vote generally in the election of directors,
as the case may be, shall not constitute a Change of Control;

            (ii)   individuals  who,  as  of  February  1,  2001,
constituted  the  Board  (the "Incumbent Board")  cease  for  any
reason  to constitute at least a majority of the Board;  provided
that  any individual becoming a director subsequent to such  date
whose  election,  or  nomination for election  by  the  Company's
shareholders,  was approved by a vote of at least a  majority  of
the  directors  then  comprising the  Incumbent  Board  shall  be
considered  as  though  such individual  were  a  member  of  the
Incumbent  Board,  but  excluding, for  this  purpose,  any  such
individual  whose initial assumption of office is  in  connection
with  an  actual or threatened election contest relating  to  the
election of the directors of the Company (as such terms are  used
in  rule  14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange
Act); or

          (iii)     approval by the shareholders of the Company of a
reorganization,  merger or consolidation of the Company  and  the
satisfaction  of all conditions precedent to the transaction,  in
each case, with respect to which the individuals and entities who
were  the  respective beneficial owners of the common  stock  and
voting  securities  of  the  Company immediately  prior  to  such
reorganization,  merger or consolidation do not,  following  such
reorganization,   merger  or  consolidation,  beneficially   own,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of, respectively, the  then
outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting  power
of  the  then  outstanding  voting securities  entitled  to  vote
generally  in the election of directors, as the case may  be,  of
the  corporation  resulting from such reorganization,  merger  or
consolidation,  or a complete liquidation or dissolution  of  the
Company  or  of  the  sale  or  other  disposition  of   all   or
substantially all of the assets of the Company.

     (c)   With  respect to a Change of Control as defined  under
paragraph  13(b)(iii),  if  the  timing  and  mechanics  of   the
transaction constituting the Change of Control will be such  that
the holders of Options will not have a reasonable opportunity  to
exercise  their Options prior to the applicable record date  with
respect  to, or the date of consummation of, as applicable,  such
transaction,  the  Board or officers of the  Company  shall  make
arrangements  in  the  agreement related to such  transaction  to
allow holders of Options to receive the same economic benefit the
holders  of  the  Options  would have received  had  the  holders
exercised  their  Options prior to the  effective  date  of  such
Change  of  Control and held the shares of common  stock  of  the
Company  issuable  upon  exercise  of  such  Options  as  of  the
applicable  record  date  with  respect  to,  or  the   date   of
consummation of, as applicable, the transaction constituting such
a Change of Control.

14.  Effective Date of Plan

     The Plan shall be effective as of February 1, 2001.

                 DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT
                           pursuant to
                    THE BOMBAY COMPANY, INC.
             2001 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR EQUITY PLAN

     This Option Agreement (The "Agreement") is made this _____
day of  ________, 2002, between THE BOMBAY COMPANY, INC., a
Delaware Corporation (the "Company"), and  ________________, a
director of the Company (the "Director").

     WHEREAS, the Company desires to carry out the purposes of
The Bombay Company, Inc. 2001 Non-Employee Director Equity Plan
(the "Plan") by affording Director the opportunity to purchase
shares of the Company's $1.00 par value common stock.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants
hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable
consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1.   Grant of Option.  The Company hereby grants to Director
the right and option (the "Option") to purchase an aggregate of
8,000 shares of the Company's $1.00 par value common stock (the
"Shares"), such Shares being subject to adjustment as provided in
paragraph 8 hereof, and on the terms and conditions herein set
forth.  The 8,000 Shares are granted as a nonqualified option not
entitled to special tax treatment under Internal Revenue Code
Section 422A.

     2.   Purchase Price.  The purchase price of the Shares
covered by the Option shall be $_________ per Share, such
purchase price being 100% of the fair market value of such Shares
on  _____________, 2002 (the "Date of Grant").

     3.   Exercise of Option.  Unless expired as provided in
paragraph 5 below, and subject to the special provisions of
paragraph 6 below, the Option may be exercised from time to time
in whole or in part at any time after the completion of six (6)
months following the Date of Grant.

     4.   Manner of Exercise; Payment of Purchase Price.

          A.   Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Option shall be exercised by written notice to the
Company at its principal office.  Such notice shall state the
election to exercise the Option and shall specify the number of
Shares sought to be exercised pursuant to the notice.  Such
notice of exercise shall be signed by Director and shall be
irrevocable when given.

          B.   The Notice of exercise shall be accompanied by the
full payment, in cash, of the purchase price for the Shares or by
tendering Shares owned by Director to the Company with a fair
market value equal to the purchase price for the Shares or by a
combination of such methods of payment.

          C.   Upon receipt of the purchase price, and subject to
the terms of paragraph 11, the certificate or certificates
representing the Shares exercised shall be registered in the name
of the person or persons so exercising the Option.  If the Option
shall be exercised by Director and, if Director shall so request
in the notice exercising the Option, the Shares shall be
registered in the name of Director and another person, as joint
tenants with right of survivorship, and shall be delivered as
provided above to or upon the written order of the person or
persons exercising the Option.  In the event the Option shall be
exercised pursuant to paragraph 7 hereof, by any person or
persons other than Director, such notice shall be accompanied by
appropriate proof satisfactory to the Company of the right of
such person or persons to exercise the Option.  All Shares that
shall be purchased upon the exercise of the Option as provided
therein shall be fully paid and non-assessable.

     5.   Expiration of Option. A departing Director shall have
twelve (12) months to exercise vested options for each full three
year term and any partial term served on the Board, to a maximum
exercise period of thirty-six (36) months.  In no event, however,
shall the period to exercise this option extend beyond the date,
which is ten (10) years after the Date of Grant.  Except as
provided in paragraph 6 below, only those portions of this option
exercisable as of the date Director ceases to serve as a Director
of the Company may be exercised, whether such termination is by
retirement or otherwise. Any option not exercised within the
permitted exercise period shall expire and become null and void.

     6.   Acceleration of Exercisable Dates.  Notwithstanding the
provisions of paragraph 3 above relating to the exercise of this
Option:  (a) upon Director's death or Disability this Option
shall be fully vested and immediately exercisable, until the
expiration date provided in paragraph 5 above, for the entire
number of Shares covered hereby; (b) upon Director's retirement,
or other termination or service, this Option shall be fully
vested and immediately exercisable, until the expiration date
provided in paragraph 5 above, for the entire number of Shares
covered hereby provided Director has completed at least five (5)
years service on the Board; and (c) upon any Change in Control of
the Company (as defined in the Plan) this Option shall be fully
vested and immediately exercisable for a period of the lesser of
thirty-six (36) months following the date of the Change of
Control or the remaining life of the option (which shall not
exceed 10 years from the Date of Grant), for the entire number of
Shares covered hereby.

     7.   Option Nontransferable.  Unless otherwise approved by
The Board of Directors of The Company, the Option and any right
related thereto shall not be transferable by Director otherwise
than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and may
be exercised, during Director's lifetime, only by Director.  Upon
the death of Director, the Option may be exercised by Director's
executor, administrator, legatee or distributee, as the case may
be, in accordance with paragraphs 4.C and 6.

     8.   Adjustments of Shares Subject to Option.  If the Shares
shall at any time prior to exercise be changed or exchanged by
reason of reorganization, merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, combination of
Shares or a dividend payable in stock, then the aggregate number
of Shares subject to this Agreement and the purchase price of
such Shares shall be automatically adjusted such that Director's
proportionate interest shall be maintained as before the
occurrence of such event.  The determination of any such
adjustment by the Administrative Committee shall be final,
binding and conclusive.

     9.   No Right to Continue as a Director.  This Agreement
does not constitute or be evidence of any agreement or
understanding, express or implied, that the Company will retain
Director for any period of time or at any particular rate of
compensation.

     10.  Rights as Shareholder.  This Option shall not entitle
Director or any permitted transferee to any rights of a
shareholder of the Company or to any notice of proceedings of the
Company with respect to any Shares issuable upon exercise of this
Option unless and until the Option has been exercised for such
Shares.

     11.  Restriction on Issuance of Shares.  The Company shall
not be required to issue or deliver any certificates for Shares
purchased upon the exercise of an Option prior to the obtaining
of any approval from any governmental agency which the Company
shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or
advisable, and the completion of any registration or other
qualification of such Shares under any state of federal law or
ruling or regulations of any governmental body which the Company
shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or
advisable.  In addition, if shares reserved for issuance upon
exercise of Options shall not then be registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 the Company may, upon Director's exercise
of the Option, require Director or his permitted transferee to
represent in writing that the Shares being acquired are for
investment and not with a view to distribution, and may mark the
certificate for the Shares with a legend restricting transfer and
may issue stop transfer orders relating to such certificate to
the transfer agent.

     12.  Binding Effect.  This Agreement shall be binding upon
the heirs, executors, administrators, and successors of the
parties hereto.

     13.  Governing Instrument and Law.  This Option and any
shares issued hereunder shall in all respects be governed by the
terms and provisions of the Plan, and by the laws of the State of
Texas, and in the event of a conflict between the terms of this
Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall
control.

                              THE BOMBAY COMPANY, INC.
