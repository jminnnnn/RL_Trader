ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General

    The Bombay Company, Inc. (the "Company") is a specialty retailer which
markets classic and traditional furniture, prints and accessories through a
network of 415 retail stores in the United States and Canada.  For financial
information by geographic areas, see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, located on page 23 of the 1997 Annual Report to Shareholders, filed
as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K Annual Report.  Such Exhibit is incorporated
herein by reference.
<F7>

Merchandise Sales, Purchasing and Distribution

    The Fiscal 1997 sales mix consisted of: 49% furniture, 26% accessories, 17%
wall decor (principally prints, mirrors and sconces) and 8% lamps and other
categories. Bombay products internally designed or styled represent
approximately 95% of total sales. During Fiscal 1997, the Company's merchandise
assortment consisted of approximately 3,000 SKU's.  The Company regularly
updates its merchandise assortment through introducing new products and
discontinuing others as they approach the end of their life cycles.  Offering
better selections by developing complete collections was a priority during
Fiscal 1997.  During the year, approximately 1,200 new SKU's were introduced as
compared to approximately 1,000 in Fiscal 1996.  The focus on product assortment
continues into Fiscal 1998, with an emphasis on enhancing our non-furniture
items as the Company attempts to attract more impulse buying.
    Merchandise is manufactured to Company specifications through a network of
contract manufacturers located principally in Asia and North America.
Approximately 60% of production needs are provided from overseas sources.
Branch offices located in Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and China and agents in
various countries locate prospective vendors, coordinate production requirements
with manufacturers, provide technical expertise and quality control.
    Approximately 75% of the Company's merchandise requirements are supplied by
35 contract manufacturers in eight countries.  Although no long-term production
agreements exist with manufacturers, there are long standing relationships with
many of the major vendors.  Formal agreements with major manufacturers are in
place which prohibit production of proprietary products for any other party.
Additional manufacturing capacity and alternative sources, both domestic and
international, continue to be added through new vendors and plant expansions by
existing vendors.
    Usually, it takes several months from the time a merchandise order is placed
with an overseas manufacturer until the goods are received at centralized
distribution centers.  Order lead times are slightly less for domestic
manufacturers principally due to shorter shipping time.  Lead times can vary
depending on seasonality factors especially in months when factories are
producing at or near peak capacity to meet seasonal demands.  While overseas
purchases are principally denominated in U.S. dollars, significant foreign
currency fluctuations could adversely affect the Company's ability to source
product in any one country.
    Store inventories are replenished from three distribution centers in the
United States and one in Canada.  The distribution centers are strategically
locatedoandsprovide thehcapabilityetoireplenishhthermajorityrofestore

Stores and Real Estate

    The stores offer a wide variety of attractively styled, ready-to-assemble
furniture, prints and accessories, with a strong emphasis on value and quality.
Significant attention is given to visual merchandising in order to display
products in the most attractive setting.
    To accommodate the increasing number of products, the Company introduced a
large format Bombay store in late fiscal 1992. The large format stores average  
4,000 square feet, while the regular stores average 1,700 square feet.
Presently, the Company's store opening program calls for large format stores
ranging in size from 2,500 to 3,500 square feet.  At January 31, 1998, 228 large
format Bombay stores were in operation, including 139 stores that have been
converted from regular stores since fiscal 1992.  Over 90% of all stores are
located in major shopping malls.  At January 31, 1998, 364 stores were operating
in 42 states in the United States and 51 stores were operating in nine provinces
in Canada, as illustrated in the map below.

Competition

   The home furnishings and decorative accessories market is highly fragmented.
The Company faces competition from furniture stores, department stores and other
specialty retailers.  The Company believes that it competes primarily on the
basis of selection, quality and value of merchandise.

Employees

   The Company has approximately 5,000 employees, which include approximately
3,000 part-time employees and is not a party to any union contract.  Employee
relations are considered to be good.

Seasonality

   Operating results are subject to seasonal variation.  Historically, the
largest proportion of sales and substantially all of the income occurs in the
fiscal quarter that includes December (the Christmas season).  Cash balances
increase significantly in December due to the Christmas business.

Intangibles

   The Company owns a number of copyright, trademark and tradename
registrations.  Management considers these intangibles to be valuable assets and
defends them as necessary.

Management's Discussion and Analysis

General
 The Bombay Company, Inc. ("Company") is a specialty retailer which markets
traditional and classic furniture, prints and accessories through its 415
locations of The Bombay Company ("Bombay") retail stores in 42 states in the
United States and nine Canadian provinces. Prior to Fiscal 1995, the Company
also operated the Alex & Ivy retail chain whose closure was announced on January
13, 1995 and completed on May 10, 1995. As such, the discussion following
relates primarily to the ongoing operations of Bombay. The discussion should be
read in conjunction with the Table below which summarizes three years of
comparable data for the total Company and also presents results excluding the
closed Alex & Ivy division.
 The largest percentage of the Company's sales and operating income is realized
in the fiscal quarter that includes December (Christmas season). Merchandise is
manufactured to Company specification through a network of contract
manufacturers located principally in Asia and North America. Because the
majority of the Company's products are proprietary, the impact of inflation on
operating results is typically not significant. The Company attempts to
alleviate inflationary pressures by increasing selling prices (subject to
competitive conditions), improving designs and finding alternative production
sources in lower cost countries.

 See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal reporting
periods.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
 Certain statements in this Annual Report to Shareholders under "Management's
Discussion and Analysis" constitute "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward -
looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other
factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the
Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such
factors include, among others, the following: competition; seasonality; success
of operating initiatives; new product development and introduction schedules;
acceptance of new product offerings; advertising and promotional efforts;
adverse publicity; expansion of the store chain; availability, locations and
terms of sites for store development; changes in business strategy or
development plans; availability and terms of capital; labor and employee benefit
costs; changes in government regulations; risks associated with international
business and regional weather conditions.

Net Sales
 Net sales declined 1% to $332.6 million for Fiscal 1997. The most significant
contributor to the sales decline was the closure of 14 underperforming stores.
Same store sales (stores in existence for one year or more) were flat for the
year while new stores accounted for a 1% increase in sales over Fiscal 1996. The
Fiscal 1997 sales mix consisted of: 49% furniture, 26% accessories, 17% wall
decor (principally prints, mirrors and sconces) and 8% lamps and other
categories, essentially the same as Fiscal 1996.  The focus of the Company was,
and continues to be, to offer more complete, cohesive collections with a broader
market appeal. This translated into a 7% increase in the average ticket;
however, the number of transactions also declined by 7%. On a regional basis,
Canada and the Northeastern United States reported the strongest results
although the results across all regions were within a very small range.

 Net sales, excluding Alex & Ivy, increased 2% to $336.3 million in Fiscal 1996
from $330.7 million in Fiscal 1995 due primarily to a 2% increase in same store
sales. During the period, the number of transactions decreased 2% while the
average sale per transaction increased 4% to $85. Furniture sales were the
predominant component in the sales mix representing 49% of the business as
compared to 47% in Fiscal 1995. All regions of the Company contributed to the
sales gain except the Midwest which showed slight declines. The Company's sales
performance was driven in part by the promotions needed to reduce its over
inventory position.

Cost of Sales, Buying and Store Occupancy Costs
 Cost of sales, including buying and store occupancy costs, for Fiscal 1997 was
$229.9 million, or 69.1% of sales. As a percentage of sales, these costs
improved from 69.6% in Fiscal 1996. Product margins improved 60 basis points
compared to the prior year as inventory overstock was sold and the new products
were introduced. The increase in product margin was somewhat offset by a 10
basis point increase in buying and occupancy costs due to the relative fixed
nature of costs measured against sales declines.

 Excluding Alex & Ivy, cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, for
Fiscal 1996 was $233.9 million or 7% higher than Fiscal 1995. As a percentage of
sales, these costs increased to 69.6% in Fiscal 1996 compared to 66.1% in Fiscal
1995. The increase was primarily the result of higher product costs as the
Company disposed of excess inventory through a series of aggressive promotions
especially during the second half of the year. The excessive inventory levels
also contributed to higher warehouse and freight costs which adversely impacted
margins.  Occupancy costs as a percentage of sales and total retail square
footage were relatively flat compared to Fiscal 1995.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
 For Fiscal 1997, selling, general and administrative costs were reduced $9.7
million to $97.7 million. Expenses declined to 29.4% of sales in Fiscal 1997
from 31.9% of sales in Fiscal 1996. Excluding charges related to management
changes of $.8 million in Fiscal 1997 and $4.2 million in Fiscal 1996 (see Note
8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), selling, general and
administrative expenses were $96.9 million, or 29.1% of sales, in Fiscal 1997
compared to $103.2 million, or 30.7% of sales, in Fiscal 1996. The decrease is
primarily due to lower payroll and payroll related costs (110 basis points) and
lower supplies costs (20 basis points) as a result of more stringent cost
control initiatives.

 For Fiscal 1996, Bombay's selling, general and administrative expenses were
$107.4 million or 31.9% of sales compared to $98.4 million or 29.8% of sales in
Fiscal 1995. The Fiscal 1996 amount included a $4.2 million charge (1.2% of
sales) recorded in connection with the management change which took place
September 1996. The remaining increase relates to higher payroll costs (120
basis points), costs incurred in connection with the closing of unprofitable
Bombay stores (20 basis points), higher insurance costs (20 basis points) and
higher recruiting and training costs (20 basis points) partially offset by lower
advertising expenses (90 basis points).

Interest
 Interest income in Fiscal 1997 was $2.3 million while there was no interest
expense for the year. In Fiscal 1996, interest income was $.7 million with
interest expense less than $.1 million, and in Fiscal 1995, interest income was
$.8 million while interest expense was less than $.1 million. Interest expense
during these periods reflects low levels of seasonal borrowing to fund inventory
purchases. The Company had no borrowings during Fiscal 1997.  The increase in
interest income relates to higher average balances in short - term investments.
The most significant increase occurred in Fiscal 1997 as the average cash
balances remained higher throughout the year as inventory levels were controlled
to lower average levels and capital expenditures were less than $4 million.

Store Closing Costs
 The January 1995 announcement to close the Alex & Ivy retail chain resulted in
a $41 million expense charge. The $41 million covered the estimated costs to
buyout lease obligations, property and equipment write-offs, inventory
writedowns and severance costs. During Fiscal 1995, the estimated costs of Alex
& Ivy store closings were reduced by $6 million based primarily on favorable
results of negotiated lease terminations (see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).

 There were no sales from Alex & Ivy stores during Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1996.
Alex & Ivy sales were $14.7 million during Fiscal 1995. Excluding costs or
credits relating to the closure, operating results for Fiscal 1995 were break-
even. All 58 of the chain's existing stores were closed during Fiscal 1995. The
Company does not expect to incur any additional costs in connection with this
operation.

Income Taxes
 The Company provided $2.9 million for income taxes in Fiscal 1997 and $8.0
million in Fiscal 1995 while reflecting a benefit of $1.6 million for Fiscal
1996. The effective tax rate was 39.3%, (35.6)% and 39.3% in Fiscal 1997, Fiscal
1996 and Fiscal 1995, respectively. The lower rate in Fiscal 1996 was primarily
attributable to realizing an operating loss without reflecting a corresponding
state tax benefit.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
 The primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from
operations and bank lines of credit. Bank borrowings are available to fund
seasonal inventory purchases. In addition, the bank credit lines are used for
overseas merchandise purchases.  Unsecured bank lines aggregate $40 million, of
which $30 million are committed under revolving credit agreements expiring April
14, 1998. These lines are expected to be renewed with existing banks.

Fiscal 1997
 At January 31, 1998, cash and short - term investments were $56.1 million, a
decrease of $7.0 million from February 1, 1997. Net cash used by operations was
$4.1 million. Cash was used primarily for the increase in inventories of $16.8
million and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $5.5 million.
These were partially offset by net income of $4.5 million which included non-
cash depreciation and amortization totaling $9.9 million. The increase in
inventory is the result of a decision to change the timing of the Fiscal 1998
Spring I marketing period and to add a Spring gift catalogue which resulted in
product arriving earlier than last year as well as not meeting sales plans
during Fiscal 1997. While the dollar value of the inventory is somewhat above
ideal, the mix of the inventory is good. The Company expects to gradually reduce
current inventories through reduced ordering and does not expect any significant
adverse impact on future operations.

 Capital expenditures totaled $3.9 million and included the costs of two new
stores, five store conversions and routine purchases of machinery and equipment.
The capital expenditure program for Fiscal 1998 is planned at approximately $20
million and includes 15 to 20 store openings and 20 conversions. The new stores
and conversions will be in a new design which includes customer-friendly
merchandise displays and updated styling. The Company also intends to retrofit a
number of its existing larger format stores with certain of the more successful
elements of the new design. Generally, a new or converted store is profitable in
its first full year of operations. The Company believes that its current cash
position, cash flows from operations and borrowings available under bank credit
lines will be sufficient to fund current operations and its capital expenditure
program.

Fiscal 1996
 Cash and short-term investments were $63.1 million at February 1, 1997, an
increase of $39.1 million over the prior year. Net cash provided by operations
was $41.2 million. The net loss from the year was $2 million which included
$11.2 million of depreciation and amortization. The remainder of the increase
related primarily to the $18.7 million reduction in inventory levels as well as
the receipt of income tax refunds and deposits totaling $10.5 million during the
period. The decrease in inventory levels was the result of the Company's
achieving its foremost objective of correcting its inventory position during the
year.

 Capital expenditures were $4.4 million for the year due primarily to opening
nine new Bombay stores and converting three stores to the large format.

Fiscal 1995
 Cash and short-term investments were $24.1 million at February 3, 1996, a
decrease of $6.6 million over the prior comparable period. Net cash used by
operations was $4.1 million. Net income was $12.4 million which included $6
million relating to the noncash adjustment to the Alex & Ivy closing reserve.
Other components of cash used by operations included a $15 million increase in
inventory levels offset by other net sources of cash totaling $4.5 million. The
increase in inventory levels was the result of timing of shipments as well as
lower than expected sales volumes during the year.

 Capital expenditures were $5.9 million during Fiscal 1995 due primarily to
opening 11 new Bombay stores and the conversion of 10 existing stores to the
large format.

Year 2000 Conversion
 The Company recognizes the need to ensure that it will be prepared for Year
2000 software issues. It has evaluated internal systems and programs and has
identified those which it believes are not currently compliant. Certain
solutions are being developed through programming while other systems will be
upgraded or replaced. Incremental costs are not expected to be significant as
most of the work will be performed through the redirection of existing internal
programming resources. Purchased software packages are capitalized and amortized
over their useful lives while programming and other costs associated with the
Year 2000 conversion are being expensed as incurred. The major components of the
conversion are expected to be completed by the middle of 1999; however, there
will be additional refinements that will continue for the remainder of the year.
The Company is also communicating with vendors, financial institutions and
others with which it does business to coordinate Year 2000 conversion issues.
There can be no assurance that the systems of other companies and agencies on
which the Company relies will be timely converted or that such failure to
convert by another entity would not have an adverse impact on the Company's
operations.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

<F1>
Note 1 - Statement of Accounting Policies
______________________________________________________________

Basis of Presentation
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly - owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions,
balances and profits have been eliminated. The Company has a retail (52 - 53
week) fiscal year which ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. The periods
ended January 31, 1998 ("Fiscal 1997") and February 1, 1997 ("Fiscal 1996")
represent 52 weeks. The period ended February 3, 1996 ("Fiscal 1995") represents
53 weeks.

Use of Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation
 Fiscal year end exchange rates are used to translate assets and liabilities to
U.S. dollars. Monthly average exchange rates are used to translate income and
expenses. The cumulative effect of foreign currency translation adjustments is
reported in stockholders' equity.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
 Cash in stores, deposits in banks and short-term investments with original
maturities of three months or less are considered as cash and cash equivalents
for the purposes of the financial statements. Short - term investments are
recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value.

Inventories
 Inventories are primarily finished merchandise and are valued at the lower of
average cost or market.

Accounting Change
 During the quarter ended May 4, 1996, the Company changed the timing of
allocation of overhead costs to distribution center inventories. The change more
accurately reflects inventory costs and represents a preferable method of
accounting for distribution center inventories. The cumulative effect of this
change was $835,000, net of tax, or $.02 per share. This amount is presented in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations as the cumulative effect of an
accounting change. The impact of this change on Fiscal 1996 results, excluding
the cumulative effect, was not significant. The pro forma effect of the change
on prior years' net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share is not
significant.

Property and Equipment
 Property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the
assets using the straight - line method over the lives shown:

   Building............                      Forty years
   Furniture and equipment                   Two to ten years
   Leasehold improvements                    The lesser of the life
                                             of the lease or asset

 Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Renewals and
betterments which materially prolong the useful lives of the assets are
capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of property retired
or sold are removed from the accounts, and gains or losses are recognized in the
statement of operations.



Advertising Costs
 Advertising costs are expensed the first time the advertising takes place.
During Fiscal 1997, Fiscal 1996 and Fiscal 1995, advertising expense was
$20,096,000, $19,887,000 and $22,859,000, respectively.

Goodwill
 Goodwill recorded in association with acquisitions accounted for using the
purchase method is amortized using the straight - line method over the estimated
useful life of 40 years. The amortization policy is reviewed annually and
impairments, if any, would be recognized if the expected future undiscounted
operating cash flows derived from such assets are less than their carrying
value.

Income Taxes
 The Company uses the liability method of computing deferred income taxes on all
material temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences
between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. The
Company assesses realizability of deferred tax assets and, if necessary, a
valuation allowance is provided.

Earnings per Share
 In March 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share ("FAS 128"), which
superceded Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 15. FAS 128 requires
presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share
are based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted
earnings per share are based upon the weighted average number of shares
outstanding plus the shares that would be outstanding assuming exercise of
dilutive stock options and distribution of restricted stock and deferred
director compensation. The Company adopted FAS 128 in Fiscal 1997 on a
retrospective basis.

 The computations for basic and diluted earnings from continuing operations per
share follow (in thousands, except per share amounts):

aggregating $45 million at January 31, 1998 of which $30 million is committed.
The credit facility is for working capital and letter of credit purposes,
primarily to fund seasonal merchandise purchases, and bears interest at market
rates based on prime. The credit agreement restricts dividend payments, and
requires the maintenance of various financial ratios and the payment of
negotiated fees. The revolving credit agreement expires April 14, 1998 and is

Note 4 - Commitments and Contingencies
______________________________________________________________
 Store, distribution and field office facilities are leased under operating
leases expiring through 2011. The store leases are generally based upon a
minimum rental plus a percentage of the store sales in excess of specified
levels. Store lease terms generally require additional payments covering taxes,
common area charges and certain other costs. Rental expense for Fiscal 1997,
Fiscal 1996 and Fiscal 1995 totaled $39,051,000, $39,502,000 and $40,181,000,
respectively.

Note 5 - Employee Benefit Plans
______________________________________________________________

 The Bombay Company, Inc. Employee 401(k) Savings and Stock Ownership Plan
("401(k) Plan") is open to substantially all employees who have been employed
for one year and who work at least 1,000 hours per year. Under the 401(k) Plan,
a participant may contribute up to 14% of earnings with the Company matching the
first 5% at a rate of 75%. Contributions are paid to a corporate trustee and
invested in various funds. Contributions made to participants' accounts become
fully vested upon completion of two years of service. Similar benefit plans are
in effect for eligible foreign employees.

 To the extent employees are unable to contribute up to 5% of their earnings to
the 401(k) Plan because of limitations imposed by IRS regulations, a
Supplemental Stock Program was adopted. Under this program, employee
contributions in excess of IRS limitations, along with Company matching
contributions, are distributed annually in the form of common stock.

 The Bombay Company, Inc. Stock Purchase Program is open to all full-time
employees who have at least six months of service. Each participant may
contribute 5% or 10% of qualifying compensation. Contributions are used to
purchase shares of Company common stock, which are distributed annually to all
participants. The participants' shares are fully vested upon purchase. The
Company has temporarily suspended its match on the Stock Purchase Program.

 Total Company contributions to these plans for Fiscal 1997, Fiscal 1996 and
Fiscal 1995 were $681,000, $1,667,000 and $1,665,000,  respectively.

Note 6 - Common Stock and Stock Options
______________________________________________________________
 Non - employee directors are eligible to participate in the 1993 Stock Deferral
Plan for Non - Employee Directors, which allows such directors the option to
defer receipt of retainer payments and meeting fees which are credited to an
account for such director in units equivalent to Company common stock.

 The Company has a shareholders' rights plan under which each share of Company
common stock includes one Preferred Share Purchase Right ("Right") entitling the
holder to buy one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock of the Company at an exercise price of $50. The Rights, which
have ten year terms expiring in 2005, are exercisable if a person or group
acquires 15% or more of the common stock of the Company or announces a tender
offer for 15% or more of the common stock. If a person or group acquires 15% or
more of the outstanding common stock of the Company, each Right will entitle the
holder to purchase, at the Right's exercise price, a number of shares of Company
common stock having a market value of twice the Right's exercise price. If the
Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after
a person or group acquires 15% or more of the Company's common stock, each Right
will entitle its holder to purchase, at the Right's exercise price, a number of
shares of the acquiring company's common stock having a market value of twice
the Right's exercise price. The Rights are redeemable at one cent per Right at
any time before they become exercisable.

 The Bombay Company, Inc. 1986 Stock Option Plan and 1996 Long Term Incentive
Stock Plan ("Employee Plans") provide for the granting of options (and other
types of stock-related awards under the 1996 plan) to officers and key
management employees. At January 31, 1998, the option shares reserved for the
Employee Plans were 3,593,470. The option price is fixed at the market price or
higher on the date of the grant. Options are generally exercisable annually at a
rate of 20% per year beginning one year after the grant date. Shares available
for additional grants were 2,663,618, 1,096,403 and 388,387 at January 31, 1998,
February 1, 1997 and February 3, 1996, respectively.

 On March 12, 1997, the Board of Directors granted 50,000 shares each of
restricted stock under the 1996 Long Term Incentive Stock Plan to two key
executives. The respective shares are issuable at March 12, 2001 contingent upon
the continued employment of each executive. Compensation expense of $105,000 was
recognized during Fiscal 1997 in connection with the restricted stock.

 The Bombay Company, Inc. 1991 Director Stock Option Plan ("Director Plan")
provides for the granting of options to members of the Board of Directors who
are neither employees nor officers of the Company. At January 31, 1998, the
option shares reserved for the Director Plan were 189,005. The option price is
fixed at the market price on the date of the grant. The option grant, initial
and annual, is currently 4,000 shares. The initial grant becomes exercisable at
a rate of 20% per year beginning one year after the grant date and includes past
Board service toward full vesting of the initial grant. Each additional annual
grant becomes fully exercisable six months after the grant date. Shares
available for additional grants were 6,946, 18,633 and 52,883 at January 31,
1998, February 1, 1997 and February 3, 1996, respectively.

 The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock - Based
Compensation ("FAS 123"). Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized
for options granted. Had compensation cost for the Company's stock option plans
been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards in Fiscal
1995 through Fiscal 1997 in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123, the

</TABLE>
The weighted average fair value of options granted during Fiscal 1997, Fiscal
1996 and Fiscal 1995 was $3.37, $4.96 and $6.66, respectively.

 The exercise of non - qualified stock options in Fiscal 1997, Fiscal 1996 and
Fiscal 1995 resulted in income tax benefits of $47,000, $558,000 and $832,000,
respectively, which were credited to additional paid - in capital. The income
tax benefits are the tax effect of the difference between the market price on
the date of exercise and the option price.

President and Chief Financial Officer. In accordance with a severance and non
competition agreement, a one time pre-tax charge of $800,000, equivalent to $.01

of January 31, 1998, $84,000 of the $800,000 had been paid.

 On September 5, 1996, the Company announced the termination of its President
and Chief Executive Officer and its Executive Vice President of Merchandising
and Marketing. In accordance with severance and non competition agreements, a
one time pre-tax charge of $4.2 million, equivalent to $.07 per share after tax,

Note 9 - Operations Realignment Costs
______________________________________________________________

 On January 12, 1995, the Board of Directors approved the establishment of $50
million in pre - tax reserves, equal to $.80 per share after tax, for the
closing of the Company's Alex & Ivy chain of retail stores, inventory writedowns
and streamlining divisional and corporate structure. The components of the $50
million are $41 million representing the estimated costs of closing the Alex &
Ivy chain, $5 million for inventory writedowns to reposition Bombay merchandise
lines and sell off discontinued items, and $4 million representing estimated
costs, principally severance, to streamline operations, including the
consolidation of divisional and corporate overheads. During Fiscal 1995, $6
million of the original reserve was reversed based primarily upon favorable
results of negotiated lease terminations, thereby reflecting lower costs than
originally projected. All Alex & Ivy stores were closed as of May 10, 1995 and
all store lease termination agreements were fully executed as of July 29, 1995.
Approximately 880 full and part-time employees were affected by the closing of
the Alex & Ivy chain. Alex & Ivy sales were $14,729,000  for Fiscal 1995.
Excluding costs or credits relating to the closure of the division, operating
results were breakeven in Fiscal 1995.

 The following table sets forth the components of the reserve to close Alex &
Ivy stores:

 In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Bombay
Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries at January 31, 1998 and February 1, 1997, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for the three years ended
January 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

          determined based upon Company performance and based upon individual
          performance.

     5.2  Bonus Pool based on Operating Profits:  Prior to or on the
          Determination Date, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall set a

          accrued for a bonus pool at different levels of profit achievement for
          the Fiscal Year.  The Committee also will specify a minimum profit
          threshold below which no bonus based on profits shall be paid.

          bonus purposes for the Fiscal Year.  If utilized, the Committee shall
          further establish a schedule for the accrual of bonus dollars for each
          percentage improvement (or fraction thereof) over the Return on Assets
          threshold.  If the Return on Assets target is not achieved, no Return
          on Assets bonus shall be accrued.

     5.4  Actual corporate Operating Profit and Return on Asset performance
          shall adjust the portion of planned bonus related to Company
          performance for each individual Participant based on the extent to
          which the pre-determined thresholds are achieved or exceeded by the
          Company, except that for any Fiscal Year the maximum bonus payable to
          any Participant under the Plan shall not exceed $3,000,000.
          Discretion shall not be permitted to reduce the award for any
          Participant below that which otherwise would be payable in accordance
          with the Plan as it relates to the Company performance element of the
          bonus.  The Operating Profit and Return on Assets calculations shall
          be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
          practices and may exclude any significant non-recurring items that are
          specified by the Committee.

     5.5  Individual Performance bonuses:  As set forth in 5.1, the Committee
          shall determine the allocation of bonus between Company performance
          and individual performance.  Individual performance bonus will be
          based upon satisfactory completion of individual goals or measurements
          as judged by the Committee for the CEO, President and COO and by the
          Committee, CEO, President & COO for all other officers who are
          Participants in the plan.

     5.6  Growth Factor:  Upon completion of the Fiscal Year and after earned
          bonuses based on Operating Profits and Return on Assets are calculated
          pursuant to the pre-determined schedules established by the Committee,
          a growth factor may be applied to adjust bonus payments up or down
          based on a comparison of Earnings per Share for the Fiscal Year
          compared to the prior fiscal year.  If Earnings per Share growth is
          less than -5%, bonuses otherwise earned based on Operating Profits and
          Return on Assets may be reduced by up to 50%, and if Earnings per
          Share increases by greater than 30%, bonuses otherwise earned may be
          increased by up to 50%.  The Committee, in its discretion, shall
          determine the schedule of bonus adjustments between these maximum
          levels.

6.   Payment of Award

     Prior to the payment of any bonuses, the Committee shall certify the level
of Operating Profit, Return on Assets and Earnings per Share achieved for the
Fiscal Year.  Payment of bonuses will be made in cash, on or about 30 days
following the completion of each Fiscal Year, unless such payments exceed 150%
of planned levels.  In such case, the Committee shall determine what percentage
of the excess over 150% that shall be paid in the form of Common Stock pursuant
to the Company's Supplemental Stock Program.  Notwithstanding any contrary
provision of the Plan, (a) if a Participant incurs a Termination of Employment
prior to the end of a Fiscal Year, the Committee shall determine, in its sole
discretion, the extent to which a bonus shall be paid for such Fiscal Year, and
b) no provision of the Plan shall be construed to create a trust or to
establish or evidence any Participant's claim of any right other than as an
unsecured general creditor with respect to any payment to which he or she may be
entitled.  The Company shall withhold all applicable taxes required by law from
any payment, including any federal, FICA, state and local taxes.

7.   Employment Rights

     Nothing in the Plan shall confer upon any Participant the right to continue
in the employ of the Company or its Affiliated Companies or shall interfere with
or restrict in any way the rights of the Participant's employer to discharge or
change the terms of employment of any Participant at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause.

8.   Effect upon Other Plans

     The adoption of the Plan shall not affect any other equity or other
compensation or incentive plan in effect for the Company or any Affiliated
Company, and the Plan shall not preclude the Company's Board of Directors from
establishing any other forms of incentive compensation for Officers.

9.   Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan

     The Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may alter, amend, or
terminate the Plan, or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason;
provided, however, that if and to the extent required to ensure the Plan's
qualification under Code Section 162(m) as "performance-based compensation," any
such amendment shall be subject to shareholder approval.

10.  Effective Date

     The effective date of this Plan, as amended, is May 21, 1997.
