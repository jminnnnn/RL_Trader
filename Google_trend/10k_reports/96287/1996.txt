          located on page  21 of the  1995 Annual  Report to  Shareholders,

          Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
<F7>

                         
          Merchandise Sales, Purchasing and Distribution
          ----------------------------------------------
          
             Bombay  products  internally  designed  or  styled   represent
          approximately 95% of  total sales.   New products are  introduced
          each year, with  over 1,500 new items  introduced in  fiscal year
          1995.  The fiscal 1995 sales mix consisted of: 47% furniture, 27%
          accessories, 17% wall  decor  (principally prints,  mirrors  and
          sconces) and 9% lamps and other categories.

             Merchandise is manufactured to Company specifications  through
          a network  of  manufacturers  located principally  in  Asia,  the
          United States, Canada, Mexico  and South America.   Approximately
          60% of  production  needs  are provided  from  overseas  sources.
          Branch offices  located in  Taiwan and  Malaysia, and  agents  in
          various  countries   coordinate  production   requirements   with
          manufacturers, provide  technical  expertise and  ensure  quality
          standards are met.

             Approximately 75%  of the  Company's merchandise  requirements
          are  supplied by 35 contract  manufacturers  in  seven countries.
          Although  no   long-term   production   agreements   exist   with
          manufacturers, there  are long  standing relationships  with  the
          major vendors.  Formal agreements with major manufacturers are in
          place which prohibit production  of proprietary products for  any
          other party.  Additional  manufacturing capacity and  alternative
          sources, both domestic  and international, continue  to be  added
          through new vendors and plant expansions by existing vendors.

             Usually, it takes several months  from the time a  merchandise
          order is placed with an overseas manufacturer until the goods are
          received at centralized distribution centers.  Order lead  times
          are slightly less for  domestic manufacturers principally due  to
          shorter  shipping  time.    Lead  times  can  vary  depending  on
          seasonality factors  especially  in  months  when  factories  are
          producing at  or near  peak capacity  to meet  seasonal  demands.
          While overseas  purchases  are principally  denominated  in  U.S.
          dollars, significant foreign  currency fluctuations could  affect
          landed cost.

               Store inventories  are  replenished from  four distribution
          centers, three of which are located in the United States and one
          in Canada.   The  Company  replenishes  the  majority  of  store
          inventories within  48 hours  of receipt  of  a store  order and
          replenishes over 90% of stores within 72 hours.

          Stores and Real Estate
          ----------------------

             The stores offer a wide variety of attractively styled, ready-
          to-assemble furniture,  prints  and accessories,  with  a  strong
          emphasis on value and quality.  Significant attention is given to
          visual merchandising in  order to  display products  in the  most
          attractive setting.  Stores are completely remerchandised several
          times a year coincident with the  mailing of each catalogue.   To
          accommodate  the  increasing  number  of  products,  the  Company
          introduced a large format Bombay store in late fiscal 1992.   The
          large format Bombay stores are approximately  4,000 square feet,
          while the regular stores average 1,700 square feet.  At  February
          3, 1996,  218 large  format  Bombay  stores were  in  operation,
          including 131 stores that have been converted from regular stores
          since fiscal 1992.  Over 90% of all stores are  located in major
          shopping malls.  At February 3, 1996, stores were operating in 42
          states in the United States and nine of ten provinces in  Canada,
          as illustrated in the map below.

                                     COMPETITION

             The home  furnishings  and decorative  accessories  market  is
          highly fragmented.  The Company faces competition from  furniture
          stores,  department   stores  and   other  specialty   retailers.
          However,  direct competition with these stores is limited to some
          extent  because  such  stores  are  not  principally  focused  on
          lifestyle  furnishings  and  household  accessories  at  moderate
          prices and do not  offer the same broad  selection.  The  Company
          believes that it  competes primarily on  the basis of  selection,
          quality and value of merchandise.


                                      EMPLOYEES

             The Company has approximately  5,000 employees, which  include
          approximately 3,000 part-time employees and is not a party to any
          union contract.  Employee relations are considered to be good.


                                     SEASONALITY

             Operating  results   are   subject  to   seasonal   variation.
          Historically, the largest proportion of sales  and income occurs
          in the fiscal  quarter   that includes  December  (the Christmas
          season).  Cash  increases significantly  in December due to  the
          Christmas business.


                                     INTANGIBLES

             The  Company  owns  a  number  of  copyright,  trademark   and
          tradename registrations.  Management considers these  intangibles
          to be valuable assets and defends them as necessary.


                               RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

             All statements in this Annual Report on  Form 10-K, including
          those incorporated  herein  by  reference, that  do  not  reflect
          historical information  are forward  looking statements  made  in
          reliance upon  the "safe harbor" provisions  of  the  Private
          Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Important factors that
          could cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those
          discussed in such forward looking statements include, but are not
          limited to,  competition,  economic  downturns,  dependence  upon
          product development, international business risks and seasonality
          of business.



          ITEM 2.  Properties.

             The Company  owns its  headquarters office  complex,  but all
          stores  and  distribution  centers  are  leased  under   numerous
          operating leases, generally with 10 year  terms.  At February  3,
          1996, owned and  occupied office space  was approximately  72,000
          square feet, and leased distribution/office and retail space  was
          approximately 821,000 and  1,256,000 square  feet, respectively.
          Leased  property  consists   of  stores,  distribution  centers,
          administrative  offices,  and  various  equipment,  with  leases
          expiring between  1996 and  2006.   Distribution  facilities are
          located in  the Atlanta, Fort  Worth, Philadelphia  and  Toronto
          areas.   Office facilities  are located  in the  Fort  Worth and
          Toronto areas.  Adequate  insurance coverage  is carried  on all
          leased properties.

             For additional  lease  information, see  Note  4 of  Notes  to

Management's Discussion and Analysis

General

 Last year the Company changed its 52-53 week fiscal year to end the Saturday
nearest the end of January. Therefore, the financial statements are presented
for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 1996 ("Fiscal 1995"), the 30 weeks or seven
month period ended January 28, 1995 ("Seven Month Period"), the 52 week fiscal
year ended July 3, 1994 ("Fiscal 1994"), and the 53 week fiscal year ended
July 4, 1993 ("Fiscal 1993").

 On January 13, 1995, the Company announced the closing of its Alex & Ivy
retail chain and established a $41 million pre-tax reserve. The closures were
completed as of May 10, 1995 at a cost $6 million less than what was initially
estimated. The Company now includes only the operations of its Bombay Company
retail stores. As such, the discussion of Fiscal 1995 results focuses primarily
on the on-going operations of Bombay. The discussion should be read in
conjunction with the Table below which summarizes four year comparable data for
the total Company and also presents Fiscal 1995 results and the comparable
twelve months excluding the closed Alex & Ivy division.

 The greater percentage of sales and operating income is realized in the
quarter that includes December (Christmas season). Even though the precise
effect of inflation on operations cannot be accurately determined, management
does not believe inflation has a material impact on sales or results of
operations.

Net Sales

 Sales for Fiscal 1995 declined $17.5 million primarily due to the closing of
the Alex & Ivy division. Fiscal 1995 and the twelve months ended January 28,
1995 include sales of $14.7 million and $31.5 million, respectively, from Alex &
Ivy operations. Net sales, excluding Alex & Ivy, were $330.7 million in Fiscal
1995 compared to $331.4 million during the comparable twelve months. The sales
decline for Bombay was the result of a 6% decrease in same store sales (stores
in existence for one year or more), including conversions, which was offset by
sales increases from new stores equal to 5%. Excluding conversions, same store
sales decreased 9%. The period showed a 1% decrease in the number of customer
transactions. However, the average sales per customer increased approximately $1
to $75 (excluding Alex & Ivy).

 For the Seven Month Period, new stores were the most significant component of
the 23% sales increase. The same store sales  of 7%, including conversions,
encompasses 58 stores that were converted to the large format within the last 12
months. Excluding the conversions, same store sales decreased 1%. The Seven
Month Period showed a 24% increase in the number of customer transactions but
the average sale per customer declined $1 to $72. Furniture sales increased
approximately 3% of the sales mix for the Seven Month Period.

 The sales increase in Fiscal 1994 was attributable to new stores and increased
same store sales. Same store sales included 56 stores which were converted to a
large format during the past 12 months. Excluding these large format stores,
same store sales increased 11% for Fiscal 1994. Same store sales increased 15%
in the first six months and 6% in the last six months of Fiscal 1994. The sales
increase in Fiscal 1994 resulted from a 47% increase in customer transactions
while the average sale per customer decreased $6 to $73. The lower average sale
per customer reflects a change in sales mix. Accessories, which are generally
lower priced items, accounted for a 2% increase in the sales mix whereas
furniture declined approximately 1%. Geographically, all regions contributed
substantially to the positive sales increases in 1994 with the Southern Region
being the strongest performer during the past two years.

 New store openings in Fiscal 1995, the Seven Month Period, and in Fiscal 1994
and 1993 were 11, 40, 71 and 44 with 63 (of which 58 were Alex & Ivy stores),
one, seven and three stores closing in each period, respectively. Bombay
converted 10 stores to the large format during Fiscal 1995. During the Seven
Month Period, Bombay opened 20 new stores and converted 38 stores to the larger
format and Alex & Ivy opened 20 new stores. In Fiscal 1994, a total of 95 large
format Bombay stores (39 new and 56 conversions) and 32 Alex & Ivy stores were
opened. During Fiscal 1993, a total of 43 large format Bombay stores were opened
(18 new and 25 conversions) while Alex & Ivy added six new stores. Most new
stores were within existing market areas for Bombay.

Cost Of Sales, Buying And Store Occupancy Costs

 Costs of sales, including buying and store occupancy costs  for Fiscal 1995
were $229.6 million, or 1% lower than the comparable twelve month period.
However, as a percentage of sales, they were 2.9% higher. Excluding the closed
Alex & Ivy division, the percentage was 66.1% in Fiscal 1995 and 62.5% in the
comparable period last year. The increase in costs for Bombay is due to higher
occupancy costs (2.7%) and higher product costs (.9%). The occupancy costs
percentage increase is the result of the retail square feet added during the
past two years and the effect of declining same store sales relative to the
fixed nature of occupancy costs. During Fiscal 1995, retail square footage for
Bombay stores increased only 4% to 1,256,000 square feet. The lower product
margin is primarily due to the effect of lowering selected retail prices,
increasing warehouse and freight costs, and a shift in the sales mix as
consumers tended to purchase a greater portion of merchandise on sale compared
to full price merchandise.

 Costs were $43.1 million, or 39.0% higher during the Seven Month Period than
the comparable prior year period. The percentage of sales increase of 7.2%
compared to the same period last year reflects lower product margin of 4.5% and
higher buying and store occupancy costs of 2.7%. The lower product margin was
primarily due to: (1) $5 million Bombay inventory writedown, principally
nonfurniture products (see Note 8 of Notes To Consolidated Financial
Statements); (2) costs associated with a new distribution center opened
September 1994, as well as inefficiencies related to excess inventory levels and
(3) the acceleration of programs to discontinue selected furniture products from
normal sale period in January 1995 to begin October 1994. The higher occupancy
costs reflect increased square footage of 33%. More importantly 32% of the total
square footage is less than one year old which effectively brings these leases
to current market rents.

 For Fiscal 1994, costs increased 39.8% over the prior year while sales
increased 37%. As a percentage of sales, costs were 59.1% or 1.2% higher than
Fiscal 1993 reflecting higher buying and occupancy costs related to the store
expansion programs undertaken. During Fiscal 1994, retail square footage
increased 52% to 1,148,000 square feet. Furthermore, approximately 43% of the
Company's total retail square footage represents leases less than one year old,
which  effectively brought the leases to current market rents. The slightly
lower product margin reflects the lower margins of Alex & Ivy and the mix
between promotional and nonpromotional periods.


Selling, General And Administrative Expenses

 Selling, general and administrative expenses were $102.3 million, or 4% lower
than the comparable period last year. Excluding the cost associated with Alex &
Ivy, Bombay costs increased to 29.8% of sales during Fiscal 1995 from 28.8% of
sales the comparable period last year. The increase is due primarily to higher
advertising (1.3%), payroll (.6%) and insurance costs (.2%). Fixed payroll costs
increased relative to sales but were significantly offset by declines in
performance based pay. Costs for the prior year include a $4 million charge
(1.2% of sales) for restructuring the Company's operations for which there was
no corresponding expense in the current period.

 Expenses for the Seven Month Period increased $13.8 million or 24.2% compared
to the same period last year. The .3% percentage of sales increase can be
attributed to the $4 million recorded for consolidation of divisional and
corporate overheads (see Note 8 of Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements)
which equals 1.7%, and higher insurance costs and other expenses (.6%), offset
by lower payroll (1%) and advertising (1%) costs.

 Fiscal 1994 expenses increased $21.3 million but decreased 1.6% as a
percentage of sales compared to Fiscal 1993. Payroll costs resulted in the most
significant decrease (.7%) from prior year; the remaining .9% decrease resulted
from lower insurance, advertising and other expenses, as a percentage of sales.

Interest

 Interest expense for Fiscal 1995, for the Seven Month Period and for Fiscal
1994 and 1993 was $.1 million, $.4 million, $.1 million and $.2 million,
respectively. The decrease in interest expense during Fiscal 1995 reflects the
lower seasonal borrowings during the period. The interest expense increase for
the Seven Month Period reflects the seasonal borrowing activity compared to
Fiscal 1994 which had no seasonal borrowing.

 Interest income for Fiscal 1995, for the Seven Month Period and for Fiscal
1994 and 1993 was $.8 million, $.2 million, $.9 million and $.7 million,
respectively. The increase in interest income during Fiscal 1995 is the result
of higher levels of short-term investments due to funds generated by the
liquidation of Alex & Ivy as well as a decrease in store expansion activity. The
decrease in interest income for the Seven Month Period resulted from lower
short-term investment levels. Interest income increased in Fiscal 1994 due to a
higher level of short-term investments.

Store Closing Costs

 The January 1995 announcement to close the Alex & Ivy retail chain resulted in
a $41 million expense charge. The $41 million covers the estimated cost to
buyout lease obligations, property and equipment write-offs, inventory
writedowns and severance costs. During Fiscal 1995, the estimated costs of Alex
& Ivy store closings were adjusted by reversing $6 million of the original
reserve based primarily on favorable results of negotiated lease terminations
(see Note 8 of Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements).
<F8>

Income Taxes

 For the Seven Month Period, income tax benefit was $9.6 million. Income tax
expense for Fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $8.0 million, $14.7 million and $5.2
million, respectively. The effective tax rate in each fiscal period was 39.3%,
(39.5)%, 39.2% and 39%.

 The effective income tax rate decreased .2% for Fiscal 1995 and increased .3%
for the Seven Month Period primarily due to the effect of state income taxes.
The effective tax rate increased .2% in Fiscal 1994 due to the Federal income
tax rate increase, partially offset by tax exempt short-term investments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 The primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from
operations and bank borrowings. Bank borrowings are utilized to fund seasonal
inventory purchases approximately six months of the year. In addition, the bank
credit lines are used for overseas merchandise purchases. Unsecured bank lines
aggregate $70 million, of which $45 million are committed under revolving credit
agreements expiring on April 1, 1996. These lines are expected to be renewed
with existing banks.

Fiscal 1995

 Cash and short-term investments were $24.1 million at February 3, 1996, a
decrease of $6.6 million over the prior comparable period. Net cash used by
operations was $4.1 million. Net income was $12.4 million which included $6.0
million relating to the noncash adjustment to the Alex & Ivy closing reserve.
Other components of cash used by operations included a $15.0 million increase in
inventory levels offset by other net sources of cash totaling $4.5 million. The
increase in inventory levels is the result of timing of shipments as well as
lower than expected sales volumes during the year.

 Capital expenditures were $5.9 million during Fiscal 1995 due primarily to
opening 11 new Bombay stores and the conversion of 10 existing stores to the
large format. The next fiscal year's capital expenditures program will be
slightly lower than last year at approximately $4 to $7 million which includes
approximately 5 new Bombay stores and 4 large store conversions.

 Generally, a new or converted store is profitable in its first full year of
operations. The Company believes that its current cash position, cash flows from
operations and borrowings available under bank credit lines will be sufficient
to fund current operations and its capital expenditures.

Seven Months Ended January 28, 1995

 Cash increased $10.2 million for the seven months ended January 28, 1995 to
$30.7 million. Net cash provided by operations was $31.0 million. The components
of cash provided by operations were: net loss of $14.7 million; noncash cost of
$50 million relating to operations realignments; and other net outflows of $4.3
million.

 Capital expenditures were $22.1 million for the seven months ended January 28,
1995. The capital expenditures program included investments in: (1) 40 new
stores; (2) 38 stores converted to large format; (3) purchase of home office
headquarters office complex; (4) new distribution center and (5) information
systems.

Fiscal 1994

 Cash flows from operations were $10 million. Net income before noncash
expenses generated $34.3 million of operating cash flow and other net changes
added $3.9 million. These were offset by the increased inventory investment of
$28.2 million, required to support the increased number of new stores and large
store conversions. However, inventory levels were slightly higher than plan as
sales did not meet forecasted levels.

 Significant capital expenditures were made in Fiscal 1994 for store growth
programs, distribution center expansion and information systems. In Fiscal 1994,
$35.3 million was invested primarily in the building of 127 stores, including 71
new stores and 56 large store conversions.

Fiscal 1993

 At July 4, 1993, cash and short-term investments were $42.8 million, an
increase of $32.7 million over Fiscal 1992. The significant increase in cash was
due to the receipt of $42.2 million in April 1993 from the proceeds of the
public offering of common stock. Cash flows from operations were $2.8 million.
Net income before noncash expenses provided approximately $23.6 million of
operating cash flow. These funds, together with other net changes of $2.9
million, were offset by a $23.7 million increase in inventories. The higher
investment in inventory reflects the opening of new stores, the conversion of
existing stores to a large store format and the expansion of the
Alex & Ivy chain. The Fiscal 1993 inventory levels were in line with business
plans, but the prior year inventories were approximately $4 million under normal
planned levels. Capital expenditures were $15 million, which were used for 44
new stores and the conversion of 25 Bombay stores to the large store format.
Additionally, investments were made in fixtures and equipment for expanded
distribution centers, and new information systems.

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1 - Statement Of Accounting Policies
- -----------------------------------------

Basis Of Presentation

 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions,
balances and profits have been eliminated. The Company has a retail (52-53 week)
fiscal year which was changed to end on the Saturday nearest January 31,
beginning with the seven months (thirty weeks) ended January 28, 1995 ("Seven
Month Period"). For previous periods, the fiscal year ended on the Sunday
nearest June 30. The periods ended February 3, 1996 ("Fiscal 1995") and July 4,
1993 ("Fiscal 1993") represent 53 weeks, and the period ended July 3, 1994
("Fiscal 1994") represents 52 weeks. Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

 Fiscal year end exchange rates are used to translate assets and liabilities to
U.S. dollars. Monthly average exchange rates are used to translate income and
expenses. The cumulative effect of foreign currency translation adjustments is
reported in stockholders' equity.

Cash And Cash Equivalents

 Cash in stores, deposits in banks and short-term investments with original
maturities of three months or less are considered as cash and cash equivalents
for the purposes of the financial statements. Short-term investments are
recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value.

Inventories

 Inventories are primarily finished merchandise and are valued at the lower of
average cost or market.

Property And Equipment

 Property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the
assets using the straight-line method and at the lives shown:

  Building ........................ Forty years
  Furniture and equipment........   Two to ten years
  Leasehold improvements........    The lesser of the life
                                    of the lease or asset

 Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Renewals and
betterments which materially prolong the useful lives of the assets are
capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of property retired
or sold are removed from the accounts, and gains or losses are recognized in the
statement of operations.

Goodwill

 Goodwill recorded in association with acquisitions accounted for using the
purchase method is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life of 40 years. The amortization policy is reviewed annually and
impairments, if any, would be recognized if the expected future operating cash
flows derived from such assets is less than their carrying value.

Income Taxes

 The Company uses the liability method of computing deferred income taxes on
all material temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences
between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. The
Company assesses realizability of deferred tax assets and, if necessary, a
valuation allowance would be provided.

Earnings Per Share

 Net income (loss) per share is based upon the weighted average number of
shares outstanding plus the shares that would be outstanding assuming exercise
of dilutive stock options which are considered to be common share equivalents.

 The Company has unsecured revolving credit agreements with banks aggregating
$45,000,000 at February 3, 1996. These credit facilities are for working capital
and letter of credit purposes, primarily to fund seasonal merchandise purchases,
and bear interest at market rates based on prime. The credit agreements  require
the maintenance of various financial ratios and the payment of negotiated fees.
The revolving credit agreements expire April 1, 1996 and are expected to be
renewed under similar terms. The Company also has an unsecured, uncommitted
short-term line of credit for $25,000,000, used for letters of credit. At
February 3, 1996, there were $26,815,000 in letters of credit outstanding under

Note 4 - Commitments And Contingencies
- --------------------------------------

 Store, distribution and field office facilities are leased under operating
leases expiring through 2006. The store leases are generally based upon a
minimum rental plus a percentage of the store sales in excess of specified
levels. Store lease terms generally require additional payments covering taxes,
common area charges and certain other costs. Rental expense for Fiscal 1995, the
Seven Month Period, Fiscal 1994 and 1993 totaled $40,181,000, $25,140,000,
$31,850,000 and $22,156,000, respectively.

 The minimum rental commitments for future fiscal years are as follows (in

 In January and February 1995, three lawsuits were filed against the Company
and its Chief Executive Officer in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Texas, seeking class action status on behalf of the
purchasers of the Company's common stock. In November 1995, the lawsuits were
settled for a nominal amount.


Note 5 - Employee Benefit Plans
- -------------------------------

 The Bombay Company, Inc. Employee 401(k) Savings and Stock Ownership Plan
("401(k) Plan") is open to substantially all employees who have been employed
for one year and who work at least 1,000 hours per year. Under the 401(k) Plan,
a participant may contribute up to 14% of earnings with the Company matching the
first 5% at a rate of 150%. The employee contributions are paid to a corporate
trustee and invested in various funds. Company contributions are generally
invested in its common stock, and contributions made to participants' accounts
become fully vested upon completion of two years of service. Similar benefit
plans are in effect for eligible foreign employees.

 To the extent employees are unable to contribute up to 5% of their earnings to
the 401(k) Plan because of limitations imposed by IRS regulations, a
Supplemental Stock Program was adopted. Under this program, employee
contributions in excess of IRS limitations, along with Company matching
contributions, are distributed annually in the form of common stock.

 The Bombay Company, Inc. Stock Purchase Program is open to all full-time
employees who have at least six months of service. Each participant may
contribute 5% or 10% of earnings. For participants with at least two years of
service, the Company matches 50% of the participant's contribution.
Contributions are used to purchase shares of Company common stock, which are
distributed annually to all participants. The participants' shares are fully
vested upon purchase.

 Total Company contributions to these plans for Fiscal 1995, the Seven Month
Period, Fiscal 1994 and 1993 were $1,665,000, $992,000, $1,857,000 and
$1,654,000, respectively.

 
Note 6 - Common Stock And Stock Options
- ---------------------------------------

 On December 1, 1993, the Board of Directors declared a three-for-two common
stock split. The split was payable on December 31, 1993 to holders of record on
December 14, 1993. Average common shares and common equivalent shares
outstanding, income per average common share and common equivalent share, stock
option shares and exercise prices have been restated to reflect all splits paid
through December 31, 1993.

 On March 30, 1993, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Certificate
of Incorporation increasing the authorized $1 par value common stock from
25,000,000 to 50,000,000 shares.

 In April 1993, the Company received net proceeds of $42,164,000 from a public
offering of 2,587,500 shares (as adjusted for subsequent stock splits). Proceeds
used for general corporate purposes, including the conversion of existing Bombay
stores to large format stores and the addition of new stores.

 Non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the 1993 Stock Deferral
Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which allows such directors the option to defer
receipt of annual retainer payments which are credited to an account for such
director in units equivalent to Company common stock.

 The Bombay Company, Inc. 1986 Stock Option Plan ("Employee Plan") provides
for the granting of options to officers and key management employees. At
February 3, 1996, the option shares reserved for the Employee Plan were
2,686,208. Since the option price is fixed at the market price or higher on the
date of the grant, no compensation is charged against earnings. Options are
generally exercisable annually at a rate of 20% per year beginning at least one
year after the grant date. Shares available for additional grants were 388,387;
506,194; 478,175 and 497,206 at February 3, 1996, January 28, 1995, July 3, 1994
and July 4, 1993, respectively.

 The Bombay Company, Inc. 1991 Director Stock Option Plan ("Director Plan")
provides for the granting of options to members of the Board of Directors who
are neither employees nor officers of the Company. At February 3, 1996, the
option shares reserved for the Director Plan were 195,192. The option price is
fixed at the market price on the date of the grant. The maximum grant, initial
and annual, is 2,250 shares. The initial grant becomes exercisable at a rate of
20% per year beginning one year after the grant date and includes past Board
service toward full vesting of the initial grant. Each additional annual grant
becomes fully exercisable six months after the grant date. Shares available for
additional grants were 52,883; 73,133; 93,383 and 111,375 at February 3, 1996,
January 28, 1995, July 3, 1994 and July 4, 1993, respectively.

 The exercise of non-qualified stock options in Fiscal 1995, the Seven Month
Period, Fiscal 1994 and 1993 resulted in income tax benefits of $832,000,
$7,000, $6,114,000 and $4,349,000, respectively, which were credited to
additional paid-in capital. The income tax benefits are the tax effect of the
difference between the market price on the date of exercise and the option
price.

Note 8 - Operations Realignment Costs
- -------------------------------------

 Bombay merchandise lines and sell off discontinued items, and
 On January 12, 1995, the Board of Directors approved the establishment of $50
million in pre-tax reserves, equal to $.80 per share, for the closing of the
Company's Alex & Ivy chain of retail stores, inventory writedowns and
streamlining divisional and corporate structure. The components of the $50
million are $41 million representing the estimated costs of closing the Alex &
Ivy chain, $5 million for inventory writedowns to reposition Bombay merchandise
lines and sell off discontinued items, and
$4 million representing estimated costs, principally severance, to streamline
operations, including the consolidation of divisional and corporate overheads.
During Fiscal 1995, $6 million of the original reserve was reversed based
primarily upon favorable results of negotiated lease terminations, thereby
reflecting lower costs than originally projected. All Alex & Ivy stores were
closed as of May 10, 1995 and all store lease termination agreements were fully
executed as of July 29, 1995. Approximately 880 full and part-time employees
were affected by the closing of the Alex & Ivy chain. Alex & Ivy sales were
$14,729,000, $24,128,000, $16,704,000 and $3,875,000 for Fiscal 1995, the Seven
Month Period, Fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively. Excluding costs or credits
relating to the closure of the division, operating results were breakeven in
Fiscal 1995 and losses before income taxes were $1,548,000, $2,863,000 and
$1,569,000 for the Seven Month Period, Fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively.

 The following table sets forth the components of the reserve to close Alex &
Ivy stores:

<AUDIT-REPORT>
Independent Accountants' Report

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Bombay Company, Inc.

 In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Bombay
Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries at February 3, 1996, January 28, 1995 and
July 3, 1994, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
year ended February 3, 1996, the seven months ended January 28, 1995 and each of
the two years in the period ended July 3, 1994, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
