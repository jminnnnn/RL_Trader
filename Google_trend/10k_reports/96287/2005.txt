ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

(a) General Development of Business

The Bombay Company,  Inc.  and its wholly-owned subsidiaries design, source and
market a line of proprietary  home  furnishings  that includes large furniture,
occasional furniture, wall decor and decorative accessories  that  is timeless,
transitional and classic in its styling  through a network of retail  locations
throughout  the  United  States  and  Canada,  through  specialty catalogs, the
Internet  and  international  licensing  arrangements.  We also  have  a  small
wholesale operation that distributes a separate  line  of occasional furniture.
Throughout  this  report, the terms "our," "we," "us", "Bombay"  and  "Company"
refer to The Bombay Company, Inc., including its subsidiaries.

The Company has a retail  (52-53  week) fiscal year, which ends on the Saturday
nearest  January  31.  The periods ended  January  29,  2005  ("Fiscal  2004"),
January 31, 2004 ("Fiscal  2003")  and February 1, 2003 ("Fiscal 2002") reflect
52 weeks.

Bombay's  unique  position  in  the market  place  is  a  result  of  our  core
competencies in design, sourcing  and  importing.   We  are  a global importer,
sourcing product from approximately 20 countries worldwide.  Over  90%  of  the
product has been designed or styled to Bombay's specifications.

Bombay has three distinct retail concepts leveraging the Bombay brand:  Bombay,
BombayKIDS  and  Bombay Outlet.  Bombay stores feature timeless and classically
styled  home  furnishings  including  accessories,  wall  decor  and  furniture
focusing on the  bedroom, the home office, the dining room and the living room.
We entered the children's furnishings business in 2001 with the introduction of
BombayKIDS, which  features  a  line  of  children's  furniture,  textiles  and
accessories  for children's bedrooms and bathrooms. Bombay Outlet stores, which
are located primarily  in  major outlet centers across the United States and in
Canada, feature an assortment  of  home furnishings similar to the Bombay store
offering at lower price points.  Additionally,  Bombay  Outlet stores provide a
channel to liquidate overstocks of Bombay and BombayKIDS  product  as  well  as
merchandise produced for our wholesale operation.

In  addition  to  our  primary  retail  operations,  Bombay has other operating
enterprises which contributed incrementally to profitability but which were not
significant to our operations in Fiscal 2004.  Unless  specified otherwise, the
discussions  in  this Annual Report on Form 10-K relate to  the  Bombay  retail
operations, including BombayKIDS, outlets, Internet and catalog.

 (b) Financial Information About Segments

Bombay operates primarily  in  one business segment as a multi-channel retailer
selling decorative home furnishings, furniture and related items.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

Merchandise Sales, Purchasing and Distribution

Bombay operates stores located in  regional  shopping  malls, certain secondary
malls, open-air lifestyle centers, high-end strip centers  and  selected  urban
and  suburban  locations.   As of January 29, 2005, there were 446 stores in 42
states in the United States and  56 stores in nine Canadian provinces.  We also
market our products through our mail  order operations in the United States and
Canada  and  over  the  Internet at www.bombaycompany.com,  www.bombaykids.com,
www.bombayoutlet.com and www.bombay.ca.

We offer a diverse selection  of  products  consisting  of  approximately 6,500
stock keeping units ("SKUs") of which over 90% of the product has been designed
or  styled to our specifications.  Bombay's proprietary product  offers  unique
design,  quality  and  exceptional  value  to a wide audience of consumers.  We
regularly update our merchandise assortment  by  introducing new products while
discontinuing  others.   Our  product  offerings   have  a  fashion  component,
primarily  in  the  accessory  and  wall  decor  areas,  which  are  introduced
seasonally.  Other products with longer lives are discontinued as they approach
the  end  of their life cycles.  Approximately 3,500 and 2,600  new  SKUs  were
introduced  in  Fiscal  2004  and  Fiscal  2003,  respectively.  Typically, new
product  introductions  have  been concentrated during  our  spring,  fall  and
Christmas selling periods.  The principal categories of merchandise include the
following:

     Furniture - We sell  two  broad categories of furniture as described
     below.   Our furniture is manufactured  by  third  party  vendors  located
     principally in China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, India and Indonesia.

                                        2
<PAGE> 3

           Large  Furniture  -  This category includes both wood and metal
           furniture focusing on the bedroom,  home  office,  dining  room  and
           living  room.   Many  of the larger items are displayed in store and
           stocked in our distribution  centers  and  are  available  for store
           delivery  typically  within  ten  days.  Large furniture represented
           29%, 30% and 26% of total sales in  Fiscal  2004,  Fiscal  2003  and
           Fiscal 2002, respectively.

           Occasional  Furniture  -  This category includes wood and metal
           hall tables, end and coffee tables,  plant  stands  and  other small
           accent  tables,  stands and curios that are ready-to-assemble,  take
           home products.  Occasional  furniture represented 19% of total sales
           in Fiscal 2004, Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002.

     Accessories - This is the broadest  category  and  represented  40%,
     39%,  and 42% of total sales in Fiscal 2004, Fiscal 2003, and Fiscal 2002.
     This  category   includes   both  functional  and  decorative  accessories
     including lamps, jewelry and  memorabilia boxes, crystal, ceramics, frames
     and desktop items, textiles, florals,  candles  and  holiday  items.   The
     items  are  sourced  from  over  20  countries  in Asia, North America and
     Europe.

     Wall  Decor  -  This  category  includes prints,  mirrors  and  wall
     accessories that represented 12%, 12% and  13%  of  total  sales in Fiscal
     2004,  Fiscal  2003  and  Fiscal 2002, respectively.  This merchandise  is
     sourced primarily from the United States and various countries in Asia.

Merchandise is manufactured to Bombay's  specifications  through  a  network of
third  party vendors principally located in Asia and North America.  More  than
90% of production  needs  are  sourced  from foreign countries.  We have branch
offices in Taiwan, Malaysia, China, Vietnam  and  India,  and utilize agents in
various   countries  to  locate  prospective  vendors,  coordinate   production
requirements  with  manufacturers  and  provide technical expertise and quality
control.

We are not dependent on any particular supplier  and  have  had  long  standing
relationships  with many of our vendors. Forty manufacturers in eight countries
supply almost 70%  of  our  merchandise  requirements.  Bombay has no long-term
production  agreements;  however,  we  generally  have  agreements  with  major
manufacturers that prohibit the production of our proprietary product for other
parties.   Additional  manufacturing capacity  and  alternative  sources,  both
domestic and international,  continue to be added through new vendors and plant
expansions  by  existing  vendors.   We  transact  business  with  our  vendors
principally in United States  currency,  and  historically have not experienced
any  material  disruptions as a result of any foreign  political,  economic  or
social instability.

The  product  development  process  takes  between  three  and  twelve  months,
beginning with the original idea and concluding with the final product received
at regional distribution centers in the United States and Canada.  Depending on
the category, the  source country and whether an item is new or reordered, lead
times generally vary  from two to six months from order placement until arrival
at the stores.  Order times  are slightly less for North American manufacturers
principally due to shorter shipping  times.  Lead times may also be impacted by
seasonality factors, especially in months  when manufacturers are producing at,
or near, peak capacity to meet seasonal demands.   As  a  result,  we strive to
maintain an adequate inventory position in our distribution centers to ensure a
sufficient supply of products to our customers.

We have regional distribution centers in Fort Worth, Texas; McDonough, Georgia;
Breinigsville,    Pennsylvania;   Gilbertsville,   Pennsylvania;   Mira   Loma,
California; Plainfield,  Indiana  and  Mississauga,  Ontario.  The distribution
centers  are  strategically located to provide the capability to replenish  the
majority of store  inventories  within 48 hours of when the order is processed.
We use dedicated trucks and less-than-truckload  carriers  to transport product
from our distribution centers to the stores.

Channels of Distribution

RETAIL

Stores and Real Estate

Historically, we have located our stores primarily in regional  shopping malls,
certain  secondary  malls  and  selected  urban  and  suburban  locations  that
satisfied  our  demographic and financial return criteria.  Over the  past  two
years, as many of  those  leases  came  up  for  renewal, we began aggressively
pursuing an off-mall strategy for new and relocated stores focusing on open-air
lifestyle  centers  and  high-end  strip  centers  (especially   those  with  a
concentration  of  home  furnishings retailers).  Such locations offer  us  the
opportunity  to  lower occupancy  costs,  improve  operating  efficiencies  and
provide a more convenient shopping experience for our customer.  Our preference
is to identify locations  where we can operate a combined Bombay and BombayKIDS
store, thereby realizing economies  that  come  with  a  larger  location while
attracting  a  new  and  younger  customer to Bombay.  As of January 29,  2005,
approximately 37% of our stores, excluding outlets, were in off-mall locations.

                                       3
<PAGE> 4

In selecting store locations, our real  estate  department  conducts  extensive
analyses  of  potential store sites.  We base our selection on the existing  or
planned co-tenancy  of  the center, the size of the market and the demographics
of the surrounding area.   In  evaluating  a  store  location, placement of the
store relative to retail traffic patterns and customer  base of other retailers
in the nearby vicinity are important considerations.  Significant  attention is
given to visual merchandising opportunities to maximize the ability  to display
product  in  the  most  attractive  setting.   We seek out the most potentially
profitable locations for the opening of new stores  regardless of the venue. We
are  currently  targeting  8,500 to 9,000 square foot locations  where  we  can
construct a Bombay store of  approximately  4,500  square feet with an adjacent
BombayKIDS store of approximately 4,000 square feet.   Bombay  mall  stores are
slightly smaller in size, currently averaging approximately 3,600 square  feet.
New  Bombay  off-mall locations are expected to be in the 4,000 to 5,000 square
foot range.  In  addition  to  building  new stores, we continue to selectively
convert our existing regular stores, which  average  approximately 2,000 square
feet,  to  the larger format.  As of January 29, 2005, there  were  20  regular
stores remaining in the chain.

At January 29,  2005, the store chain included a total of 47 outlet stores.  We
view the use of outlets  as  an  opportunity  to  increase sales to a different
customer base, to assist in the orderly clearance of merchandise and to further
leverage our design and sourcing capabilities.

Following is a table summarizing our store activity and composition:

</TABLE>


During  Fiscal  2005,  we  plan  to open approximately 45  to  50  new  stores,
including  approximately  12-13  BombayKIDS   stores.    We   plan   to   close
approximately  42 stores, ending the year with approximately 505 to 510 stores.
For store count  purposes, a combined Bombay and BombayKIDS location represents
two stores.

Our average cost of  leasehold  improvements, furniture, fixtures and machinery
for  Bombay  stores  opened  in  Fiscal  2004,  net  of  landlord  construction
allowances, was approximately $175,000  per  store, or $37 per square foot.  In
addition, other investments, which consist primarily  of inventory in the store
location, averaged approximately $90,000 per large format  store.  The  average
net cost of a BombayKIDS store is approximately $220,000 but, at $53 per square
foot, is higher than a Bombay large format store on a per square foot basis due
to  higher  fixturing  costs.   Inventory  investment  averaged  $85,000  for a
BombayKIDS  store.   During  Fiscal 2004, average inventory physically in store
was approximately 43% of the total inventory investment.  Our mall-based stores
typically achieve store level  operating  profitability during their first full
year  of operations and reach maturity in three  years.   Off-mall  stores  are
typically profitable during their first year of operation.  However, based upon
our limited  experience,  it appears that it may take slightly longer for these
stores to mature.  Further,  whether a store was relocated from a local mall or
is  a  new  store  in  a  market may  also  be  an  influencing  factor  as  to
profitability and length of time until maturity.

Direct

We offer virtually all our retail SKUs for purchase  over  the internet through
our  U.S. websites at www.bombaycompany.com for Bombay, www.bombaykids.com  for
BombayKIDS and www.bombayoutlet.com for Bombay Outlets.  During Fiscal 2003, we
launched our Bombay Canada website at www.bombay.ca, which currently sells core
product  and  a  limited selection of outlet product. We plan to add a Canadian
BombayKIDS  site in  the  future.   We  continue  to  pursue  online  marketing
partnerships  to  broaden  our  reach  to  additional  customers.  Business-to-
consumer  revenues  over the Internet were approximately $21.2  million,  $17.1
million  and  $8.1 million  in  Fiscal  2004,  Fiscal  2003  and  Fiscal  2002,
respectively.  We also maintain websites supporting our wholesale activities.

Bombay has a catalog  business which primarily serves as a marketing vehicle to
drive  customers  into stores  and  to  the  Internet.   Direct  catalog  sales
represent less than 2% of revenues.

WHOLESALE

Bailey Street Trading  Company  -  During  Fiscal  2000, we created a wholesale
subsidiary,  Bailey  Street Trading Company ("Bailey Street").   The  brand  is
separate from Bombay and  allows  us  to capitalize on our strengths in product
design,  sourcing and importing.  Current  product  offerings  are  focused  on
occasional  furniture, which we distribute to a variety of customers, including
independent gift  stores,  catalogers,  department stores, furniture stores and
mass merchants through a network of independent regional sales representatives.
In  November  2004,  we  announced our intention  to  exit  the  Bailey  Street
operations through sale or  liquidation in order to focus on our core business.
We are currently in the process  of  evaluating alternatives and expect to exit
Bailey Street during Fiscal 2005.

International   -  Bombay  International,   Inc.   ("International")   is   our
international licensing  and  distribution  channel.   International operations
have  extended  to 15 licensed stores as of the end of Fiscal  2004,  operating
principally in the  Middle  East  and  the  Caribbean.  International  revenues
totaled  $3.8  million  in Fiscal 2004 compared to $3.7 million in Fiscal 2003.
During Fiscal 2004, the Company  entered into a master licensing agreement with
a third party to manage and expand  International operations in the Middle East
and  certain eastern European countries.   We  plan  limited  expansion  abroad
through  licensing  and  distribution  agreements  in  existing markets or with
current  partners,  including  the  master  licensee.   During   Fiscal   2005,
approximately three additional International stores are planned to be opened by
our licensees.

Intangibles

We  own  a  number  of  the  trademarks and service marks used in our business,
including    federal    registrations     for     the    marks    The    Bombay
Company{reg-trade-mark},   Bombay{reg-trade-mark},   the    palm   tree   logo,
BombayKIDS{reg-trade-mark}  and  Bailey Street Trading Company{reg-trade-mark}.
Our trademarks are also registered  or  are the subject of pending applications
in a number of foreign countries.  Each registration  is renewable indefinitely
if the mark is still in use at the time of renewal.

We  believe  that our trademarks have significant value and  that  these  marks
enhance the Bombay{reg-trade-mark} brand and are instrumental in our ability to
create, sustain  demand  for  and  market  our  product.  From time to time, we
discover products in the marketplace that are counterfeit  reproductions of our
product or that otherwise infringe upon our trademark or tradedress rights.  We
have  and  will  continue to vigorously defend our rights under  the  marks  as
necessary.

Seasonality

Operating results are subject to seasonal variation.  Historically, the largest
proportion of sales  and  substantially  all  of the income occur in the fourth
fiscal quarter, which includes the Christmas season.   Inventory  balances  are
generally  built to their highest levels prior to the Christmas selling season.
Inventories  decline,  short-term  borrowings  are  repaid  and  cash  balances
increase significantly in December due to the Christmas business.

Competition

The home furnishings and decorative accessories market is highly fragmented and
very  competitive.   We  face  competition  from  furniture  stores, department
stores, mass merchants and other specialty retailers, including national chains
and independent retailers.  We believe that we compete primarily  on  the basis
of style, selection, quality and value of merchandise.

Employees

We have approximately 5,000 employees,  including approximately 3,000 part-time
employees,  and  we  are not a party to any union contract.  Employee relations
are considered to be good based on employee retention and industry trends.

(d) Financial Information About Geographic Areas

Bombay operates in one industry segment, specialty retailing.  Greater than 90%
of all revenues results from the  sale  of  home  furnishings  and  accessories
through  retail stores in the United States and Canada.  The remaining  portion
of our revenues  results  from  the  sale  of  home furnishings and accessories
through  our  wholesale operations, direct-to-customer  retail  operations  and
related shipping charges.  Our wholesale and direct-to-customer operations have
been immaterial  to  our  operations and financial results to-date.  Long-lived
assets include all non-current assets except deferred taxes.

We  lease  all of our retail locations  and  distribution  centers  under  non-
cancelable operating  leases  whose initial terms typically have 10-year terms,
expiring between 2005 and 2016, and may include options that permit renewal for
additional periods.  Rents under  the  store  leases  are  generally based upon
minimum rentals plus additional contingent rentals based upon  a  percentage of
the  store's  sales  volume  in excess of specified levels.  Store lease  terms
generally require additional payments  covering  taxes, common area maintenance
charges, insurance and certain other costs.

Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements
During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004, we began an
evaluation  of  our  lease accounting practices  and  determined  that  it  was
appropriate to restate  previously  issued financial statements.  Historically,
we have recognized store lease expense  on  a  straight-line basis beginning on
the date that the store opened.  This generally had the effect of excluding the
pre-opening store build out, fixturing and merchandise  stocking periods during
which the Company typically had no rent payments.  Based upon our evaluation of
our  lease  accounting  practices,  we  have  adopted an accounting  policy  to
capitalize  rent during the construction period   and  recognize  straight-line
rent expense  upon  the store becoming substantially complete and ready for its
intended use, which results in us recording rent expense during the merchandise
stocking periods.

Additionally,  in  prior   periods,   we   reflected   proceeds  from  landlord
construction allowances as a separately identified component of cash flows from
investing  activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash  Flows.   We  have
restated our historical Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 Consolidated Statements  of
Cash Flows to reflect such proceeds as a component of cash flows from
operating activities.

The restatement includes adjustments to cost of sales, buying and store
occupancy costs, income (loss) before income taxes, provision (benefit) for
income taxes, net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share.  These changes
increased net loss and loss per share by $43,000 and $.00 per diluted share
in the first three quarters of Fiscal 2004.  The restatement adjustments
decreased net income and earnings per share in Fiscal 2003 by $85,000 and $.00
per diluted share, and increased net income and earnings per share in Fiscal
2002 by $11,000 and $.00
per diluted share.  Although the restatement did not impact any net cash flows
for any period presented, it did have the effect of increasing operating cash
flows and increasing investing cash flows by a similar amount.  These changes
increased net cash provided by operating activities and increased our net
cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 by $11.9
million and $3.5 million, respectively.  The restatement also affects periods
prior to Fiscal 2002.  The impact of the restatement on such prior periods has
been reflected as a reduction of $301,000, or less than 1%, to total
stockholders' equity as of February 2, 2002 in the
accompanying consolidated statement of changes in stockholders' equity.  We
have also restated the applicable financial information for Fiscal 2003,
Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000 in Item 6, Selected Financial Data.
For information with respect to the restatement adjustments, see Note 2 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.  This Management's Discussion
and Analysis gives effect to these restatements.

The restatement relating to the reflection of proceeds from landlord
construction allowances as a component of cash flows from operating activities
increased our net cash provided by operating activities and increased our net
cash used in investing activities in the three, six and nine month interim
periods of Fiscal 2004 by $.5 million, $4.3 million and $8.5 million,
respectively, and increased our net cash provided by (used in) operating
activities and increased our net cash in investing activities in the nine
month interim period of Fiscal 2003 by $7.4 million.

Executive Overview
Bombay designs, sources and markets a line of proprietary home furnishings that
includes  large furniture, occasional  furniture,  wall  decor  and  decorative
accessories  that  is  timeless, transitional and classic in its styling.  More
than 90% of the items are  imported  from approximately 20 countries worldwide,
with more than half of the product coming  from  China.  We are a multi-

channel
retailer with store locations, Internet and mail order  operations.   We have a
small wholesale operation that is immaterial to overall revenue but contributes
incrementally to profitability.

We  focus  on  several  key  metrics  in  managing and evaluating our operating
performance and financial condition including  the following: same store sales,
sales  and  gross margins by merchandise categories,  operating  margins  as  a
percentage of  revenues,  earnings  per  share, cash flow, return on assets and
inventory turn.

We  are  currently  executing  a  multi-phase turnaround  intended  to  improve
Bombay's long-term profitability and  generate competitive operating results in
line with current market leaders in the  sector  whose operating profits are in
the  8% to 12% range.  Fiscal 2004 was an investment  year  during  which  many
structural issues were addressed.

Phase I of the turnaround commenced during the third quarter of Fiscal 2002 and
continued  into  Fiscal 2003.  Our goal was to reclaim market share, generating
above average same store sales and validating our positioning within the market
place.  We reported  13  consecutive  months  of  double-digit same store sales
increases beginning in September 2002 and continuing  through  September  2003.
As  a  result  of the strength of these sales, we were able to leverage many of
our fixed costs  including  our  buying and occupancy costs, a key component to
improving our overall operating margins.

Phase  II can be characterized by the  aggressive  repositioning  of  our  real
estate portfolio.   During the 1980s and 1990s, our focus was on opening stores
in "A" malls throughout  North  America.  As shopping habits have evolved, with
alternative venues such as lifestyle  centers and big box strip centers gaining
popularity, we began to migrate our stores to off-mall locations.   In addition
to being more convenient for customers  and  suitable  for  the  sale  of large
items,  such locations typically have lower cost structures, both from a  fixed
rent perspective  and  for  other  common  area  expenses  billed by landlords.
Management believes that the movement to the off-mall locations will ultimately
result in lower fixed costs for Bombay and will help improve profitability.

Another key aspect of Phase II included aggressively investing  in marketing to
attract  new  customers  to Bombay and support the move from mall to  off-mall.
During the late 1990s and  early  2000s,  we had become increasingly reliant on
periodic catalogs to drive customers into the  store and did not have marketing
vehicles  with  a  broader  reach. In Fiscal 2001, the  marketing  expenditures
reached their historical low  of  3.4%  of  revenues.   During  Fiscal 2002 and
Fiscal  2003,  we  increased  our  marketing  to  4.1%  and  4.6%  of revenues,
respectively, with much of the incremental spending going to support  a program
for monthly inserts in Sunday newspapers in our top markets.

In addition to investing in new stores, we began making some key investments in
our  infrastructure  intended to serve as the foundation upon which we plan  to
grow with competitive  operating margins.  During Phase II, we made investments
in our supply chain, in our information technology, in our distribution network
and in key leadership positions.

As we began Fiscal 2004,  we were facing a number of challenges.  We had a lack
of new product in our inventory  with  an assortment over-weighted in basic and
core merchandise.  We also were effecting a significant number of migrations of
our core Bombay stores from mall to off-mall,  and at the same time, taking our
BombayKIDS stores to critical mass.  Additionally,  we  were  anniversarying  a
year   during   which  we  recorded  a  13%  same  store  sales  increase.   We
underestimated the  impact  of  these  factors,  as well as the softness of the
environment that would develop in the third and fourth  quarters,  which led to
an  overall  decline  in  revenue for the year and a 12% decline in same  store
sales.  The lower revenue base  made  it  difficult  to  leverage  fixed  costs
throughout  the  organization and for the year, the Company reported a net loss
of $12.2 million.

With respect to our  inventory  assortment,  we  made the conscious decision to
exit Fiscal 2003 with higher levels of core merchandise  than ideal.  While the
merchandise was salable, it prevented us from bringing in appropriate levels of
new fresh product.  As a result, both sales and margin suffered.   Product flow
and newness was further impacted by interruptions in the supply chain caused by
the  imposition  of antidumping duties on bedroom furniture beginning  in  June
2004.  While we were  aware  of  the impending action by the U.S. Department of
Commerce and had taken action to move  much of our bedroom furniture production
from  China  to Vietnam and other source countries,  inefficiencies  associated
with dealing with  new  vendors, limited production capacity in these factories
as Bombay and other home  furnishings  retailers sought alternatives to Chinese
sources, and the inability, in some cases, to locate factories outside of China
that  were  capable  of manufacturing product  to  Bombay  quality  and  safety
specifications, resulted  in  disruptions  in  our supply chain and significant
voids in the assortment, particularly during the second half of the year.

We believe that we have taken, and are continuing  to take, positive actions to
correct these situations going forward.  We ended the year with a much improved
merchandise mix.  We have hired a  general merchandise  manager  experienced in
overseas  sourcing  and  have  modified  our plans with respect to new  product
introductions,  eliminating  SKU count in certain  categories  and  introducing
additional classifications such  as home fragrance, designed to increase repeat
purchases and boost the overall productivity  of  the  store.   We plan to slow
the rate of product introduction in key furniture categories,  and  have  taken
steps to mitigate risk as we transition from one product line into another.  We
believe that these actions should help drive improved sales and margins.

                                        13

We  continued to invest in marketing during Fiscal 2004, spending 5.6% of total
revenue   on   advertising.   However,  we  began  to  see  a  decline  in  the
effectiveness of  the  reach  vehicles  being  used  and  some investments were
unwarranted.   Going  forward,  the Company expects to continue  to  invest  in
marketing  at  the  rate of 4.5% of  revenues  on  an  annual  basis  but  will
reallocate funds to focus  on  driving existing customers in to make additional
purchases through the use of more direct mail pieces.  We also expect to invest
more heavily in new store grand  opening  support  and  will  readdress certain
locations  that opened softer than expected during Fiscal 2004 with  additional
marketing spend.

While Fiscal 2004 was a disappointing year in the short term, there were longer
term successes.   We have continued to migrate stores successfully from mall to
off-mall locations.   During  Fiscal  2004,  we  closed 35 stores, of which the
majority were mall based.  A total of 66 real estate  projects,  including  new
stores  and relocations, were completed during the year resulting in opening 61
new off-mall locations.  The total number of stores grew to 502, a net increase
of 31 stores.  While assortment issues adversely impacted new stores as well as
existing stores, the overall four-wall profit for off-mall stores opened a full
year was  approximately 350 to 400 basis points higher than those of mall-based
stores and  the  average sales per store was 8% higher.  Occupancy costs in the
off-mall locations are in line with expectations and represent on average a 15%
reduction in per store  costs compared to the mall store - in spite of the fact
that  the average off-mall  store  size  is  27%  larger  than  its  mall-based
counterpart.

The following table reflects the real estate portfolio at each fiscal year end:

</TABLE>

We will  continue  to  invest  in  the  migration of mall to off-mall locations
during Fiscal 2005 as leases expire.  Overall,  we  expect  to  open  45  to 50
stores  and  close  42  stores  during the year.  By the end of Fiscal 2005, we
expect approximately 44% of our stores to be in off-mall locations.

During Fiscal 2004, we also opened  a total of 16 BombayKIDS stores, ending the
year with 51 stores.  This growth, along  with planned openings in Fiscal 2005,
has  helped  us  reach critical mass which we  expect  to  result  in  improved
efficiency  in  the   buying,  distribution,  marketing  and  field  operations
functions.  We continue  to prefer to open BombayKIDS stores adjacent to Bombay
locations thus enabling us to leverage cost and introduce a new customer to the
Bombay brand.

We will continue to invest selectively in infrastructure and, in this area, we
achieved some major goals during Fiscal 2004.  In August 2004, we relocated to
a  new distribution center  in  the  Northeast.   The  previous  location  was
severely  undersized  and  resulted  in excessive use of off-site storage.  We
also identified and have initiated plans  to move to a new distribution center
in the metropolitan Toronto area. The new facility  will  replace  our current
undersized  location  and  is  expected  to  result  in  improved  operational
efficiencies  when  it  opens  during  the second quarter of Fiscal 2005.   We
completed  the  rollout  of the new point-of-sale  system  and  the  broadband
environment to our Canadian  stores.    We  relaunched  our Internet site on a
more stable, reliable platform.  The new site has improved  functionality  and
we  expect  to  make continued enhancements to it in the future.  We have made
improvements in our planning and allocations systems and expect to continue to
invest in this area in order to improve our ability to forecast and assort our
stores.  While we  believe  that  these investments are critical to our future
success, we also need to ensure that our expenses are in line with our revenue
base.  As a result, we have taken steps  in  other  areas  to  right  size the
organization  and  continue  to  aggressively  control  expenses as we seek to
restore profitability to the Company.

The infrastructure that we develop and the investments that  we  make  will be
critical  to  the  third  phase  of  our  turnaround strategy.  Our plan is to
organically develop other retail concepts and  areas  of operations that would
leverage  our  core  competencies and become new growth vehicles  for  Bombay.
This longer-term strategy  is  dependent on successfully accomplishing earlier
phases, which will be the focus for Fiscal 2005 and beyond.

Other Disclosures
The largest percentage of our sales  and  operating  income  is realized in the
fourth fiscal quarter, which includes December (Christmas season).

Same  store  sales  comparisons are calculated based upon revenue  from  stores
opened for more than  12  months.   Stores converted from the regular format to
the large format and stores relocated  from  mall  to  off-mall  locations  are
classified  as  new and are excluded from same store sales until they have been
opened for 12 months.   Stores  relocated  within  a  mall  and  whose  size is

                                       14

<PAGE> 15


significantly changed are treated as new stores and are excluded from the  same
store  sales  calculation until opened for a full year. Remodeled stores remain
in the computation of same store sales.

Cost of sales includes  all  costs  associated  with  the  purchase  of product
including,  but  not  limited  to,  vendor  cost, inbound transportation costs,
duties,  commission,  inspections, quality control,  warehousing  and  outbound
transportation costs.   Buying  costs  include costs associated with our buying
department, consisting primarily of salaries,  travel,  product development and
product sample costs.  Store occupancy costs include costs  such  as rent, real
estate  taxes, common area maintenance charges, utilities and depreciation  and
amortization  of  leasehold improvements and other fixed assets relating to our
retail locations.

The impact of inflation  on  operating  results  is  typically  not significant
because the majority of our products are proprietary.   We attempt to alleviate
inflationary  pressures  by  improving designs, finding alternative  production
sources in lower cost countries  and  increasing  selling  prices  (subject  to
competitive conditions).

An  anti-dumping  petition against China furniture makers for allegedly dumping
bedroom furniture was  filed  during 2003.  This created some disruption in the
industry and in our flow of product  as  we  shifted  orders  to  vendors  with
production  capacity  in  other  countries  in  preparation for the unfavorable
duties.  The actual duties determined by the U.S.  Department  of Commerce were
announced late in 2004 and we do not expect the impact of these  duties to have
a material effect on operations going forward.

Bombay  has  a  retail  (52-53  week)  fiscal  year, which ends on the Saturday
nearest  January  31.   The  periods ended January 29,  2005  ("Fiscal  2004"),
January 31, 2004 ("Fiscal 2003")  and  February 1, 2003 ("Fiscal 2002") reflect
52 weeks.


NET REVENUES
Net revenues consist of sales to retail  customers,  through  store, mail order
and   Internet,  and  wholesale  sales,  through  Bailey  Street  and  to   our
international licensees, as well as shipping fees and other revenues.  Shipping
fees reflect  revenue  from  customers  for  delivery  of  merchandise.   Other
includes royalties and territory fees from international licensees.

Fiscal 2004
Net  revenues  decreased $20.3 million, or 3%, to $576.1 million,  compared  to
$596.4 million in Fiscal 2003.  Revenues from retail operations decreased $19.8
million, or 3%,  from the previous year.  Same store sales declines of 12% were
partially offset by  sales  from  new  stores,  which contributed approximately
$85.7 million in net sales.  During the year, we  opened 50 large format stores
and 16 BombayKIDS stores.  Increases from new stores  were  partially offset by
the  closing  of  31  large  format  stores and four regular stores  which,  in
aggregate, contributed approximately $48.4 million to net sales in Fiscal 2003.
Direct-to-customer revenues increased 6% to $31.7 million from $29.8 million in
the previous year, attributable to 25%  growth  in  Internet  sales, which more
than  offset  the  31%  decline  in  mail order revenues.   Wholesale  revenues
declined  slightly to $18.9 million from  $19.5  million  in  Fiscal  2003  due
primarily to a decline in the Bailey Street business.

All regions  of  the U.S. and Canada reported low double digit same store sales
declines.  We ended  Fiscal  2004  with  384  large  format  stores, 20 regular
stores,  47  outlets  and  51  BombayKIDS stores.  Total retail square  footage
increased 9% from Fiscal 2003 year  end,  while  the store count increased by a
net  31 units.  The number of retail transactions for  the  year  increased  by
approximately 8%, and the average ticket decreased to $77.

Fiscal 2003
Net revenues  increased  $102.4 million, or 21%, to $596.4 million, compared to
$494.0 million in Fiscal 2002.  Revenues from retail operations increased $94.9
million, or 20%, from the  prior  year.  Both  new  stores and same store sales
increases contributed to the growth. Same store sales  increased  13%  for  the
year  while  stores  classified  as  new  stores during Fiscal 2003 contributed
approximately $51.8 million in net sales.   During the year, we opened 53 large
format stores, 30 BombayKIDS stores and one outlet.   In addition, we converted
four  regular  stores  to  the large format.  Increases from  new  stores  were
partially offset by the closing of 26 large format stores, eight regular stores
and one outlet which, in aggregate,  contributed approximately $24.9 million in
net sales in Fiscal 2002.  Direct-to-customer  revenues  increased 44% to $29.8
million, from $20.6 million, due to strong Internet sales,  partially offset by
a  decrease  of  approximately 10% in mail order sales.  The remainder  of  the
increase relates to  growth  in our wholesale operations, in particular, Bailey
Street, where revenues increased  88%,  to  $15.8  million from $8.4 million in
Fiscal 2002.

All regions of the U.S. and Canada reported positive same store sales, with all
but the Midwest reporting double-digit sales increases.   At  the end of Fiscal
2003,  we  had  365 large format stores, 25 regular stores, 46 outlets  and  35
BombayKIDS stores.  Total retail square footage increased 17% compared to year-
end Fiscal 2002, while the store count increased by a net 49 units.  The number
of retail transactions  for  the  year  increased by almost 15% and the average
ticket increased to $86 from $82 in Fiscal 2002.

</TABLE>


Fiscal 2004
Cost of sales, including buying and store  occupancy costs, for Fiscal 2004 was
$428.6 million, or 74.4% of revenues, up from 70.7% of revenues in Fiscal 2003.
Product  margins  declined  130  basis  points  as  a  result  of  issues  with
merchandise  mix,  promotional  activity and a general  softness  in  the  home
furnishings retail sector.  Additionally,  distribution  costs  had  a negative
impact on margins as they were deleveraged on a lower sales volume.  Buying and
store  occupancy  costs increased 240 basis points, reflecting the deleveraging
impact of these relatively  fixed  costs  compared  to  the lower sales volume.
Buying  and  store  occupancy  costs included impairment charges  totaling  $.5
million to write down the fixed assets related to ten unprofitable stores.

Fiscal 2003
Cost of sales, including buying  and store occupancy costs, for Fiscal 2003 was
$421.5 million, or 70.7% of revenues.  As a percentage of revenues, these costs
improved from 70.8% in Fiscal 2002.   Product margins declined 210 basis points
as we focused on our value offerings at  key  price points designed to increase
market  share  and  drive  sales  volumes.  Buying and  store  occupancy  costs
declined as a percentage of revenues  to  16.8%  from  19.1%  in  Fiscal  2002,
reflecting  the  significant  leverage  gained as a result of higher same store
sales.  Buying and store occupancy costs  included  impairment charges totaling
$.2  million  to  write  down  the fixed assets related to  eight  unprofitable
stores.


SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Fiscal 2004
Selling, general and administrative  expenses  were  $165.7 million compared to
$158.4 million in Fiscal 2003.  As a percentage of revenues, expenses increased
to 28.8% in Fiscal 2004 compared to 26.6% in Fiscal 2003.

At the store level, expenses increased $2.4 million, or  90  basis points.  The
increase  was  driven  primarily  by  a $2.0 million increase in store  payroll
resulting from the higher store count over  the  course  of the year.  On a per
store  basis, total costs were down as we tightly managed expenses  in  a  soft
sales environment.    The 90 basis point increase as a percentage of revenue is
the result of the same store sales declines and a general softness in sales for
all stores making it difficult  to  leverage fixed costs, particularly early in
the year when store payroll costs tend to be more fixed in nature.

Marketing and visual merchandising costs  increased  approximately $1.5 million
or  40 basis points to 5.6% of total revenue.  The increase  in  this  category
resulted  from our decision to continue to invest in marketing despite the soft
sales trend in order to drive traffic and reach new customers.

                                     16

<PAGE> 17


Corporate office  selling,  general  and administrative expenses increased $3.4
million, or 90 basis points over the prior  year,  due  to  higher  medical and
other  insurance  costs  of  $2.7 million and higher severance expenses of  $.7
million associated with right-sizing  the  organization.   Additionally,  audit
expenses   increased   approximately  $.6  million  as  a  result  of  the  new
requirements for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
Internet and mail order  selling,  general and administrative expense increased
by $1.1 million due to higher internet  sales  and  higher  hosting  and design
costs  as  we  launched  our updated website on a new platform.   Also, we  had
approximately $.8 million  less foreign exchange gain resulting from changes in
the Canadian dollar exchange  rate,  in  addition  to  other  less  significant
changes.  Current year depreciation was $2.0 million lower than in Fiscal  2003
as  a result of the prior year charge of $2.1 million associated with replacing
the Company's  point-of-sales  system.  Additionally, corporate incentive-based
compensation expense was $1.4 million lower in Fiscal 2004 than in Fiscal 2003.

Fiscal 2003
           Selling, general and  administrative  expenses, including marketing,
     were slightly lower at 26.6% of revenues in Fiscal  2003 compared to 26.8%
     of  revenues  in  Fiscal  2002.   In dollars, total selling,  general  and
     administrative expenses were $158.4  million compared to $132.3 million in
     Fiscal 2002, an increase of $26.1 million.

           At  the  store level, costs increased  $13.7  million  but  declined
     slightly as a percentage  of  sales.   Major  factors  contributing to the
     increased costs include factors associated with the increase in volume and
     number of stores such as higher store payroll and bonuses, which increased
     $9.3 million, and higher costs associated with credit card  processing and
     collections,  which  increased  $1.2  million.  Store payroll declined  30
     basis points as a percentage of revenue  due  to  leveraging  against  the
     higher sales base while store bonuses, which are based upon improvement in
     store   level  profitability  from  the  comparative  prior  year  period,
     increased 10 basis points.  Other store level initiatives that resulted in
     higher selling,  general and administrative costs included the replacement
     of  the  point-of-sale   dial-up   environment   with   a   new  broadband
     communication  network  which resulted in increased costs of approximately
     $1.1 million, and store opening and closing expenses of $0.6 million.

           Marketing costs, including  visual  merchandising  costs,  increased
     $7.5  million,  or  50  basis points, as we increased our distribution  of
     monthly Sunday newspaper inserts from three markets in late Fiscal 2002 to
     21 markets in Fiscal 2003,  in  order  to  attract new customers and drive
     traffic into the stores.  Growth in Internet  marketing,  support  for new
     store  openings  and  general increase attributable to the increased store
     count also contributed to the higher marketing dollars.

           Corporate  office   selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses
     increased  $4.9  million  compared   to   the   prior  year  but  declined
     approximately 40 basis points as a percentage of  revenue  as we leveraged
     insurance  and  payroll costs against the higher revenue base.   Corporate
     payroll,  including   bonuses,   increased   $3.5   million  as  we  built
     infrastructure to support the current and future growth  plans.  Insurance
     costs declined slightly primarily due to favorable experience  relating to
     workers'  compensation  insurance.   Costs  associated with infrastructure
     investment  in  systems  resulted  in  an  increase  in  depreciation  and
     amortization  cost  and  related  operating costs  of  approximately  $2.1
     million.   Internet selling and operating  costs  also  contributed to the
     increase during the period.  These cost increases were partially offset by
     foreign exchange gains of $1.4 million related to the strengthening of the
     Canadian  dollar,  and costs incurred during Fiscal 2002 of  $1.3  million
     related to the settlement  of  a California wage and hour lawsuit and $1.1
     million relating to the departure of the former Chief Executive Officer.


INTEREST

Fiscal 2004
During Fiscal 2004, we had interest income  of  $67,000 and interest expense of
$601,000,  compared  to interest income of $176,000  and  interest  expense  of
$621,000 in Fiscal 2003.   Interest  income  declined as we had lower levels of
invested  cash  balances  during  the  year  resulting   from   the   lack   of
profitability.  However, interest expense also declined as we managed inventory
levels and maintained average borrowing levels lower than in Fiscal 2003.

Fiscal 2003
During  Fiscal 2003, we had interest income of $176,000 and interest expense of
$621,000,  compared  to  interest  income  of  $331,000 and interest expense of
$152,000 in Fiscal 2002.  Decline in interest income  and  increase  in expense
are the result of lower invested cash balances and greater utilization  of  the
credit  facility in the current year.  Funds were primarily used to finance our
capital expansion plan, with the addition of 49 locations, and higher inventory
levels to  support  both  the higher store count and the increase in same store
sales.

INCOME TAXES

We provided income tax benefit  of  $6.5  million in Fiscal 2004 and income tax
expense  of  $6.2 million and $5.1 million in  Fiscal  2003  and  Fiscal  2002,
respectively.   The  effective  rates  were  34.6%,  38.7%  and  41.2%  in  the
respective  periods.  Fluctuations in the effective rate were primarily related
to foreign taxes  associated  with  our  Canadian  subsidiary  and the relative
significance of the profit generated by the Canadian subsidiary  to the overall
consolidated entity, as well as the impact of state tax expenses that  have not
changed proportionately to income (loss) before income taxes.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The  primary  sources  of  liquidity  and capital resources are cash flows from
operations and a line of credit.  We have a secured, revolving credit agreement
with a group of banks, with an aggregate  commitment  of up to $125 million for
working  capital,  inventory  financing  and  letter of credit  purposes.   The
available  commitment  under  the  facility  is limited  to  a  borrowing  base
generally comprised of 75% of eligible inventory  and  85%  of  receivables, as
defined in the credit agreement and with seasonal and reserve adjustments.  The
aggregate commitment under the facility can be increased to $175  million prior
to September 15, 2007, at the request of the Company.  At January 29, 2005, the
bank  commitment  was  $70.2  million,  and  $61.4  million  was available  for
borrowings  or  additional  letters  of  credit.   The credit facility  expires
September 15, 2009.

Fiscal 2004
During Fiscal 2004, we ended the year with cash and  long-term  investments  of
$9.2  million,  $16.5  million  lower  than  at the previous year end.  Capital
expenditures were the primary use of cash, at  $36.9  million,  as we opened 66
stores,  including  50 large format stores and 16 BombayKIDS locations,  and  a
distribution center during  the  year  in  addition  to  routine  purchases  of
software and equipment.

Although  we  recorded a net loss of $12.2 million, cash provided by operations
was $19.3 million,  due  primarily to non-cash depreciation and amortization of
$18.8 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $15.8
million.  Cash flows from  operations  also  reflects $11.6 million of landlord
construction allowances from store and distribution  center landlords that help
reduce the net outlay of cash related to the new construction.

At  January  29,  2005,  inventory balances were $5.8 million  higher  than  at
January 31, 2004, due primarily  to higher level of merchandise in-transit from
the vendors as of the end of the year.  Inventory at the store level and in the
distribution centers was similar to  last year's levels.  Inventory was $72 per
square foot of retail space as of the  end  of  Fiscal 2004 compared to $75 per
square foot last year.  On a per store basis, inventories decreased to $288,000
per  store  compared  to $294,000 per store last year.   We  believe  that  the
quality of merchandise  is  much  improved compared to last year with a greater
portion of the assortment consisting  of  new  product  to  support Fiscal 2005
sales.

From  a  liquidity  and  capital  expenditures standpoint, our strategy  is  to
utilize our credit facility to finance  seasonal borrowings and working capital
required by store growth while we utilize  cash  flow  from  operations and our
balance sheet to finance our capital programs.  The operating  loss  for Fiscal
2004  and  the  resulting decline in the cash balance has caused us to reassess
our liquidity and  capital  program  and  investigate  alternatives to fund the
continued  migration  of stores from mall to off-mall and  the  growth  of  the
BombayKIDS stores.   Management has developed a plan that calls for a reduction
in store growth for Fiscal 2005 compared to levels previously announced and the
disposal of certain assets  which are either non-operating assets or are not an
integral component of our core  operations.   In November, we announced that we
plan to divest the Bailey Street wholesale operations.  We are currently in the
process of assessing sale and liquidation scenarios as well as a combination of
both.    Substantially all of the assets of Bailey Street  are  current  assets
(inventory  and  accounts  receivable).   We  also  plan  to sell non-operating
assets,  including  a Company-owned building occupied by a third  party  and  a
parcel of land adjacent to our Company headquarters, in order to supplement our
available  capital.   We   expect  that  the  proceeds  from  the  sale  and/or
liquidation of our Bailey Street  operation,  along  with  the sale of land and
building, should be adequate, when added to expected cash flow from operations,
to fund our capital expenditure program and result in a higher  cash balance at
the end of Fiscal 2005.

Our capital requirements for Fiscal 2005 are estimated to be $20 to $25 million
and  includes  opening  45  to  50  new  stores  during  the year while closing
approximately  42 stores, resulting in an ending store count  of  approximately
505 to 510 stores.   Other  capital  expenditure plans include the opening of a
new distribution center to replace an  existing  undersized  facility in Canada
and continued investment in information systems.

Fiscal 2003
During  Fiscal 2003, we used $31.0 million of cash, ending the year with  $25.6
million in  cash  and  long-term investments.  The decline in the level of cash
from Fiscal 2002, for both  year-end  comparisons and throughout the period, is
due to our higher capital expenditures  and  corresponding  inventory levels in
Fiscal  2003 to support the additional stores and growth in same  store  sales.
The primary  sources  of cash were net income, including non-cash depreciation,
amortization expense and deferred tax expense, as well as the exercise of stock
options.  Cash was primarily  used  for  capital expansion, partially offset by
construction  allowances  granted  by landlords,  and  to  purchase  additional
inventory to support the larger store  base  and  increased  same  store sales.
Other significant uses of cash included the payment of federal income taxes and
a decrease in other current assets, primarily due to a decrease in prepaid rent
resulting from the timing of the end of the fiscal period.

Capital expenditures totaled $41.1 million and included the costs of opening 53
large  format  stores,  30  KIDS  stores, one outlet, a distribution center  in
Plainfield, Indiana, investments in  new point-of-sale, planning and allocation
and other systems and routine purchases  of equipment.  These expenditures were
partially  offset  by  construction allowances  of  $11.9  million  granted  by
landlords.

At January 31, 2004, inventory  levels  were  $138.9  million  or $36.1 million
higher  than  at  February  1,  2003.  This increase represents investments  to
support the additional number of  stores and higher sales levels.  The year end
level was above desired levels as a  result of aggressively buying to Christmas
sales that did not materialize.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In the course of preparing the financial  statements,  management makes certain
judgments  relative  to  accounting  policies  that  are  appropriate   in  the
circumstances  and  the  application of those policies.  The following policies
are those deemed to be most critical.

Inventory Valuation
Inventories are valued at  the  lower  of  cost  or  market,  with  cost  being
determined based upon the weighted average inventory method. Cost is calculated
based upon the actual landed cost of an item at the time it is received in  the
warehouse based upon actual vendor invoices, or estimates of costs for which an
invoice is not present, or for which an allocation of shared costs is required.
In addition, we include the cost of warehousing and transporting product to the
stores in our costs.

We  regularly  evaluate  our  compliance  with  the  lower  of  cost  or market
principle.  Items are evaluated by SKU and, to the extent that the cost  of the
item  exceeds  the  current  selling  price,  provision  is  made to reduce the
carrying cost of the item.  Additionally, we review the aging  of our inventory
by  SKU.   The  carrying  cost  of  the item is reduced based upon certain  age
criteria and product category.  Since  the  determination  of carrying value of
inventory  involves  both  estimation  and judgment of cost and  market  value,
differences in these estimates could result  in  valuations  that vary from the
recorded amount.

                                       19

<PAGE> 20

Each month, we record an allowance for shrinkage to provide for  the  estimated
cost  of  lost  or stolen inventory.  The amount of the allowance is determined
based upon the historical  shrinkage  results and is adjusted at least annually
to  reflect current circumstances.  Inventory  is  physically  counted  at  all
locations  at  least once each year, at which time actual results are reflected
in the financial  statements.   Physical counts were taken at substantially all
stores and distribution centers during January 2005.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We review long-lived assets with  definite lives at least annually and whenever
events or changes in circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value of the
asset  may  not  be  recoverable.   This  review  includes  the  evaluation  of
individual  under-performing  retail stores and assessing the recoverability of
the carrying value of the fixed assets related to the store.  Future cash flows
are  projected  for  the remaining  lease  life  using  a  probability-weighted
approach to estimate the  fair  value  of  the store assets.  These projections
consider such factors as future sales levels,  gross  margins,  changes in rent
and  other  expenses  as well as the overall operating environment specific  to
that store.  If the estimated  future  cash  flows  are  less than the carrying
value  of the assets, we record an impairment charge equal  to  the  difference
between  the  assets'  fair  value and carrying value.  Since the projection of
future cash flows involves judgment and estimates, differences in circumstances
or estimates could produce different results.

Income Taxes
In  determining net loss for financial  statement  purposes,  we  make  certain
estimates  and  judgments  in the calculation of tax  benefit and the resulting
tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

In the ordinary course of business,  there may be transactions and calculations
where  the  ultimate  tax  outcome is not  certain.   The  calculation  of  tax
liabilities involves dealing  with  uncertainties in the application of complex
tax laws.  We recognize potential liabilities  for anticipated tax audit issues
in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on  an  estimate  of the ultimate
resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes  will  be due.
Although  we  believe  that  the  estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be
given that the final outcome of these  matters  will not be different than what
is reflected in the current and historical income tax provisions and accruals.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for items that have a difference between the
time they are deductible for financial statement  purposes and for tax purposes
as well as for net operating loss carryforwards and  credit  carryforwards.  As
of January 29, 2005, we have recorded $9.4 million of net deferred  tax assets,
including net operating loss and credit carryforwards of $4.0 million  recorded
during  Fiscal  2004 as a result of our net taxable loss exceeding amounts  for
which a carryback was available.

Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 109, Accounting for
Income  Taxes, requires that deferred tax assets  be  reduced  by  a  valuation
allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some
portion or  all  of  the  recorded  deferred tax assets will not be realized in
future periods. This assessment requires  significant  judgment,  and  the fact
that  a  benefit  may  be  expected for a portion but not all of a deferred tax
asset increases the judgmental complexity.

We evaluate the realizability  of  our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis,
considering  all  available  positive  and  negative  evidence,  including  the
reversal patterns of the assets, our past  results, the existence of cumulative
losses  in recent years, our forecast of future  taxable  income  and  on-going
prudent and  feasible  tax planning strategies.  A significant factor impacting
our evaluation of the deferred  tax assets recorded as of January 29, 2005, was
the net loss recognized for Fiscal  2004.   We  believe that the performance of
Fiscal 2004 will not be repeated and that we will  return  to  profitability in
Fiscal 2005 and beyond for the following reasons:

      We  entered  2005 with an improved inventory mix having  elected  to
      clear much of the undesirable  inventory in late Fiscal 2004 whereas last
      year,  we  entered  the  year  with  an  oversupply  of  core  and  basic
      merchandise, which restricted our ability to introduce new, fresh product
      into the assortment and resulted in higher inventory carrying costs.

      We  have  taken measures to substantially  improve  our  merchandise
      assortment and the process by which we introduce new product and exit old
      product under the leadership of our new general merchandise manager.

      We do not expect  the supply chain interruption and additional costs
      that we experienced as a  result  of the imposition of antidumping duties
      on  bedroom furniture from China, which  necessitated  moving  production
      from China to Vietnam and other alternative source countries.

      We  have  an  increased number of stores in off-mall locations where
      operating costs are  lower  and  where we have experienced higher average
      sales volumes, thus helping to improve  the  overall profitability of our
      stores.  Additionally, many of these stores were  relatively  new or were
      the  result of migrating from mall to off-mall locations.  As the  stores
      become more mature, we expect overall sales volumes to strengthen.

      We have fewer new store openings planned for Fiscal 2005, which will
      reduce  store  opening expenses and help to reduce the cannibalization of
      existing stores, thereby enhancing profitability.

      We have taken  steps  to  reduce general and administrative costs in
      order to right size the organization and improve profitability.

                                     20

Based upon our evaluation, we have concluded  that  it  is more likely than not
that  the  benefit of the deferred tax assets will be realized  and,  thus,  no
valuation allowance  has  been established as of January 29, 2005.  However, if
our  plans for the return to  profitability  in  the  future  do  not  come  to
fruition,  or if other conditions indicate that the benefit of the deferred tax
assets is more  likely  than  not  to  be  realized, we will record a valuation
allowance  to  reduce  the assets to their realizable  value.   Such  valuation
allowance, if established,  would  serve to increase our tax expense and reduce
net income in the period in which it is recorded.

Insurance
We  are self-insured with respect to  medical  and  dental  insurance  coverage
offered  to  our  eligible  employees,  up  to a maximum of $150,000 per claim.
Above that amount, medical insurance coverage  is in place.  In connection with
the self-insured portion, we maintain a liability  for  claims  that are in the
process of being paid and those that have been incurred but not yet reported to
our  insurance  carrier.   We base the amount of the liability upon  historical
claims experience and actuarial  estimates  regarding  the  exposure for claims
incurred but not yet reported.  At January 29, 2005, the balance of the medical
and dental liability was $957,000.

Since  Fiscal  2001,  we  have also maintained workers' compensation  insurance
coverage with a deductible  of  up to $150,000 per claim.  At January 29, 2005,
we had recorded a liability of $3.1  million, representing the estimated amount
that will have to be paid in future periods related to the settlement of claims
under the insurance policies for Fiscal  2001  through Fiscal 2004.  The amount
of the liability reflects expected remaining workers' compensation claims based
upon  actuarial  estimates, utilizing historical claims  experience  and  other
relevant  information   and   trends.   Prior  to  Fiscal  2001,  our  workers'
compensation insurance was not  subject  to  a deductible.  Beginning in Fiscal
2005,  our  workers' compensation insurance deductible  will  be  $250,000  per
claim.

If circumstances change or if information becomes available that would indicate
that future payments  with  respect to insurance liabilities would be different
than  what  was  previously  estimated,   we   will   adjust  such  liabilities
accordingly.  Since the amounts recorded for insurance  liabilities  are  based
upon various estimates, actual future requirements could vary from the recorded
liabilities.

New Accounting Pronouncements
In  January  2003,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Interpretation   46,  Consolidation  of  Variable  Interest   Entities   -   An
Interpretation of  ARB  No.  51  ("FIN 46").  FIN 46 is intended to clarify the
application  of  ARB  No. 51, Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  to  certain
entities in which equity  investors  do  not  have  the  characteristics  of  a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the
entity  to  finance  its  activities  without additional subordinated financial
support.  For  those  entities,  a controlling  financial  interest  cannot  be
identified based on an evaluation  of  voting  interests  and  may  be achieved
through  arrangements  that  do not involve voting interests. The consolidation
requirement  of  FIN 46 was effective  immediately  to  variable  interests  in
variable interest entities ("VIEs") created or obtained after January 31, 2003.
FIN 46 also sets forth certain disclosures regarding interests in VIEs that are
deemed significant,  even  if consolidation is not required.  In December 2003,
the  FASB issued FIN 46 (revised  December  2003),  Consolidation  of  Variable
Interest  Entities  ("FIN  46R"),  which  delayed  the  effective  date  of the
application  of  FIN  46 to us for non-special purpose VIEs acquired or created
before February 1, 2003,  to  our  interim  period  ended  on  May 1, 2004, and
provided additional technical clarifications to implementation issues.   During
Fiscal  2004,  we  adopted the provisions of FIN 46R.  Since we do not have any
VIEs, the adoption of  FIN  46R  had  no  impact  on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

In  November  2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory  Costs.   SFAS  151
requires that fixed  production  costs  be  allocated to inventory based on the
normal  capacity of production facilities and  that  unallocated  overheads  be
recognized  as  an  expense  in  the  periods  in  which they are incurred.  In
addition, other items such as abnormal freight, handling  costs  and amounts of
excess spoilage require treatment as current-period charges rather  than  as  a
portion of the inventory cost.  SFAS 151 is effective for Fiscal 2006, at which
time  we  will  adopt  the  provisions  of  the standard.  We do not expect the
adoption  of  the  standard  to  have  a material impact  on  our  consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.  123 (Revised 2004) ("123R"), Share-
Based Payment.  SFAS 123R establishes standards for accounting for transactions
in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services.  The
primary  focus  of SFAS 123R is on employee services  obtained  in  share-based
payment transactions.   SFAS  123R  requires  that  all share-based payments to
employees  be  recognized  in the financial statements based  upon  their  fair
values.  The cost will be recognized  over  the period during which an employee
is required to provide services in exchange for  the  award.   The  standard is
effective for our financial statements beginning in Fiscal 2006, at which  time
we  will  adopt  its  provisions.   We  are  in  the  process  of  planning our
implementation  and  evaluating  the  impact  of  adoption  on our consolidated
financial position and results of operations.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse  changes  in the
value  of  financial  instruments.  The risk of loss is assessed based upon the
likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.

We have exposure to interest rate risk, as borrowings under our credit facility
are based upon LIBOR, prime  and other benchmark rates which may fluctuate with
market conditions.  Based upon  our  seasonal borrowing levels, management does
not believe that a change in interest  rates  of  100 basis points would have a
significant  impact  on  our  consolidated  financial position  or  results  of
operations.

International purchases of inventory are primarily denominated in United States
dollars,  which  reduces our risk to foreign exchange  rate  fluctuation.   Our
greatest foreign exchange exposure is with respect to intercompany transactions
with our Canadian  subsidiary and translation of their financial statements for
inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.

As  of  January 29, 2005  we  had  no  debt  or  other  market  risk  sensitive
instruments.


ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

The index  to  the  consolidated financial statements is found on page 28.  Our
consolidated financial  statements  and  notes  to  the  consolidated financial
statements follow the index.


ITEM  9.   CHANGES  IN  AND  DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON  ACCOUNTING  AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES.

There have been no changes in or disagreements with accountants on accounting
or financial disclosures.


ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

We maintain disclosure controls  and  procedures  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
under  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended  (the  "Exchange  Act"))
that are  designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information that we
are required  to  disclose  in  the  reports  that  we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported  within  the  time
periods  specified  in  the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated  to  our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer,  as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.  It should  be  noted  that, because of inherent
limitations, our disclosure controls and procedures, however  well designed and
operated,  can  provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance  that  the
objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.

Management began a review of our accounting policies and practices with respect
to leases during  the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 based upon their monitoring
of  restatement activity  and  the  related  communication  within  the  retail
industry.   As  a  result  of this internal review, we identified errors in our
reporting of landlord allowances  within  the  consolidated  statements of cash
flows.   Landlord  allowances,  although  clearly  separately identified,  were
improperly  included  as  a component of cash flows from  investing  activities
instead  of  cash  flows from  operating  activities.    Accordingly,  we  have
restated our consolidated  statements  of cash flows for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal
2002.  Management, with the participation  of  the  Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, has performed an evaluation of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of January 29, 2005, and for the reason  set forth below, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded  that  as of
January 29, 2005, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective  at
a  reasonable level of assurance, based on the evaluation of these controls and
procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b).

In light  of  the  material  weakness  described below, we performed additional
analysis  and  other  procedures  to ensure  that  our  consolidated  financial
statements  were  prepared in accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles. Accordingly,  management  believes  that  the  financial statements
included  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly,  in  all  material
respects, our  financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the
periods presented  in  conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our  management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate
internal control over  financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-
15(f). Our internal control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process that is
designed  under  the  supervision  of  our  Chief  Executive Officer and  Chief
Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other
personnel,  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial  statements  for  external
purposes  in  accordance  with accounting principles generally accepted in  the
United  States of America.   Our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting
includes those policies and procedures that:




   i.  Pertain to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable detail,
       accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our
       assets;

   ii.   Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as
         necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
         with accounting principles generally accepted in  the  United  States
         of  America, and that receipts and expenditures  recorded  by  us  are
         being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management
         and  Board  of Directors of the Company; and

   iii.  Provide reasonable assurance regarding  prevention  or timely detection
         of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
         could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control  over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness  to  future  periods are subject to the risk  that  controls  may
become inadequate because of  changes  in  conditions,  or  that  the degree of
compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Management,  with  the  participation of our Chief Executive Officer and  Chief
Financial  Officer,  performed  an  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2005.  In
making this assessment,  we  used  the  criteria set forth in Internal Control-
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the "COSO").

A  material  weakness  is  a  control deficiency,  or  combination  of  control
deficiencies, that results in more  than  a  remote  likelihood that a material
misstatement  of  the  annual  or  interim  financial statements  will  not  be
prevented or detected. Management has concluded  that  as  of January 29, 2005,
our  controls  over  the  selection  and  application  of our lease  accounting
policies  related  to  the  classification  of landlord allowances  within  the
consolidated  statements of cash flows were ineffective  to  ensure  that  such
leasing transactions were reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows
in accordance with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the United
States  of  America.   Specifically,  the  deficiency in our controls over  the
selection and application of our lease accounting  policies  failed to identify
misstatements  in  the  reporting of cash provided by operating activities  and
cash used in investing activities  reported  in  the consolidated statements of
cash flows, which resulted in the restatement of our  Fiscal  2003  and  Fiscal
2002  annual  consolidated  financial  statements.  Additionally,  this control
deficiency  could  result  in  a  misstatement  of  cash  provided by operating
activities  and  cash  used  in  investing activities that would  result  in  a
material misstatement to annual or  interim financial statements that would not
be prevented or detected. Accordingly,  management,  with  the participation of
our  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has  determined  that
this control  deficiency  constituted  a  material  weakness.   Because of this
material weakness, management has concluded that as of January 29, 2005, we did
not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  based  on the
criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
COSO.

Our independent registered public accounting  firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
has audited our management's assessment of the  effectiveness  of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2005  as  stated in
their report, which is included herein.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the
fiscal  quarter  ended  January 29, 2005 that have materially affected, or  are
reasonably likely to materially  affect,  our  internal  control over financial
reporting.

In the first quarter of 2005, the Company enhanced its monitoring of
developments surrounding the accounting for leases and revised its accounting
policies with respect to classification of tenant allowances.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Bombay Company, Inc.:

We have completed an integrated audit of The Bombay Company, Inc.'s fiscal 2004
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of January 29, 2005 and audits of its fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Our opinions, based
on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of The Bombay Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
"Company") at January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
January 29, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit of
financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
has restated its fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 consolidated financial statements.


Internal control over financial reporting

Also, we have audited management's assessment, included in Management's Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that The
Bombay Company, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of January 29, 2005, because the Company did not maintain
effective controls over its selection and application of lease accounting
policies related to the classification of landlord allowances within the
Company's consolidated statements of cash flows, based on criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on
management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  An audit of
internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's
assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control
deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be
prevented or detected.  The following material weakness has been identified and
included in management's assessment.  As of January 29, 2005, management has
concluded that the Company's controls over the selection and application of its
lease accounting policies related to the classification of landlord allowances
within the consolidated statements of cash flows were ineffective to ensure
that such leasing transactions were reported in the consolidated statements of
cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Specifically, the deficiency in the Company's
controls over the selection and application of its lease accounting policies
failed to identify misstatements in the reporting of cash provided by operating
activities and cash used in investing activities reported in the consolidated
statements of cash flows, which resulted in the restatement of the Company's
fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 annual consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, this control deficiency could result in a misstatement of cash
provided by operating activities and cash used in investing activities that
would result in a material misstatement to annual or interim financial
statements that would not be prevented or detected.  Accordingly, management
has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.
This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and
extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the fiscal 2004 consolidated
financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion
on those consolidated financial statements.

In our opinion, management's assessment that The Bombay Company, Inc. did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29,
2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.  Also, in our
opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the
achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, The Bombay Company, Inc.
has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
January 29, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   The Bombay Company, Inc. and Subsidiaries


NOTE 1 - STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The Bombay Company, Inc. and  its  wholly-owned subsidiaries design, source and
market a unique line of fashionable  home accessories, wall decor and furniture
through a network of retail locations  throughout the United States and Canada,
through  specialty  catalogs,  over the Internet  and  internationally  through
licensing  arrangements.   We  also  have  a  small  wholesale  operation  that
distributes a separate line of occasional  furniture.   Throughout this report,
the  terms  "our",  "we",  "us",  "Bombay" and "Company" refer  to  The  Bombay
Company, Inc., including its subsidiaries.

The consolidated financial statements  include  the  accounts of Bombay and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions, balances
and  profits  have  been  eliminated.   Certain prior year  amounts  have  been
reclassified to conform to current year presentation.  Bombay has a retail (52-
53  week)  fiscal year, which ends on the Saturday  nearest  January  31.   The
periods ended  January  29,  2005  ("Fiscal  2004"),  January 31, 2004 ("Fiscal
2003") and February 1, 2003 ("Fiscal 2002") reflect 52 weeks.

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with  generally  accepted
accounting  principles  requires  management to make estimates.  Such estimates
are based on historical experience  and  on  various  other assumptions that we
believe  to  be  reasonable  under the circumstances.  These  estimates  affect
reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenues,  expenses  and  related
disclosures.  Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The functional currency of our Canadian  operations  is  the  Canadian  dollar.
Fiscal year end exchange rates are used to translate assets and liabilities  to
U.S.  dollars.  Monthly average exchange rates are used to translate income and
expenses.   We  record  the  cumulative  effect of foreign currency translation
adjustments   in   accumulated  other  comprehensive   income   (loss)   within
stockholders' equity.  During Fiscal 2004, Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002, foreign
exchange gain totaled  $551,000,  $1,377,000 and $23,000, respectively, related
to transactions of our Canadian subsidiary.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
We consider cash in stores, deposits  in  banks and short-term investments with
original or remaining maturities of three months or less when purchased as cash
and cash equivalents for the purposes of the  financial statements.  Short-term
investments are recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value.

INVENTORIES
Inventories consist primarily of finished merchandise  and  are  valued  at the
lower  of  cost  or  market, with cost being determined based upon the weighted
average inventory method.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment  are  recorded  at  cost  and  are  depreciated over the
estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line  method  over  the
lives shown:

 Building...............  Forty years
 Furniture and equipment  Two to ten years
 Leasehold improvements.  The lesser of the life of the lease or asset

Landlord  construction  allowances  are recorded as accrued rent and other long
term liabilities, and are amortized as  a  reduction  of  rent expense over the
life of the related lease.

We  charge  maintenance  and  repairs  to  expense  as  they are incurred.   We
capitalize  improvements and betterments which materially  prolong  the  useful
lives of the  assets.   As  property is retired or sold, we remove the cost and
related accumulated depreciation  from  the accounts, and we recognize gains or
losses in the statements of income.

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS
We  capitalize certain external and internal  costs  associated  with  computer
software   and  significant  enhancements  to  software  features  of  existing
products.  We  amortize  the  costs utilizing the straight-line method over the
estimated economic lives of the  software,  which  range  from  three  to seven
years.  Total costs capitalized were $17,522,000 and $15,128,000 at January 29,
2005  and January 31, 2004, respectively.  Accumulated amortization related  to
these assets  was  $12,195,000  and $10,016,000 at January 29, 2005 and January
31, 2004, respectively.

                                       37

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
During  Fiscal  2002,  we adopted the  provisions  of  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.  SFAS  144  requires  that  long-lived  assets with definite
lives  be  evaluated  for  impairment  whenever  conditions indicate  that  the
carrying  value of the assets may not be recoverable.   In  determining  if  an
impairment  exists,  assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which there
are identifiable cash  flows  that  are  largely independent of cash flows from
other  groups of assets.  In performing this  impairment  test,  we  group  our
assets at  the  store  level.  If  an  impairment  exists,  the  amount  of the
impairment  is  measured  as  the difference between the carrying value and the
estimated fair value of the assets.

GOODWILL
We test goodwill for impairment  at least annually, as of the end of the fiscal
year, and whenever conditions indicate  that  such  an  impairment could exist.
Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the estimated  fair value of our
net  assets  to  their  carrying  value.   If  the  carrying value exceeds  the
estimated fair value, we calculate the implied value  of goodwill and recognize
an impairment loss.  No impairment was recorded in Fiscal  2004, Fiscal 2003 or
Fiscal 2002.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
We recognize revenue when delivery has occurred, the sales price  is  fixed  or
determinable,  and  collectibility  is reasonably assured.  Revenues are net of
returns and exclude sales tax.

We  include  in revenues amounts collected  from  customers  for  shipping  and
handling orders.   In  Fiscal 2004, Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002, these revenues
totaled $7,149,000, $6,566,000  and  $4,626,000,  respectively.  The associated
shipping and handling expenses are included in cost of sales.

GIFT CERTIFICATES
We record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and  certificates as a liability
at  the  time  we  receive them.  When the holder of the  card  or  certificate
redeems it for merchandise, we relieve the liability and recognize revenue.

COST OF SALES, BUYING AND STORE OCCUPANCY COSTS
We include in cost of  sales  all costs associated with the purchase of product
including,  but not limited to,  vendor  cost,  inbound  transportation  costs,
duties, commission,  inspections,  quality  control,  warehousing  and outbound
transportation costs.  Buying costs include expenses associated with our buying
department,  consisting primarily of salaries, travel, product development  and
product sample costs.  Store occupancy costs include costs such as rent, common
area maintenance  charges,  utilities  and  depreciation  and  amortization  of
leasehold improvements and other fixed assets relating to our retail locations.

ADVERTISING COSTS
We  expense  advertising  costs  the  first  time  the advertising takes place.
During  Fiscal  2004,  Fiscal  2003  and Fiscal 2002, advertising  expense  was
$29,018,000, $27,604,000 and $20,258,000, respectively.

INCOME TAXES
We use the liability method of computing  deferred income taxes on all material
temporary differences.  Temporary differences  are  the differences between the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their  tax bases.  We assess the
realizability  of  deferred  tax  assets based on available  evidence  and,  if
necessary, provide a valuation allowance  if  it  is  more likely than not that
some  portion  or all of the deferred tax assets will not  be  realized.   This
assessment requires  significant  judgment,  and the fact that a benefit may be
expected  for  a  portion but not all of a deferred  tax  asset  increases  the
judgmental complexity.

All  unremitted earnings  of  the  foreign  subsidiary  are  considered  to  be
permanently reinvested.  Accordingly, no U.S. deferred taxes have been provided
on such earnings.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)
Comprehensive  income  (loss) represents the change in equity (net assets) of a
business enterprise during  a  period  from  transactions  and other events and
circumstances from non-owner sources.  It includes all changes in equity during
a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to
owners.   Such  amounts are included in accumulated other comprehensive  income
(loss) within stockholders'  equity  and  consist  of  the cumulative effect of
foreign  currency  translation  adjustments.   There is no tax  effect  on  the
cumulative effect of foreign currency translation  adjustments as undistributed
earnings of the Canadian subsidiary are considered to be permanently reinvested
and  will  continue  to  be reinvested in this subsidiary  in  the  foreseeable
future.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In January 2003, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB
Interpretation Number ("FIN") 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities -
An Interpretation of ARB No. 51.   FIN  46  addresses consolidation by business
enterprises  of variable interest entities ("VIEs")  in  which  the  enterprise
absorbs a majority  of  the  VIE's  expected losses, receives a majority of the
VIE's expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual
or other financial interests in the VIE.   In  December  2003, the FASB amended
and clarified FIN 46 by issuing FIN 46R.  During Fiscal 2004,  we  adopted  the
provisions  of FIN 46R.  The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact
on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151, Inventory Costs.  SFAS 151 requires
that fixed production  costs  be  allocated  to  inventory  based on the normal
capacity of production facilities and that unallocated overheads  be recognized
as  an  expense in the periods in which they are incurred.  In addition,  other
items such  as  abnormal freight, handling costs and amounts of excess spoilage
require treatment  as  current-period  charges  rather than as a portion of the
inventory cost.  SFAS 151 is effective for Fiscal  2006,  at which time we will
adopt the provisions of the standard.   We do not expect the  adoption  of  the
standard  to  have  a material impact on our consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

In  December 2004, the  FASB  issued  SFAS  123R  (Revised  2004),  Share-Based
Payment.   SFAS  123R  establishes standards for accounting for transactions in
which an entity exchanges  its  equity  instruments for goods or services.  The
primary  focus of SFAS 123R is on employee  services  obtained  in  share-based
payment transactions.   SFAS  123R  requires  that  all share-based payments to
employees  be  recognized  in the financial statements based  upon  their  fair
values.  The cost will be recognized  over  the period during which an employee
is required to provide services in exchange for  the  award.   The  standard is
effective for our financial statements beginning in Fiscal 2006, at which  time
we  will  adopt  its  provisions.   We  are  in  the  process  of  planning our
implementation  and  evaluating  the  impact  of  adoption  on our consolidated
financial position and results of operations.

EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share are based upon the weighted average  number  of shares
outstanding.   Diluted  earnings  per share are based upon the weighted average
number of shares outstanding plus the shares that would be outstanding assuming
exercise  of  dilutive stock options  and  distribution  of  deferred  director
compensation.

The computation  for basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are as follows
(in thousands, except per share amounts):

During  Fiscal 2004,  we  reported  a  net  loss.   Accordingly,  common  stock
equivalents  would  be  anti-dilutive  during  the  period  and,  thus, are not
included  in the computation of diluted loss per share.  At January  29,  2005,
3,114,000 stock options and 51,000 units of deferred director compensation were
potentially dilutive securities which were excluded from the computation.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
We apply the  recognition  and  measurement principles of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to Employees, and related
interpretations, and the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based  Compensation, in accounting for our stock-based  incentive  plans.
No compensation  expense  related to grants of stock options has been reflected
in net income (loss), as all  options  granted  under the plans had an exercise
price equal to the market price of Bombay's common  stock on the date of grant.
Compensation expense related to grants of restricted  stock  is measured as the
quoted market price of Bombay's common stock at the measurement date, amortized
to expense over the vesting period.  The following table illustrates the effect
on net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share if we had applied  the  fair
value  recognition  provisions  of  SFAS  123 to stock-based compensation.  For
purposes of the pro forma disclosures below,  the  estimated  fair value of the
options is recognized as expense over the vesting period (in thousands):

NOTE 2 - RESTATEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004, we began an
evaluation  of  our  lease  accounting  practices and  determined  that it  was
appropriate  to  restate previously issued financial statements.  Historically,
we have recognized  store  lease  expense on a straight-line basis beginning on
the date that the store opened.  This generally had the effect of excluding the
pre-opening store build out, fixturing  and merchandise stocking periods during
which the Company typically had no rent payments.  Based upon our evaluation of
our  lease  accounting  practices,  we have adopted  an  accounting  policy  to
capitalize rent during the construction  period   and  recognize  straight-line
rent expense upon the store becoming  substantially complete and ready  for its
intended  use, which results  in  us  recording  rent  expense during the
merchandise stocking periods.

Additionally,   in  prior  periods,  we  reflected   proceeds   from   landlord
construction allowances  as a component of cash flows from investing activities
in the Consolidated Statements  of Cash Flows.  We have restated our historical
Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 Consolidated  Statements  of  Cash Flows to reflect
such proceeds as a component of cash flows from operating activities.

NOTE 3 - STORE IMPAIRMENTS

We  review long-lived assets with definite lives at least annually and whenever
events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying value of the
asset  may  not  be  recoverable.   This  review  includes  the  evaluation  of
individual under-performing retail stores and  assessing  the recoverability of
the carrying value of the fixed assets related to the store.  Future cash flows
are  projected  for  the  remaining  lease  life  using  a probability-weighted
approach  to  estimate the fair value of the store assets.   These  projections
consider such factors  as  future  sales levels, gross margins, changes in rent
and other expenses as well as the overall  operating  environment  specific  to
that  store.   If  the  estimated  future cash flows are less than the carrying
value of the assets, we record an impairment  charge  equal  to  the difference
between  the  assets'  fair value and carrying value.  Since the projection  of
future cash flows involves judgment and estimates, differences in circumstances
or estimates could produce different results.

Following the holiday selling  season in our fourth fiscal quarter, we reviewed
our real estate portfolio for impairment, focusing on store locations currently
operating at a loss.  Of the 502  Company-owned  stores  open as of January 29,
2005, ten stores were identified for which the carrying amounts  of  the  store
assets  were  not  expected  to  be recoverable.  As a result of the review, we
recorded an impairment charge to buying  and  occupancy  costs  of  $534,000 to
reduce  the  carrying  value  of  the  assets to their estimated net realizable
values.  Similar reviews, performed in Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002, resulted in
charges to buying and occupancy costs of $244,000 and $693,000, respectively.


NOTE 4 - DEBT

Effective September 29, 2004, we entered into a secured credit agreement with a
group of banks, pursuant to a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Retail Finance,
LLC, as Arranger and Administrative Agent.   The facility replaced our previous
$75 million facility, all indebtedness under which  was  repaid coincident with
the  closing  of the new facility.  The new facility is comprised  of  separate
lines of credit  in the United States and in Canada, with separate availability
bases.   The United  States  and  Canadian  lines  are  secured  by  inventory,
receivables  and  certain  other  assets  of  the Company and its United States
subsidiaries.   The Canadian line is also secured  by  certain  assets  of  the
Company's Canadian  subsidiary,  which can borrow up to US$18 million under the
line in certain circumstances.  Aggregate  borrowings  under  the United States
and Canadian lines cannot exceed $125 million, except as noted below.

The facility may be used for working capital, inventory financing,  and  letter
of  credit  needs.  Borrowings under the facility may be made, at the Company's
option and, subject  to  certain  limitations,  in  the form of loans or by the
issuance  of bankers' acceptances with respect to inventory  purchases.   Loans
under the facility  bear interest, at the Company's option, at either the prime
lending rate of Wells  Fargo Bank, National Association, or the LIBOR rate plus
a margin of 1.00% to 1.75%,  with  such margin depending on the amount by which
the average available commitment exceeds  usage  under the line.  The available
commitment  under  the  facility  is  limited  to  a borrowing  base  generally
comprised of 75% of eligible inventory and 85% of receivables,  as  defined  in
the  credit agreement and with seasonal and reserve adjustments.  The aggregate
commitment  under  the  facility  can  be  increased  to  $175 million prior to
September  15,  2007,  at  the  request  of the Company.  The facility  expires
September 15, 2009.

The  credit  agreement  contains  no covenants  regarding  the  maintenance  of
financial ratios, but does include other customary covenants including, but not
limited to, the maintenance of certain minimum availability under the facility;
reporting of certain financial and  operational  information to the lender; and
limitations regarding the incurrence of other debt,  creation of liens, certain
investments,  sales, transfers and dispositions of assets.   Throughout  Fiscal
2004, and continuing,  we  have  been  in  compliance with all covenants of the
credit agreement.  The credit agreement allows us to pay dividends, so long as:
no  default or event of default has occurred  and  is  continuing;  immediately
after  giving  effect  thereto, availability exceeds usage under the line by at
least $25 million; and certain  other  conditions  are  satisfied.   We are not
currently, nor have we been, restricted from paying such dividends.

At  January  29,  2005,  total availability under the facility was $70,200,000.
There were no borrowings as  of  January  29, 2005.  Letters of credit totaling
$8,812,000, primarily to support inventory  purchases,  were  outstanding,  and
$61,388,000  was  available  for  additional  borrowings  or letters of credit.
Interest expense and negotiated fees for Fiscal 2004, Fiscal  2003  and  Fiscal
2002, totaled $1,334,000, $1,086,000 and $617,000, respectively.

Deferred taxes reflect the net tax impact  of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
amounts used for income tax purposes.  Deferred  tax  assets  (liabilities) are
comprised of the following (in thousands):

         Total..............                 $9,377     $4,256
</TABLE>

As of January 29, 2005, we have recorded net deferred tax assets of $9,377,000,
including federal net operating loss carryforwards of $4,688,000,  expiring  in
Fiscal  2024,  state  net operating loss carryforwards of $589,000, expiring in
Fiscal 2005 through Fiscal  2024  and  general  business  credits,  foreign tax
credits  and  other  tax  carryforwards  of  $705,000,  expiring in Fiscal 2013
through Fiscal 2024, recorded during Fiscal 2004 as a result of our net taxable
loss exceeding amounts for which a carryback was available.

We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets  on  an ongoing basis,
considering  all  available  positive  and  negative  evidence,  including  the
reversal patterns of the assets, our past results, the existence of  cumulative
losses  in  recent  years,  our  forecast of future taxable income and on-going
prudent and feasible tax planning  strategies.   A significant factor impacting
our evaluation of the deferred tax assets recorded  as of January 29, 2005, was
the  net loss recognized for Fiscal 2004 and the likelihood  that  losses  will
continue in future years.

Based  upon  our  evaluation, we have concluded that it is more likely than not
that the benefit of  the  deferred  tax  assets  will be realized and, thus, no
valuation allowance has been established as of January  29,  2005.  However, if
our plans for the return to profitability in the future do not come to fruition
or if other conditions indicate that the benefit of the deferred  tax assets is
more  likely  than not to be realized, we will record a valuation allowance  to
reduce the assets  to  their  realizable  value.   Such valuation allowance, if
established, would serve to increase our tax expense  and  reduce net income in
the period in which it would be recorded.

The  Internal Revenue Service has completed its examination of  federal  income
tax returns  through  Fiscal  2001,  and  will be examining Fiscal 2002 through
Fiscal 2004 in the near future.  Additionally,  we  are  routinely  involved in
state  and local income tax audits and, from time to time, foreign jurisdiction
tax audits.   We  have  paid  or  accrued any liabilities associated with these
audits, and do not expect them to have  a  material  effect  on  the  Company's
consolidated financial statements.


NOTE 6 -  LEASES

We  lease  all  of  our  retail  locations  and distribution centers under non-
cancelable operating leases whose initial terms  typically  have 10-year terms,
expiring between 2005 and 2016, and may include options that permit renewal for
additional  periods.   We  also  lease certain equipment and our  field  office
facilities under non-cancelable operating  leases  whose  terms typically range
from 3 to 5 years.  During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004, we began an
evaluation of our lease accounting
practices and  have revised our lease  accounting  practices to capitalize rent
during the construction period  and recognize  straight-line  expense  upon the
store  becoming  substantially  complete  and ready for its intended use, which
results in us recording rent expense during  the  merchandise stocking periods.
As a result, we restated our consolidated financial  statements for Fiscal 2003
and Fiscal 2002.  See further discussion in Note 2.

                                       44

Minimum  rental commitments include step rent provisions,  escalation  clauses,
capital improvement  funding  and other lease concessions, which are recognized
on a straight-line basis over the  primary  lease  term which includes the pre-
opening  store  build  out,  fixturing  and  merchandise stocking  period.   In
addition  to  minimum  rental  payment,  certain  leases   require   additional
contingent rentals based on a percentage of the store's sales volumes exceeding
specified  levels as well as  reimbursement for real estate taxes, common  area
maintenance, insurance and certain other costs.

Rental  expense   included  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of
operations for operating leases was (in thousands):

NOTE 7 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

As of January 29, 2005,  we  have  outstanding  unconditional  purchase  orders
totaling $163,784,000 relating to the acquisition of inventory in Fiscal 2005.

We  have  certain  contingent  liabilities resulting from litigation and claims
incident to the ordinary course  of  business.   Management  believes  that the
probable  resolution  of  such  contingencies  will  not  materially affect our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

We are party to employment agreements with certain executives which provide for
compensation  and  certain  other  benefits.  The agreements also  provide  for
severance payments under certain circumstances.


NOTE 8 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The  Bombay Company, Inc. Employee 401(k)  Savings  and  Stock  Ownership  Plan
("401(k)  Plan")  is open to substantially all employees who have been employed
for one year and who  work  at  least  1,000  hours per year.  Under the 401(k)
Plan, a participant may contribute up to 75% of  earnings  with Bombay matching
100% of the initial 3% contribution, and 50% of the next 2%  contributed by the
participant.   Participant  contributions  and  Company  match are  paid  to  a
corporate trustee and invested in various funds or Bombay stock, as directed by
the participant.  Company matching contributions made to participants' accounts
are fully vested immediately.  Similar benefit plans are in effect for eligible
foreign employees.

To the extent employees are unable to contribute up to 5%  of their earnings to
the  401(k)  Plan  because  of  limitations  imposed  by  IRS  regulations,   a
Supplemental   Stock   Program  was  adopted.   Under  this  program,  employee
contributions  in excess  of  IRS  limitations,  along  with  Company  matching
contributions, are distributed annually in the form of Bombay common stock.

The Bombay Company,  Inc.  Stock  Purchase Program ("SPP") is open to all full-
time employees who have at least 90  days  of  service.   Each  participant may
contribute   1%  to  10%  of  qualifying  compensation,  to  a  maximum  annual
contribution of  $21,250.  Contributions  are used to purchase shares of Bombay
common stock at a discount of 15% from the  lesser  of the fair market price

                                       45

<PAGE> 46

at
the beginning or at the end of the investment period.  The participants' shares
are fully vested upon purchase.  Participants' shares are held by a third-party
administrator until the respective participant requests a distribution.

Total  Bombay contributions to these plans for Fiscal  2004,  Fiscal  2003  and
Fiscal 2002 were $756,000, $714,000 and $723,000, respectively.


NOTE 9 - COMMON STOCK AND STOCK OPTIONS

Our Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up
to an aggregate  of $30 million of Bombay's stock.  The shares may be purchased
from time to time,  through  open  market  purchases  and  privately negotiated
transactions.   During  Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002, 9,000 and  13,000  shares,
respectively, were acquired  at  an  aggregate  cost  of  $69,000  and $31,000,
respectively.  Treasury shares are used for various employee and director stock
plans as the need arises.

The Bombay Company, Inc. 1996 Long Term Incentive Stock Plan ("Employee  Plan")
provides  for  the  granting of options and other types of stock-related awards
under the 1996 plan to  officers  and  key management employees. At January 29,
2005, the option shares reserved for the  Employee  Plan  was  4,511,002.   The
option  price  is fixed at the market price or higher on the date of the grant.
Options are generally  exercisable annually at a rate of 33% per year beginning
one year after the grant  date.   Shares  available  for additional grants were
1,458,720; 1,795,138 and 2,432,019 at January 29, 2005,  January  31,  2004 and
February 1, 2003, respectively.

The  Bombay  Company,  Inc. Non-Employee Director Equity Plan ("Director Plan")
provides for the granting  of  options to members of the Board of Directors who
are neither Bombay employees nor  officers.   At  January  29, 2005, the option
shares reserved for the Director Plan were 451,444.  The option  price is fixed
at  the  market price on the date of the grant.  The option grant, initial  and
annual, is 10,000 shares, with an additional 2,500 shares for the Lead Director
and each of  the committee chairs.     The initial grant becomes exercisable at
a rate of 20%  per  year  beginning  one  year  after  the  grant  date.   Each
additional  annual  grant  becomes fully exercisable six months after the grant
date.  Shares available for  additional grants were 55,185; 116,469 and 325,196
at January 29, 2005, January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003, respectively.

The Director Plan also allows  directors  the  option  to  receive retainer and
meeting  fees in the form of Bombay common stock or to defer  receipt  of  such
fees in the form of stock units.  To the extent that a director elects to defer
at least 50%  of the annual retainer, the director is paid an additional 25% of
the amount of the  deferral, also in the form of stock units.  Deferred amounts
are credited to an account  for  such  director  in  units equivalent to Bombay
common stock.

The  following  table includes option information for the  Employee  Plans  and
Director Plan:

The exercise of non-qualified  stock  options  in  Fiscal 2004, Fiscal 2003 and
Fiscal  2002  resulted  in  income  tax  benefits of $212,000,  $3,283,000  and
$155,000, respectively, which were credited to additional paid-in capital.  The
income tax benefits are the tax effect of  the  difference  between  the market
price on the date of exercise and the option price.

The Bombay Company, Inc. 1996 Long Term Incentive Stock Plan provides  for  the
granting  of  restricted  stock  to  officers  and  key  management  employees.
Restricted  stock grants are generally issued in separate tranches, which  vest
in designated  increments, generally 12 to 36 months, contingent upon continued
employment of the award recipient.  The market value of the restricted stock at
the  date of grant  is  recorded  as  deferred  compensation,  a  component  of
stockholders'  equity,  and  is  charged to expense over the respective vesting
periods.  If restricted stock is unvested  at  the time when an award recipient
leaves  the employment of the Company, the shares  are  canceled,  the  related
amounts are  removed from deferred compensation and amounts previously expensed
for  the  unvested   shares  are  reversed.   The  following  table  summarizes
restricted stock issued under the 1996 Long Term Incentive Stock Plan:

stock grants.


NOTE 10 - SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS PLAN

We have a shareholders' rights plan under  which  each  share  of Bombay common
stock  includes  one  Preferred  Share  Purchase Right ("Right") entitling  the
holder to buy one one-thousandth of a share  of  Series  A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock of the Company at an exercise price of $50.   The Rights, which
have  ten  year  terms expiring in 2005, are exercisable if a person  or  group
acquires 15% or more  of the common stock of Bombay or announces a tender offer
for 15% or more of the common stock.  If a person or group acquires 15% or more
of the outstanding common  stock  of Bombay, each Right will entitle the holder
to purchase, at the Right's exercise price, a number of shares of Bombay common
stock having a market value of twice  the Right's exercise price.  If Bombay is
acquired in a merger or other business  combination  transaction after a person
or group acquires 15% or more

                                      47

<PAGE> 48
of our common stock, each  Right will entitle its
holder to purchase, at the Right's exercise price, a number  of  shares  of the
acquiring  company's  common  stock  having a market value of twice the Right's
exercise price.  The Rights are redeemable  at  one  cent per Right at any time
before they become exercisable.  We are currently evaluating  what  action,  if
any, we will take upon the expiration of this Plan.


NOTE 11 - STOCK PURCHASE LOANS

On  May 16, 2002, the Board of Directors elected to abolish our Executive Stock
Loan  Program,  which  originated  in  August 1999.  At that date, participants
owned 189,031 shares of Bombay common stock  purchased  under  the program.  We
reacquired,  at  then  current market prices aggregating $864,000,  the  Bombay
common stock that was previously  purchased by the executive officers under the
program,  and the notes were extinguished.   Amounts  owed  to  Bombay  or  the
participants  as  a  result  of  the difference between the market value of the
stock and the loan balance plus accrued interest were paid in full.

During Fiscal 2002, $17,000 in interest  income  was  recognized related to the
loans.


NOTE 12- PLANNED DIVESTITURE OF BAILEY STREET TRADING COMPANY

On November 17, 2004, our Board of Directors approved the  divestiture  of  our
Bailey  Street  Trading  Company (" Bailey Street") wholesale operations.  This
action was taken to allow  management  to focus on improving the performance of
our core businesses as well as to provide  capital  to  support  the  continued
expansion  of  those  businesses.   Substantially  all  of the assets of Bailey
Street consist of inventory and receivables.  As a result  of  the  decision to
exit  the  operations, we expect to take a non-cash charge of approximately  $2
million in connection with vacating our 200,000 square foot leased distribution
center in Gilbertsville,  PA.  Other charges in connection with the divestiture
are not expected to be material.   We are currently in the process of assessing
sale and liquidation scenarios  as  well  as  a combination of both.   We would

NOTE 13 - GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

We operate primarily  in  one  industry  segment, specialty retailing.  Greater
than  90%  of  all  revenues results from the  sale  of  home  furnishings  and
accessories through retail  stores  in  the  United  States  and  Canada.   The
remaining portion of our revenues results from the sale of home furnishings and
accessories   through   our  wholesale  operations,  direct-to-customer  retail
operations and related shipping  charges.  Our wholesale and direct-to-customer
operations have been immaterial to  our  operations  and  financial results to-
date.  Long-lived assets include all non-current assets except deferred taxes.

The following table shows net revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area
(in thousands):

      other Business Combination shall have been approved  by a majority of the
      Disinterested Directors) which had the effect, directly or indirectly, of
      increasing the proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any class
      or  series  of  stock  or  securities  convertible  into  stock   of  the
      Corporation   or   any   Subsidiary  which  was  directly  or  indirectly

                   Common Stock),  except  as  approved  by  a  majority of the
                   Disinterested Directors, and (y) an increase in  such annual
                   rate   of  dividends  (as  necessary  to  prevent  any  such
                   reduction)  in  the event of any reclassification (including
                   any reverse stock  split),  recapitalization, reorganization
                   or any similar transaction which  has the effect of reducing
                   the number of outstanding shares of the Common Stock, unless
                   the failure so to increase such annual rate is approved by a

                   have become the beneficial owner of any additional shares of
                   Voting Stock except as part  of  the transaction in which it
                   became an Interested Stockholder; and

                         (v)    after such Interested Stockholder has become an
             Interested Stockholder, such Interested Stockholder shall not have
             received    the   benefit,   directly   or   indirectly    (except

             guarantees, pledges  or  other  financial  assistance  or  any tax
             credits or tax advantages provided by the Corporation, whether  in
             anticipation of or in connection with such Business Combination or

             proxy  or  information statement is required to be mailed pursuant
             to the Exchange Act or such subsequent provisions).

law.

      Section 7.   Notwithstanding any other  provisions of this Certificate of
Incorporation, the provisions set forth in this  Article  V may not be repeated
or  amended  in any respect unless such action is approved by  the  affirmative

stockholders or only for "odd-lot" holdings of Common Stock.

      Section 2.   For purposes of this Article VI:

             (a)   A  "person"  shall  mean any individual, firm,  corporation,

             shares of Voting Stock; or

                   (2)   is an Affiliate of  the  Corporation  and, at any time
             within  the  two-year  period  immediately  prior to the  date  in

                   (3)   is an assignee of or has otherwise  succeeded  to  the

             in question beneficially owned  by  an  Interested Stockholder, or
             Affiliate or Associate thereof, if such assignment  or  succession
             shall  have occurred in the courser of a transaction or series  of
             transactions  not  involving  either  a public offering within the
             meaning  of  the Securities Act of 1933,  as  amended,  or  normal
             market transactions.

             (c)   A person shall be a "beneficial owner" of any Voting Stock:

                   (1)   which  such  person or any of such person's Affiliates
             or Associates beneficially owns directly or indirectly; or

                   (2)   which such person  or  any of such person's Affiliates
             or Associates has (a) the right to acquire  (whether such right is
             exercisable  immediately  or  only  after  the passage  of  time),
             pursuant  to any agreement, arrangement or understanding  or  upon
             the exercise  of  conversion  rights, exchange rights, warrants or
             options, or otherwise, or (b) the  right  to vote or to direct the
             vote pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding; or

             understanding  for  the  purpose  of acquiring, holding, voting or
             disposing of any shares of Voting Stock.

             (d)   For  the purposes of determining  whether  a  person  is  an
      Interested Stockholder  pursuant  to paragraph (b) of this Section 2, the
      number of shares of Voting Stock deemed  to  be outstanding shall include
      shares deemed owned by such person through application  of  paragraph (c)

      which  may  be  issuable  to  other  persons  pursuant  to any agreement,
      arrangement  or  understanding,  or  upon exercise of conversion  rights,
      exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise.

             (e)   An "Affiliate" of a specified  person  shall  mean  a person

             (h)   "Disinterested Director"  means  any  member of the Board of
      Directors of the Corporation who is not an Affiliate  or Associate of, is
      not  a  nominee  of,  and  is  not employed or engaged by the  Interested
      Stockholder and was a member of  the Board of Directors prior to the time
      that the Interested Stockholder became an Interested Stockholder, and any
      successor  of  a  Disinterested Director  who  is  not  an  Affiliate  or
      Associate of, not a  nominee  of,  and  is not employed or engaged by the
      Interested Stockholder and who is recommended  to succeed a Disinterested

      Section 3.   A majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Corporation
shall  have  the power to determine, on the basis of information known to  them

Article  VI,  including,  without  limitation,  (a)  whether  a  person  is  an
Interested Stockholder,  (b)  the number of shares of Voting Stock beneficially
owned by any person, and (c) whether  a  person is an Affiliate or Associate of
another  person;  and  the  good  faith determination  of  a  majority  of  the
Disinterested Directors on such matters shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes of this Article VI.

      Section 4.   Notwithstanding  any other provisions of this Certificate of
Incorporation, the provisions set forth  in this Article VI may not be repealed
or amended in any respect unless such action  is  approved  by  the affirmative
vote of the holders of voting shares entitling them to exercise not  less  than
two-thirds  of  the total voting power of all outstanding voting shares of this
Corporation, subject  to  the provisions of any series of Preferred Stock which
may at the time be outstanding.

                                  ARTICLE VII

      Section 1.   The number  of  directors of the Corporation, and the number
of directors in each class, shall be  fixed from time to time by or pursuant to
the Bylaws of the Corporation but the number  of  directors  of the Corporation
shall not be less than three or more than nine, except as otherwise fixed by or
pursuant to the provisions of Article IV hereof relating to the  rights  of the
holders  of  any  class  or series of stock having a preference over the Common
Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation.  The directors shall be divided into
three classes, as nearly equal  in  number as possible, as shall be provided in
the Bylaws of the Corporation.  Unless otherwise provided in the Bylaws, at the
annual meeting of stockholders held in  1985,  one class of two directors shall
be elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held
in 1986, another class of two directors shall be elected for a term expiring at
the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in  1987 and another class of two
directors  shall  be  elected  for  a term expiring at the  annual  meeting  of
stockholders to be held in 1988, with  each  class  to  hold  office  until its
successors  are  elected and qualified.  At each annual meeting of stockholders
subsequent to 1985, the successors of the class of directors whose term expires
at that meeting shall  be  elected  to  hold  office for a term expiring at the
annual meeting of stockholders held in the third  year  following  the  year of
election.   The  election  of  directors  need  not  be  by written ballot.  No
decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board  of  Directors shall
shorten the term of any incumbent director.

      Section 2.   Except as otherwise provided for or fixed by or  pursuant to
the  provisions  of Article IV hereof relating to the rights of the holders  of
any class or series  of  stock  having a preference over the Common Stock as to
dividends or upon liquidation, newly  created  directorships resulting from any
increase in the number of directors and any vacancies on the Board of Directors
resulting from death, resignation, removal or other  cause shall only be filled
by  the  affirmative  vote  of a majority of the remaining  directors  then  in
office, even though less than  a quorum of the Board of Directors, or by a sole
remaining director.  Any director  elected  in  accordance  with  the preceding
sentence of this Section 2 shall hold office for the remainder of the full term
of  the  class  of directors in which the new directorship was created  or  the
vacancy occurred  and  until  such director's successor shall have been elected
and qualified.

      Section 3.   Subject to the  rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock
or any other class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock
as to dividends or upon liquidation,  any  director  may be removed from office
only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the  combined  voting  power of the then outstanding shares  of  Voting  Stock,
voting together as a single  class.   For  purposes  of this Section 3, "cause"
shall  mean the willful and continuous failure of a director  to  substantially
perform  such director's duties to the Corporation (other than any such failure
resulting  from  incapacity  due  to physical or mental illness) or the willful
engaging  by  a  director  in  gross  misconduct  materially  and  demonstrably
injurious to the Corporation.

      Section 4.   Notwithstanding any  other provisions of this Certificate of
Incorporation, the provisions set forth in this Article VII may not be repealed
or amended in any respect, and no article  imposing  cumulative  voting  in the
election  of  directors  may  be  added,  unless such action is approved by the
affirmative vote of the holders of voting shares entitling them to exercise not
less than two-thirds of the total voting power of all outstanding voting shares
of this Corporation, subject to the provisions of any series of Preferred Stock
which may at the time be outstanding.

                                 ARTICLE VIII

      Section 1.   Subject to the rights of  the holders of the Preferred Stock
or any other class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock
as to dividends or upon liquidation, any action  required  or  permitted  to be
taken  by  the  stockholders  of the Corporation must be effected (a) at a duly
called annual or special meeting  of  stockholders of the Corporation or (b) by
the unanimous written consent of all stockholders  of  the Corporation.  Except
as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights of  the  holders  of the
Preferred Stock or any other class or series of stock having a preference  over
the  Common  Stock  as  to  dividends  or upon liquidation, special meetings of
stockholders of the Corporation may be called  only  by  the Board of Directors
pursuant  to  a  resolution  approved  by  a  majority of the entire  Board  of
Directors.

      Section 2.   Nominations by stockholders  for  any  directorship  must be
submitted to the Board of Directors by written notice received by the Board  of
Directors  not  later  than  45 days prior to the date of the annual meeting of
stockholders at which the election  is  to  be  held or, if later, within seven
days after the date the Corporation mails, or otherwise  gives,  notice  of the
date  of  such  meeting,  which  notice  shall state the name of the nominating
stockholder, the name of the nominee, the  addresses  of the nominee's business
and residence, the nominee's principal occupation, the  name and address of the
nominee's employer or business if self-employed, and the  number  of  shares of
Common  Stock and Preferred Stock which are beneficially owned by such nominee,
if any, and by the nominating stockholder.

      Section 3.   In  addition  to  any  requirements  of  law  and  any other
provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any resolution or resolutions
of the Board of Directors adopted pursuant to Article IV of this Certificate of
Incorporation  (and  notwithstanding  the fact that a lesser percentage may  be
specified by law, this Certificate of Incorporation  or  any such resolution or
resolutions), the Bylaws of the Corporation may be adopted,  repealed,  altered
or  amended  (i) by the stockholders of the Corporation only by the affirmative
vote of the holders of 66-2/3% or more of the combined voting power of the then
outstanding shares  of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class and cast
at a meeting of the stockholders  called  for  that purpose (provided that such
notice of such proposed adoption, repeal, alteration  or  amendment is included
in  the  notice  of  such  meeting);  or  (ii)  by  the Board of Directors,  in
furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred  upon  it  by law, by
the vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors.

      Section 4.   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate  of
Incorporation,  the  provisions  set  forth  in  this  Article  VIII may not be
repealed  or  amended  in  any  respect unless such action is approved  by  the
affirmative vote of the holders of voting shares entitling them to exercise not
less than two-thirds of the total voting power of all outstanding voting shares
of this Corporation, subject to the provisions of any series of Preferred Stock
which may at the time be outstanding.

                                  ARTICLE IX

      A director of this Corporation  shall  not  be  personally  liable to the
Corporation  or  its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of  fiduciary
duty as a director,  except  for liability (i) for any breach of the director's
duty of loyalty to the Corporation  or  its  stockholders;  (ii)  for  acts  or
omissions  not  in  good  faith  or  which  involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing  violation of law; (iii) under Section  174  of  the  Delaware  General
Corporation Law; or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit.

      IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  THE  BOMBAY  COMPANY, INC. has caused this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation to be signed by Robert E.M. Nourse, its President,
and attested by Michael J. Veitenheimer, its  Secretary,  as  of the 5th day of

of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat shall be
requisite and shall constitute a quorum.  If, however, such majority shall not
be represented at any meeting of the stockholders regularly called, the holders
of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote
thereat shall have power to adjourn the meeting to another time, or to another
time and place, without notice other than announcement of adjournment at the
meeting, and there may be successive adjournments for like cause and in like
manner until the requisite amount of shares entitled to vote at such meeting
shall be represented.  At such adjourned meeting at which the requisite amount
of shares entitled to vote thereat shall be represented, any business may be
transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally
notified.

     SECTION 6.   VOTES.  At each meeting of stockholders every stockholder
shall have one vote for each share of Common Stock entitled to vote and the
vote, if any, which was fixed pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation for
each share of Preferred Stock which is registered in the stockholder's name on
the books of the Corporation on the date on which the transfer books were
closed, if closed, or on the date set by the Board of Directors for the
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting.  At each such
meeting, every stockholder shall be entitled to vote in person, or by proxy
appointed by an instrument in writing subscribed by such stockholder and
bearing
a date not more than three (3) years prior to the meeting in question, unless
said instrument provides for a longer period during which it is to remain in
force.

     At all meetings of the stockholders, a quorum being present, all matters
shall be decided by a majority vote of the shares of stock entitled to vote
held
by stockholders present in person or by proxy, except as otherwise required by
the Certificate of Incorporation or the laws of the State of Delaware.  Unless
so directed by the chairman of the meeting, or required by the laws of the
State
of Delaware, the vote thereat on any question need not be by ballot.

     On a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder
voting,
or in his name by his proxy, if there be such proxy, and shall state the number
of shares voted by him and the number of votes to which each share is entitled.
On a vote by ballot, the chairman shall appoint two inspectors of election, who
shall first take and subscribe an oath or affirmation faithfully to execute the
duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to
the best of their ability and who shall take charge of the polls and after the
balloting shall make a certificate of the result of the vote taken; but no
director or candidate for the office of director shall be appointed as such
inspector.

     SECTION 7.   STOCK LIST.  At least ten (10) days before every election of
directors, a complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at such election,
arranged in alphabetical order, with the residence of each and the number of
voting shares held by each shall be prepared by the Secretary.  Such list shall
be open at the place where the election is to be held for said ten (10) days,
to
the examination of any stockholder entitled to vote at that election and shall
be produced and kept at the time and place of election during the whole time
thereof, and subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present.

     SECTION 2.   TERM OF OFFICE.  Except as otherwise provided by law or the
Certificate of Incorporation, each director shall hold office until the annual
meeting of stockholders held in the third year following the year of such
director's election, and until such director's successor is duly elected and

preside at all meetings of the stockholders and of the Board of Directors.

     SECTION 4.   VACANCIES.  If any vacancy shall occur among the directors,
or
if the number of directors shall at any time be increased, the directors in
office, although less than a quorum, by a majority vote may fill the vacancies
or newly created directorships.  When one or more directors shall resign from
the Board of Directors, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors
then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill
such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such
resignation
or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold
office as herein provided in the filling of other vacancies.

     SECTION 5.   MEETING.  Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at
such place within or without the State of Delaware as may from time to time be
fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board,

any meeting.  Meetings may be held at any time upon the call of the Chairman of
the Board, the President or the Secretary or any two (2) of the directors in
office by oral, telegraphic, or written notice, duly served or sent or mailed

held at any time and place without notice if all the directors are present, or
if those not present shall in writing or by telegram or cable waive notice
thereof.  A regular meeting of the Board of Directors may be held without
notice
immediately following the annual meeting of stockholders at the place where
such
annual meeting is held.  Regular meetings of the Board may also be held without
notice at such time and place as shall from time to time be determined by
resolution of the Board of Directors.

     SECTION 6.   QUORUM.  One-third, but not less than two (2), of the
directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  If at any
meeting of the Board of Directors there shall be less than a quorum present, a
majority of those present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without
notice other than announcement of the adjournment at the meeting, and at such
adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present any business may be transacted
which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

     SECTION 7.   COMPENSATION.  The directors may be paid their expenses, if
any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors, a fixed sum for
attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and/or a stated fee as
director.  No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the
Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.  Members
of the Executive Committee and/or of other committees may be allowed like
compensation and reimbursement of expenses for attending committee meetings.

     SECTION 1.   FORM AND EXECUTION OF CERTIFICATES.  The interest of each
stockholder of the Corporation shall be evidenced by a certificate or
certificates for shares of stock in such form as may be prescribed from time to
time by law and by the Board of Directors.  The certificates of stock of each

either the President or a Vice President together either with the Secretary or
an Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the

engraved facsimile thereof.  Where any such certificate is signed by a transfer
agent or transfer clerk and by a registrar, the signatures of any such
President, Vice President, Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer, Secretary or
Assistant Secretary upon such certificate may be facsimiles engraved or
printed.
In case any officer or officers who shall have signed, or whose facsimile
signature or signatures shall have been placed upon, such certificate or
certificates shall have ceased to be such, whether because of death,
resignation
or otherwise, before such certificate or certificates shall have been issued
and
delivered, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued and
delivered with the same effect as if such officer or officers had not ceased to
be such at the date of its issue and delivery.

     SECTION 2.   TRANSFER OF SHARES.  The shares of the stock of the
Corporation shall be transferred on the books of the Corporation by the holder
thereof in person or by his attorney lawfully constituted, upon surrender for
cancellation of certificates for the same number of shares, with an assignment
and power of transfer endorsed thereon or attached thereto, duly executed, with
such proof or guaranty of the authenticity of the signature as the Corporation
or its agents may reasonably require.  The Corporation shall be entitled to
treat the holder of record of any share or shares of stock as the holder in
fact
thereof and accordingly shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other
claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person
whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as
otherwise  expressly provided by law.

     SECTION 3.   CLOSING OF TRANSFER BOOKS AND RECORD DATES.  The Board of
Directors may in its discretion prescribe, in advance, a record date not
exceeding sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days prior to the date of any
meeting of the stockholders or prior to the last day on which the consent or
dissent of stockholders may be effectively expressed for any purpose without a
meeting, during which no transfer of stock on the books of the Corporation may
be made; or in lieu of prohibiting the transfer of stock, may fix, in advance,
a
record date not more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days prior to the
date of any meeting of stockholders or prior to the last day on which the
consent or dissent of stockholders may be effectively expressed for any purpose
without a meeting, as the time as of which stockholders entitled to notice of
and to vote at such a meeting or whose consent or dissent is required or may be
expressed for any purpose, as the case may be, shall be determined; and all
persons who were holders of record of voting stock at such time and no others
shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting or to express their
consent or dissent, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any
stock on the books of the Corporation after any record date fixed as aforesaid.
The Board of Directors may also, in its discretion, fix in advance a date not
exceeding sixty (60) days preceding the date fixed for the payment of any
dividend or the making of any distribution, or for the delivery of evidence of
rights, or evidences of interests arising out of any issuance, change,
conversion or exchange of capital stock, as a record date for the determination
of the stockholders entitled to receive or participate in any such dividend,
distribution, rights or interests, notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on
the books of the Corporation after any record date fixed as aforesaid, or, at
its option, in lieu of so fixing a record date, may prescribe in advance a
period not exceeding sixty (60) days prior to the date for such payment,
distribution or delivery during which no transfer of stock on the books of the
Corporation may be made.

     SECTION 4.   LOST OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES.  In case of the loss or
destruction of any outstanding certificate of stock, a new certificate may be
issued upon the following conditions:

     The owner of said certificate shall file with the Secretary of the
Corporation an affidavit giving the facts in relation to the ownership, and in
relation to the loss or destruction of said certificate, stating its number and
the number of shares represented thereby; such affidavit to be in such form and
contain such statements as shall satisfy the President and Secretary that said
certificate has been accidentally destroyed or lost, and that a new certificate
ought to be issued in lieu thereof.  Upon being so notified, the President and
Secretary shall require such owner to file with the Secretary a bond in such
penal sum and in such form as they may deem advisable, and with a surety or
sureties approved by them, to indemnify and save harmless the Corporation from
any claim, loss, damage or liability which may be occasioned by the issuance of
a new certificate in lieu thereof.  Upon such bond being so filed, a new
certificate for the same number of shares shall be issued to the owner of the
certificate so lost or destroyed; and the transfer agent and registrar of
stock,
if any, shall countersign and register such new certificate upon receipt of a
written order signed by the said President and Secretary, and thereupon the
Corporation will save harmless said transfer agent and registrar in the
premises.  Any Vice President may act hereunder in the stead of the President,
and an Assistant Secretary in the stead of the Secretary.  In case of the
surrender of the original certificate, in lieu of which a new certificate has
been issued, or the surrender of such new certificate, for cancellation, the
bond of indemnity given as a condition of the issue of such new certificate may
be surrendered.  A new certificate may be issued without requiring any bond
when
in the judgment of the Board of Directors it is proper to do so.

Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer, or by such
other officer or officers, agent or agents, as shall be thereunto authorized

Corporation by the President or a Vice President and by the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary.

as the case may be, and such written consent is filed with the minutes of
proceedings of the Board of Directors or of such committee.

                               RIGHTS AGREEMENT


             Rights Agreement, dated  as of June 1, 1995 ("Agreement"), between
The Bombay Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and The First
National Bank of Boston, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent").

             The Board of Directors of  the Company has authorized and declared
a dividend of one preferred share purchase  right (a "Right") for each share of
Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) of the  Company  outstanding  as  of  the
Close of Business (as defined below) on June 15, 1995 (the "Record Date"), each
Right  representing  the  right  to  purchase  one  one-thousandth  (subject to
adjustment)  of  a share of Preferred Stock (as hereinafter defined), upon  the
terms  and subject  to  the  conditions  herein  set  forth,  and  has  further
authorized  and  directed  the  issuance of one Right (subject to adjustment as
provided herein) with respect to  each  share of Common Stock that shall become
outstanding between the Record Date and the  earlier  of  the Distribution Date
and  the  Expiration  Date  (as such terms are hereinafter defined);  provided,
however, that Rights may be issued  with respect to shares of Common Stock that
shall become outstanding after the Distribution  Date  and prior to the Expira-
tion Date in accordance with Section 22.

             Accordingly,  in  consideration  of the premises  and  the  mutual
agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:

             Section 1.  Certain Definitions.   For purposes of this Agreement,
the following terms have the meaning indicated:

             (a)   "Acquiring Person" shall mean  any  Person  (as such term is
hereinafter defined) who or which shall be the Beneficial Owner  (as  such term
is  hereinafter  defined)  of  15%  or  more of the shares of Common Stock then
outstanding,  but  shall  not  include  an  Exempt  Person  (as  such  term  is
hereinafter defined); provided, however, that  if the Board of Directors of the
Company  determines  in  good faith that a Person who  would  otherwise  be  an
"Acquiring Person" became  such  inadvertently  (including, without limitation,
because (i) such Person was unaware that it beneficially  owned a percentage of
Common Stock that would otherwise cause such Person to be an "Acquiring Person"
or  (ii)  such  Person was aware of the extent of its Beneficial  Ownership  of
Common Stock but had no actual knowledge of the consequences of such Beneficial
Ownership under this  Agreement)  and  without  any  intention  of  changing or
influencing  control  of  the  Company,  and  if  such  Person  as  promptly as
practicable  divested or divests itself of Beneficial Ownership of a sufficient
number of shares  of  Common  Stock  so  that such Person would no longer be an
"Acquiring Person," then such Person shall  not  be  deemed  to  be  or to have
become  an  "Acquiring  Person"  for  any purposes of this Agreement.  Notwith-
standing the foregoing, no Person shall  become  an  "Acquiring  Person" as the
result  of  an acquisition of shares of Common Stock by the Company  which,  by
reducing the  number  of shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number
of shares of Common Stock  beneficially  owned by such Person to 15% or more of
the  shares of Common Stock then outstanding,  provided,  however,  that  if  a
Person shall become the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the shares of Common
Stock  then outstanding by reason of such share acquisitions by the Company and
shall thereafter become the Beneficial Owner of any additional shares of Common
Stock, then such Person shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person" unless upon
the consummation  of  the acquisition of such additional shares of Common Stock
such Person does not own  15%  or  more  of  the  shares  of  Common Stock then
outstanding.  For all purposes of this Agreement, any calculation of the number
of  shares  of  Common Stock outstanding at any particular time, including  for
purposes of determining the particular percentage of such outstanding shares of
Common Stock of which  any  Person  is  the  Beneficial Owner, shall be made in
accordance with the last sentence of Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i)  of  the General Rules
and  Regulations  under  the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended  (the
"Exchange Act"), as in effect on the date hereof.

             (b)   "Affiliate"   and  "Associate"  shall  have  the  respective
meanings  ascribed  to such terms in  Rule  12b-2  of  the  General  Rules  and
Regulations under the  Exchange  Act,  as  in effect on the date of this Rights
Agreement.

             (c)   A Person shall be deemed the "Beneficial Owner" of, shall be
deemed to have "Beneficial Ownership" of and  shall  be deemed to "beneficially
own" any securities:

                   (i) which such Person or any of such  Person's Affiliates or
Associates  is deemed to beneficially own, directly or indirectly,  within  the
meaning of Rule  13d-3  of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange
Act as in effect on the date of this Rights Agreement;

                   (ii) which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or
Associates has (A) the right to acquire (whether such right is exercisable imme-
diately or only after the  passage of time) pursuant to any agreement, arrange-
ment  or  understanding (other  than  customary  agreements  with  and  between
underwriters  and  selling  group  members  with  respect to a bona fide public
offering  of securities), or upon the exercise of conversion  rights,  exchange
rights, rights,  warrants  or  options, or otherwise; provided, however, that a
Person shall not be deemed the Beneficial Owner of, or to beneficially own, (x)
securities tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by or on behalf
of such Person or any of such Person's  Affiliates  or  Associates  until  such
tendered securities are accepted for purchase, (y) securities which such Person
has  a  right  to  acquire upon the exercise of Rights at any time prior to the
time that any Person  becomes  an  Acquiring  Person or (z) securities issuable
upon the exercise of Rights from and after the  time that any Person becomes an
Acquiring Person if such Rights were acquired by  such  Person  or  any of such
Person's Affiliates or Associates prior to the Distribution Date or pursuant to
Section  3(a)  or Section 22 hereof ("original Rights") or pursuant to  Section
11(i) or Section 11(n) with respect to an adjustment to original Rights; or (B)
the right to vote  pursuant  to  any  agreement,  arrangement or understanding;
provided, however, that a Person shall not be deemed  the  Beneficial Owner of,
or  to beneficially own, any security by reason of such agreement,  arrangement
or understanding  if  the  agreement, arrangement or understanding to vote such
security (1) arises solely from  a  revocable  proxy  or  consent given to such
Person in response to a public proxy or consent solicitation  made pursuant to,
and in accordance with, the applicable rules and regulations promulgated  under
the Exchange Act and (2) is not also then reportable on Schedule 13D under  the
Exchange Act (or any comparable or successor report); or

                   (iii)  which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly,
by  any  other Person with which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates
or Associates  has  any  agreement,  arrangement  or  understanding (other than
customary agreements with and between underwriters and  selling  group  members
with  respect to a bona fide public offering of securities) for the purpose  of
acquiring, holding, voting (except to the extent contemplated by the proviso to
Section 1(c)(ii)(B)) or disposing of any securities of the Company;

provided, however, that no Person who is an officer, director or employee of an
Exempt  Person  shall  be  deemed,  solely by reason of such Person's status or
authority  as  such,  to be the "Beneficial  Owner"  of,  to  have  "Beneficial
Ownership" of or to "beneficially  own"  any  securities that are "beneficially
owned" (as defined in this Section 1(c)), including,  without  limitation, in a
fiduciary capacity, by an Exempt Person or by any other such officer,  director
or employee of an Exempt Person.

             (d)   "Business  Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday,  a
Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the State of Texas or the city
in which the principal office of  the Rights Agent is located are authorized or
obligated by law or executive order to close.

entity, the equivalent equity interest) with the  greatest voting power of such
other Person or, if such other Person is a subsidiary  of  another  Person, the

then  outstanding  (including  any such date which is after the  date  of  this
Agreement and prior to the issuance  of  the  Rights; the earlier of such dates

evidenced   (subject   to  the  provisions  of  Section  3(b)  hereof)  by  the
certificates for Common  Stock  registered  in the names of the holders thereof
and not by separate Right Certificates, and (y) the Rights will be transferable
only in connection with the transfer of Common  Stock.   As soon as practicable
after the Distribution Date, the Company will prepare and  execute,  the Rights
Agent  will countersign and the Company will send or cause to be sent (and  the
Rights Agent will, if requested, send) by first-class, insured, postage-prepaid
mail, to  each record holder of Common Stock as of the close of business on the
Distribution  Date  (other  than  any  Acquiring  Person  or  any  Associate or
Affiliate of an Acquiring Person), at the address of such holder shown  on  the
records  of  the  Company,  a  Right  Certificate, in substantially the form of
Exhibit B hereto (a "Right Certificate"),  evidencing  one  Right  (subject  to
adjustment  as  provided herein) for each share of Common Stock so held.  As of
the Distribution  Date,  the  Rights  will  be  evidenced  solely by such Right
Certificates.

             (b)  On the Record Date, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the
Company will send a copy of a Summary of Rights to Purchase Shares of Preferred
Stock, in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto (the "Summary of Rights"),
by first-class, postage-prepaid mail, to each record holder  of Common Stock as
of the Close of Business on the Record Date (other than any Acquiring Person or
any  Associate  or Affiliate of any Acquiring Person), at the address  of  such
holder shown on the  records  of the Company.  With respect to certificates for
Common Stock outstanding as of  the  Record  Date, until the Distribution Date,
the Rights will be evidenced by such certificates  registered  in  the names of
the  holders  thereof  together with the Summary of Rights. Until the Distribu-
tion Date (or, if earlier,  the Expiration Date), the surrender for transfer of
any certificate for Common Stock  outstanding  on  the  Record  Date,  with  or
without  a copy of the Summary of Rights, shall also constitute the transfer of
the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented thereby.

             (c)   Certificates  issued  for  Common  Stock (including, without
limitation, upon transfer of outstanding Common Stock,  disposition  of  Common
Stock  out  of treasury stock or issuance or reissuance of Common Stock out  of
authorized but  unissued shares) after the Record Date but prior to the earlier
of the Distribution  Date  and  the  Expiration  Date  shall have impressed on,
printed on, written on or otherwise affixed to them the following legend:

             This certificate also evidences and entitles  the holder hereof to
             certain  rights  as  set forth in a Rights Agreement  between  The
             Bombay Company, Inc. and  The  First  National  Bank of Boston, as
             Rights Agent, dated as of June 1, 1995 as the same  may be amended
             from time to time (the "Rights Agreement"), the terms of which are
             hereby incorporated herein by reference and a copy of  which is on
             file  at  the  principal  executive offices of The Bombay Company,
             Inc.  Under certain circumstances,  as  set  forth  in  the Rights
             Agreement,  such Rights will be evidenced by separate certificates
             and will no longer  be  evidenced by this certificate.  The Bombay
             Company, Inc. will mail to  the  holder of this certificate a copy
             of the Rights Agreement without charge  after receipt of a written
             request therefor.  Under certain circumstances,  as  set  forth in
             the Rights Agreement, Rights owned by or transferred to any Person
             who  is  or  becomes an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights
             Agreement) and  certain  transferees  thereof will become null and
             void and will no longer be transferable.

With respect to such certificates containing the foregoing  legend,  until  the
Distribution  Date  the  Rights associated with the Common Stock represented by
such certificates shall be  evidenced  by  such  certificates  alone,  and  the
surrender  for  transfer  of any such certificate, except as otherwise provided
herein, shall also constitute  the  transfer  of the Rights associated with the
Common Stock represented thereby.  In the event  that  the Company purchases or
otherwise  acquires any Common Stock after the Record Date  but  prior  to  the
Distribution Date, any Rights associated with such Common Stock shall be deemed
canceled and  retired so that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise any
Rights associated with the Common Stock which are no longer outstanding.

             Notwithstanding this paragraph (c), the omission of a legend shall
not affect the  enforceability  of  any part of this Agreement or the rights of
any holder of the Rights.

             Section 4.  Form of Right  Certificates.   The  Right Certificates
(and the forms of election to purchase shares and of assignment  to  be printed
on the reverse thereof) shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit
B  hereto  and  may  have such marks of identification or designation and  such
legends, summaries or  endorsements  printed  thereon  as  the Company may deem
appropriate and as are not inconsistent with the provisions  of this Agreement,
or  as may be required to comply with any applicable law or with  any  rule  or
regulation  made  pursuant  thereto or with any rule or regulation of any stock
exchange or interdealer quotation  system  on which the Rights may from time to
time be listed or quoted, or to conform to usage.  Subject to the provisions of
Sections 11, 13 and 22 hereof, the Right Certificates shall entitle the holders
thereof to purchase such number of one one-thousandths  of a share of Preferred
Stock as shall be set forth therein at the price per one  one-thousandth  of  a
share  of  Preferred  Stock  set  forth therein (the "Purchase Price"), but the
number of such one one-thousandths  of  a  share  of  Preferred  Stock  and the
Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein.

             Section 5.  Countersignature and Registration.

             (a)  The  Right  Certificates  shall  be executed on behalf of the
Company  by  the  President  of the Company, either manually  or  by  facsimile
signature, shall have affixed thereto the Company's seal or a facsimile thereof
and shall be attested by the Secretary  of  the  Company, either manually or by
facsimile signature.  The Right Certificates shall be manually countersigned by
the Rights Agent and shall not be valid for any purpose  unless  countersigned.
In  case  any  officer  of  the Company who shall have signed any of the  Right
Certificates shall cease to be such officer of the Company before countersigna-
ture by the Rights Agent and  issuance  and delivery by the Company, such Right
Certificates, nevertheless, may be countersigned by the Rights Agent and issued
and delivered by the Company with the same  force  and  effect  as  though  the
Person  who signed such Right Certificates had not ceased to be such officer of
the Company;  and  any Right Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company
by  any  Person who, at  the  actual  date  of  the  execution  of  such  Right
Certificate,  shall  be  a  proper  officer  of  the Company to sign such Right
Certificate, although at the date of the execution  of  this Agreement any such
Person was not such an officer.

             (b) Following the Distribution Date, the Rights Agent will keep or
cause to be kept, at an office or agency designated for such purpose, books for
registration  and  transfer of the Right Certificates issued  hereunder.   Such
books shall show the names and addresses of the respective holders of the Right
Certificates, the number  of  Rights evidenced on its face by each of the Right
Certificates and the date of each of the Right Certificates.

             Section 6.  Transfer,  Split Up, Combination and Exchange of Right
Certificates; Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Right Certificates.

             (a)  Subject to the provisions  of Sections 7(e), 11(a)(ii) and 14
hereof, at any time after the Distribution Date  and  prior  to  the Expiration
Date, any Right Certificate or Right Certificates may be transferred, split up,
combined  or  exchanged  for  another  Right Certificate or Right Certificates,
entitling  the  registered  holder  to purchase  a  like  number  of  one  one-
thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock  as  the  Right  Certificate or Right
Certificates  surrendered  then entitled such holder to purchase.   Any  regis-
tered holder desiring to transfer,  split  up,  combine  or  exchange any Right
Certificate or Right Certificates shall make such request in writing  delivered
to  the  Rights  Agent,  and  shall  surrender  the  Right Certificate or Right
Certificates to be transferred, split up, combined or  exchanged  at the office
or  agency  of  the  Rights  Agent designated for such purpose.  Thereupon  the
Rights Agent shall countersign  and  deliver  to  the Person entitled thereto a
Right Certificate or Right Certificates, as the case  may  be, as so requested.
The  Company  may  require  payment  of a sum sufficient to cover  any  tax  or
governmental charge that may be imposed  in connection with any transfer, split
up, combination or exchange of Right Certificates.

             (b)  Subject to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, at any
time after the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date, upon receipt
by the Company and the Rights Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to them
of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation  of  a Right Certificate, and, in
case  of  loss,  theft  or  destruction,  of indemnity or  security  reasonably
satisfactory  to  them, and, at the Company's  request,  reimbursement  to  the
Company and the Rights Agent of all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, and
upon surrender to the Rights Agent and cancellation of the Right Certificate if
mutilated, the Company  will  make  and deliver a new Right Certificate of like
tenor to the Rights Agent for delivery  to the registered holder in lieu of the
Right Certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated.

             Section 7.  Exercise of Rights, Purchase Price; Expiration Date of
Rights.

             (a) Except as otherwise provided  herein,  the Rights shall become
exercisable on the Distribution Date, and thereafter the  registered  holder of
any  Right  Certificate may, subject to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof and except  as
otherwise provided herein, exercise the Rights evidenced thereby in whole or in
part upon surrender  of  the  Right  Certificate,  with the form of election to
purchase on the reverse side thereof duly executed,  to the Rights Agent at the
office or agency of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, together with
payment of the aggregate Purchase Price with respect to the total number of one
one-thousandths  of a share of Preferred Stock (or other  securities,  cash  or
other assets, as the  case may be) as to which the Rights are exercised, at any
time which is both after  the  Distribution  Date  and  prior  to the time (the
"Expiration Date") that is the earliest of (i) the Close of Business on June 1,
2005  (the  "Final  Expiration  Date"),  (ii) the time at which the Rights  are
redeemed as provided in Section 23 hereof  (the "Redemption Date") or (iii) the
time at which such Rights are exchanged as provided in Section 24 hereof.

             (b)  The Purchase Price shall be  initially  $50.00  for  each one
one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon the exercise of a
Right.  The Purchase Price and the number of one one-thousandths of a share  of
Preferred Stock or other securities or property to be acquired upon exercise of
a  Right  shall  be  subject  to  adjustment  from  time to time as provided in
Sections 11 and 13 hereof and shall be payable in lawful  money  of  the United
States of America in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section 7.

             (c)  Except as otherwise provided herein, upon receipt of  a Right
Certificate  representing  exercisable  Rights,  with  the  form of election to
purchase duly executed, accompanied by payment of the aggregate  Purchase Price
for  the shares of Preferred Stock to be purchased and an amount equal  to  any
applicable  transfer  tax  required  to  be  paid  by  the holder of such Right
Certificate in accordance with Section 9 hereof, in cash or by certified check,
cashier's check or money order payable to the order of the  Company, the Rights
Agent shall thereupon promptly (i) (A) requisition from any transfer  agent  of
the Preferred Stock certificates for the number of shares of Preferred Stock to
be  purchased  and the Company hereby irrevocably authorizes its transfer agent
to comply with all  such requests, or (B) requisition from the depositary agent
depositary  receipts  representing   interests  in  such  number  of  one  one-
thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock as are to be purchased (in which case
certificates for the Preferred Stock represented  by  such  receipts  shall  be
deposited  by  the  transfer  agent  with the depositary agent) and the Company
hereby directs the depositary agent to  comply  with  such  request,  (ii) when
appropriate, requisition from the Company the amount of cash to be paid in lieu
of  issuance  of fractional shares in accordance with Section 14 hereof,  (iii)
promptly after  receipt  of such certificates or depositary receipts, cause the
same to be delivered to or  upon  the  order  of  the registered holder of such
Right Certificate, registered in such name or names  as  may  be  designated by
such  holder  and  (iv) when appropriate, after receipt, promptly deliver  such
cash to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate.

             (d)  Except  as  otherwise provided herein, in case the registered
holder of any Right Certificate  shall  exercise  less  than  all of the Rights
evidenced thereby, a new Right Certificate evidencing Rights equivalent  to the
exercisable Rights remaining unexercised shall be issued by the Rights Agent to
the  registered  holder  of  such  Right  Certificate or to his duly authorized
assigns, subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof.

             (e)  Notwithstanding anything  in  this Agreement to the contrary,
neither the Rights Agent nor the Company shall be  obligated  to  undertake any
action with respect to a registered holder of Rights upon the occurrence of any
purported transfer or exercise of Rights pursuant to Section 6 hereof  or  this
Section 7 unless such registered holder shall have (i) completed and signed the
certificate contained in the form of assignment or form of election to purchase
set  forth  on  the reverse side of the Rights Certificate surrendered for such
transfer or exercise and (ii) provided such additional evidence of the identity
of the Beneficial  Owner  (or  former  Beneficial Owner) thereof as the Company
shall reasonably request.

             Section 8.  Cancellation and  Destruction  of  Right Certificates.
All Right Certificates surrendered for the purpose of exercise, transfer, split
up, combination or exchange shall, if surrendered to the Company  or  to any of
its  agents,  be  delivered to the Rights Agent for cancellation or in canceled
form, or, if surrendered  to  the Rights Agent, shall be canceled by it, and no
Right  Certificates  shall  be issued  in  lieu  thereof  except  as  expressly
permitted  by any of the provisions  of  this  Agreement.   The  Company  shall
deliver to the  Rights  Agent  for  cancellation and retirement, and the Rights
Agent shall so cancel and retire, any  other  Right  Certificate  purchased  or
acquired  by  the Company otherwise than upon the exercise thereof.  The Rights
Agent shall deliver  all  canceled Right Certificates to the Company, or shall,
at  the  written  request  of  the   Company,   destroy   such  canceled  Right
Certificates,  and  in  such  case shall deliver a certificate  of  destruction
thereof to the Company.

             Section 9.  Availability of Shares of Preferred Stock.

             (a)  The Company covenants  and  agrees  that  it will cause to be
reserved  and  kept  available  out  of its authorized and unissued  shares  of
Preferred Stock or any shares of Preferred  Stock  held  in  its  treasury, the
number  of  shares  of  Preferred  Stock that will be sufficient to permit  the
exercise in full of all outstanding Rights.

             (b)  So long as the shares  of Preferred Stock (and, following the
time that any Person becomes an Acquiring  Person,  shares  of Common Stock and
other  securities)  issuable  upon  the  exercise  of Rights may be  listed  or
admitted to trading on any national securities exchange,  or  quoted on NASDAQ,
the Company shall use its best efforts to cause, from and after  such  time  as
the  Rights  become  exercisable,  all  shares reserved for such issuance to be
listed  or admitted to trading on such exchange,  or  quoted  on  NASDAQ,  upon
official notice of issuance upon such exercise.

             (c)   From  and  after such time as the Rights become exercisable,
the  Company shall use its best  efforts,  if  then  necessary  to  permit  the
issuance  of shares of Preferred Stock (and, following the time that any Person
becomes an  Acquiring Person, shares of Common Stock and other securities) upon
the exercise  of Rights, to register and qualify such shares of Preferred Stock
(and, following the time that any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, shares of
Common Stock and  other securities) under the Securities Act and any applicable
state securities or "Blue Sky" laws (to the extent exemptions therefrom are not
available), cause such  registration  statement  and  qualifications  to become
effective as soon as possible after such filing and keep such registration  and
qualifications  effective  until the earlier of the date as of which the Rights
are no longer exercisable for  such  securities  and  the  Expiration Date. The
Company may temporarily suspend, for a period of time not to  exceed  90  days,
the  exercisability  of  the Rights in order to prepare and file a registration
statement under the Securities Act and permit it to become effective.  Upon any
such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the
exercisability of the Rights  has  been  temporarily  suspended,  as  well as a
public  announcement  at  such  time  as the suspension is no longer in effect.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement  to  the  contrary,  the Rights
shall not be exercisable in any jurisdiction unless the requisite qualification
in  such  jurisdiction  shall  have  been  obtained  and  until  a registration
statement  under  the  Securities  Act  (if  required) shall have been declared
effective.

             (d)  The Company covenants and agrees  that  it will take all such
action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares of Preferred  Stock  (and,
following  the  time  that  any  Person  becomes an Acquiring Person, shares of
Common Stock and other securities) delivered  upon exercise of Rights shall, at
the time of delivery of the certificates therefor  (subject  to  payment of the
Purchase Price), be duly and validly authorized and issued and fully  paid  and
nonassessable shares.

             (e)   The  Company  further  covenants and agrees that it will pay
when due and payable any and all federal and  state  transfer taxes and charges
which  may  be  payable  in respect of the issuance or delivery  of  the  Right
Certificates or of any shares  of Preferred Stock (or shares of Common Stock or
other securities) upon the exercise of Rights.  The Company shall not, however,
be required to pay any transfer  tax  which  may  be  payable in respect of any
transfer  or  delivery of Right Certificates to a Person  other  than,  or  the
issuance or delivery  of  certificates or depositary receipts for the Preferred
Stock (or shares of Common Stock or other securities) in a name other than that
of,  the  registered  holder  of   the   Right  Certificate  evidencing  Rights
surrendered for exercise or to issue or deliver  any certificates or depositary
receipts for Preferred Stock (or shares of Common  Stock  or  other securities)
upon  the exercise of any Rights until any such tax shall have been  paid  (any
such tax  being payable by that holder of such Right Certificate at the time of
surrender)  or  until  it  has  been  established  to  the Company's reasonable
satisfaction that no such tax is due.

             Section 10. Preferred Stock Record Date. Each Person in whose name
any certificate for Preferred Stock is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall
for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares of
Preferred Stock represented thereby on, and such certificate  shall  be  dated,
the  date  upon  which  the  Right  Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly
surrendered and payment of the Purchase  Price  (and  any  applicable  transfer
taxes)  was  made;  provided,  however,  that if the date of such surrender and
payment is a date upon which the Preferred  Stock transfer books of the Company
are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have  become  the  record  holder of
such  shares  on,  and  such  certificate  shall  be dated, the next succeeding
Business Day on which the Preferred Stock transfer  books  of  the  Company are
open.  Prior to the exercise of the Rights evidenced thereby, the holder  of  a
Right  Certificate shall not be entitled to any rights of a holder of Preferred
Stock for which the Rights shall be exercisable, including, without limitation,
the right to vote or to receive dividends or other distributions, and shall not
be entitled  to receive any notice of any proceedings of the Company, except as
provided herein.

             Section  11.  Adjustment  of  Purchase  Price,  Number and Kind of
Shares  and  Number  of  Rights.  The Purchase Price, the number of  shares  of
Preferred Stock or other securities  or  property  purchasable upon exercise of
each Right and the number of Rights outstanding are  subject to adjustment from
time to time as provided in this Section 11.

                   (a)(i)In the event the Company shall  at  any time after the
date of this Agreement (A) declare a dividend on the Preferred Stock payable in
shares of Preferred Stock, (B) subdivide the outstanding Preferred  Stock,  (C)
combine  the  outstanding  Preferred  Stock  into a smaller number of shares of
Preferred Stock or (D) issue any shares of its  capital  stock in a reclassifi-
cation  of  the  Preferred  Stock  (including  any  such  reclassification   in
connection  with  a  consolidation  or  merger  in  which  the  Company  is the
continuing  or  surviving  corporation),  except  as otherwise provided in this
Section 11(a), the Purchase Price in effect at the  time of the record date for
such  dividend  or  of the effective date of such subdivision,  combination  or
reclassification, and  the  number and kind of shares of capital stock issuable
on such date, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any Right
exercised after such time shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and
kind of shares of capital stock which, if such Right had been exercised immedi-
ately prior to such date and  at a time when the Preferred Stock transfer books
of the Company were open, the holder  would  have  owned upon such exercise and
been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend,  subdivision,  combination
or  reclassification;  provided,  however, that in no event shall the consider-
ation to be paid upon the exercise  of one Right be less than the aggregate par
value of the shares of capital stock  of  the Company issuable upon exercise of
one Right.

                   (ii)  Subject to Section  24 of this Agreement, in the event
any  Person becomes an Acquiring Person (the first  occurrence  of  such  event
being  referred  to  hereinafter as the "Flip-In Event"), then (A) the Purchase
Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to
the Flip-In Event multiplied by the number of one one-thousandths of a share of
Preferred Stock for which  a  Right  was  exercisable immediately prior to such
Flip-In Event, whether or not such Right was  then  exercisable,  and  (B) each
holder  of a Right, except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a)(ii)  and
Section 11(a)(iii)  hereof,  shall  thereafter  have the right to receive, upon
exercise thereof at a price equal to the Purchase  Price  (as  so adjusted), in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and in lieu of shares  of Preferred
Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall equal the result obtained
by dividing the Purchase Price (as so adjusted) by 50% of the current per share
market price of the Common Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d)  hereof)
on  the  date of such Flip-In Event; provided, however, that the Purchase Price
(as so adjusted)  and  the  number of shares of Common Stock so receivable upon
exercise of a Right shall, following  the  Flip-In Event, be subject to further
adjustment   as   appropriate  in  accordance  with   Section   11(f)   hereof.
Notwithstanding anything  in  this Agreement to the contrary, however, from and
after the Flip-In Event, any Rights  that  are  beneficially  owned  by (x) any
Acquiring Person (or any Affiliate or Associate of any Acquiring Person), (y) a
transferee  of  any  Acquiring Person (or any such Affiliate or Associate)  who
becomes a transferee after  the  Flip-In  Event  or  (z)  a  transferee  of any
Acquiring  Person  (or any such Affiliate or Associate) who became a transferee
prior to or concurrently  with  the  Flip-In  Event  pursuant  to  either (I) a
transfer  from the Acquiring Person to holders of its equity securities  or  to
any Person with whom it has any continuing agreement, arrangement or understand-
ing regarding  the  transferred  Rights  or  (II) a transfer which the Board of
Directors has determined is part of a plan, arrangement  or understanding which
has  the  purpose or effect of avoiding the provisions of this  paragraph,  and
subsequent  transferees  of  such  Persons,  shall  be void without any further
action and any holder of such Rights shall thereafter  have  no  rights whatso-
ever  with  respect to such Rights under any provision of this Agreement.   The
Company shall  use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the provisions of this
Section 11(a)(ii)  are complied with, but shall have no liability to any holder
of Right Certificates  or  other  Person as a result of its failure to make any
determinations  with  respect  to  an  Acquiring   Person  or  its  Affiliates,
Associates or transferees hereunder. From and after the Flip-In Event, no Right
Certificate  shall be issued pursuant to Section 3 or  Section  6  hereof  that
represents Rights  that  are  or have become void pursuant to the provisions of
this paragraph, and any Right Certificate  delivered  to  the Rights Agent that
represents Rights that are or have become void pursuant to  the  provisions  of
this  paragraph  shall  be canceled.  From and after the occurrence of an event
specified in Section 13(a)  hereof,  any  Rights that theretofore have not been
exercised pursuant to this Section 11(a)(ii)  shall  thereafter  be exercisable
only in accordance with Section 13 and not pursuant to this Section 11(a)(ii).

                   (iii) The Company may at its option substitute  for  a share
of  Common  Stock  issuable  upon the exercise of Rights in accordance with the
foregoing subparagraph (ii) a  number  of shares of Preferred Stock or fraction
thereof such that the current per share  market price of one share of Preferred
Stock multiplied by such number or fraction  is  equal to the current per share
market price of one share of Common Stock. In the event that there shall not be
sufficient shares of Common Stock issued but not outstanding  or authorized but
unissued  to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance  with  the
foregoing subparagraph  (ii),  the  Board  of  Directors  shall,  to the extent
permitted by applicable law and any material agreements then in effect to which
the Company is a party (A) determine the excess (such excess, the "Spread")  of
(1)  the  value  of  the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of a
Right in accordance with  the foregoing subparagraph (ii) (the "Current Value")
over (2) the Purchase Price  (as  adjusted  in  accordance  with  the foregoing
subparagraph (ii)), and (B) with respect to each Right (other than Rights which
have  become  void pursuant to the foregoing subparagraph (ii)), make  adequate
provision to substitute  for  the shares of Common Stock issuable in accordance
with the foregoing subparagraph  (ii) upon exercise of the Right and payment of
the Purchase Price (as adjusted in  accordance  therewith),  (1)  cash,  (2)  a
reduction in such Purchase Price, (3) shares of Preferred Stock or other equity
securities  of  the Company (including, without limitation, shares or fractions
of shares of preferred  stock  which,  by virtue of having dividend, voting and
liquidation rights substantially comparable  to  those  of the shares of Common
Stock, are deemed in good faith by the Board of Directors  to have substantial-
ly the same value as the shares of Common Stock (such shares of Preferred Stock
and  shares or fractions of shares of preferred stock are hereinafter  referred
to as  "Common  Stock  equivalents")),  (4) debt securities of the Company, (5)
other assets, or (6) any combination of the  foregoing,  having  a value which,
when  added  to  the  value of the shares of Common Stock actually issued  upon
exercise of such Right,  shall  have  an  aggregate  value equal to the Current
Value  (less the amount of any reduction in such Purchase  Price),  where  such
aggregate  value  has been determined by the Board of Directors upon the advice
of a nationally recognized  investment  banking  firm selected in good faith by
the Board of Directors; provided, however, that if  the  Company shall not make
adequate provision to deliver value pursuant to clause (B)  above within thirty
(30) days following the Flip-In Event (the "Section 11(a) (ii)  Trigger Date"),
then  the  Company  shall  be obligated to deliver, to the extent permitted  by
applicable law and any material  agreements then in effect to which the Company
is a party, upon the surrender for  exercise  of  a Right and without requiring
payment  of  such  Purchase  Price,  shares  of  Common Stock  (to  the  extent
available),  and  then, if necessary, such number or  fractions  of  shares  of
Preferred Stock (to  the  extent available) and then, if necessary, cash, which
shares and/or cash have an  aggregate  value equal to the Spread.  If, upon the
occurrence of the Flip-In Event, the Board of Directors shall determine in good
faith that it is likely that sufficient additional shares of Common Stock could
be authorized for issuance upon exercise  in  full  of the Rights, then, if the
Board of Directors so elects, the thirty (30) day period set forth above may be
extended to the extent necessary, but not more than ninety  (90) days after the
Section  11(a)  (ii)  Trigger Date, in order that the Company may  seek  stock-
holder approval for the  authorization  of  such additional shares (such thirty
(30)  day  period, as it may be extended, is herein  called  the  "Substitution
Period").  To  the  extent that the Company determines that some action need be
taken pursuant to the  second and/or third sentence of this Section 11(a)(iii),
the Company (x) shall provide, subject to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof and the last
sentence of this Section  11(a)(iii)  hereof,  that  such  action  shall  apply
uniformly  to all outstanding Rights and (y) may suspend the exercisability  of
the Rights until the expiration of the Substitution Period in order to seek any
authorization  of  additional  shares  and/or to decide the appropriate form of
distribution to be made pursuant to such  second  sentence and to determine the
value thereof. In the event of any such suspension,  the  Company shall issue a
public  announcement  stating that the exercisability of the  Rights  has  been
temporarily suspended,  as  well  as  a public announcement at such time as the
suspension is no longer in effect. For  purposes  of  this Section 11(a) (iii),
the value of the shares of Common Stock shall be the current  per  share market
price  (as  determined  pursuant  to Section 11(d)(i)) on the Section 11(a)(ii)
Trigger  Date  and  the per share or fractional  value  of  any  "Common  Stock
equivalent" shall be  deemed to equal the current per share market price of the
Common Stock.  The Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company may, but shall not be
required to, establish procedures to allocate the right  to  receive  shares of
Common  Stock  upon the exercise of the Rights among holders of Rights pursuant
to this Section 11(a)(iii).

             (b)   In case the Company shall fix a record date for the issuance
of rights, options or warrants to all holders of Preferred Stock entitling them
(for a period expiring  within  45  calendar  days  after  such record date) to
subscribe for or purchase Preferred Stock (or shares having  the  same  rights,
privileges  and  preferences  as  the  Preferred  Stock  ("equivalent preferred
shares"))  or  securities  convertible  into  Preferred  Stock  or   equivalent
preferred  shares  at  a  price  per  share  of  Preferred  Stock or equivalent
preferred  shares  (or  having  a  conversion  price per share, if  a  security
convertible into shares of Preferred Stock or equivalent preferred shares) less
than the then current per share market price of the Preferred Stock (determined
pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on such record date, the Purchase Price to be
in  effect  after  such  record  date shall be determined  by  multiplying  the
Purchase Price in effect immediately  prior  to such record date by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the number of  shares  of  Preferred  Stock and
equivalent preferred shares outstanding on such record date plus the number  of
shares  of  Preferred Stock and equivalent preferred shares which the aggregate
offering price  of  the  total  number  of  shares  of  Preferred  Stock and/or
equivalent  preferred  shares  so  to  be offered (and/or the aggregate initial
conversion price of the convertible securities so to be offered) would purchase
at such current market price, and the denominator  of which shall be the number
of  shares of Preferred Stock and equivalent preferred  shares  outstanding  on
such record date plus the number of additional shares of Preferred Stock and/or
equivalent preferred shares to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into
which  the  convertible securities so to be offered are initially convertible);
provided, however, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the
exercise of one  Right  be  less  than the aggregate par value of the shares of
capital stock of the Company issuable  upon exercise of one Right. In case such
subscription price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be
in  a  form  other  than cash, the value of  such  consideration  shall  be  as
determined in good faith  by  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the Company, whose
determination  shall be described in a statement filed with the  Rights  Agent.
Shares of Preferred  Stock and equivalent preferred shares owned by or held for
the account of the Company  shall  not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of
any such computation.  Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such
a record date is fixed; and in the event  that such rights, options or warrants
are not so issued, the Purchase Price shall  be  adjusted  to  be  the Purchase
Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.

             (c)   In  case the Company shall fix a record date for the  making
of a distribution to all  holders  of  the  Preferred Stock (including any such
distribution made in connection with a consolidation  or  merger  in  which the
Company   is   the   continuing  or  surviving  corporation)  of  evidences  of
indebtedness or assets  (other  than  a  regular  quarterly  cash dividend or a
dividend  payable  in  Preferred  Stock)  or  subscription  rights or  warrants
(excluding those referred to in Section 11(b) hereof), the Purchase Price to be
in  effect  after  such  record  date  shall  be determined by multiplying  the
Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such  record  date by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the then current per share market  price of the
Preferred  Stock  (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on such  record
date, less the fair  market  value (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Company whose  determination shall be described in a statement
filed with the Rights Agent) of the  portion  of  the  assets  or  evidences of
indebtedness  so  to be distributed or of such subscription rights or  warrants
applicable to one share  of Preferred Stock, and the denominator of which shall
be such current per share  market  price  (determined pursuant to Section 11(d)
hereof) of the Preferred Stock; provided, however,  that  in no event shall the
consideration  to  be  paid  upon the exercise of one Right be  less  than  the
aggregate par value of the shares  of capital stock of the Company to be issued
upon  exercise  of  one Right.  Such adjustments  shall  be  made  successively
whenever such a record  date  is fixed; and in the event that such distribution
is not so made, the Purchase Price  shall  again be adjusted to be the Purchase
Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.

             (d)(i)Except as otherwise provided  herein, for the purpose of any
computation hereunder, the "current per share market  price" of any security (a
"Security"  for  the purpose of this Section 11(d)(i)) on  any  date  shall  be
deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of such Security
for the 30 consecutive  Trading  Days  (as  such  term  is hereinafter defined)
immediately prior to such date; provided, however, that in  the  event that the
current  per share market price of the Security is determined during  a  period
following  the announcement by the issuer of such Security of (A) a dividend or
distribution  on such Security payable in shares of such Security or securities
convertible  into   such   shares,  or  (B)  any  subdivision,  combination  or
reclassification of such Security,  and  prior  to the expiration of 30 Trading
Days  after  the ex-dividend date for such dividend  or  distribution,  or  the
record date for such subdivision, combination or reclassification, then, and in
each such case,  the  current  per  share  market  price shall be appropriately
adjusted  to  reflect  the current market price per share  equivalent  of  such
Security. The closing price  for each day shall be the last sale price, regular
way, or, in case no such sale  takes  place  on  such  day,  the average of the
closing  bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported  by  the
principal  consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities
listed or admitted  to  trading  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange or, if the
Security is not listed or admitted to trading on the New York  Stock  Exchange,
as  reported  in  the principal consolidated transaction reporting system  with
respect to securities  listed  on the principal national securities exchange on
which the Security is listed or  admitted to trading or, if the Security is not
listed or admitted to trading on any  national  securities  exchange,  the last
quoted  price  or,  if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked
prices in the over-the-counter  market,  as  reported  by  NASDAQ or such other
system then in use, or, if on any such date the Security is  not  quoted by any
such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished
by a professional market maker making a market in the Security selected  by the
Board  of Directors of the Company. The term "Trading Day" shall mean a day  on
which the  principal  national  securities  exchange  on  which the Security is
listed or admitted to trading is open for the transaction of  business  or,  if
the  Security  is  not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities
exchange, a Business Day.

                   (ii)  For  the  purpose of any computation hereunder, if the
Preferred Stock is publicly traded, the "current per share market price" of the
Preferred Stock shall be determined  in accordance with the method set forth in
Section 11(d)(i). If the Preferred Stock  is not publicly traded but the Common
Stock is publicly traded, the "current per share market price" of the Preferred
Stock shall be conclusively deemed to be the  current per share market price of
the Common Stock as determined pursuant to Section  11(d)(i)  multiplied by one
thousand (appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock  dividend or
similar  transaction  occurring  after the date hereof). If neither the  Common
Stock nor the Preferred Stock is publicly  traded,  "current  per  share market
price" shall mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith  by  the
Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in  a
statement filed with the Rights Agent.

             (e)   No adjustment in the Purchase Price shall be required unless
such  adjustment  would  require  an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the
Purchase Price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this
Section 11(e) are not required to be  made  shall  be carried forward and taken
into account in any subsequent adjustment.  All calculations under this Section
11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest  one  hundred-thousandth
of  a  share  of  Preferred  Stock or share of Common Stock or other  share  or
security as the case may be. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section
11(e), any adjustment required  by  this Section 11 shall be made no later than
the earlier of (i) three years from the  date of the transaction which requires
such adjustment or (ii) the Expiration Date.

             (f)   If as a result of an adjustment  made  pursuant  to  Section
11(a)  hereof,  the  holder  of  any  Right  thereafter  exercised shall become
entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the Company  other  than the
Preferred  Stock,  thereafter  the  Purchase Price and the number of such other
shares so receivable upon exercise of  a  Right  shall be subject to adjustment
from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly  equivalent as practicable
to  the  provisions with respect to the Preferred Stock contained  in  Sections
11(a), 11(b),  11(c),  11(e), 11(h), 11(i) and 11(m) hereof, as applicable, and
the provisions of Sections  7,  9,  10,  13  and  14 hereof with respect to the
Preferred Stock shall apply on like terms to any such other shares.

             (g)   All Rights originally issued by  the  Company  subsequent to
any adjustment made to the Purchase Price hereunder shall evidence the right to
purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, the number of one one-thousandths  of
a  share  of Preferred Stock purchasable from time to time hereunder upon exer-
cise of the Rights, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

             (h)   Unless  the  Company  shall  have  exercised its election as
provided  in Section 11(i), upon each adjustment of the  Purchase  Price  as  a
result  of the  calculations  made  in  Sections  11(b)  and  (c),  each  Right
outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall thereafter
evidence  the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that number of
one one-thousandths  of  a  share of Preferred Stock (calculated to the nearest
one  hundred-thousandth  of  a  share  of  Preferred  Stock)  obtained  by  (i)
multiplying (x) the number of one one-thousandths of a share covered by a Right
immediately prior to such adjustment  by  (y)  the  Purchase  Price  in  effect
immediately  prior  to  such adjustment of the Purchase Price and (ii) dividing
the product so obtained by  the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such
adjustment of the Purchase Price.

             (i)   The Company may elect on or after the date of any adjustment
of the Purchase Price pursuant  to  Sections 11(a)(i), 11(b) or 11(c) hereof to
adjust the number of Rights, in substitution  for  any adjustment in the number
of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon the exer-
cise of a Right.  Each of the Rights outstanding after  such  adjustment of the
number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one one-thousandths  of
a  share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior
to such  adjustment.  Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the
number of Rights shall  become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest
one-hundredth) obtained by  dividing  the  Purchase Price in effect immediately
prior  to adjustment of the Purchase Price by  the  Purchase  Price  in  effect
immediately  after  adjustment  of the Purchase Price. The Company shall make a
public announcement of its election  to adjust the number of Rights, indicating
the record date for the adjustment, and,  if  known  at the time, the amount of
the adjustment to be made. This record date may be the  date  on which the Pur-
chase  Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right  Certificates
have been  issued,  shall be at least 10 days later than the date of the public
announcement. If Right  Certificates  have been issued, upon each adjustment of
the  number  of Rights pursuant to this Section  11(i),  the  Company  may,  as
promptly as practicable,  cause to be distributed to holders of record of Right
Certificates on such record  date  Right  Certificates  evidencing,  subject to
Section  14  hereof,  the  additional  Rights  to  which  such holders shall be
entitled  as  a result of such adjustment, or, at the option  of  the  Company,
shall cause to  be  distributed  to  such holders of record in substitution and
replacement for the Right Certificates  held  by such holders prior to the date
of  adjustment, and upon surrender thereof, if required  by  the  Company,  new
Right  Certificates  evidencing  all  the Rights to which such holders shall be
entitled after such adjustment. Right Certificates  so  to be distributed shall
be  issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided  for  herein  and
shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Right Certificates
on the record date specified in the public announcement.

             (j)   Irrespective  of  any  adjustment  or change in the Purchase
Price or the number of one one-thousandths of a share of  Preferred Stock issu-
able  upon the exercise of the Rights, the Right Certificates  theretofore  and
thereafter  issued may continue to express the Purchase Price and the number of
one one-thousandths  of  a share of Preferred Stock which were expressed in the
initial Right Certificates issued hereunder.

             (k)   Before  taking  any  action  that  would cause an adjustment
reducing the Purchase Price below the then par value, if  any,  of the fraction
of Preferred Stock or other shares of capital stock issuable upon  exercise  of
the  Rights,  the  Company  shall  take  any corporate action which may, in the
opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order  that the Company may validly and
legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares  of  Preferred Stock or other
such shares at such adjusted Purchase Price.

             (l)   In any case in which this Section 11  shall  require that an
adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a record  date  for  a
specified  event,  the  Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such
event the issuing to the  holder  of any Right exercised after such record date
of the Preferred Stock and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if
any, issuable upon such exercise over  and  above the Preferred Stock and other
capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise
on  the  basis  of  the  Purchase Price in effect  prior  to  such  adjustment;
provided, however, that the  Company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or
other appropriate instrument evidencing  such  holder's  right  to receive such
additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.

             (m)   Anything in this Section 11 to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Company shall be entitled to make such reductions in the Purchase Price, in
addition to those adjustments expressly required by this Section  11, as and to
the  extent  that it in its sole discretion shall determine to be advisable  in
order that any  consolidation  or  subdivision of the Preferred Stock, issuance
wholly for cash of any shares of Preferred  Stock  at  less  than  the  current
market  price,  issuance wholly for cash of Preferred Stock or securities which
by their terms are  convertible  into  or  exchangeable  for  Preferred  Stock,
dividends  on  Preferred Stock payable in shares of Preferred Stock or issuance
of rights, options  or  warrants  referred  to  hereinabove  in  Section 11(b),
hereafter  made by the Company to holders of its Preferred Stock shall  not  be
taxable to such stockholders.

             (n)   Anything  in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
in the event that at any time after the date of this Rights Agreement and prior
to the Distribution Date, the  Company shall (i) declare or pay any dividend on
the Common Stock payable in Common Stock or (ii) effect a subdivision, combina-
tion or consolidation of the Common  Stock  (by  reclassification  or otherwise
than by payment of a dividend payable in Common Stock) into a greater or lesser
number of shares of Common Stock, then, in each such case, the number of Rights
associated with each share of Common Stock then outstanding, or issued or deliv-
ered thereafter, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the number of Rights
thereafter associated with each share of Common Stock following any  such event
shall  equal the result obtained by multiplying the number of Rights associated
with each  share  of Common Stock immediately prior to such event by a fraction
the numerator of which  shall  be  the  total  number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding  immediately  prior  to  the  occurrence   of  the  event  and  the
denominator  of  which  shall  be the total number of shares  of  Common  Stock
outstanding immediately following the occurrence of such event.

             (o)   The  Company  agrees   that,   after   the  earlier  of  the
Distribution  Date  or  the  Stock  Acquisition  Date, it will not,  except  as
permitted by Sections 23, 24 or 27 hereof, take (or  permit  any  Subsidiary to
take)  any  action  if  at  the  time  such  action  is  taken it is reasonably
foreseeable that such action will diminish substantially or eliminate the bene-
fits intended to be afforded by the Rights.

             Section 12. Certificate of Adjusted Purchase  Price  or  Number of
Shares.  Whenever an adjustment is made as provided in Section 11 or 13 hereof,
the  Company  shall  promptly  (a)  prepare  a  certificate  setting forth such
adjustment, and a brief statement of the facts accounting for  such adjustment,
(b)  file  with  the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for  the  Common
Stock and the Preferred  Stock  a copy of such certificate and (c) mail a brief
summary  thereof to each holder of  a  Right  Certificate  in  accordance  with
Section 25  hereof  (if so required under Section 25 hereof).  The Rights Agent
shall be fully protected  in  relying  on  any  such  certificate  and  on  any
adjustment  therein  contained and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any
such adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate.

             Section 13. Consolidation, Merger or Sale or Transfer of Assets or
Earnings Power.

             (a) In the  event,  directly  or indirectly, at any time after the
Flip-In Event (i) the Company shall merge with  and into any other Person, (ii)
any Person shall consolidate with the Company, or  any  Person shall merge with
and  into  the  Company  and the Company shall be the continuing  or  surviving
corporation of such merger  and, in connection with such merger, all or part of
the  Common  Stock shall be changed  into  or  exchanged  for  stock  or  other
securities of  any  other  Person  (or  of  the  Company)  or cash or any other
property, or (iii) the Company shall sell or otherwise transfer (or one or more
of  its  Subsidiaries  shall  sell  or  otherwise  transfer),  in one  or  more
transactions, assets or earning power aggregating 50% or more of  the assets or
earning  power  of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole)  to  any
other Person (other  than  the Company or one or more wholly owned Subsidiaries
of the Company), then upon the first occurrence of such event, proper provision
shall be made so that:  (A)  each  holder  of  a Right (other than Rights which
have become void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof)  shall  thereafter  have
the  right  to  receive,  upon  the  exercise thereof at the Purchase Price (as
theretofore  adjusted  in  accordance  with   Section   11(a)(ii)  hereof),  in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and in lieu of  shares of Preferred
Stock  or  Common Stock of the Company, such number of validly  authorized  and
issued, fully  paid, non-assessable and freely tradeable shares of Common Stock
of the Principal  Party  (as  such term is hereinafter defined), not subject to
any liens, encumbrances, rights  of  first  refusal or other adverse claims, as
shall equal the result obtained by dividing the  Purchase Price (as theretofore
adjusted in accordance with Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) by 50% of the current per
share  market  price  of the Common Stock of such Principal  Party  (determined
pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on the date of consummation of such consolida-
tion, merger, sale or transfer;  provided, however, that the Purchase Price (as
theretofore adjusted in accordance  with  Section  11(a)(ii)  hereof)  and  the
number  of  shares  of  Common Stock of such Principal Party so receivable upon
exercise of a Right shall  be  subject  to further adjustment as appropriate in
accordance with Section 11(f) hereof to reflect any events occurring in respect
of  the  Common Stock of such Principal Party  after  the  occurrence  of  such
consolidation,  merger,  sale  or  transfer;  (B)  such  Principal  Party shall
thereafter  be  liable  for, and shall assume, by virtue of such consolidation,
merger, sale or transfer,  all  the  obligations  and  duties  of  the  Company
pursuant  to this Rights Agreement; (C) the term "Company" shall thereafter  be
deemed to refer  to  such  Principal  Party; and (D) such Principal Party shall
take such steps (including, but not limited to, the reservation of a sufficient
number of its shares of Common Stock in  accordance  with  Section 9 hereof) in
connection with such consummation of any such transaction as  may  be necessary
to assure that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable,  as nearly
as  reasonably may be, in relation to the shares of its Common Stock thereafter
deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights; provided that, upon the subsequent
occurrence  of  any  consolidation, merger, sale or transfer of assets or other
extraordinary transaction  in respect of such Principal Party, each holder of a
Right shall thereupon be entitled  to  receive,  upon  exercise  of a Right and
payment  of  the  Purchase Price as provided in this Section 13(a), such  cash,
shares, rights, warrants  and  other property which such holder would have been
entitled to receive had such holder, at the time of such transaction, owned the
Common Stock of the Principal Party  receivable  upon  the  exercise of a Right
pursuant to this Section 13(a), and such Principal Party shall  take such steps
(including,  but  not  limited  to, reservation of shares of stock) as  may  be
necessary to permit the subsequent  exercise  of  the Rights in accordance with
the terms hereof for such cash, shares, rights, warrants and other property.

             (b) "Principal Party" shall mean

                   (i)   in the case of any transaction  described  in  (i)  or
(ii)  of the first sentence of Section 13(a) hereof: (A) the Person that is the
issuer of the securities into which the shares of Common Stock are converted in
such merger  or  consolidation,  or, if there is more than one such issuer, the
issuer the shares of Common Stock  of  which have the greatest aggregate market
value of shares outstanding, or (B) if no  securities  are  so  issued, (x) the
Person  that  is  the  other party to the merger, if such Person survives  said
merger, or, if there is  more  than  one  such Person, the Person the shares of
Common  Stock  of  which have the greatest aggregate  market  value  of  shares
outstanding or (y) if the Person that is the other party to the merger does not
survive the merger,  the  Person  that  does  survive the merger (including the
Company if it survives) or (z) the Person resulting from the consolidation; and

                   (ii)  in the case of any transaction  described  in (iii) of
the  first  sentence  in  Section  13(a)  hereof,  the Person that is the party
receiving  the  greatest  portion  of the assets or earning  power  transferred
pursuant to such transaction or transactions,  or,  if  each  Person  that is a
party  to  such  transaction  or transactions receives the same portion of  the
assets or earning power so transferred  or if the Person receiving the greatest
portion of the assets or earning power cannot  be determined, whichever of such
Persons as is the issuer of Common Stock having  the  greatest aggregate market
value of shares outstanding;

provided,  however,  that  in any such case described in the  foregoing  clause
(b)(i) or (b)(ii), if the Common  Stock  of  such Person is not at such time or
has not been continuously over the preceding 12-month  period  registered under
Section 12 of the Exchange Act, then (1) if such Person is a direct or indirect
Subsidiary  of  another  Person  the Common Stock of which is and has  been  so
registered, the term "Principal Party" shall refer to such other Person, or (2)
if  such Person is a Subsidiary, directly  or  indirectly,  of  more  than  one
Person,  the  Common  Stock  of all of which is and has been so registered, the
term "Principal Party" shall refer  to  whichever of such Persons is the issuer
of Common Stock having the greatest aggregate  market value of shares outstand-
ing, or (3) if such Person is owned, directly or indirectly, by a joint venture
formed by two or more Persons that are not owned,  directly  or  indirectly, by
the same Person, the rules set forth in clauses (1) and (2) above  shall  apply
to  each of the owners having an interest in the venture as if the Person owned
by the  joint  venture was a Subsidiary of both or all of such joint venturers,
and the Principal  Party in each such case shall bear the obligations set forth
in this Section 13 in  the  same  ratio as its interest in such Person bears to
the total of such interests.

             (c)   The Company shall  not consummate any consolidation, merger,
sale or transfer referred to in Section  13(a)  hereof unless prior thereto the
Company  and  the  Principal Party involved therein  shall  have  executed  and
delivered to the Rights  Agent an agreement confirming that the requirements of
Sections 13(a) and (b) hereof  shall  promptly  be performed in accordance with
their terms and that such consolidation, merger,  sale  or  transfer  of assets
shall  not  result in a default by the Principal Party under this Agreement  as
the same shall  have  been  assumed by the Principal Party pursuant to Sections
13(a) and (b) hereof and providing that, as soon as practicable after executing
such agreement pursuant to this Section 13, the Principal Party will:

                   (i)   prepare  and  file  a registration statement under the
Securities Act, if necessary, with respect to  the  Rights  and  the securities
purchasable  upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, use  its  best
efforts to cause  such  registration  statement  to become effective as soon as
practicable after such filing and use its best efforts  to cause such registra-
tion statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at  all times meeting the
requirements  of  the Securities Act) until the Expiration Date  and  similarly
comply with applicable state securities laws;

                   (ii)  use  its  best  efforts,  if  the  Common Stock of the
Principal Party shall be listed or admitted to trading on the  New  York  Stock
Exchange  or  on  another  national  securities  exchange,  to list or admit to
trading (or continue the listing of) the Rights and the securities  purchasable
upon  exercise  of the Rights on the New York Stock Exchange or such securities
exchange, or, if the Common Stock of the Principal Party shall not be listed or
admitted to trading  on  the  New  York Stock Exchange or a national securities
exchange, to cause the Rights and the  securities  receivable  upon exercise of
the  Rights  to  be authorized for quotation on NASDAQ or on such other  system
then in use;

                   (iii) deliver  to holders of the Rights historical financial
statements for the Principal Party  which  comply  in  all  respects  with  the
requirements  for  registration  on  Form  10 (or any successor form) under the
Exchange Act; and

                   (iv)  obtain  waivers of any  rights  of  first  refusal  or
preemptive rights in respect of the Common Stock of the Principal Party subject
to purchase upon exercise of outstanding Rights.

             (d)   In case the Principal  Party  has  provision  in  any of its
authorized  securities  or  in  its certificate of incorporation or by-laws  or
other instrument governing its corporate  affairs,  which  provision would have
the effect of (i) causing such Principal Party to issue (other  than to holders
of  Rights  pursuant  to this Section 13), in connection with, or as  a  conse-
quence of, the consummation  of  a  transaction referred to in this Section 13,
shares of Common Stock of such Principal  Party  at  less than the then current
market price per share thereof (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) or
securities exercisable for, or convertible into, Common Stock of such Principal
Party at less than such then current market price, or  (ii)  providing  for any
special  payment,  tax or similar provision in connection with the issuance  of
the Common Stock of  such Principal Party pursuant to the provisions of Section
13, then, in such event,  the  Company hereby agrees with each holder of Rights
that it shall not consummate any  such  transaction  unless  prior  thereto the
Company  and  such  Principal  Party  shall have executed and delivered to  the
Rights Agent a supplemental agreement providing  that the provision in question
of such Principal Party shall have been canceled,  waived  or  amended, or that
the  authorized securities shall be redeemed, so that the applicable  provision
will have  no  effect  in  connection with, or as a consequence of, the consum-
mation of the proposed transaction.

             (e)   The Company  covenants  and agrees that it shall not, at any
time after the Flip-In Event, enter into any  transaction of the type described
in clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 13(a) hereof  if  (i) at the time of or
immediately  after  such  consolidation,  merger,  sale,  transfer   or   other
transaction  there  are any rights, warrants or other instruments or securities
outstanding or agreements  in  effect  which  would  substantially  diminish or
otherwise  eliminate  the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights,  (ii)
prior to, simultaneously  with or immediately after such consolidation, merger,
sale, transfer or other transaction, the stockholders of the Person who consti-
tutes, or would constitute,  the  Principal Party for purposes of Section 13(a)
hereof shall have received a distribution  of  Rights  previously owned by such
Person or any of its Affiliates or Associates or (iii) the  form  or  nature of
organization  of the Principal Party would preclude or limit the exercisability
of the Rights.

             Section 14. Fractional Rights and Fractional Shares.

             (a) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Rights
or to distribute  Right  Certificates  which evidence fractional Rights (except
prior to the Distribution Date in accordance  with  Section  11(n)  hereof). In
lieu  of such fractional Rights, there shall be paid to the registered  holders
of the  Right  Certificates  with  regard to which such fractional Rights would
otherwise be issuable, an amount in  cash  equal  to  the  same fraction of the
current market value of a whole Right. For the purposes of this  Section 14(a),
the  current  market value of a whole Right shall be the closing price  of  the
Rights for the  Trading  Day  immediately  prior  to  the  date  on  which such
fractional Rights would have been otherwise issuable. The closing price for any
day  shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale  takes
place  on  such  day,  the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular
way,  in either case as reported  in  the  principal  consolidated  transaction
reporting  system  with  respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on
the New York Stock Exchange  or,  if  the  Rights are not listed or admitted to
trading  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange,  as  reported  in  the  principal
consolidated transaction reporting system with respect  to securities listed on
the principal national securities exchange on which the Rights  are  listed  or
admitted  to trading or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on
any national  securities  exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted,
the average of the high bid  and  low  asked  prices  in  the  over-the-counter
market, as reported by NASDAQ or such other system then in use or,  if  on  any
such  date  the  Rights are not quoted by any such organization, the average of
the closing bid and  asked  prices  as furnished by a professional market maker
making  a market in the Rights selected  by  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the
Company.  If  on  any  such date no such market maker is making a market in the
Rights, the fair value of  the  Rights on such date as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors of the Company shall be used.

             (b)   The Company shall  not  be  required  to  issue fractions of
Preferred Stock (other than fractions which are integral multiples  of one one-
thousandth  of  a share of Preferred Stock) upon exercise of the Rights  or  to
distribute certificates  which  evidence  fractional  shares of Preferred Stock
(other than fractions which are integral multiples of one  one-thousandth  of a
share  of  Preferred  Stock).  Interests  in  fractions  of  Preferred Stock in
integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred  Stock may, at
the  election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts, pursuant  to
an appropriate  agreement  between the Company and a depositary selected by it;
provided, that such agreement shall provide that the holders of such depositary
receipts shall have all the  rights,  privileges  and preferences to which they
are entitled as beneficial owners of the Preferred  Stock  represented  by such
depositary  receipts. In lieu of fractional shares of Preferred Stock that  are
not integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, the
Company shall  pay  to the registered holders of Right Certificates at the time
such Rights are exercised  as  herein  provided  an amount in cash equal to the
same fraction of the current per share market price  of  one share of Preferred
Stock  (as  determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) for  the  Trading  Day
immediately prior to the date of such exercise.

             (c)   The  holder  of  a  Right  by  the  acceptance  of the Right
expressly  waives  his right to receive any fractional Rights or any fractional
shares upon exercise of a Right (except as provided above).

             Section  15.  Rights of Action. All rights of action in respect of
this Agreement, excepting the  rights of action given to the Rights Agent under
Section 18 hereof, are vested in the respective registered holders of the Right
Certificates (and, prior to the  Distribution  Date,  the registered holders of
the  Common  Stock);  and any registered holder of any Right  Certificate  (or,
prior to the Distribution  Date,  of  the Common Stock), without the consent of
the Rights Agent or of the holder of any  other Right Certificate (or, prior to
the Distribution Date, of the Common Stock),  on his own behalf and for his own
benefit,  may  enforce,  and may institute and maintain  any  suit,  action  or
proceeding against the Company  to enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, his
right to exercise the Rights evidenced  by such Right Certificate (or, prior to
the Distribution Date, such Common Stock) in the manner provided therein and in
this Agreement.  Without limiting the foregoing  or  any  remedies available to
the  holders  of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that  the  holders  of
Rights would not  have  an  adequate  remedy  at  law  for  any  breach of this
Agreement  and  will  be  entitled  to  specific performance of the obligations
under, and injunctive relief against actual  or  threatened  violations of, the
obligations of any Person subject to this Agreement.

             Section 16. Agreement of Right Holders. Every holder  of  a Right,
by  accepting  the  same,  consents  and agrees with the Company and the Rights
Agent and with every other holder of a Right that:

             (a)   prior  to  the  Distribution   Date,   the  Rights  will  be
transferable only in connection with the transfer of the Common Stock;

             (b)   after  the  Distribution  Date,  the Right Certificates  are
transferable only on the registry books of the Rights  Agent  if surrendered at
the  office  or  agency  of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose,  duly
endorsed or accompanied by a proper instrument of transfer; and

             (c)   the Company  and  the  Rights  Agent  may deem and treat the
Person in whose name the Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date,
the Common Stock certificate) is registered as the absolute  owner  thereof and
of the Rights evidenced thereby (notwithstanding any notations of ownership  or
writing  on  the  Right  Certificates  or  the Common Stock certificate made by
anyone  other than the Company or the Rights  Agent)  for  all  purposes  what-
soever, and  neither  the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any
notice to the contrary.

             Section 17.  Right Certificate Holder Not Deemed a Stockholder. No
holder, as such, of any Right  Certificate  shall  be entitled to vote, receive
dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of the Preferred Stock or any
other  securities  of  the Company which may at any time  be  issuable  on  the
exercise of the Rights represented thereby, nor shall anything contained herein
or in any Right Certificate be construed to confer upon the holder of any Right
Certificate, as such, any  of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any
right to vote for the election  of  directors  or  upon any matter submitted to
stockholders  at  any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold  consent  to  any
corporate action, or  to  receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting
stockholders (except as provided in this Agreement), or to receive dividends or
subscription rights, or otherwise,  until  the  Rights  evidenced by such Right
Certificate shall have been exercised in accordance with the provisions hereof.

             Section 18. Concerning the Rights Agent.

             (a)  The  Company  agrees  to pay to the Rights  Agent  reasonable
compensation for all services rendered by  it hereunder and, from time to time,
on demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable  expenses  and  counsel  fees and
other  disbursements  incurred  in  the  administration  and  execution of this
Agreement  and  the  exercise  and  performance  of its duties hereunder.   The
Company also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent  for, and to hold it harmless
against, any loss, liability or expense, incurred without gross negligence, bad
faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Rights  Agent, for anything done
or omitted by the Rights Agent in connection with the acceptance and administra-
tion of this Agreement, including the costs and expenses  of  defending against
any claim of liability arising therefrom, directly or indirectly.

             (b)   The  Rights  Agent  shall  be protected and shall  incur  no
liability for, or in respect of any action taken,  suffered or omitted by it in
connection  with, its administration of this Agreement  in  reliance  upon  any
Right Certificate or certificate for the Preferred Stock or Common Stock or for
other securities of the Company, instrument of assignment or transfer, power of
attorney,  endorsement,   affidavit,   letter,   notice,   direction,  consent,
certificate, statement or other paper or document believed by  it to be genuine
and  to be signed, executed and, where necessary, verified or acknowledged,  by
the proper  Person  or  Persons, or otherwise upon the advice of counsel as set
forth in Section 20 hereof.

             Section 19.  Merger  or  Consolidation or Change of Name of Rights
Agent.

             (a) Any corporation into which  the  Rights Agent or any successor
Rights  Agent  may  be  merged  or with which it may be  consolidated,  or  any
corporation resulting from any merger  or  consolidation  to  which  the Rights
Agent  or  any  successor  Rights  Agent  shall  be a party, or any corporation
succeeding to the stock transfer or corporate trust  powers of the Rights Agent
or any successor Rights Agent, shall be the successor to the Rights Agent under
this Agreement without the execution or filing of any  paper or any further act
on the part of any of the parties hereto; provided, that such corporation would
be eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under the provisions of
Section  21  hereof.   In  case at the time such successor Rights  Agent  shall
succeed to the agency created  by this Agreement, any of the Right Certificates
shall have been countersigned but  not  delivered,  any  such  successor Rights
Agent  may  adopt  the  countersignature  of  the predecessor Rights Agent  and
deliver such Right Certificates so countersigned;  and in case at that time any
of  the  Right  Certificates shall not have been countersigned,  any  successor
Rights Agent may  countersign such Right Certificates either in the name of the
predecessor Rights  Agent  or in the name of the successor Rights Agent; and in
all such cases such Right Certificates  shall  have  the full force provided in
the Right Certificates and in this Agreement.

             (b)   In case at any time the name of the  Rights  Agent  shall be
changed  and  at  such  time  any  of  the  Right  Certificates shall have been
countersigned but not delivered, the Rights Agent may  adopt  the countersigna-
ture under its prior name and deliver Right Certificates so countersigned;  and
in  case  at  that  time  any  of  the  Right  Certificates shall not have been
countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign  such Right Certificates either
in  its  prior name or in its changed name and in all  such  cases  such  Right
Certificates  shall  have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and
in this Agreement.

             Section 20.  Duties  of  Rights Agent. The Rights Agent undertakes
the duties and obligations imposed by this  Agreement  upon the following terms
and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders  of  Right Certifi-
cates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:

             (a)   The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel  (who may be
legal counsel for the Company), and the opinion of such counsel shall  be  full
and  complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent as to any action
taken or omitted by it in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.

             (b)   Whenever  in the performance of its duties under this Agree-
ment the Rights Agent shall deem  it  necessary  or  desirable that any fact or
matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any
action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof
be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be  conclusively proved and
established by a certificate signed by the President and  the  Secretary of the
Company and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate  shall  be full
authorization  to  the  Rights  Agent  for any action taken or suffered in good
faith  by  it under the provisions of this  Agreement  in  reliance  upon  such
certificate.

             (c)   The  Rights  Agent  shall be liable hereunder to the Company
and  any  other  Person  only  for its own negligence,  bad  faith  or  willful
misconduct.

             (d)   The Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any
of the statements of fact or recitals  contained  in  this  Agreement or in the
Right  Certificates  (except  its countersignature thereof) or be  required  to
verify the same, but all such statements  and  recitals are and shall be deemed
to have been made by the Company only.

             (e)   The Rights Agent shall not be  under  any  responsibility in
respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and  delivery hereof
(except  the  due  execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect  of  the
validity or execution  of  any  Right  Certificate (except its countersignature
thereof); nor shall it be responsible for  any  breach  by  the  Company of any
covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Right  Certificate;
nor shall it be responsible for any change in the exercisability of  the Rights
(including  the  Rights becoming void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof)  or
any adjustment in  the  terms of the Rights provided for in Sections 3, 11, 13,
23 and 24, or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any
such change or adjustment  (except  with  respect  to  the  exercise  of Rights
evidenced  by  Right  Certificates  after  receipt  of  a certificate furnished
pursuant to Section 12, describing such change or adjustment);  nor shall it by
any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty  as  to  the
authorization  or  reservation  of  any  shares  of  Preferred  Stock  or other
securities to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Right Certificate  or
as  to  whether  any  shares  of Preferred Stock or other securities will, when
issued, be validly authorized and issued fully paid and nonassessable.

             (f)   The Company  agrees  that it will perform, execute, acknowl-
edge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered
all such further and other acts, instruments  and  assurances as may reasonably
be  required  by the Rights Agent for the carrying out  or  performing  by  the
Rights Agent of the provisions of this Agreement.

             (g)   The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept
instructions with  respect  to the performance of its duties hereunder from any
person reasonably believed by  the  Rights  Agent to be one of the President or
the  Secretary of the Company, and to apply to  such  officers  for  advice  or
instructions  in connection with its duties, and it shall not be liable for any
action taken or suffered by it in good faith in accordance with instructions of
any  such  officer  or  for  any  delay  in  acting  while  waiting  for  those
instructions.   Any  application  by  the Rights Agent for written instructions
from the Company may, at the option of  the  Rights Agent, set forth in writing
any  action proposed to be taken or omitted by  the  Rights  Agent  under  this
Agreement and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or such
omission  shall  be  effective.   The  Rights Agent shall not be liable for any
action taken by, or omission of, the Rights Agent in accordance with a proposal
included  in  any  such application on or after  the  date  specified  in  such
application (which date  shall  not  be  less than five Business Days after the
date any officer of the Company actually receives  such  application unless any
such officer shall have consented in writing to an earlier  date) unless, prior
to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case  of  an omission),
the Rights Agent shall have received written instructions in response  to  such
application specifying the action to be taken or omitted.

             (h)   The  Rights  Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or
employee of the Rights Agent may  buy,  sell  or  deal  in any of the Rights or
other  securities  of  the  Company  or  become pecuniarily interested  in  any
transaction in which the Company may be interested,  or  contract  with or lend
money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not
Rights  Agent  under this Agreement.  Nothing herein shall preclude the  Rights
Agent from acting  in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal
entity.

             (i)   The  Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights
or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself or by
or  through its attorneys  or  agents,  and  the  Rights  Agent  shall  not  be
answerable  or  accountable  for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any
such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company resulting from any such
act, default, neglect or misconduct,  provided reasonable care was exercised in
the selection and continued employment thereof.

             (j)   If, with respect to  any  Rights  Certificate surrendered to
the  Rights Agent for exercise or transfer, the certificate  contained  in  the
form of assignment or the form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse
thereof,  as  the  case may be, has not been completed to certify the holder is
not an Acquiring Person  (or an Affiliate or Associate thereof), a Rights Agent
shall not take any further  action  with  respect to such requested exercise of
transfer without first consulting with the Company.

             Section 21.  Change of Rights  Agent.   The  Rights  Agent  or any
successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under  this
Agreement  upon  30  days'  notice in writing mailed to the Company and to each
transfer  agent  of the Common  Stock  or  Preferred  Stock  by  registered  or
certified mail, and,  following  the  Distribution  Date, to the holders of the
Right  Certificates by first-class mail.  The Company  may  remove  the  Rights
Agent or  any successor Rights Agent upon 30 days' notice in writing, mailed to
the Rights  Agent  or  successor  Rights Agent, as the case may be, and to each
transfer  agent  of  the Common Stock  or  Preferred  Stock  by  registered  or
certified mail, and, following  the  Distribution  Date,  to the holders of the
Right Certificates by first-class mail.  If the Rights Agent shall resign or be
removed  or  shall  otherwise  become  incapable of acting, the  Company  shall
appoint a successor to the Rights Agent.   If  the  Company  shall fail to make
such appointment within a period of 30 days after giving notice of such removal
or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or  incapacity  by
the  resigning  or  incapacitated  Rights  Agent  or  by  the holder of a Right
Certificate  (who  shall,  with such notice, submit his Right  Certificate  for
inspection by the Company), then the registered holder of any Right Certificate
may apply to any court of competent  jurisdiction  for the appointment of a new
Rights Agent.  Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed  by the Company or
by such a court, shall be a corporation organized and doing business  under the
laws of the United States or the laws of any state of the United States  or the
District of Columbia, in good standing, having an office in the State of Texas,
which  is  authorized  under  such  laws  to  exercise corporate trust or stock
transfer  powers and is subject to supervision or  examination  by  federal  or
state authority  and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a
combined capital and  surplus  of at least $50 million.  After appointment, the
successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and
responsibilities as if it had been  originally  named  as  Rights Agent without
further  act  or  deed;  but  the  predecessor Rights Agent shall  deliver  and
transfer to the successor Rights Agent  any  property  at  the  time held by it
hereunder,  and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance,  act  or
deed necessary  for the purpose.  Not later than the effective date of any such
appointment  the  Company  shall  file  notice  thereof  in  writing  with  the
predecessor Rights  Agent  and  each  transfer  agent  of  the  Common Stock or
Preferred Stock, and, following the Distribution Date, mail a notice thereof in
writing to the registered holders of the Right Certificates.  Failure  to  give
any  notice  provided  for  in this Section 21, however, or any defect therein,
shall not affect the legality  or validity of the resignation or removal of the
Rights Agent or the appointment  of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may
be.

             Section 22. Issuance  of  New Right Certificates.  Notwithstanding
any of the provisions of this Agreement  or  of the Rights to the contrary, the
Company may, at its option, issue new Right Certificates  evidencing  Rights in
such forms as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any  adjust-
ment  or change in the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class of shares
or other  securities  or property purchasable under the Right Certificates made
in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this  Agreement.   In  addition,  in
connection with the issuance or sale of Common Stock following the Distribution
Date and prior to the Expiration  Date,  the Company may with respect to shares
of  Common  Stock so issued or sold pursuant  to  (i)  the  exercise  of  stock
options, (ii)  under any employee plan or arrangement, (iii) upon the exercise,
conversion or exchange  of securities notes or debentures issued by the Company
or (iv) a contractual obligation of the Company, in each case existing prior to
the Distribution Date, issue  Rights  Certificates representing the appropriate
number of Rights in connection with such issuance or sale.

             Section 23. Redemption.

             (a)   The Board of Directors of the Company may, at any time prior
to the Flip-In Event, redeem all but not  less  than  all  the then outstanding
Rights  at  a  redemption  price of $.01 per Right, appropriately  adjusted  to
reflect any stock split, stock  dividend or similar transaction occurring after
the date hereof (the redemption price  being  hereinafter  referred  to  as the
"Redemption  Price").   The  redemption  of the Rights may be made effective at
such time, on such basis and with such conditions  as the Board of Directors in
its sole discretion may establish.

             (b)   Immediately  upon  the  action  of the  Board  of  Directors
ordering the redemption of the Rights pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section
23  (or  at such later time as the Board of Directors  may  establish  for  the
effectiveness  of  such redemption), and without any further action and without
any notice, the right  to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right
thereafter of the holders  of  Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price.
The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such redemption; provided,
however, that the failure to give,  or any defect in, any such notice shall not
affect the validity of such redemption.   Within  10  days after such action of
the  Board of Directors ordering the redemption of the Rights  (or  such  later
time as  the  Board  of  Directors  may establish for the effectiveness of such
redemption), the Company shall mail a  notice  of redemption to all the holders
of the then outstanding Rights at their last addresses  as they appear upon the
registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution  Date,  on the
registry books of the transfer agent for the Common Stock.  Any notice which is
mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not  the
holder  receives  the  notice.   Each such notice of redemption shall state the
method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made.

             Section 24. Exchange.

             (a)  The Board of Directors  of the Company may, at its option, at
any time after the Flip-In Event, exchange  all or part of the then outstanding
and exercisable Rights (which shall not include  Rights  that  have become void
pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) for Common  Stock at an
exchange  ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right, appropriately  adjusted
to reflect  any  stock  split,  stock dividend or similar transaction occurring
after the date hereof (such amount  per  Right being hereinafter referred to as
the "Exchange Ratio").  Notwithstanding the  foregoing,  the Board of Directors
shall  not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time  after  any  Person
(other than  an  Exempt Person), together with all Affiliates and Associates of
such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of shares of Common Stock aggregating
50% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding.  From and after the
occurrence of an event  specified  in  Section  13(a)  hereof,  any Rights that
theretofore  have  not  been  exchanged  pursuant  to this Section 24(a)  shall
thereafter be exercisable only in accordance with Section  13  and  may  not be
exchanged  pursuant  to  this Section 24(a).  The exchange of the Rights by the
Board of Directors may be  made  effective at such time, on such basis and with
such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish.

             (b)   Immediately upon  the  effectiveness  of  the  action of the
Board of Directors of the Company ordering the exchange of any Rights  pursuant
to  paragraph (a) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without
any notice,  the  right  to  exercise  such Rights shall terminate and the only
right thereafter of a holder of such Rights  shall be to receive that number of
shares of Common Stock equal to the number of  such  Rights held by such holder
multiplied  by  the  Exchange  Ratio.  The Company shall promptly  give  public
notice of any such exchange; provided,  however,  that  the failure to give, or
any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange.  The
Company shall promptly mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders
of  the  Rights so exchanged at their last addresses as they  appear  upon  the
registry books  of  the Rights Agent.  Any notice which is mailed in the manner
herein provided shall  be  deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the
notice.  Each such notice of  exchange  will  state  the  method  by  which the
exchange of the shares of Common Stock for Rights will be effected and,  in the
event  of  any  partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged.
Any partial exchange  shall  be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights
(other than Rights which have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section
11(a)(ii) hereof) held by each holder of Rights.

             (c)   The Company  may at its option substitute, and, in the event
that there shall not be sufficient  shares  of  Common  Stock  issued  but  not
outstanding  or  authorized  but  unissued  to permit an exchange of Rights for
Common Stock as contemplated in accordance with  this  Section  24, the Company
shall substitute to the extent of such insufficiency, for each share  of Common
Stock  that  would otherwise be issuable upon exchange of a Right, a number  of
shares of Preferred  Stock or fraction thereof (or equivalent preferred shares,
as such term is defined  in  Section  11(b))  such  that  the current per share
market  price (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof)  of  one  share  of
Preferred  Stock  (or  equivalent preferred share) multiplied by such number or
fraction is equal to the  current per share market price of one share of Common
Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) as of the date of the Flip-
In Event.

             (d)   The Company  shall  not,  in  connection  with  any exchange
pursuant to this Section 24, be required to issue fractions of shares of Common
Stock or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares  of Common
Stock.   In  lieu of such fractional shares of Common Stock, the Company  shall
pay to the registered  holders  of  the Right Certificates with regard to which
such fractional shares of Common Stock would otherwise be issuable an amount in
cash equal to the same fraction of the  current  per  share  market  price of a
whole  share  of  Common Stock (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof)
for the Trading Day  immediately prior to the date of exchange pursuant to this
Section 24.

             Section 25. Notice of Certain Events.

             (a)  In case  the  Company  shall at any time after the earlier of
the Distribution Date or the Stock Acquisition  Date  propose  (i)  to  pay any
dividend payable in stock of any class to the holders of its Preferred Stock or
to  make  any  other  distribution to the holders of its Preferred Stock (other
than a regular quarterly  cash  dividend),  (ii) to offer to the holders of its
Preferred  Stock  rights  or  warrants to subscribe  for  or  to  purchase  any
additional shares of Preferred  Stock  or  shares  of stock of any class or any
other securities, rights or options, (iii) to effect  any  reclassification  of
its   Preferred  Stock  (other  than  a  reclassification  involving  only  the
subdivision  of  outstanding  Preferred Stock), (iv) to effect the liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company, or (v) to declare or pay any dividend
on the Common Stock payable in  Common Stock or to effect a subdivision, combi-
nation or consolidation of the Common  Stock  (by reclassification or otherwise
than by payment of dividends in Common Stock),  then,  in  each  such case, the
Company  shall  give to each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance  with
Section 26 hereof,  a  notice  of such proposed action, which shall specify the
record date for the purposes of  such stock dividend, or distribution of rights
or warrants, or the date on which  such  liquidation, dissolution or winding up
is to take place and the date of participation  therein  by  the holders of the
Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock, if any such date is to be  fixed, and such
notice  shall  be so given in the case of any action covered by clause  (i)  or
(ii) above at least 10 days prior to the record date for determining holders of
the Preferred Stock  for  purposes  of such action, and in the case of any such
other action, at least 10 days prior to the date of the taking of such proposed
action or the date of participation therein  by the holders of the Common Stock
and/or Preferred Stock, whichever shall be the earlier.

             (b)   In case any event described  in Section 11(a)(ii) or Section
13 shall occur then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter give to
each holder of a Right Certificate (or if occurring  prior  to the Distribution
Date, the holders of the Common Stock) in accordance with Section  26 hereof, a
notice of the occurrence of such event, which notice shall describe  such event
and the consequences of such event to holders of Rights under Section 11(a)(ii)
and Section 13 hereof.

             Section 26. Notices.    Notices  or  demands  authorized  by  this
Agreement to be given or made by the Rights Agent or by the holder of any Right
Certificate to or on the Company shall be sufficiently given or made if sent by
first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed (until another address is filed in
writing with the Rights Agent) as follows:

Subject to the provisions of Section 21 hereof, any notice or demand authorized
by this Agreement to be given or made  by  the  Company or by the holder of any
Right Certificate to or on the Rights Agent shall be sufficiently given or made
if sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed  (until another address
is filed in writing with the Company) as follows:

                         Attention:  Shareholder Services Administrator

Notices  or demands authorized by this Agreement to be given  or  made  by  the
Company or  the  Rights  Agent  to the holder of any Right Certificate shall be
sufficiently  given  or made if sent  by  first-class  mail,  postage  prepaid,
addressed to such holder at the address of such holder as shown on the registry
books of the Company.

             Section 27. Supplements and Amendments.  Except as provided in the
penultimate sentence of  this  Section  27,  for so long as the Rights are then
redeemable, the Company may in its sole and absolute discretion, and the Rights
Agent shall if the Company so directs, supplement  or  amend  any  provision of
this  Agreement  in  any  respect  without  the approval of any holders of  the
Rights.   At  any  time  when the Rights are no longer  redeemable,  except  as
provided in the penultimate  sentence  of this Section 27, the Company may, and
the Rights Agent shall, if the Company so  directs,  supplement  or  amend this
Agreement  without the approval of any holders of Rights Certificates in  order
to (i) cure  any  ambiguity, (ii) correct or supplement any provision contained
herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions herein,
(iii)  shorten or lengthen  any  time  period  hereunder,  or  (iv)  change  or
supplement  the  provisions  hereunder in any manner which the Company may deem
necessary or desirable; provided  that  no  such  supplement or amendment shall
adversely affect the interests of the holders of Rights  as such (other than an
Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring  Person),  and no
such  amendment  may  cause  the rights again to become redeemable or cause the
Agreement  again  to  become amendable  other  than  in  accordance  with  this
sentence.   Notwithstanding   anything  contained  in  this  Agreement  to  the
contrary, no supplement or amendment shall be made which changes the Redemption
Price.  Upon the delivery of a  certificate  from an appropriate officer of the
Company which states that the proposed supplement or amendment is in compliance
with  the  terms  of  this  Section 27, the Rights  Agent  shall  execute  such
supplement or amendment.

             Section 28. Successors.   All the covenants and provisions of this
Agreement by or for the benefit of the Company  or  the Rights Agent shall bind
and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns hereunder.

             Section 29. Benefits of this Agreement.   Nothing  in  this Agree-
ment  shall  be  construed  to  give to any Person other than the Company,  the
Rights Agent and the registered holders  of  the Right Certificates (and, prior
to  the  Distribution Date, the Common Stock) any  legal  or  equitable  right,
remedy or  claim under this Agreement; but this Agreement shall be for the sole
and exclusive  benefit  of  the  Company,  the  Rights Agent and the registered
holders of the Right Certificates (and, prior to  the  Distribution  Date,  the
Common Stock).

             Section 30. Determinations  and Actions by the Board of Directors.
The  Board  of Directors of the Company shall  have  the  exclusive  power  and
authority to  administer  this  Agreement and to exercise the rights and powers
specifically granted to the Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  or  to  the

                 SERIES A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK

                           THE BOMBAY COMPANY, INC.

            Pursuant to Section 151 of the General Corporation Law
                           of the State of Delaware

             The  Bombay  Company,  Inc.,  a corporation organized and existing
under the General Corporation Law of the State  of Delaware, in accordance with
the provisions of Section 103 thereof, DOES HEREBY CERTIFY:

             That pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of Directors in
accordance with the provisions of the Restated Certificate  of Incorporation of
the said Corporation, the said Board of Directors on June 1,  1995  adopted the
following  resolution  creating  a series of 400,000 shares of Preferred  Stock
designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock":

                   RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority vested in the Board
             of Directors of this Corporation in accordance with the provisions
             of  the  Restated  Certificate   of  Incorporation,  a  series  of
             Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per  share, of the Corporation be
             and  hereby  is created, and that the designation  and  number  of
             shares thereof  and  the  voting and other powers, preferences and
             relative, participating, optional or other rights of the shares of
             such series and the qualifications,  limitations  and restrictions
             thereof are as follows:

                 SERIES A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK

             1.    Designation  and  Amount.   There  shall  be  a  series   of
Preferred  Stock  that  shall  be  designated as "Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock," and the number of  shares  constituting  such series shall be
400,000.  Such number of shares may be increased or decreased  by resolution of
the  Board of Directors; provided, however, that no decrease shall  reduce  the
number  of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock to less than
the number  of  shares  then  issued  and outstanding plus the number of shares
issuable  upon exercise of outstanding rights,  options  or  warrants  or  upon
conversion of outstanding securities issued by the Corporation.

             2.    Dividends and Distribution.

                   (A)   Subject  to  the  prior  and  superior  rights  of the
holders  of  any  shares  of  any  series  of Preferred Stock ranking prior and
superior to the shares of Series A Junior Participating  Preferred  Stock  with
respect  to  dividends,  the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, in preference  to the holders of shares of any class or series
of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, shall be entitled  to receive, when, as and if declared by the
Board of Directors out of funds legally  available  for  the purpose, quarterly
dividends  payable  in  cash  on  the  first day of May, August,  November  and
February in each year (each such date being  referred to herein as a "Quarterly
Dividend  Payment Date"), commencing on the first  Quarterly  Dividend  Payment
Date after  the  first  issuance  of a share or fraction of a share of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock,  in  an  amount per share (rounded to the
nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1.00  or  (b)  the Adjustment Number
(as defined below) times the aggregate per share amount of  all cash dividends,
and  the  Adjustment  Number times the aggregate per share amount  (payable  in
kind) of all non-cash dividends  or  other  distributions other than a dividend
payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise),  declared on the Common Stock,
par value $1.00 per share, of the Corporation (the  "Common  Stock")  since the
immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect  to the
first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or
fraction  of  a  share  of  Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.  The
"Adjustment Number" shall initially  be  1000.   In  the  event the Corporation
shall  at  any  time  after  June 1, 1995 (the "Rights Declaration  Date")  (i)
declare any dividend on Common  Stock  payable  in shares of Common Stock, (ii)
subdivide the outstanding Common Stock or (iii) combine  the outstanding Common
Stock  into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case  the  Adjustment
Number in  effect  immediately  prior  to  such  event  shall  be  adjusted  by
multiplying  such Adjustment Number by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of shares  of  Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and
the denominator of which  is  the  number  of  shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to such event.

                   (B)   The   Corporation   shall  declare   a   dividend   or
distribution on the Series A Junior Participating  Preferred  Stock as provided
in paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution
on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock).

                   (C)   Dividends shall begin to accrue and be  cumulative  on
outstanding  shares  of  Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares
of Series A Junior Participating  Preferred  Stock, unless the date of issue of
such  shares  is  prior  to the record date for the  first  Quarterly  Dividend
Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from
the date of issue of such  shares,  or  unless the date of issue is a Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date or is a date after  the record date for the determination
of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating  Preferred Stock entitled
to  receive  a  quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly  Dividend  Payment
Date, in either of  which  events  such  dividends shall begin to accrue and be
cumulative  from  such Quarterly Dividend Payment  Date.   Accrued  but  unpaid
dividends shall not  bear  interest.   Dividends paid on the shares of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of
such  dividends  at  the  time accrued and payable  on  such  shares  shall  be
allocated pro rata on a share-by-share  basis among all such shares at the time
outstanding.   The  Board  of  Directors  may   fix   a  record  date  for  the
determination  of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating  Preferred
Stock entitled to  receive  payment  of  a  dividend  or  distribution declared
thereon,  which  record date shall be no more than 60 days prior  to  the  date
fixed for the payment thereof.

             3.    Voting  Rights.   The  holders  of shares of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:

                   (A)   Each share of Series A Junior  Participating Preferred
Stock  shall  entitle  the  holder thereof to a number of votes  equal  to  the
Adjustment Number on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the
Corporation.

                   (B)   Except  as  required  by law and by Section 10 hereof,
holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred  Stock shall have no special
voting rights and their consent shall not be required  (except  to  the  extent
they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for
taking any corporate action.

             4.    Certain Restrictions.

                   (A)   Whenever  quarterly  dividends  or  other dividends or
distributions payable on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred  Stock  as
provided  in  Section  2  are  in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and
unpaid dividends and distributions,  whether  or  not  declared,  on  shares of
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been  paid
in full, the Corporation shall not

                         (i)   declare  or  pay  dividends  on,  make any other
distributions  on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration
any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding  up)  to  the  Series  A  Junior Participating Preferred
Stock;

                         (ii)  declare or pay dividends  on  or  make any other
distributions  on  any  shares  of  stock  ranking  on  a parity (either as  to
dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up)  with  the  Series  A
Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock,  except  dividends paid ratably on the
Series  A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and all  such  parity  stock  on
which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to
which the holders of all such shares are then entitled; or

                         (iii) purchase  or otherwise acquire for consideration
any shares of Series A Junior Participating  Preferred  Stock, or any shares of
stock  ranking  on  a  parity with the Series A Junior Participating  Preferred
Stock, except in accordance  with  a  purchase  offer  made  in  writing  or by
publication  (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of Series
A Junior Participating  Preferred  Stock, or to such holders and holders of any
such shares ranking on a parity therewith,  upon  such  terms  as  the Board of
Directors,  after  consideration  of  the respective annual dividend rates  and
other relative rights and preferences of  the  respective  series  and classes,
shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among
the respective series or classes.

                   (B)   The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the
Corporation  to  purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares  of
stock of the Corporation  unless  the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of
this Section 4, purchase or otherwise  acquire  such shares at such time and in
such manner.

             5.    Reacquired Shares.  Any shares of Series A Junior Participat-
ing Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired  by  the Corporation in any
manner whatsoever shall be retired promptly after the acquisition thereof.  All
such shares shall upon their retirement become authorized  but  unissued shares
of  Preferred  Stock  and may be reissued as part of a new series of  Preferred
Stock to be created by  resolution  or  resolutions  of the Board of Directors,
subject to any conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.

             6.    Liquidation,  Dissolution  or  Winding  Up.   (A)  Upon  any
liquidation  (voluntary  or  otherwise),  dissolution  or  winding  up  of  the
Corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders  of  shares  of stock
ranking  junior  (either  as  to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution  or
winding up) to the Series A Junior  Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior
thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
shall have received $100 per share, plus  an amount equal to accrued and unpaid
dividends and distributions thereon, whether  or  not  declared, to the date of
such payment (the "Series A Liquidation Preference").  Following the payment of
the  full  amount  of  the  Series  A  Liquidation  Preference,  no  additional
distributions  shall  be  made  to the holders of shares  of  Series  A  Junior
Participating Preferred Stock unless,  prior  thereto, the holders of shares of
Common Stock shall have received an amount per  share (the "Common Adjustment")
equal  to  the  quotient  obtained  by dividing (i) the  Series  A  Liquidation
Preference by (ii) the Adjustment Number.   Following  the  payment of the full
amount  of  the  Series A Liquidation Preference and the Common  Adjustment  in
respect  of  all outstanding  shares  of  (1)  Series  A  Junior  Participating
Preferred Stock  and  (2)  Common  Stock, respectively, (a) holders of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock  and (b) holders of shares of Common Stock
shall, subject to the prior rights of all  other  series of Preferred Stock, if
any, ranking prior thereto, receive their ratable and  proportionate  share  of
the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to
1 with respect to (x) the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and (y)
the Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.

                   (B)   In  the  event, however, that there are not sufficient
assets  available  to permit payment  in  full  of  the  Series  A  Liquidation
Preference and the liquidation  preferences  of  all  other series of Preferred
Stock,  if  any, that rank on a parity with the Series A  Junior  Participating
Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the
holders of such  parity  shares  in  proportion to their respective liquidation
preferences.   In the event, however, that  there  are  not  sufficient  assets
available to permit  payment  in  full  of  the  Common  Adjustment,  then such
remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock.

                   (C)   Neither the merger or consolidation of the Corporation
into  or with another corporation nor the merger or consolidation of any  other
corporation  into  or with the Corporation shall be deemed to be a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation within the meaning of this Section
6.

             7.    Consolidation,  Merger,  Etc.  In case the Corporation shall
enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which
the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for  or  changed  into  other stock or
securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of
Series  A  Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock  shall  at the same time  be
similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share equal  to  the Adjustment
Number times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or  any  other
property  (payable  in  kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each
share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged.

             8.    No Redemption.   Shares  of  Series  A  Junior Participating
Preferred Stock shall not be subject to redemption by the Company.

             9.    Ranking.  The Series A Junior Participating  Preferred Stock
shall rank junior to all other series of the Corporation's Preferred  Stock  as
to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of
any  such  series  shall provide otherwise, and shall rank senior to the Common
Stock as to such matters.

             10.   Amendment.   At  any time that any shares of Series A Junior
Participating  Preferred Stock are outstanding,  the  Restated  Certificate  of
Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be amended in any manner which would
materially alter  or  change  the  powers, preferences or special rights of the
Series A Junior Participating Preferred  Stock  so  as to affect them adversely
without the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds  of  the  outstanding
shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as a
class.

             11.   Fractional Shares.  Series A Junior Participating  Preferred
Stock  may be issued in fractions of a share that shall entitle the holder,  in
proportion  to  such  holder's  fractional  shares,  to exercise voting rights,
receive dividends, participate in distributions and to  have the benefit of all
other rights of holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.


             IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed  this Certificate
this ____ day of __________, 1995.

such holder to purchase.  If this Right Certificate shall be exercised in part,
the holder shall be entitled to  receive  upon  surrender  hereof another Right
Certificate or Right Certificates for the number of whole Rights not exercised.

election of directors  or  upon  any  matter  submitted  to stockholders at any
meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate  action, or to
receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders  (except  as
provided  in  the  Rights  Agreement)  or  to receive dividends or subscription

             UNDER  CERTAIN  CIRCUMSTANCES, AS SET FORTH IN THE  RIGHTS  AGREE-
             MENT, RIGHTS OWNED  BY  OR TRANSFERRED TO ANY PERSON WHO IS OR BE-

                         SUMMARY OF RIGHTS TO PURCHASE
                         SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK OF
                           THE BOMBAY COMPANY, INC.

             On June 1, 1995, the Board of  Directors  of  The  Bombay Company,
Inc. (the "Company") declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase  right
(a  "Right")  for  each  outstanding share of common stock, par value $1.00 per
share,  of the Company (the  "Common  Stock").   The  dividend  is  payable  on
June 15,  1995  (the "Record Date") to the stockholders of record on that date.
Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-
thousandth of a share  of  Series  A  Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par
value $1.00 per share (the "Preferred Stock")  of  the  Company  at  a price of
$50.00  per  one  one-thousandth  of  a share of Preferred Stock (the "Purchase
Price"), subject to adjustment.  The description  and  terms  of the Rights are
set forth in a Rights Agreement dated as of June 1, 1995, as the  same  may  be
amended from time to time (the "Rights Agreement"), between the Company and The
First National Bank of Boston, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent").

             Until  the  earlier  to  occur  of  (i) 10 days following a public
announcement that a person or group of affiliated  or  associated  persons  (an
"Acquiring  Person")  has  acquired  beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or (ii) 10 business days (or such later date
as may be determined by action of the  Board of Directors prior to such time as
any  person  or  group  of  affiliated persons  becomes  an  Acquiring  Person)
following the commencement of,  or  announcement  of  an  intention  to make, a
tender  offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result  in  the
beneficial  ownership  by  a  person or group of 15% or more of the outstanding
shares  of  Common  Stock  (the  earlier   of   such  dates  being  called  the
"Distribution Date"), the Rights will be evidenced,  with respect to any of the
Common Stock certificates outstanding as of the Record  Date,  by  such  Common
Stock certificate together with a copy of this Summary of Rights.

             The  Rights  Agreement  provides that, until the Distribution Date
(or  earlier  redemption or expiration of  the  Rights),  the  Rights  will  be
transferred with  and  only with the Common Stock.  Until the Distribution Date
(or  earlier  redemption  or  expiration  of  the  Rights),  new  Common  Stock
certificates issued after the  Record  Date  upon  transfer or new issuances of
Common  Stock  will contain a notation incorporating the  Rights  Agreement  by
reference.  Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of
the Rights), the  surrender  for  transfer  of  any  certificates for shares of
Common Stock outstanding as of the Record Date, even without such notation or a
copy of this Summary of Rights, will also constitute the transfer of the Rights
associated with the shares of Common Stock represented by such certificate.  As
soon  as  practicable  following  the Distribution Date, separate  certificates
evidencing the Rights ("Right Certificates")  will  be  mailed  to  holders  of
record of the Common Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date
and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.

             The  Rights  are not exercisable until the Distribution Date.  The
Rights will expire on June  1,  2005  (the "Final Expiration Date"), unless the
Final Expiration Date is extended or unless  the Rights are earlier redeemed or
exchanged by the Company, in each case as described below.

             The Purchase Price payable, and the  number of shares of Preferred
Stock or other securities or property issuable, upon  exercise of the Rights is
subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of
a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification  of, the
Preferred  Stock,  (ii)  upon  the  grant  to holders of the Preferred Stock of
certain rights or warrants to subscribe for  or  purchase  Preferred Stock at a
price, or securities convertible into Preferred Stock with a  conversion price,
less than the then-current market price of the Preferred Stock  or  (iii)  upon
the distribution to holders of the Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness
or  assets  (excluding  regular periodic cash dividends or dividends payable in
Preferred  Stock) or of subscription  rights  or  warrants  (other  than  those
referred to above).

             The  number  of outstanding Rights is subject to adjustment in the
event of a stock dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock
or subdivisions, consolidations  or combinations of the Common Stock occurring,
in any such case, prior to the Distribution Date.

             Shares of Preferred Stock  purchasable upon exercise of the Rights
will not be redeemable.  Each share of Preferred  Stock will be entitled, when,
as  and if declared, to a minimum preferential quarterly  dividend  payment  of
$1.00 per share but will be entitled to an aggregate dividend of 1000 times the
dividend  declared per share of Common Stock.  In the event of liquidation, the
holders of  the  Preferred  Stock  will  be  entitled to a minimum preferential
liquidation payment of $100 per share (plus any  accrued  but unpaid dividends)
but will be entitled to an aggregate payment of 1000 times the payment made per
share  of Common Stock.  Each share of Preferred Stock will  have  1000  votes,
voting together  with  the  Common Stock.  Finally, in the event of any merger,
consolidation  or  other transaction  in  which  shares  of  Common  Stock  are
converted or exchanged,  each  share  of  Preferred  Stock  will be entitled to
receive 1000 times the amount received per share of Common Stock.  These rights
are protected by customary antidilution provisions.

             Because   of   the  nature  of  the  Preferred  Stock's  dividend,
liquidation and voting rights,  the value of the one one-thousandth interest in
a share of Preferred Stock purchasable  upon  exercise  of  each  Right  should
approximate the value of one share of Common Stock.

             In  the event that any person or group of affiliated or associated
persons becomes an  Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right, other than Rights
beneficially owned by  the Acquiring Person (which will thereupon become void),
will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of a Right at the then-
current exercise price of  the  Right,  that  number  of shares of Common Stock
having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.

             In the event that, after a person or group has become an Acquiring
Person,  the  Company  is  acquired  in a merger or other business  combination
transaction or 50% or more of its consolidated  assets  or  earning  power  are
sold, proper provisions will be made so that each holder of a Right (other than
Rights  beneficially  owned by an Acquiring Person which will have become void)
will thereafter have the  right  to  receive,  upon the exercise thereof at the
then-current exercise price of the Right, that number of shares of common stock
of the person with whom the Company has engaged  in  the  foregoing transaction
(or  its parent), which number of shares at the time of such  transaction  will
have a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.

             At  any time after any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person
and prior to the earlier  of  one  of  the  events  described  in  the previous
paragraph  or  the  acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more  of  the
outstanding shares of  Common  Stock, the Board of Directors of the Company may
exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group which will
have become void), in whole or in part, for shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock (or a series of the Company's  preferred  stock having equivalent rights,
preferences and privileges), at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock,
or a fractional share of Preferred Stock (or other  preferred stock) equivalent
in value thereto, per Right.

             With certain exceptions, no adjustment in  the Purchase Price will
be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment  of  at least 1%
in such Purchase Price.  No fractional shares of Preferred Stock will be issued
(other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth  of  a
share  of  Preferred  Stock,  which  may,  at  the  election of the Company, be
evidenced by depositary receipts), and in lieu thereof  an  adjustment  in cash
will  be  made  based  on  the  market price of the Preferred Stock on the last
trading day prior to the date of exercise.

             At any time prior to  the  time  an Acquiring Person becomes such,
the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem  the  Rights in whole, but not
in part, at a price of $.01 per Right (the "Redemption Price").  The redemption
of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such  basis  and with such
conditions  as  the  Board  of  Directors in its sole discretion may establish.
Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights
will terminate and the only right  of  the holders of Rights will be to receive
the Redemption Price.

             For so long as the Rights are  then  redeemable,  the Company may,
except  with respect to the redemption price, amend the Rights in  any  manner.
After the Rights are no longer redeemable, the Company may, except with respect
to the redemption price, amend the Rights in any manner that does not adversely
affect the interests of holders of the Rights.

             Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have
no rights  as  a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the
right to vote or to receive dividends.

             A copy  of the Rights Agreement has been filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission  as  an Exhibit to a Registration Statement on Form 8-A
dated Monday, June 12, 1995.   A copy of the Rights Agreement is available free
of charge from the Company.  This  summary  description  of the Rights does not
purport  to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by  reference  to  the
Rights Agreement, as the same may be amended from time to time, which is hereby
incorporated herein by reference.

                            THE BOMBAY COMPANY, INC
                          SUPPLEMENTAL STOCK PROGRAM
  (As Amended February 1993, February 1994 and February 1995 and March 1997)

      WHEREAS,  The  Bombay  Company,  Inc.  ("Bombay" or "Company") desires to
establish, on behalf of its eligible employees,  a  program for the purposes of
enhancing  such  individuals' investment in the Common  Stock  of  the  Company
("Bombay Stock"); and

      WHEREAS, to meet this goal, a plan has been designed and adopted with the
following plan features:   (i)  401(k)  Excess  Feature,  whereby  its eligible
employees  who,  due  to  benefit limitations in applicable tax laws under  the
Internal  Revenue  Code  or  Revenue   Canada,   are  unable  to  have  further
contributions  made  on their behalf under The Bombay  Company,  Inc.  Employee
401(k) Savings and Stock  Ownership  Plan  or  its Canadian equivalent ("401(k)
Plan") may continue their contributions and obtain  Bombay  Stock;  (ii) Excess
Bonus  Feature  whereby  selected  employees  whose  earned  bonuses  exceed  a
specified  multiple of target bonus levels will be paid such amounts in  Bombay
Stock rather  than cash; and (iii) Foreign Employee Investment Feature, whereby
eligible employees  of  the  Company  employed  by  or  in  any  of its foreign
subsidiaries,  branch  offices  or  operations  which do not have a stock  plan
comparable to the Company's 401(k) Plan may elect to invest in the Common Stock
of the Company through this Program.

                                       I

                                      III

                         PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM

      A.    ADOPTION OF PROGRAM.  The Company and each of its subsidiaries  may
adopt  the  Program  for all or part of its Employees as the Board of Directors
may in its discretion  approve.   Bombay  and each of its subsidiaries adopting
the Program are hereinafter collectively referred to as "Company".

      B.    ELIGIBILITY.   Subject  to the provisions  of  Section  XVII,  with
respect  to  union-represented  Employees,   only  Employees  selected  by  the
Committee  are  eligible to participate in the Program.  For  purposes  of  the
401(k)  Excess  Feature,   selected   Employees  are  eligible  only  if  their
contributions are limited in any 401(k)  Plan plan year ("401(k) Plan Year") as
a result of Internal Revenue Code Sections  402(g),  415(c),  401(a)(17) and/or
401(k)(3)  or  similar  limitations  imposed  in  Canada by Revenue Canada  and
following  such  Employee's  election  to  participate being  received  in  the
Program's   administrative  office.   Thereafter,   the   Employee   may   make
contributions   to  the  Program  through  Employee  Payroll  Deductions  as  a
Participant for the  remainder  of any 401(k) Plan Year after the date on which
the contribution limit is reached.   Participation in the 401(k) Excess Feature
is entirely voluntary and an election  to  participate must be made pursuant to
Section III(C)(1).  For purposes of the Excess  Bonus  Feature,  only Employees
selected by the Committee or its designated representative shall be eligible to
participate.   For  purposes  of  the  Foreign Employee Feature, only employees
employed in foreign operations (except any  corporate  officer who shall not be
eligible  for this Foreign Employee Feature) shall be eligible  to  participate
upon completion  of  one  (1)  year of service to the Company during which such
employee worked a minimum of 1,000  hours.   To  remain as a Participant in the
Program, an Employee must continue to be an Employee  engaged in service to the
Company.

      C.    APPLICATION FOR PARTICIPATION.

            1.    401(k)  Excess  Feature.   In order to become  a  Participant
                  under the 401(k) Excess Feature, each eligible Employee shall
                  execute a written application stating the following:

                  a.    The intent to participate in the Program;

                  b.    The  consent for Employee  Payroll  Deductions  as  set
                        forth below; and

                  c.    The acknowledgment  and  consent  to the withholding of
                        taxes  resulting  from the Company Contribution  during
                        the Taxable Year in  which  the Company Contribution is
                        made.

      The   Employee   shall   have  thirty  (30)  days  from  eligibility   of
participation in the Program to  file  a written application for participation.
Participation in the Program shall become  effective  on  the start of the next
pay  period  after  the  application  is  received by the Company  or  after  a
Participant  has  reached  the  contribution limit  in  any  401(k)  Plan  Year
following the year of initial enrollment in the Program.

      In the event that an eligible  Employee  elects not to participate in the
Program  or fails to file a written application for  participation  during  the
required period,  payroll deductions shall cease upon reaching the 401(k) limit
and no further Company  contribution  will  be  credited to Participant for the
remainder of the 401(k) Plan Year.

      Participants   shall  designate  their  participation   and   desire   to
participate through payroll  deductions authorized by the completed application
form.  The initial authorization  shall continue in effect, notwithstanding any
change in Participant's Earnings, until  the Participant becomes ineligible for
the  Program.   Deductions  made  subject  to  such  authorization  are  called
"Employee Payroll Deductions".

      After   receipt  of  a  completed  application  form   by   the   Program
administration  office  Participants  shall  have  Employee  Payroll Deductions
withheld at the rate of up to 5% of Earnings, in excess of the  maximum  amount
of  Earnings needed to reach one of the contribution limits to the 401(k) Plan,
as set  out  in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or as otherwise set forth by
the Committee.   Contributions  may be made to the Program for the remainder of
the 401(k) Plan Year.

            2.    Excess Bonus Feature.  In order to become a Participant under
                  the  Excess  Bonus  Feature,  each  eligible  Employee  shall
                  execute a written application stating the following:

                  a.    The  intention  to  participate  in  the  Excess  Bonus
                        Feature;

                  b.    The consent  for  any bonus payments due in excess of a
                        specified multiple of the Participant's target level to

                  c.    The acknowledgment  that  the  distribution  of  Bombay
                        Stock  in  lieu of bonus shall be net of federal income
                        tax withholding at the maximum marginal rate.

            3.    Foreign Employee Feature.   In  order to become a Participant
                  under the Foreign Employee Feature,  each  eligible  Employee
                  shall execute a written application stating the following:

                  a.    The  intention  to  participate in the Foreign Employee
                        Feature;

                  b.    The  consent for Employee  Payroll  Deductions  as  set
                        forth below; and

                        Taxable Year in which such contributions are made.

      Once  an  Employee  has met the necessary  eligibility  requirements  for
participation in the Program,  contributions  under Section IV shall begin upon
receipt of a completed written application form  by  the Program Administration
office.  Participation in the Program shall become effective  on  the  start of
the  next  pay  period  after  the application is received and processed by the
Company.  Participants shall designate  their payroll deductions in the written
application form.  The initial
deduction percentage, which may be up to  5%  of  Earnings,  shall  continue in
effect,  notwithstanding  any  change  in  Participant's  Earnings,  until  the
Participant  changes  the  deduction  percentage  or becomes ineligible for the
Program.  Deductions made subject to such authorization  are  called  "Employee
Payroll Deductions".

                                      IV

                            CREDITS TO PARTICIPANTS

      A.    401(k)  EXCESS  FEATURE  AND FOREIGN EMPLOYEE FEATURE:  As soon  as
practicable  after  the  end  of  each calendar  month  after  eligibility  and
participation  election,  the  following   credits   shall   be  made  to  each
Participant's account:

            1.    Employee  Payroll Deduction.  The amount of Employee  Payroll
                  Deductions withheld during such month;

            2.    Company  Contribution.    A   monthly  amount  (the  "Company
                  Contribution") calculated by multiplying the Employee Payroll
                  Deduction by 75%.

            3.    Application of Credits.  The Employee  Payroll Deductions and
                  Company Contributions are to be applied to the acquisition of
                  Bombay   Stock   monthly  and  shall  be  credited   to   the
                  Participant's account  as  soon  as practicable thereafter in
                  the form of Bombay Stock and any Fractional Share (as defined
                  in Section XVI) based upon the number  of  shares  of  Bombay
                  Stock  purchasable  at  a  price equal to the average closing
                  price of Bombay Stock as reported  for  the  New  York  Stock
                  Exchange  composite  transactions for each trading day of the
                  calendar month for which  the deductions or contributions are
                  made (the "Stock Price").   Except  for  excess contributions
                  made because of fraud or mistake of fact and  returned within
                  one (1) year after payment to the Company under this Program,
                  no  part  of  the  contributions  of  the  Company  shall  be
                  recoverable by it under any circumstances.

      B.    EXCESS  BONUS  FEATURE:   Upon  final  computation  of annual bonus
amounts due to Participants of the Excess Bonus Feature, the number  of  shares
of  Bombay  Stock  to  be  distributed shall be determined by taking the dollar
amount of the bonus in excess  of  a  Committee-designated  multiple  of target
bonus,  less  federal  income  tax  withholding  at  the maximum marginal rate,
divided by the closing price of Bombay Stock on the date  of  final approval of
such bonus by the Board of Directors, or otherwise for non-executive officers.

      C.    OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS-DIVIDEND INCOME ON STOCK.  All  cash  dividends
paid  on  shares  credited  to  the  Participant's  account  on the record date
designated  by the Company for such dividend shall be allocated  when  paid  to
each Participant's  account  as other contributions ("Other Contributions") and
applied to the purchase of Bombay Stock.  These Other Contributions will not be
subject to matching contributions by the Company.

      D.    STOCK DIVIDEND OR  SPLIT-UP.   Any  Bombay  Stock  issuable  by the
Company  as a stock dividend or split-up on the Bombay Stock and any Fractional
Share to the  credit  of  the  Participant on the record date designated by the
Company  for  such  stock dividend  or  split-up  shall  be  credited  to  each
Participant's account  (in an amount per share equivalent to any stock dividend
or split-up actually paid  by the Company on its Bombay Stock then outstanding)
as soon as practicable after  the  distribution  date of such stock dividend or
split-up.

      E.    EXCESS 401(k) CONTRIBUTION REFUNDS.  Any  refund  of  excess 401(k)
contributions from the 401(k) Plan issuable to a Participant in the Program may
be  deposited by such Participant into the Program with written notice  to  the
Administrative  Committee.   Such  refund  contribution  shall  be  credited to
Participant's  account  for the purchase of Stock at the Stock Price applicable
for the month in which the deposit is made.

                                       V

            1.    The Committee  will  invest  all  or substantially all of the
                  contributions to the Program in Bombay Stock.

            2.    Any  Bombay Stock required for the Program  may  be  treasury
                  shares or original issue shares.

            3.    Bombay Stock may be held by the Company, as custodian, at its
                  discretion,  either in its name or in the name of one or more
                  nominees.

                                HOLDING PERIOD

      A.    DURATION.  The Company shall retain  for  the  "Holding Period" all
Bombay  Stock  credited  to the Participant's account under the  Program.   The
Holding Period with respect  to any Bombay Stock shall commence on the date the
Bombay Stock is credited to the  Participant's  account  and  shall  end on the
401(k)  Excess Distribution Date or the Excess Bonus Distribution Date  or  the
Foreign Employee Distribution Date, whichever is applicable.

      B.    DISTRIBUTION.  As promptly as practicable after the Holding Period,
the Company  shall  distribute  the full shares of Bombay Stock then held which
was credited to the Participant's  account  under the Program since the Holding
Period began.  At the option of the Company,  Fractional  Shares, if any, shall
be paid in cash or shall be carried forward into the next Program  Year  in the
Participant's account.

                                      VII

                          DISTRIBUTIONS AND PAYMENTS

      A.    401(k) EXCESS FEATURE AND FOREIGN EMPLOYEE FEATURE:

            1.    During  employment, an annual distribution of a Participant's
                  account shall  occur  approximately  45  days  following  the
                  completion   of   the   Program   Year  (the  "401(k)  Excess
                  Distribution Date" or "Foreign Employee  Distribution  Date,"
                  whichever   is   applicable   to   Participant).    The  full
                  distribution  of  all Bombay Stock in a Participant's account
                  will also be made promptly  upon  receipt of a written Notice
                  of Withdrawal at the Program administration  office or if the
                  Company records have evidence of the Participant's  (a) death
                  or   (b)   termination  of  Employment,  either  voluntarily,
                  involuntarily or by retirement at age 65 or older.

            2.    Employee Payroll  Deductions, Company Contributions and Other
                  Contributions not yet  used  to purchase Bombay Stock will be
                  paid over to the withdrawing Participant in cash.

            3.    Upon withdrawal, no Fractional Share will be distributed.  In
                  lieu of distribution of such Fractional Share the Participant
                  will be paid cash for the value of the Fractional Share based
                  upon the Stock Price for the previous month.

            4.    The number of shares of Bombay  Stock  to be distributed will
                  be  determined  by  the  number  of  shares  credited   to  a
                  Participant's account:

                  a.    At  the end of the calendar month preceding the receipt
                        of the  written  Notice  of  Withdrawal  by the Program
                        administration office; or

                  b.    In the absence of receipt by the Program administration
                        office of a Notice of Withdrawal from the  Participant,
                        Alternate  Payee(s),  or the Participant's Beneficiary,
                        at the end of the month  preceding  the  month in which
                        one  of  the two withdrawal events is recorded  in  the
                        records   of   the   Program   administration   office,
                        regardless of the month in which such event occurred.

            5.    In  the event a Participant  eligible  for  the  401(k)  Plan
                  ceases  participation  or  makes a withdrawal from the 401(k)
                  Plan, the Participant will be suspended from participation in
                  the Program until participation in the 401(k) Plan resumes.

      B.    EXCESS BONUS FEATURE:  The Bombay Stock credited to the Participant
pursuant to the Excess Bonus Feature shall be  distributed  to such Participant
within 30 days following the final determination of the number  of  shares (the
"Excess Bonus Distribution Date") as set forth in Section IV(B).

      C.    RECIPIENT OF DISTRIBUTION.  All distributions will be made  to  the
Participant  except  distributions  resulting  from  death  or  divorce  of the
Participant.   In  the  event of death, payment will be made to the Beneficiary
designated by the Participant  or  as otherwise provided by the Program and the
Participant's Beneficiary may act on  behalf  of the Participant.  In the event
of a Participant's divorce, a certified copy of the divorce decree or Qualified
Domestic  Relations  Order  (collectively referred  to  hereinafter  as  "Court
Order") must be submitted to  the  Program  administration office together with
any other identifying information as required  by  the  Program  administration
office.  The Participant's account will then be divided as specifically ordered
in  the  Court Order and the shares awarded to the Alternate Payee(s)  will  be
withdrawn.   Distribution  to  the  Participant,  the  Alternate  Payee(s),  or
Beneficiary  shall  be  made  as soon as practicable after the event permitting
withdrawal.
                                     VIII

                                  BENEFICIARY

      A.    DESIGNATION  OF BENEFICIARY.   Participants  shall  file  with  the
Company a written designation  of Beneficiary designating who is to receive any
Bombay Stock, Fractional Share payment,  and  any  cash  to  the  Participant's
credit under the Program in the event of death prior to delivery to him of such
Bombay Stock, Fractional Share payment or cash due to Participant.


      B.    CHANGE   OF   BENEFICIARY.    A  Participant  may  change  a  prior
Beneficiary designation at any time by written  notice  being  delivered to the
Program administration office.  Such change shall take effect as  of  the  date
the  Participant  signed  such  written  notice,  whether or not Participant is
living  at  the  time of receipt of such notice by the  Program  administration
office, except that  the  change  of  Beneficiary shall not be effective if the
Program has distributed the Participant's  account  prior  to  receipt  of  the
change of Beneficiary form.

      C.    DISTRIBUTION  TO  BENEFICIARY.  Upon the death of a Participant and
upon receipt of proof deemed adequate  by  the Program administration office of
the  identity and existence at the Participant's  death  of  a  Beneficiary  or
Beneficiaries  validly  designated under the Program, distribution will be made
to the Beneficiary or Beneficiaries  in  the  manner  and  form as set forth in
Section VII hereof.

      D.    ABSENCE OF BENEFICIARY.  In the absence of a Beneficiary designated
under  the  Program  who  is  living  at  the  time  of  Participant's   death,
distribution  shall  be made to the executor or administrator of the estate  of
the Participant.  If no  executor  or  administrator  has been appointed to the
knowledge of the Program administration office (or in the  event  such executor
or administrator has been disqualified), the distribution may be made  to  such
person or persons as the Program administration office shall be satisfied is or
are legally entitled thereto.

      E.    INTEREST  OF  BENEFICIARY  IN  PROGRAM.   No designated Beneficiary
shall,  prior  to  the death of the Participant, acquire any  interest  in  the
Bombay Stock, Fractional  Share,  or cash credited to the Participant under the
Program or in the assets of the Program.
                                      IX

                               VOTING OF STOCKS

      While Bombay Stock is held by  the Company as custodian, the Company will
cause  to  be delivered to each Participant  all  notices  of  meetings,  proxy
statements and  other materials distributed by the Company to its shareholders.
The full shares of  Bombay Stock in each Participant's account will be voted in
accordance with the Participant's signed proxy instructions timely delivered to
the Company or its agent.  Fractional Shares shall be voted on a combined basis
in  order  to  comply,  to   the  extent  possible,  with  all  timely  written
instructions received from Participants.   If  timely  written instructions are
not  received  from  a Participant, the Company shall vote  such  Participant's
shares in the same proportion  as  those  shares of stock with respect to which
timely written instructions were received.

                        respect   to   a  Participant's  Credited   Shares   in
                        accordance with  timely  written instructions delivered
                        by such Participant to the  Special  Custodian.  Voting
                        Rights  with  respect  to  Fractional Shares  shall  be
                        exercised on a combined basis  in  order  to comply, to
                        the   extent   possible,   with   all   timely  written
                        instructions  received  from Participants.   If  timely
                        written   instructions  are   not   received   from   a
                        Participant,   the  Special  Custodian  shall  exercise
                        Voting  Rights  with   respect  to  such  Participant's
                        Credited Shares in the same  proportion as those shares
                        of Bombay Stock with respect to  which  timely  written
                        instructions were received.


                  c.    The  Special  Custodian  shall use its best efforts  to
                        ensure  that  Participants  are   able  to  direct  the
                        exercise  of  Voting Rights and Tender  Rights  on  the
                        basis of the same  information,  and in accordance with
                        substantially the same procedures,  as are available to
                        the  holders  of  shares  of  Bombay  Stock.    Without
                        limiting  the  generality of the foregoing, the Special
                        Custodian shall take the following actions:

                        i.    Give prior  written notice to each Participant of
                              any occasion  upon  which Voting Rights or Tender
                              Rights may be exercised;

                        ii.   Transmit   to   each  Participant   any   written
                              information relating  to  the  exercise of Voting
                              Rights  or Tender Rights that is  distributed  by
                              the  management  of  the  Company  or  any  other
                              person;

                        iii.  Request    written    instructions    from   each
                              Participant  as  to  the  manner  in which Voting
                              Rights or Tender Rights should be exercised; and

                        iv.   Exercise  Voting  Rights  or  Tender  Rights   in
                              accordance    with   the   written   instructions
                              delivered  by  the  Participant  to  the  Special
                              Custodian.

                  d.    The  Special  Custodian   shall  not  disclose  to  the
                        Company, and shall maintain strict confidentiality with
                        respect to, any information  regarding  the exercise of
                        Voting  Rights  or  Tender  Rights, including,  without
                        limitation, information regarding  the  identity of any
                        Participant  who  exercises  or fails to exercise  such
                        rights.

                  e.    Any  cash  or other property received  by  the  Special
                        Custodian upon  consummation of a Tender Offer shall be
                        distributed to Participants  as promptly as practicable
                        following receipt thereof.

                     PARTICIPATION BY AFFILIATED COMPANIES

      This  Program shall apply to any corporation a portion  of  whose  voting
stock  is owned  directly  or  indirectly  by  the  Company,  and  any  of  its
affiliates,  if  such company or corporation shall elect to participate and if,
and so long as, such  participation shall be approved by the Board of Directors
of the Company.  Each participating Company shall be bound by the terms of this
document.

                                      XI

                        NO WARRANTY OF SECURITY VALUES

      Neither the Company,  its officers, directors, agents or servants, or the
Committee warrants or represents  in  any way that the value of Bombay Stock in
which the Participant may have an interest  will increase or will not decrease.
Each Participant assumes all risk in connection  with  any changes in the value
of Bombay Stock to the extent he may have an interest therein.

                                      XII

                              GENERAL PROVISIONS

      A.    EXTENT  OF  CERTAIN RIGHTS OF PARTICIPANTS.  Participation  in  the
Program shall not entitle any Employee to be retained in the service of Company
for any period of time or  to  continue  the  present  or  any  other  rate  of
compensation.   The at-will employment right and power of Company to dismiss or
discharge any Employee is specifically reserved.

      B.    LIMITATION  OF PARTICIPANT'S RIGHTS.  No Participant nor any person
claiming under or through  them  shall  have  any  right  or interest under the
Program that is not herein expressly granted.

      C.    ASSIGNMENT.  No interest in any Bombay Stock or cash held under the
Program prior to delivery to the Participant as hereinabove  provided, shall be
assigned,  alienated,  pledged, or otherwise encumbered in whole  or  in  part,
either directly by operation of law, or otherwise.  If any attempt is made by a
Participant to assign, alienate,  pledge, or otherwise encumber his interest in
such Bombay Stock or cash, prior to  such  delivery, for his debts, liabilities
in  tort  or  contract,  or  otherwise, then the  Committee  (in  its  absolute
discretion)  may treat such attempt  as  an  election  by  the  Participant  to
withdraw from  the  Program  permanently  and  submit  to any loss of rights as
provided  in  the  Program,  except  that  a  Court Order to pay  an  Alternate
Payee(s), issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall not be a violation
under this paragraph which requires a Participant's withdrawal.

      D.    QUARTERLY STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS.  As  soon as practicable after the
end  of  each  calendar  quarter in which any contributions  are  made  to  the
Program, each Participant  shall  be furnished with a statement of Bombay Stock
credited to his account.

      E.    REGISTRATION OF STOCK.   Each Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate
Payee shall, at such time as the Program  administration  office  or Bombay may
reasonably  request, furnish written instructions for the registration  of  the
Bombay Stock  to  be delivered under the Program upon completion of the Holding
Period.  Such Bombay  Stock  will be registered in the name of the Participant,
Beneficiary or Alternate Payee (or if a minor, in the name of another person as
custodian under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, or if incompetent, in the name
of the guardian or such other person(s) as the Program Administrative Committee
or Bombay may determine) alone  or in his name and that of one such other adult
person as he may designate as joint tenants with right of survivorship, and not
as tenants in common.  Such instructions  shall  remain in effect until receipt
by  the  Program Administration office of written instructions  to  change  the
registration   previously   authorized.    In   the  absence  of  such  written
instructions, Bombay Stock to be delivered to a Participant  will be registered
in his name or the Alternate Payee's name alone or in the event  of  his  death
prior  to such delivery will be registered in the name of the person or persons
entitled thereto.

      F.    MISCELLANEOUS.

            1.    No  individual administering, or aiding in the administration
                  of the  Program  shall have any liability, except as provided
                  in subparagraph (2)  below.   As  a  condition  precedent  to
                  participation  in  the  Program  or  the  receipt of benefits
                  thereunder,  such liability if any, is expressly  waived  and
                  released by each  Participant  and  by  any  and  all persons
                  claiming  under  or through any Participant, such waiver  and
                  release  to  be  conclusively   evidenced   by   the  act  of
                  participation or the acceptance of benefits thereunder.

            2.    No  individual administering, or aiding in the administration
                  of, the  Program  shall  be liable except for his own acts or
                  omissions and then only for  willful  misfeasance, bad faith,
                  gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved
                  in the conduct of this office.  As used  herein,  "individual
                  administering,   or  aiding  in  the  administration  of  the
                  Program" shall include  any  share  owner, director, officer,
                  Employee or agent of the Company.

            3.    The Company shall have the right to require  compliance  with
                  any   legal  requirements  which  it  deems  necessary  as  a
                  condition  for  delivery of, or payment for, any Bombay Stock
                  or cash to the credit of any Participant under the Program.

            4.    By a Participant's  act of participating in the Program or by
                  the  acceptance  of any  of  the  benefits  thereunder,  such
                  Participant and any and all persons claiming under or through
                  any such Participant, shall thereby be conclusively deemed to
                  have  indicated  his  acceptance  and  ratification  of,  and
                  consent to, the application of the provisions of the Program.


            5.    For the purposes of  the  Program,  unless  the  contrary  is
                  clearly  indicated  by  the context, the use of the masculine
                  gender shall also include  within  its  meaning the feminine,
                  and  the  use of the singular shall also include  within  its
                  meaning the plural, and vice versa.

                                     XIII

                          NOTICES AND COMMUNICATIONS

      A.    TO PARTICIPANTS.   All notices, reports and other communications to
a Participant under or in connection  with  the Program shall be deemed to have
been duly given, made or delivered when received  by  the  Participant,  or (if
mailed)  when  mailed with postage prepaid and addressed to the Participant  at
his address last appearing on the records of the Company.

      B.    BY PARTICIPANTS.  All notices, instructions or other communications
by a Participant  to  the Company under or in connection with the Program shall

specified in writing by the  Company  and  at  the  location, or by the person,
designated for receipt of such notice, instruction or  other  communication  by
the Company.

                                      XIV

                     AMENDMENT, SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION

      A.    AUTHORITY  TO  AMEND,  SUSPEND  OR  TERMINATE.   The  Committee may
suspend or terminate the Program, or any portion thereof, at any time  and  may
amend  the Program from time to time in such respects as the Committee may deem
advisable;  provided,  however, the Program shall not be amended more than once
every 6 months, other than to comport with changes in the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, or the rules promulgated thereunder; and provided further,
the Program shall not be  amended  without  shareholder  approval to the extent
required  by law or the rules of any exchange upon which the  Bombay  Stock  is
listed, (a)  to  materially increase the number of shares of Bombay Stock which
may be issued under  the  Program, (b) to materially modify the requirements as
to eligibility for participation  in the Program, or (c) to materially increase
the benefits accruing to officers of  the  Company  under the Program.  No such
amendment,  suspension  or  termination  shall  make  any  change   that  would
disqualify  the  Program,  or any other plan of the Company intended to  be  so
qualified, from the exemption  provided  by  Rule  16b-3  promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

      B.    DELEGATION  OF  AUTHORITY.   The  Committee  may  delegate  to  the
Administrative Committee the authority to amend any provision of  this Program,
provided  such  amendment  is  (a) of an administrative nature or (b) does  not
result in any material increase in costs to the Company.

      C.    AMENDMENTS.   No  amendment,   suspension   or   termination  shall
adversely affect any rights of a Participant to Bombay Stock,  Fractional Share
payment  or  cash to his credit under the Program as of the date of  amendment,
suspension or termination.  Upon such termination, all Bombay Stock, Fractional
Share payment or cash to the credit of each Participant under the Program shall
be promptly paid over to him.

                                      XV

                                APPLICABLE LAW

      Any question  concerning,  or  in respect of, the validity, construction,
interpretation, administration and effect  of the Program, and of its rules and
regulations, and the rights of any or all persons having or claiming to have an
interest therein or thereunder, shall be governed  exclusively  and  solely  in
accordance  with  the  laws  of  the  State of Texas, with jurisdiction for any
action  being  expressly  agreed as being  Tarrant  County,  Texas,  where  all
contributions and payments  under  the  Program  are deemed to take place.  The
issuance of shares of Bombay Stock shall be subject to all applicable rules and
regulations,  and to such approvals by any governmental  agencies  or  national
securities exchanges as may be required.

Plan,  including the authority in the event of a spin-off  or  other  corporate

on all persons affected by such decisions.

purpose of replacing or regranting such options or rights with a purchase price
that is less than the purchase price of the original option or right.

reckless  disregard  of his or her duties.  The Company  shall  indemnify  each
member of the Committee for all costs and expenses and, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, any liability incurred in connection with defending against,
responding to, negotiation  for the settlement of or otherwise dealing with any
claim, cause of action or dispute  of  any  kind arising in connection with any
actions in administering this Plan or in authorizing  or  denying authorization
to any transaction hereunder.

5.    PARTICIPATION

      Awards may be granted under the Plan to those Employees of the Company as
the Committee may from time to time select, including any Employee of an entity
acquired by or merged into the Company pursuant to the assumption,  replacement
or substitution of awards previously issued by such entity.  In no event may an
Award be granted under the Plan to any person who is not an Employee, except in
circumstances  involving  the  grant  of  an  Award  made  in  tandem  with  or
replacement of an earlier Award made under the Plan to a former Employee.

6.    AVAILABLE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

a)    Available  Shares.   There  shall  be  an initial allocation of 1,400,000
shares of Common Stock to the Plan, plus any shares  of  Common Stock available
for delivery under the 1986 Stock Option Plan (the "Prior Plan") which have not
been committed for delivery by grants made under the Prior Plan.  Additionally,
and subject to the provisions of Section 6(d) of the Plan, the aggregate number
of shares of Common Stock which shall be available for delivery to Participants
under the Plan shall be increased each fiscal year following the fiscal year in
which  the  Plan  is  adopted by an amount equal to one and one-fourth  percent
(1.25%) of the total number of issued shares of Common Stock as reported in the
Company's Consolidated  Balance Sheet in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
immediately preceding fiscal  year  end.  Any  shares of Common Stock which are
represented by Awards or portions of Awards made  under  the  Plan or the Prior
Plan which are settled, forfeited, expire or are canceled without  the delivery
of  shares,  and  any  shares  of  Common  Stock  which may be tendered, either
actually or by attestation, by a person as full or  partial payment made to the
Company in connection with the exercise of any stock  option  under the Plan or
the  Prior  Plan shall be available for Awards under the Plan.  Any  shares  of
Common Stock  available pursuant to this Section 6 which were available and not
used for Awards  in  any  prior  fiscal  year  shall  be carried forward and be
available  for  Awards  in  succeeding  fiscal  years, as well  as  any  shares
reacquired by the Company in the open market or in  a  private  transaction, in
which  Fair  Market  Value is paid for such shares, up to the extent  that  the
aggregate purchase price  of  such shares does not exceed the cumulative amount
of cash proceeds received by the  Company  after the effective date of the Plan
from the exercise of stock options granted under  the  Plan  or the Prior Plan.
The  stock  subject to the provisions of this Plan shall either  be  shares  of
authorized but  unissued  Common Stock, shares of Common Stock held as treasury
stock or previously issued  shares  of  Common Stock reacquired by the Company,
including shares purchased on the open market.

      b)    Limitations.  The aggregate number  of  shares of Common Stock that
may be represented by Awards granted to any single Participant  under  Sections
7(c),  7(d)  and 7(e) of the Plan shall not exceed 525,000 for any fiscal  year
during which the  Plan  is in effect.  The aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock that may be delivered in settlement of Awards granted pursuant to Section
7(e) of the Plan shall not  exceed  25%  of  the  aggregate  number  of  shares
available for delivery at any time under the Plan under Section 6(a).  Further,
the  aggregate  number  of shares of Common Stock that may be covered by Awards
made in the form of incentive stock options intended to comply with Section 422
of the Code shall not exceed 1,500,000 during the life of the Plan.

      c)    Non-Share Usage.  Cash dividends, dividend equivalents paid in cash
in conjunction with outstanding  Awards, and stock-denominated Awards which are
settled in cash shall not reduce the  number  of  shares available for delivery
under the Plan.  Further, any shares that are issued  by  the  Company, and any
Awards  that  are  granted  through the assumption of, or in substitution  for,
outstanding awards previously  granted  by  an acquired entity shall not reduce
the number of shares available for Awards under the Plan.  No fractional shares
of Common Stock shall be delivered under the Plan.  Cash may be paid in lieu of
any fractional shares in settlements of Awards under the Plan.

      d)    Adjustments.   In the event of any  stock  dividend,  stock  split,
combination   or  exchange  of  equity   securities,   merger,   consolidation,
recapitalization,  spin-off  or  other  distribution  (other  than  normal cash
dividends)  of  the  Company's  assets  to  shareholders,  or  any other change
affecting  shares  of  Common  Stock  or share price, the Committee shall  make
appropriate adjustments to reflect such change with respect to:  (i) the number
of shares of Common Stock that may be available  and  delivered as set forth in
Section 6(a) and the limitations on such Awards as set  forth  in Section 6(b);
(ii)  the  number  of shares of Common Stock covered by each outstanding  Award
made under the Plan; and (iii) the exercise price per share of Common Stock for
any outstanding stock  options,  stock  appreciation  rights  or similar Awards
under the Plan.

7.    AWARDS

      a)    General.   The  Committee  shall  determine  the type or  types  of
Award(s) set forth below to be made to each Participant.  Awards may be granted
singly, in combination or in tandem.  Awards also may be made,  subject  to the
provision of Section 4(c), in replacement of or as alternatives to other Awards
or  rights  under  the  Plan  or  any  other  employee compensation plan of the
Company, including the plan of any acquired entity.

      b)    Foreign Jurisdiction.  Awards may be  granted, without amending the
Plan, to Participants who are foreign nationals or  employed outside the United
States or both, on such terms and conditions different  from those specified in
the Plan as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable to
further the purposes of the Plan or to accommodate differences  in  local  law,
tax policy or custom.  Moreover, the Committee may approve such supplements  to
or alternative versions of the Plan as it may consider necessary or appropriate
for  such purposes without thereby affecting the terms of the Plan as in effect
for any  other  purpose;  provided,  however, no such supplement or alternative
version shall:  (a) increase the number  of  available  shares  of Common Stock
under Section 6(a); or (b) increase the limitations contained in Section 6(b).

      c)    Stock  Options.   A stock option represents a right to  purchase  a
specified  number  of shares of Common  Stock  during  a  specified  period  as
determined by the Committee. The purchase price per share for each stock option
shall be not less than  100%  of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant.  A
stock option may be in the form of an incentive stock option which, in addition
to  being  subject  to  the  applicable   terms,   conditions  and  limitations
established  by the Committee, complies with Section  422  of  the  Code.   The
shares of Common  Stock  covered  by  a  stock  option may be exercised only by
written  notice  to  the  Secretary  of  the Company, in  accordance  with  the
applicable Award Agreement, accompanied by  cash  payment or such other payment
method permitted by the Committee, including (i) tendering  (either actually or
by attestation) shares of Common Stock valued at Fair Market  Value on the date
of exercise; (ii) authorizing a third party to sell the shares (or a sufficient
portion  thereof) acquired upon exercise of a stock option, and  assigning  the
delivery to  the Company of a sufficient amount of the sale proceeds to pay for
all  the  shares  acquired  through  such  exercise  and  any  tax  withholding
obligations  resulting  from  such  exercise;  or  (iii) any combination of the
above.  The Committee may grant stock options that provide  for  the grant of a
subsequent restoration stock option if the exercise price has been  paid for by
tendering shares to the Company.  Any restoration stock option shall be for the
number   of   shares  tendered  in  exercising  the  predecessor  option.   The
restoration stock  option  exercise price shall be the then-current Fair Market
Value, and the term of such  restoration  option  may  not  extend  beyond  the
remaining term of the original option.

      d)    Stock Appreciation Rights.  A stock appreciation right represents a
right  to  receive a payment, in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination,
equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of a specified number of shares on
the date the  right is exercised over (a) the Fair Market Value on the date the
right was granted as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement or (b), in the
case of a stock appreciation right granted in tandem with or substitution for a
stock option, the purchase price per share of such stock option.

      e)    Stock  Awards.  A stock Award represents an Award made in shares of
Common Stock or denominated  in  units  equivalent in value to shares of Common
Stock.   All or part of any stock Award shall  be  subject  to  conditions  and
restrictions established by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement,
which may  include,  but not be limited to, continuous service with the Company
and/or the achievement  of  Performance  Goals  over  a  specified  Performance
Period.   The  Committee  may  select  one  criterion or multiple criteria  for
measuring performance, and the measurement may  be  based  on  total Company or
business  unit  performance  or  based  on  comparative performance with  other
companies.

8.    DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS

      The Committee may provide that any Awards  under  the Plan earn dividends
or dividend equivalents.  Such dividends or dividend equivalents  may  be  paid
currently  or  may  be  credited  to a Participant's account.  Any crediting of
dividends or dividend equivalents may  be  subject  to  such  restrictions  and
conditions as the Committee may establish, including reinvestment in additional
shares  of  Common Stock or share equivalents.  Payment of credited or deferred
dividends shall  be  made  upon  the lapsing of any restrictions imposed on the
Award in respect of which the deferred  dividends  were paid, and any dividends
deferred in respect to an Award shall be forfeited upon  the forfeiture of such
Award.  The total number of shares of Common Stock available  for  grant  under
Section  6(a)  shall  not  be  reduced  to  reflect  any  dividends or dividend
equivalents  that  are reinvested into additional shares or credited  as  units
equivalent to shares.

9.    PAYMENTS AND PAYMENT DEFERRALS

      Payment of Awards  may  be  in  the form of cash, shares of Common Stock,
other Awards or combinations thereof as the Committee shall determine, and with
such restrictions as it may impose.  The  Committee  also may require or permit
participants  to elect to defer the delivery of shares  or  the  settlement  of
Awards in cash  under  such  rules and procedures as it may establish under the
Plan.  It also may provide that  deferred  settlements  include  the payment or
crediting  of interest on the deferral amounts, or the payment or crediting  of
dividend equivalents  where  the  deferral  amounts  are  denominated  in share
equivalents.   In  addition, the Committee may stipulate in an Award Agreement,
either at the time of  grant  or  by  subsequent  amendment,  that a payment or
portion of a payment of an Award be delayed in the event that Section 162(m) of
the  Code  (or  any  successor  or similar provision of the Code affecting  tax
deductibility) would operate to disallow a tax deduction by the Company for all
or a portion of such payment.  The period of any such delay in payment shall be
until the payment or portion thereof,  is  tax deductible, or such earlier date
as the Committee shall determine.

10.   TRANSFERABILITY

      No Award shall be assignable or transferable  except by will, by the laws
of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order
as  defined  by  the Code or as otherwise may be permitted  by  the  Committee.
During the lifetime  of  a  Participant,  an Award shall be exercisable only by
such  Participant  or  such  Participant's guardian,  legal  representative  or
assignee pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order.

11.   CHANGE-OF-CONTROL

      (a)   Notwithstanding anything  contained  in  this  Plan  or  any  Award
            Agreement to the contrary, in the event of a Change of Control,  as
            defined  below, any of the following may, in the sole discretion of
            the  Committee,   occur   with   respect  to  any  Employee  Awards
            outstanding as of such Change of Control:

            (i)   the  time periods for exercising  or  realizing  and  vesting
                  periods  of  Awards  will  be  accelerated, restrictions will
                  lapse and performance standards  will  be deemed to have been
                  attained  so  that such Awards may be immediately  exercised,
                  realized or vested  in  full  on  or before the relevant date
                  fixed in the Award Agreement;

            (ii)  outstanding  stock Awards granted pursuant  to  Section  7(a)
                  shall be settled in cash;

            (iii) upon exercise  of a stock option or an incentive stock option
                  (collectively, an "Option") during the 60-day period from and
                  after  the date of  a  Change  of  Control,  the  Participant
                  exercising  the  Option  may in lieu of the receipt of Common
                  Stock  upon the exercise of  the  Option,  elect  by  written
                  notice to  the Corporation to receive an amount in cash equal
                  to the excess  of  the  aggregate value (as defined below) of
                  the shares of Common Stock  covered  by the Option or portion
                  thereof  surrendered determined on the  date  the  Option  is
                  exercised,  over  the  aggregate exercise price of the Option
                  (such  excess  is  referred   to  herein  as  the  "Aggregate
                  Spread"); provided, however, and  notwithstanding  any  other
                  provision of this Plan, if the end of such 60-day period from
                  and  after  the  date  of  a  Change of Control is within six
                  months  of  the  date  of  grant  of  an  Option  held  by  a
                  Participant who is a Reporting Person,  such  Option shall be
                  canceled  in  exchange for a cash payment to the  Participant
                  equal to the Aggregate  Spread on the day which is six months
                  and one day after the date  of grant of such Option.  As used
                  in this Section 11(a)(iii) the  term "Value" means the higher
                  of (i) the highest Fair Market Value during the 60-day period
                  from and after the date of a Change  of  Control  and (ii) if
                  the  Change  of  Control  is  the result of a transaction  or
                  series of transactions described  in  paragraphs (i) or (iii)
                  of the definition of Change of Control, the highest price per
                  share of the Common Stock paid in such  transaction or series
                  of transactions (which in the case of paragraph  (i) shall be
                  the highest price per share of the Common Stock as  reflected
                  in  a  Schedule  13D  filed  by  the  person  having made the
                  acquisition);

            (iv)  if a Participant's employment terminates for any reason other
                  than retirement or death following a Change of  Control,  any
                  options  held  by  such  Participant may be exercised by such
                  Participant  until the earlier  of  three  months  after  the
                  termination of  employment  or  the  expiration  date of such
                  options; and

             (v)  all outstanding Awards shall become non-cancelable.

      (b)   A  "Change  of Control" of the Company, unless otherwise determined
            by the Board,  shall  be deemed to have occurred upon the happening
            of any of the following events:

            (i)   the  acquisition,   other  than  from  the  Company,  by  any
                  individual, entity or  group  (within  the meaning of Section
                  13(d)(3)  or  14(d)(2)  of  the Exchange Act)  of  beneficial
                  ownership  of  20%  or more of either  the  then  outstanding
                  shares of Common Stock  of the Company or the combined voting
                  power  of  the  then outstanding  voting  securities  of  the
                  Company  entitled  to  vote  generally  in  the  election  of
                  directors;  provided,  however,  that  any acquisition by the
                  Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any  employee  benefit
                  plan  (or  related trust) of the Company or its subsidiaries,
                  or any corporation  with  respect  to  which  following  such
                  acquisition,   more  than  50%  of,  respectively,  the  then
                  outstanding shares  of  common  stock of such corporation and

                  securities of such  corporation entitled to vote generally in
                  the  election  of  directors   is  then  beneficially  owned,
                  directly or indirectly, by all or  substantially  all  of the
                  individuals  and  entities  who  were  the beneficial owners,
                  respectively,  of the Common Stock and voting  securities  of
                  the  Company  immediately   prior   to  such  acquisition  in
                  substantially  the  same  proportion  as   their   ownership,

                  though  such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board,
                  but excluding,  for  this  purpose, any such individual whose
                  initial assumption of office  is in connection with an actual
                  or threatened election contest  relating  to  the election of
                  the directors of the Company (as such terms are  used in rule

                  reorganization, merger or consolidation of  the  Company,  in
                  each case, with respect to which the individuals and entities
                  who were the respective beneficial owners of the Common Stock
                  and  voting  securities  of  the Company immediately prior to
                  such  reorganization,  merger  or   consolidation   do   not,
                  following   such  reorganization,  merger  or  consolidation,
                  beneficially  own,  directly or indirectly, more than 50% of,
                  respectively, the then outstanding shares of Common Stock and
                  the combined voting power  of  the  then  outstanding  voting
                  securities  entitled  to  vote  generally  in the election of
                  directors,  as the case may be, of the corporation  resulting
                  from  such reorganization,  merger  or  consolidation,  or  a
                  complete  liquidation or dissolution of the Company or of the
                  sale or other  disposition of all or substantially all of the
                  assets of the Company.

option exceed a period of ten years from the date of its grant), the provisions
applicable in the  event  the  Participant's  employment  terminates,  and  the

sooner  terminate  the  Plan  and  may at any time and from time to time amend,
modify or suspend the Plan; provided, however, that no amendment that increases
the amounts of shares specified in Sections  6(a)  and  6(b)  or  the price per

the  shareholders  of  the  Company  in  accordance  with  applicable  law  and
regulations.

14.   TAX WITHHOLDING

      The  Company  shall  have  the  right to deduct from any settlement of an
Award made under the Plan, including the  delivery  or  vesting  of  shares  of
Common Stock, a sufficient amount to cover withholding of any federal, state or
local  taxes  required  by  law  or  such  greater amount of withholding as the
Committee shall determine from time to time,  or  to  take such other action as
may be necessary to satisfy any such withholding obligations.  If the Committee
permits or requires shares of Common Stock to be used to  satisfy  required tax
withholding, such shares shall be valued at the Fair Market Value as of the tax
recognition date for such Award.

15.   OTHER BENEFIT AND COMPENSATION PROGRAMS

      Unless otherwise specifically determined by the Committee, settlements of

funds.   The Plan shall not establish any fiduciary  relationship  between  the
Company and  any  Participant  or other person.  To the extent any person holds

17.   USE OF PROCEEDS

      The cash proceeds received by the Company from the delivery of shares  of
Common  Stock  pursuant  to  the exercise of stock options or the settlement of
other Awards under the Plan shall  be  used  for  general  corporate  purposes,

permits required by regulatory  authorities  having jurisdiction over the Plan,
the Awards granted under it or the shares issued pursuant to it.

19.   FUTURE RIGHTS

      No person shall have any claim or rights to be granted an Award under the
Plan, and no Participant shall have any rights under the Plan to be retained in
the employ of the Company.  Likewise, participation in the Plan will not in any
way affect the Company's right to terminate the  employment  of the Participant

or relating to the Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of  the

                        EMPLOYEE OPTION AWARD AGREEMENT
                   NON-QUALIFIED AND INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS
                                  PURSUANT TO
                           THE BOMBAY COMPANY, INC.
                      1996 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN


       This  Option  Award  Agreement ("the Agreement") is made this ___ day of
________, 2005 between THE BOMBAY  COMPANY,  INC.,  a Delaware corporation (the
"Company") and ____________________, an employee of the  Company  or one of its
subsidiaries (the "Employee").

       WHEREAS,  the  Company  desires to carry out the purposes of The  Bombay
Company, Inc. 1996 Long-Term Incentive  Stock  Plan  (the  "Plan") by affording
Employee the opportunity to purchase shares of the Company's  $1.00  par  value
common stock (the "Shares").

       NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set
forth  for  other  good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

       1. Grant of Option.  The Company hereby grants to Employee the right and
          option (the  "Option")  to purchase an aggregate of _______ shares of
          the Company's Shares, such  Shares  being  subject  to  adjustment as
          provided  in  paragraph  8  hereof,  and  on the terms and conditions
          herein  set  forth  (the  "Option Shares").  Of  the  Shares  granted
          pursuant to this Option, _______  shares  are granted as an Incentive
          Stock  Option  within the meaning of Section  422A  of  the  Internal
          Revenue Code of  1954,  as  amended  (the  "ISO  Shares"), and ______
          shares are granted as a Non-qualified Option (the "NQO Shares").

       2.    Purchase Price.  The purchase price of the Option  Shares shall be
$_____  per Share, such purchase price being 100% of the fair market  value  of
such Shares on the date first appearing above (the "Date of the Grant").

       3.    Exercise of Option.

             A.     ISO  Shares:   Unless  expired  as  provided in paragraph 5
       below, and subject to the special provisions of paragraph  6  below, the
       Option for ISO Shares may be exercised from time to time in whole  or in
       part  for  not  more  than 33% of the entire number of ISO Shares at any
       time after the first anniversary of the Date of Grant, and an additional
       33%  of  the  total  ISO Shares  on  each  of  the  two  (2)  succeeding
       anniversaries of the Date of Grant.

             B.     NQO Shares:   Unless  expired  as  provided  in paragraph 5
       below, and subject to the special provisions of paragraph 6  below,  the
       Option  for NQO Shares may be exercised from time to time in whole or in
       part for  not  more  than  33% of the entire number of NQO Shares at any
       time after the first anniversary of the Date of Grant, and an additional
       33%  of  the  total  NQO Shares  on  each  of  the  two  (2)  succeeding
       anniversaries of the Date of Grant.

       4.    Manner of Exercise; Payment of Purchase Price.

             A.     Subject to  the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Option shall be exercised by written  notice  to  the  Company at its principal
office.  Such notice shall state the election to exercise  the Option and shall
specify  the  number  of Option Shares sought to be exercised pursuant  to  the
notice.  Such notice of  exercise  shall  be  signed  by  Employee and shall be
irrevocable when given.

             B.     The  notice of exercise shall be accompanied  by  the  full
payment of the purchase price  for the Option Shares in cash by certified check
or bank cashiers check or through  satisfactory  arrangements  for payment by a
broker  representing  the  Employee  in  the sale of some or all of the  Option
Shares.   Subject  to  approval of an authorized  committee  of  the  Board  of
Directors (the "Committee"),  payment of the purchase price may be accomplished
by  the  surrender  of  stock  certifications  representing  Shares  having  an
aggregate fair market value on the date of exercise equal to the purchase price
of the Option Shares, or by a combination of cash and Shares.

             C.     Upon receipt  of  the  purchase  price,  and subject to the
terms  of paragraph 11, a certificate representing the Option Shares  exercised
shall be  registered  in  the  name  of the person or persons so exercising the
Option.  In the event the Option shall be exercised pursuant to paragraph 7, by
any person or persons other than the Employee, such notice shall be accompanied
by appropriate proof satisfactory to the Company of the right of such person or
persons to exercise the Option.  All Share issued as a result of an exercise of
an Option as provided herein shall be fully paid and non-assessable.

             D.     The payment of withholding  tax liability by Employee shall
be a condition precedent to the Company's obligation  to issue any certificates
for Shares resulting from an exercise of an Option.

       5.    Exercise and Expiration of Option.  This Option, if not exercised,
shall expire and become null and void upon the expiration  of  three (3) months
after Employee ceases to be employed by the Company or any of its  subsidiaries
(subject to being extended based upon service duration with the Company) unless
such termination shall have been for cause, as determined by the Committee,  in
which  event  the  Option  shall  be  null  and  void  as  of  the date of such
termination.  Notwithstanding the above, if Employee retires from  the  Company
or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  (as  determined  by  the  Committee in its sole
discretion), the Option may, at the Committee's discretion,  remain exercisable
for a period not to exceed 36 months following such retirement.   In  the event
of  Employee's  death  or permanent disability, the Option shall be exercisable
for a period of 12 months  following such death or disability.  Notwithstanding
the above, the Option shall,  without  exception,  become  null and void once a
period  of  10  years  shall  have lapsed since the Date of Grant.   Except  as
provide in paragraph 6 below, only  those  portions of this Option vested as of
the date of termination of Employee's employment may be exercised.

       6.    Acceleration of Exercise Dates.  Notwithstanding the provisions of
paragraph 3 above relating to the vesting of  this  Option in installments, the
Committee  may,  in  its  discretion,  permit  this Option  to  be  immediately
exercisable, until the expiration date provided  in  paragraph 5 above, for the
entire number of Option Shares covered hereby upon the  retirement  of Employee
or any Change in Control of the Company (as defined in the Plan).

       7.    Option Nontransferable.  Unless permitted by law or regulation and
approved  by the Committee, the Option and any right related thereto shall  not
be transferable  by  Employee  otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent
and  distribution  and may be exercised  during  Employee's  lifetime  only  by
Employee.   Upon the  death  of  Employee,  the  Option  may  be  exercised  by
Employee's executor, administrator, legatee or distributee, as the case may be.

       8.    Adjustments  of  Shares Subject to Option.  If any Shares shall at
any  time  be  changed  or  exchanged  by  reason  or  reorganization,  merger,
consolidation, recapitalization,  reclassification, stock split, combination of
shares or a dividend payable in stock,  then  the  aggregate  number  of Option
Shares  subject to this Agreement and the purchase price of such Option  Shares
shall be  automatically  adjusted  such  that Employee's proportionate interest
shall be maintained as before the occurrence  of such event.  The determination
of any such adjustment by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive.

       9.    No Contract.  This Agreement does  not  constitute  a contract for
employment  and  shall  not  affect  the  right  of  the  Company  to terminate
Employee's employment for any reason whatsoever.

       10.   Rights as Shareholder.  This Option shall not entitle Employee  or
any  permitted  transferee  to any rights of a shareholder of the Company or to
any notice of proceedings of  the  Company  with  respect  to any Option Shares
issuable  upon  exercise  of this Option unless and until the Option  has  been
exercised for such Shares.

       11.   Restriction on  Issuance  of  Shares.   The  Company  shall not be
required  to  issue  or deliver any certificates for Shares purchased upon  the
exercise  of an Option  prior  to  the  obtaining  of  any  approval  from  any
governmental  agency which the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine
to be necessary  or  advisable, and the completion of any registration or other
qualification of such  Shares  under  any  state  or  federal  law,  ruling  or
regulations  of  any  governmental  body  which  the Company shall, in its sole
discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable.   In  addition,  if  Shares
reserved  for  issuance  upon  exercise of Options shall not then be registered
under the Securities Act of 1933,  the Company may, upon Employee's exercise of
any  Option,  require Employee or his  permitted  transferee  to  represent  in
writing that the  Shares  being acquired are for investment and not with a view
to distribution, and may mark  the  certificate  for  the  Shares with a legend
restricting  transfer  and  may  issue  stop transfer orders relating  to  such
certificate to the transfer agent.

       12.   Lapse of Option.  The Agreement  shall  be  null  and  void in the
event  Employee  shall  fail  to  sign  and return a counterpart hereof to  the
Company within thirty (30) days of its delivery to Employee.

       13.   Confidentiality    and    Non-Solicitation    Restrictions.     In
consideration of Employee's receipt of the  above  stock option grant, Employee
agrees as follows:

             A.     Employee will not disclose to any  person  any confidential
information  obtained  while  in the employ of the Company, including,  without
limitation, any of the Company's  inventions, methods of distribution, vendors,
customers or other trade secrets; provided,  however, that this provision shall
not preclude Employee from use of or disclosure  of information known generally
to the public or of information not considered confidential  by persons engaged
in the business conducted by the Company or from disclosure required  by law or
court  order.   Upon  termination,  Employee  shall  immediately  return to the
Company all documents, reports, files, memoranda, records, keys and pass cards,
software and other physical or personal property which Employee has received or
prepared or helped to prepare in connection with his or her employment which is
in  Employee's  possession  or  control  and Employee agrees not to retain  any
copies, duplications, reproductions or excerpts thereof.

             B.     Employee will not now  or  for  a period of one (1) year in
the future solicit and/or attempt to recruit employees of the Company for other
employment with any subsequent employer or attempt directly  or  indirectly  to
solicit  the trade or business of any current or prospective customer, supplier
or partner of the Company.

             C.     In  the  event Employee fails to comply with the provisions
of paragraphs A and B above, the  Company  shall  have the right to rescind any
transaction involving the Shares granted pursuant to  this Option up to six (6)
months prior to such failure to comply and for up to two  (2) years thereafter.
In  the  event of any such rescission, Employee shall pay to  the  Company  the
amount of  any  gain  realized or payment received as a result of the rescinded
exercise in such manner  and  on  such terms and conditions as may be required,
and the Company shall be entitled to  set-off  against  the  amount of any such
gain any amount owed to the Employee by the Company.

       14.   Binding Effect.  This Agreement shall be binding  upon  the heirs,
executors, administrators, and successors of the parties hereto.

Shares may be sold, transferred,  assigned,  pledged or otherwise encumbered or
disposed  of prior to the satisfaction of all restrictions  prescribed  by  the
