ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

         GENERAL

                Duane Reade is the largest drugstore chain in New York City,
based on sales volume, with 58 of its 67 stores located in Manhattan's
high-traffic business and residential districts. The Company operates almost
twice as many stores in Manhattan as its next largest competitor. Since opening
its first store in 1960, the Company has successfully executed a marketing and
operating strategy tailored to the unique characteristics of New York City, the
largest and most densely populated market in the United States. According to
Drug Store News, Duane Reade is the leading drugstore chain in the United
States in terms of sales per square foot, at $1,010 per square foot in 1997,
which was more than two times the national average for drugstore chains. For
the fiscal year ended December 27, 1997, the Company had sales of $429.8
million and EBITDA of $43.1 million, increases of 12.7% and 22.0%,
respectively, over the 1996 fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended December 27,
1997, the Company had a net loss of $14.7 million.

                The Company enjoys strong brand name recognition in New York
City, which it believes results from the Company's many locations in
high-traffic areas of Manhattan and the 30 million shopping bags with the
distinctive Duane Reade logo that the Company distributes annually. An
independent survey conducted in 1996 indicated that approximately 84% of the
people who live or work in Manhattan recognize the Duane Reade name, and seven
out of ten shopped at a Duane Reade store in the past twelve months. The
Company was also recently named "Regional Drug Store Chain of the Year" for
1997 by Drug Store News.

                The Company has developed an operating strategy designed to
capitalize on the unique characteristics of the New York City market, which
include high-traffic volume, complex distribution logistics and high costs of
occupancy, media advertising and personnel. The key elements of the Company's
operating strategy are (i) everyday low price format and broad product
offering, (ii) low cost operating structure supported by its high volume stores
and low advertising and distribution costs and (iii) ability to design and
operate its stores in a wide variety of sizes and layouts.

                The Company believes that its everyday low price format and
broad product offerings provide value and convenience for its customers and
build customer loyalty. The Company's everyday low price format results in
prices that the Company believes are lower, on average, than the prices offered
by its competitors.

                The Company is able to keep its operating costs relatively low
due to its high per store sales volume, relatively low warehouse and
distribution costs and relatively low advertising expenditures. The Company's
high volume stores allow it to effectively leverage occupancy costs, payroll
and other store operating expenses. The Company's two primary distribution
facilities are located within five miles of all but one of its 67 stores and,
combined with the rapid 



                                      -4-
<PAGE>

turnover of inventory in Duane Reade's stores, result in relatively low
warehouse and distribution costs. The Company plans to move all of its
distribution facilities to another, recently leased warehouse in mid-1998. See
"--Company Operations." The Company's strong brand name recognition in New York
City and everyday low price format allow the Company to minimize its use of
costly media and print advertising and to rely instead on in-window displays
and other less expensive promotional activities.

                The Company has demonstrated its ability to successfully
operate stores using a wide variety of store configurations and sizes, which
the Company believes is necessary to succeed in the New York City market. For
example, the size of the Company's stores ranges from 2,600 to 12,300 square
feet, and it operates 29 bi-level stores. The Company believes that its
flexibility in configuring stores provides it with a competitive advantage in
securing locations for its new stores, as many of its competitors target more
standardized spaces for their stores, which are more difficult to find in New
York City. In addition, the Company's management team has extensive experience
and knowledge of the New York City real estate market, allowing it to pursue
attractive real estate opportunities.

                The Company's predecessor was founded in 1960. In 1992, Bain
Capital acquired the Company from its founders and, in June 1997, investment
funds affiliated with DLJMBPII (as defined) acquired approximately 91.5% of the
outstanding capital stock of the Company from Bain Capital and certain other
selling securityholders. Since the 1992 acquisition, the Company has incurred 
net losses in each fiscal year.

                In 1994 and 1995, the Company experienced rapid expansion,
growing from 40 stores to 59 stores. However, as a result of liquidity
constraints and the need for improved inventory controls, the Company was
forced to suspend its store expansion program in late 1995. In early 1996, a
strengthened management team led by Anthony Cuti, the Company's new Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, took several measures to improve operations,
including improving inventory controls and decreasing out-of-stock occurrences,
creating a loss prevention function to control inventory shrink and continuing
to invest in MIS. In 1997, the Company resumed its store expansion program,
opening seven stores. During Mr. Cuti's tenure at the Company, EBITDA has
increased by 60.2% from $26.9 million for the 52 weeks ended March 29, 1996 to
$43.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 27, 1997, and the Company
experienced net losses of $19.8 million and $14.7 million for the 52 weeks
ended March 29, 1996 and the fiscal year ended December 27, 1997, respectively.
Net loss before non-recurring charges for the fiscal year ended December 27,
1997 was $2.0 million.

         COMPANY OPERATIONS

                Merchandising. Duane Reade's overall merchandising strategy is
to provide the broadest selection of branded and private label drugstore
products available in Manhattan and to sell them at everyday low prices. To
further enhance customer service and loyalty, the Company attempts to maintain
a consistent in-stock position in all merchandise categories. In addition to
prescription and OTC drugs, the Company offers health and beauty aids, food and
beverage items, tobacco products, cosmetics, housewares, hosiery, greeting
cards, photofinishing, photo 


                                      -5-
<PAGE>

supplies, seasonal merchandise and other products. Health and beauty care
products, including OTC drugs, represent the largest of the Company's product
categories. Duane Reade drugstores offer a wide variety of brand name and
private label products, including oral, skin and hair care products, bath
supplies, vitamins and nutritional supplements, feminine hygiene products,
family planning products and baby care products. Popular brands of health and
beauty aids are given ample shelf space, and large sizes are offered, which the
Company believes appeals to the value consciousness of many Manhattan
consumers. Convenience items such as candy, snacks and seasonal goods are
positioned near the check out registers to provide optimum convenience and
stimulate impulse purchases for the customers while allowing the store
employees to monitor those product categories that are particularly susceptible
to inventory shrink.

                In addition to the wide array of brand products offered in its
stores, the Company offers its own private label products. Private label
products provide customers with high-quality, lower priced alternatives to name
brand products while generating higher gross profit margins than name brand
products. These offerings also enhance Duane Reade's reputation as a
value-oriented store. the Company currently offers approximately 400 private
label products. In 1997, these private label products accounted for
approximately 4.6% of non-pharmacy sales. The Company believes that its strong
brand image, reputation for quality and reliability in the New York City
market, and its economies of scale in purchasing allow it to aggressively
promote private label goods.

                The Company has recently made efforts to increase the sales of
certain high-margin items, such as cosmetics, greeting cards and
photofinishing. Other merchandising initiatives completed during 1996 and 1997
include an expanded selection of seasonal merchandise, vitamins, nutrition
products and baby accessories, particularly in stores located in residential
areas. The Company believes there are additional opportunities to continue to
refine and improve the merchandise mix in its stores.

                The Company also offers same-day photofinishing services in all
of its stores and has recently introduced one-hour photofinishing in three
stores. In 1998, the Company expects to introduce one-hour photofinishing in
seven to ten additional stores. Management believes that photofinishing
services contribute significantly to sales of other merchandise categories
because of customer traffic increases that result from the customer visiting a
store twice, in order to drop off film and pick up the processed photos.

                Pharmacy. The Company believes that its pharmacy business will
continue to contribute significantly to the Company's growth. Management also
believes that a larger and stronger pharmacy business will enhance customer
loyalty and generate incremental customer traffic, which is expected to
increase sales of Duane Reade's wide variety of OTC drugs and other
non-pharmacy merchandise. Duane Reade's prescription drug sales (as reflected
by same store pharmacy sales) grew by 24.6% in 1997 compared to 1996. Sales of
prescription and OTC drugs represented approximately 40% of total sales in 1997
as compared with 35% of total sales in 1996. Although the average number of
prescriptions filled by Duane Reade per store per week has increased from 640
in 1994 to 863 during 1997, the Company's average remains well below the
industry chain store average of approximately 1,200, providing significant
opportunity for 


                                      -6-
<PAGE>

continued pharmacy growth. The Company believes that the average number of
prescriptions filled per week by it lags behind the industry average because of
(i) the historically low penetration of Third Party Plans in the New York City
area and (ii) the Company's concentration of stores in business areas, rather
than residential areas. The Company believes continued pharmacy growth will
also increase overall customer traffic and benefits its non-pharmacy sales.

                The Company generally locates the pharmacy at the rear of the
store in order to maximize the pharmacy customer's exposure to other categories
of merchandise in the front of the store. Each pharmacy is staffed with a
registered pharmacist and drug clerk at all times to ensure quick and high
quality service. Each store carries a complete line of both branded and generic
prescription drugs. In 1996, the Company began a program to upgrade the quality
of its pharmacy service. The Company believes that this initiative has
contributed to its strong growth in pharmacy sales and should continue to
benefit the Company as customer loyalty builds in response to improved service
levels.

                In addition to customer service initiatives in its pharmacy
business, the Company has remodeled or redesigned 16 of its pharmacies since
the beginning of 1996. This remodeling, which has primarily involved updating
the pharmacy counter area to allow pharmacists and customers to have more
direct contact and providing a consultation and waiting area for customers, has
not resulted in any significant reduction in total retail selling space. By
improving the store layout and accessibility of the pharmacist and pharmacy
area, the stores that have been remodeled have achieved strong growth in their
pharmacy business. All stores opened since 1995 have the new pharmacy counter
area design. The Company currently operates 24 such stores. The Company has
also launched pharmacy marketing initiatives, such as home delivery and
prescription-by-fax services, which it believes have contributed to the
increased sales and customer loyalty of the pharmacy business.

                The Company believes that its extensive network of conveniently
located stores, strong local market position, pricing policies and reputation
for high quality health care products and services provide it with a
competitive advantage in attracting pharmacy business from individual customers
as well as Third Party Plans. The percentage of the Company's total
prescription drug sales attributable to Third Party Plans increased to
approximately 74% in 1997 from approximately 64% in 1996. Although gross
margins on sales to Third Party Plans are generally lower than other
prescription drug sales because of the highly competitive nature of pricing for
this business and the purchasing power of Third Party Plans, management
believes that the lower gross profit margins are offset by the higher volume of
pharmacy sales to Third Party Plan customers allowing the Company to leverage
other fixed store operating expenses. In addition, the Company believes that
Third Party Plans generate additional general merchandise sales by increasing
customer traffic in the stores. As of December 27, 1997, the Company had
contracts with over 100 Third Party Plans, including every major Third Party
Plan in the Company market areas.

                Another important component of the Company's pharmacy growth
strategy is the continued acquisition of prescription files from independent
pharmacies in market areas currently served by existing Company stores. In
1997, the Company purchased the prescription files of 


                                      -7-
<PAGE>

eight independent pharmacies for an aggregate total of $830,000, which
generated approximately $7 million in revenues on an annualized basis.
Independent pharmacists tend to have a higher proportion of customers that are
not Third Party Plans, which provide the Company with incremental revenue and
higher margin contribution. When appropriate, the Company will retain the
services of the pharmacist, whose personal relationship with the customers
generally maximizes the retention rate of the purchased file. Since 1995, the
Company has experienced an estimated 80% customer retention rate with respect
to prescription files acquired. Presently, there are approximately 1,400
independent pharmacies in New York City, and the Company believes that these
stores will provide additional acquisition opportunities in the future.

                The Company's pharmacies employ computer systems that link all
of the Company's pharmacies and enable them to provide customers with a broad
range of services. The Company's pharmacy computer network profiles customer
medical and other relevant information, supplies customers with information
concerning their drug purchases for income tax and insurance purposes and
prepares prescription labels and receipts. The computer network also expedites
transactions with Third Party Plans by electronically transmitting prescription
information directly to the Third Party Plan and providing on-line
adjudication, which confirms at the time of sale customer eligibility,
prescription coverage and pricing and co-payment requirements and automatically
bills the respective plan. On-line adjudication reduces losses from rejected
claims and eliminates a portion of the Company's paperwork for billing and
collection of receivables and costs associated therewith.

                Store Operations. The majority of the Company's stores are
located in the business and residential areas of Manhattan, the most densely
populated area in the United States. The Company's operations have been
tailored to handle high-volume customer traffic. During 1997, an average Duane
Reade store served approximately 2,500 customers per weekday, and 700 customers
during each of the peak lunch and commuting periods of the day. Some of the
Company's stores may operate up to 25 registers during peak demand periods.

                Duane Reade stores range in size from 2,600 to 12,300 square
feet, with an average of 6,900 square feet. The Company's stores are designed
to facilitate customer movement and to minimize inventory shrink. The Company
believes that its wide, straight aisles and well-stocked shelves allow
customers to find merchandise easily and allow the store's employees (managers,
security guards, cashiers and stock clerks) to effectively monitor customer
behavior. The Company attempts to group merchandise logically in order to
enable customers to locate items quickly and to stimulate impulse purchases.

                In 1996, the Company began planogramming its stores by using a
computerized space management system to design each store's layout and product
displays. The system seeks to maximize productivity per square foot of selling
space, maintain consistency in merchandising and reduce inventory levels. To
date, 52 stores have been designed by the system. Management believes that the
Company's remaining stores will be planogrammed by the end of the second
quarter of 1998. As a result, the Company believes that it has yet to realize
the full benefits from this system.

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

                The Company establishes each store's hours of operation in an
attempt to best serve customer traffic patterns and purchase habits and to
optimize store labor productivity. Stores in Manhattan's business districts are
generally open five days a week. In residential and appropriate
business/shopping districts, stores are open six or seven days a week with a
heavy emphasis on convenient, early morning and late evening openings. In 1997,
the Company had seven stores which were open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
The Company intends to continue to identify stores in which extended operating
hours would improve customer service and convenience and contribute to the
Company's profitability. Each store is supervised by one store manager and one
or more assistant store managers. Stores are supplied by deliveries from the
Company's warehouses in Queens an average of three times a week, allowing the
stores to maintain a high in-stock position, maximize store selling space and
minimize inventory required to be held on hand.

                The Company attempts to mitigate inventory shrink through (i)
the employment of full time security guards in each store, (ii) use of a
state-of-the-art Electronic Article Surveillance ("EAS") system that detects
unremoved EAS tags on valuable or easily concealed merchandise and (iii)
merchandise delivery and stocking during non-peak hours. Additionally, all
store and warehouse employees are trained to monitor inventory shrink, and the
Company uses outside consulting services to monitor employee behavior.
Recently, the Company hired a full-time team of loss prevention professionals
and established an anonymous call-in line to allow employees to report
instances of theft. The Company also instituted ongoing audits of warehouse
picking and receiving and an anonymous reward line for the reporting of theft.
The Company believes that these programs have enabled it to control inventory
shrink and will enable it to continue to do so.

                Purchasing and Distribution. The Company purchases
approximately 82% of its merchandise directly from manufacturers. The Company
distributes approximately 84% of its merchandise through the Company's
warehouses and receives direct-to-store deliveries for approximately 16% of its
purchases. Direct-to-store deliveries are made for some pharmaceuticals, 
greeting cards, photofinishing, convenience foods and beverages. The Company 
purchases from over 1,000 vendors. The Company believes that there are ample 
sources of supply for the merchandise currently sold in its stores. The 
Company manages its purchasing through a combination of forward buying, 
national buying and vendor discount ("deal") buying in ways in which it 
believes maximizes its buying power. For example, the Company uses a 
computerized forecasting and investment program that is designed to determine 
optimal forward buying quantities before an announced or anticipated price 
increase has been implemented. By forward buying, the Company stocks up on 
regularly carried items when manufacturers temporarily reduce the cost of 
goods or when a price increase has been announced or is anticipated.

                The Company currently operates two warehouses, which are
located within five miles of all but one of its stores. The Company's primary
warehouse contains approximately 150,000 square feet devoted to inventory. The
Company believes that the close proximity of the warehouses to the stores
allows the Company to supply the stores frequently, thereby minimizing
inventory and maximizing distribution economies. The Company also owns a fleet
of trucks and vans, which it uses for all deliveries from the warehouses to the
stores.

                In March 1998, the Company entered into a new long-term lease
for a 300,000 square foot distribution center in Long Island City, New York.
The facility will approximately double in the Company's distribution capacity
and is one mile away from the Company's current center. The new facility is
scheduled to open in mid-year 1998 and will replace the existing warehouses.

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION

                The Company regularly promotes key items at reduced retail
prices during four-week promotional periods. Store windows and in-store signs
are utilized to communicate savings and value to shoppers. Additionally, over
30 million bags with the highly recognizable Duane Reade logo are used by its
customers each year, helping to promote the Company's name throughout New York
City. The Company also utilizes full color circulars to announce new stores and
heavily circulates them in local areas to attract customers. Typically, a new
store sells one to two times its regular volume during a grand opening
promotion, which generally lasts two to three weeks. The Company generally does
not rely heavily on the use of print or broadcast media to promote its stores.
Rather, because of its many high-traffic locations, the Company typically
relies on in-window displays as its primary method of advertising. In 1997, the
Company began using radio advertising. The radio advertising focuses on the
Company's pharmacy business, highlighting services enhanced by the modern
pharmacy computer system, pharmacist accessibility and enhanced convenience

MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

                The Company currently has modern pharmacy and inventory
management information systems. In 1996, the Company completed the installation
of a host-based, modern pharmacy information system. The pharmacy system (PDX)
has reduced the processing time for electronic reimbursement approval for
prescriptions from Third Party Plan providers from 50 seconds to 7 seconds, and
the inventory management systems (JDA merchandising and E3 replenishment) have
allowed the Company to increase turns in the warehouse from 11 to 13 per year.
In early 1997, the Company began the process of installing its point of sale
(POS) systems in its stores,. The Company believes that these systems will
better allow the Company to better control pricing, inventory and shrink, while
maximizing the benefits derived from the other parts of its systems
installation program. POS will also provide sales analysis that will enable the
Company to improve labor scheduling, and will help optimize planogram design by
allowing detailed analysis of stock-keeping unit sales. The installation of the
Company's POS systems was completed in December 1997. Additionally, the Company
has upgraded its financial reporting systems and installed local and wide area
networks to facilitate the transfer of data between systems and from the stores
to headquarters.

                The Company has several computer software systems which will
require modification or upgrading to accommodate the year 2000 and thereafter.
The Company believes that all systems can be changed by the end of 1999 and
does not expect the cost of all the changes to be material to the Company's
financial condition or results of operations.

COMPETITION

                The Company's stores compete on the basis of, among other
things, convenience of location and store layout, product mix, selection,
customer service and price. The New York 


                                     -10-
<PAGE>

City drugstore market is highly fragmented due to the complexities and costs of
doing business in the most densely populated area of the country. The diverse
labor pool, local customer needs and complex real estate market in New York
City all favor regional chains and independents that are familiar with the
market. Duane Reade's store format is tailored to meet all of these
requirements and has proven successful in both the business and residential
neighborhoods of Manhattan.

                Because of the difficulties of operating in densely populated
areas, the New York City drugstore market remains under-penetrated by national
chains as compared to the rest of the country. Nationwide, approximately 74% of
the drugstore market is controlled by chains, while in New York City that
number is approximately 50%. There can be no assurance that such
underpenetration will continue.

                Duane Reade believes that it has significant competitive
advantages over the approximately 1,400 independent drugstores in New York
City, including purchasing economies of scale, centrally located warehouses
that minimize store inventory and maximize selling space, a full line of in
stock, brand name merchandise and a convenient store format. Major chain
competitors in the New York City market include Rite-Aid, Genovese and CVS.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

                Duane Reade's stores and its distribution facility are
registered with the federal U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and are subject to 
various state and local licensing requirements. Each of Duane Reade's 
pharmacies and pharmacists located in New York are licensed by the State of 
New York. The pharmacy and pharmacists employed at Duane Reade's store in 
Newark, New Jersey are licensed by the State of New Jersey. In addition, Duane 
Reade has been granted cigarette tax stamping licenses from the State of 
New York and from the City of New York which permit Duane Reade to buy 
cigarettes directly from the manufacturers and stamp the cigarettes themselves.
Duane Reade's stores possess cigarette tax retail dealers licenses issued by 
the State of New York, the City of New York and the State of New Jersey.

EMPLOYEES

                As of December 27, 1997, Duane Reade had approximately 2,000
employees, almost all of whom were full-time. Approximately 1,800 of the
Company's 2,000 employees are represented by unions. Non-union employees
include employees at corporate headquarters, employees at Duane Reade's
personnel office and store management. The distribution facility employees are
represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs and
Warehousemen and Helpers of America, Local 815, and all store employees are
represented by the Allied Trade Council. Duane Reade's three year contracts
with these two unions expire on August 31, 1999 and August 31, 1998,
respectively. Duane Reade believes that its relations with its employees are
good.

(1)      Refer to Note 12 of Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)      As used herein, "EBITDA" means net loss plus nonrecurring charges,
         interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and other non-cash
         items (primarily deferred rents). Management believes that EBITDA, as
         presented, represents a useful measure of assessing the performance of
         the Company's ongoing operating activities as it reflects the earnings
         trends of the Company without the impact of certain non-cash charges.
         Targets and positive trends in EBITDA are used as the performance
         measure for determining management's bonus compensation; EBITDA is
         also utilized by the Company's creditors in assessing debt covenant
         compliance. The Company understands that, while EBITDA is frequently
         used by security analysis in the evaluation of companies, it is not
         necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other
         companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of
         calculation. EBITDA is not intended as an alternative to cash flow
         from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, nor an
         alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's operating
         performance nor any other measure of performance in conformity with

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS.

         The following should be read in connection with the consolidated
financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto included elsewhere in
this document.

GENERAL

         The Company generates revenues primarily through sales of OTC drugs
and prescription pharmaceutical products, health and beauty aids, food and
beverage items, tobacco products, cosmetics, housewares, hosiery, greeting
cards, photofinishing, photo supplies and seasonal merchandise. Health and
beauty products, including OTC drugs, represent the largest of the Company's
product categories. The Company's primary costs and expenses consist of (i)
inventory costs, (ii) labor expenses and (iii) occupancy costs.

         In 1994 and 1995, the Company experienced rapid expansion, growing
from 40 stores to 59 stores. However, as a result of liquidity constraints and
the need for improved inventory controls, the Company was forced to suspend its
store expansion program in late 1995. In early 1996, a strengthened management
team led by Anthony Cuti, the Company's new Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, took several measures to improve operations such as decreasing out-of
stock occurrences, creating a loss prevention function to control inventory
shrink and continuing to invest in MIS.

         The Company had sales per square foot of $956 and $1,010 in fiscal
1996 and fiscal 1997, respectively. The Company believes that sales per square
foot are a useful measure of comparing the Company's performance to that of its
competitors because it is a measure of a store's sales productivity. The
Company experienced a decline in sales per square foot from 1993 through 1995
as a result of the opening of additional stores in connection with the
Company's expansion plans during that period. The opening of such additional
stores resulted in a decline in sales per square foot principally because (i)
the average square footage for the new stores was greater than that of the
existing store base and (ii) new stores generally take some time to reach a
mature level of sales. The Company currently expects that its sales per square
foot may decline as it embarks on its plan to increase new store openings
during 1998 and 1999. The Company believes that its competitors in the industry
experience increases and decreases in sales per square foot for similar
reasons.

         In 1997, the Company resumed its store expansion program, opening
seven stores. Generally a new Duane Reade store requires an investment of
approximately $1.1 million in capital expenditures and working capital. Since
1993, all of the Company's new stores have become profitable on an operating
basis within the first full year of operation. Over the next two years, the
Company plans to open approximately 30 to 40 stores, primarily in New York
City.

         Over the past two years, Third Party Plans, including managed care
providers and insurance companies, have comprised an increasing percentage of
the Company's pharmacy business as the health care industry shifts to managed
care. While sales to customers covered by 


                                     -17-
<PAGE>

Third Party Plans results in lower gross profit rates due to competitive
pricing, the Company believes that such lower rates are offset by increased
volume of pharmacy sales and the opportunity to leverage fixed expenses.

         The Company includes stores that have been in operation for at least
13 months for purposes of calculating comparable store sales figures.

         The Company's predecessor was founded in 1960. In 1992, Bain Capital
formed the Company to acquire the Company's predecessor from its founders
through a leveraged buyout, financed primarily with the proceeds from the Zero
Coupon Notes and the Senior Notes. In June 1997, investment funds affiliated
with DLJMBPII (the "DLJMB Entities"), an affiliate of DLJ, acquired
approximately 91.5% of the outstanding capital stock of the Company from Bain
Capital and certain other selling securityholders, for approximately $78.7
million in cash, pursuant to a Recapitalization Agreement, dated June 18, 1997
(the "Recapitalization Agreement"). Upon consummation of such purchase, the
Company reclassified all of its outstanding capital stock (then consisting of
four classes) into one class of common stock, $0.01 par value per share.

         Prior to the consummation of the Offering in February 1998, the
Company's primary asset was all of the outstanding common stock of Daboco,
Inc., a New York corporation ("Daboco"), with Daboco and DRI I, Inc. ("DRI"), a
direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Daboco, together owning all of the
outstanding partnership interest of Duane Reade, a New York general partnership
("Duane Reade") (Daboco owns a 99% partnership interest and DRI owns the
remaining 1% partnership interest). Substantially all of the operations of the
Company are conducted through Duane Reade. Concurrently with the consummation
of the Offering, Daboco was merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"),
resulting in the Company directly owning 99% of the partnership interests of
Duane Reade (the "Partnership Interests") and DRI continuing to own a 1%
partnership interest. Following the consummation of the Merger, the primary
assets of the Company are the Partnership Interest and 100% of the outstanding
common stock of DRI.

FISCAL 1997 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1996

         Net sales in 1997 were $429.8 million, an increase of 12.7% over 1996
net sales of $381.5 million. The increase was attributable to increased
comparable store sales of 7.6% and the inclusion of one new store opened during
1996 for the entire 1997 period and seven new stores opened in 1997.

         Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 75.0% for 1997
from 75.6% for 1996, resulting in an increase in gross profit margin to 25.0%
for 1997 from 24.4% during 1996. The increase in gross margin resulted from a
number of factors including (i) increased contribution from the sale of higher
margin merchandise such as cosmetics, vitamins, general merchandise, generic
drugs and private label products, (ii) higher promotional allowances received
from venders and (iii) occupancy costs that increased at a lesser rate than the
rate at which sales increased.

                Selling, general and administrative expenses were $65.4 million
or 15.2% of net sales and $59.0 million or 15.5% of net sales in 1997 and 1996,
respectively. The percentage decrease in 1997 compared to 1996 resulted
principally from lower general and administrative expense as a percentage of
net sales including the elimination of agreements requiring the annual payment
of $1.0 million in management fees to Bain Capital, partially offset by higher
selling expenses related to higher store salaries as a percentage of net sales
(principally from new stores during the early months of operation). The Company
believes, that as the Company's new stores mature, salaries will increase at a
lesser rate than store sales.

                  Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in 1997 and
1996 was $5.3 million and $16.2 million, respectively. The decrease in
amortization is principally a result of the completion in 1996 of amortization
of covenants not to compete and the related write-off of the balance of such
amounts during the fourth quarter of 1996.

                  Depreciation was $3.5 million and $3.0 million in 1997 and
1996, respectively.

                  Store pre-opening expenses increased to $0.8 million in 1997
from $0.1 in 1996 due to the opening of seven new store locations in 1997
compared to one in 1996.

                  Net interest expense was $34.5 million in 1997 compared to
$32.4 million in 1996. The increase in interest expense was principally due to
(i) higher non-cash accretion of the Zero Coupon Notes, (ii) interest related
to financing of third party accounts receivable and (iii) increased interest on
borrowings under the revolving credit facility, partially offset by (a) reduced
interest on term loan borrowings caused by the decrease in average balance from
$72.0 million for 1996 to $67.4 million for 1997 and a decrease in the average
interest rate from 9.1% to 8.7% and (b) reduced interest on capital lease
obligations.

                                     -19-
<PAGE>

                  The net loss for the Company decreased by $3.2 million from
$17.9 million in 1996 to $14.7 million in 1997 primarily as a result of an
increase in sales and gross profit margin and a reduction in amortization
expense, partially offset by nonrecurring charges (see Note 12 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company's EBITDA improved by $7.8
million or 22.0% to $43.1 million in 1997 compared to $35.3 million in 1996.
EBITDA as a percentage of sales increased to 10.0% in 1997 from 9.3% in 1996.

     FISCAL 1996 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1995

                  Net sales in 1996 were $381.5 million, an increase of 13.2%
over 1995 net sales of $336.9 million. The increase was due to increased
comparable store sales of 8.3% and the inclusion of eight stores opened during
1995 for the entire 1996 period and of one store opened in 1996. The increase
in comparable store sales was primarily attributable to increased pharmacy
sales, which increased to 21.8% of total sales in 1996 compared to 19.0% of
total sales in 1995.

                  Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 75.6%
for 1996 from 77.1% for 1995, resulting in an increase in gross profit margin
to 24.4% for 1996 from 22.9% for 1995. The increase in gross margin resulted
from a number of factors including (i) lower inventory shrink losses, (ii)
increased contribution from the sale of generic drugs and private label
products, (iii) less promotional activity and (iv) lower rent-to-sales ratios 
in stores opened during 1995 and 1994. The increases were partially offset by
lower gross margins resulting from sales to customers covered by Third Party
Plans.

                  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $59.0
million or 15.5% of net sales and $50.3 million or 14.9% of net sales in 1996
and 1995, respectively. The percentage increase in 1996 compared to 1995
resulted principally from higher administrative expenses, including (i)
operating costs related to the Company's management information systems
department, (ii) administrative salaries and one time executive search and
severance expenses and (iii) professional and consulting fees principally for
the warehouse and loss prevention areas. The increases were partially offset by
lower store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales primarily due to a
higher volume of pharmacy sales, which allows the Company to leverage other
fixed store operating expenses.

                  Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in 1995 and
1996 was $11.6 million and $16.2 million, respectively. The increase in
amortization was caused by an increase in the amortization of covenants not to
compete from $8.1 million in 1995 to $11.4 million in 1996 and amortization of
systems installation and integration costs in an amount of $1.4 million in
1996. The increase in amortization of covenants not to compete was caused by
the write-off of the balance of such intangibles in 1996 resulting from the
termination of the related agreements. Amortization of systems installation and
integration costs began in 1996.

                  The increase in depreciation from $1.9 million in 1995 to
$3.0 million in 1996 resulted principally from (i) depreciation of data
processing equipment which began in 1996 and (ii) a full year's depreciation in
1996 of assets of eight stores that were opened in 1995.

                                     -20-
<PAGE>

                  Store pre-opening expenses decreased from $1.1 million in
1995 to $0.1 million in 1996 due to the opening of one new store in 1996 
compared to eight in 1995.

                  Net interest expense increased 7.2% to $32.4 million in 1996
from $30.2 million in 1995. The increase in interest expense was principally
due to the higher non-cash accretion of the Zero Coupon Notes offset, in part,
by reduced interest on term loan borrowings resulting from the decrease in
average outstanding balance from $75.1 million to $72.0 million and a decrease
in the average interest rate from 9.5% to 9.1%.

                  The net loss for the Company decreased by $0.2 million or
1.1% from $18.1 million in 1995 to $17.9 million in 1996 primarily as a result
of increased sales and gross profit margin offset, in part, by increases in
selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangibles.
The Company's EBITDA increased by $7.9 million or 28.6% to $35.3 million in
1996 compared to $27.4 million in 1995. EBITDA as a percentage of sales
increased to 9.3% in 1996 from 8.2% in 1995.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

                  On September 30, 1997, the Company entered into the Old
Credit Agreement, which provided for, among other things, $65.5 million
of term loans and up to $30.0 million of revolving loans. As of December 27,
1997, outstanding balances thereunder totaled $89.8 million. The Company
utilizes cash flow from operations, together with borrowings under the
revolving portion of the Old Credit Agreement, to fund working capital
needs, investing activities (consisting primarily of capital expenditures) and
financing activities (normal debt service requirements, interest payments and
repayment of term and revolving loans outstanding).

                  In February 1998, the Company successfully completed an
initial public offering of its stock which was part of a plan to refinance all
of the Company's existing indebtedness (the "Refinancing Plan") in order to
enhance the Company's financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities and
implement capital improvements. The Refinancing Plan resulted in a reduction in
the Company's overall indebtedness, a simplification of the Company's capital
structure and access to additional borrowings. The principal components of the
Refinancing Plan were; (i) the sale by the Company of 6.7 million shares of
common stock for net proceeds of approximately $102 million; (ii) the execution
of a new secured credit agreement (the "Existing Credit Agreement") which
provides for borrowings up to approximately $160 million ($130 million of term
loans and up to $30 million of revolving loans); (iii) the issuance of $80
million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1/4% Senior Subordinated
Notes due 2008 (the "Senior Notes") for net proceeds of approximately 
$77 million; (iv) the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the 
Old Credit Agreement, the outstanding principal amount of which was 
$89.8 million as of December 27, 1997; (v) the redemption of the
Company's outstanding Zero Coupon Notes; (vi) the redemption of the Company's
outstanding 12% Senior Notes due 2002; and the (vii) Merger of Daboco with and
into the Company. The Company believes the Refinancing Plan will result in a
reduction in overall interest expense because total interest expense associated
with the Existing Credit Agreement and the New Senior 


                                     -21-
<PAGE>

Subordinated Notes will be less than the total interest expense associated with
the 12% Senior Notes due 2002 and the Zero Coupon Notes. The interest rates
under the Existing Credit Agreement will be approximately the same as interest
rates under the Old Existing Credit Agreement.

                  Working capital was $37.5 million and $9.9 million as of
December 27, 1997 and December 28, 1996, respectively The increase is primarily
due to the Company's investing in forward-buy inventory and increases in
inventory related to the opening of additional stores in the first quarter or
1998. The Company's capital requirements primarily result from opening and
stocking new stores and from the continuing development of new MIS. The
Company's ability to open stores in 1996 was limited to a certain degree by
liquidity considerations. The Company believes that there are significant
opportunities to open additional stores, and currently plans to open 30 to 40
stores in the next two years. The Company expects to spend approximately $16
million in 1998 on capital expenditures primarily for new and replacement
stores. Working capital is also required to support inventory for the Company's
existing stores. Historically, the Company has been able to lease its store
locations The Company has experienced a significant increase in accounts
receivable due to increased pharmacy sales in connection with Third Party
Plans, as compared to non-Third Party Plan sales which are generally paid by
cash or credit card. However, the Company believes that it has adequately
provided for liquidity by entering into a non-recourse factoring arrangement
whereby the Company resells accounts receivable associated with Third Party
Plans.

                  For the fiscal year ended December 28, 1996, net cash
provided by operating activities was $12.6 million, compared to $6.7 million
for the fiscal year ended December 30, 1995. The primary reasons for this
increase relate to an increase in operating earnings before the amortization of
goodwill and other intangibles, depreciation and amortization of property and
equipment and interest expenses, partially offset by a decrease in working
capital primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable. For the fiscal year
ended December 28, 1996, net cash used in investing activities was $3.8
million, compared to $12.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 30,1995.
This reduction primarily resulted form a decrease in capital expenditures and
decreases in systems development costs. For the fiscal year ended December 28,
1996, net cash used in financing activities was $10.7 million, compared to $4.8
million provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended December 30,
1995. This reduction primarily resulted from decreased borrowings under the
Company's then existing credit facility and a decrease in capital lease
financing.

                  For the fiscal year ended December 27, 1997, net cash used in
operating activities was $3.8 million, compared to $12.6 million provided by
operating activities during the fiscal year ended December 28, 1996. The
primary reasons for this decrease are (i) an increase in inventory and (ii) an
increase in accounts receivable due to increased pharmacy sales in connection
with Third Party Plans. The Company's significant increase in inventory
resulted from management's decision to take advantage of a number of forward
purchasing opportunities, accumulate inventory in advance of additional store
openings and seasonal inventory buildup during 1997. The Company believes that
the activities did not and will not materially adversely affect its liquidity.

<PAGE>

activities was $12.4 million, compared to $3.8 million for the fiscal year
ended December 28, 1996. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in
capital expenditures during 1997 partially offset by a decrease in systems
development costs. For the fiscal year ended December 27, 1997, net cash
provided by financing activities was $16.2 million, compared to $10.7 million
used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended December 28, 1996. This
increase primarily resulted from borrowings under the Old Credit Agreement 
which provided for a term loan of $65.5 million and borrowings of 
$24.5 million on a revolving credit facility of $30 million. These proceeds 
were used to repay the outstanding term loan balance of $69.5 million and 
the revolving loan balance of $2.5 million.

                  Leases for seven of the Company's stores that generated
approximately 10.7% of the Company's net sales for the fiscal year ended
December 27, 1997 are scheduled to expire before the end of the year 2000. The
Company believes that it will be able to renew such leases on economically
favorable terms or, alternatively, find other economically attractive locations
to lease.

                  As of December 27, 1997, approximately 1,800 of the Company's
approximately 2,000 employees were represented by various labor unions and were
covered by collective bargaining agreements. Pursuant to the terms of such
collectively bargaining agreements, the Company is required to pay certain
annual increases in salary and benefits to such employees. The Company does not
believe that such increases will have a material impact on the Company's
liquidity or results of operations.

                  Following the implementation of the Refinancing Plan, the
Company believes that, based on current levels of operations and anticipated
growth, cash flow from operations, together with other available sources of
funds, including borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement, will be 
adequate for at least the next two years to make required payments of 
principal and interest on the Company's indebtedness, to fund anticipated 
capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to comply with the 
terms of its debt agreements. The ability of the Company to meet its debt 
service obligations and reduce its total debt will be dependent upon the future
performance of the Company and its subsidiaries which, in turn, will be subject
to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory
and other conditions, many of which are beyond the Company's control. In
addition, there can be no assurance that the Company's operating results, cash
flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of its indebtedness
in the future. Substantially all of the Company's borrowings under the Existing
Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates; therefore, the Company's
financial condition will be affected by the changes in prevailing interest
rates. The Company expects to enter into interest rate protection agreements to
minimize the impact from a rise in interest rates.

TAX BENEFITS FROM NET OPERATING LOSSES

                                     -23-
<PAGE>

                  At December 27, 1997, the Company had net operating loss
carryforwards ("NOLs") of approximately $71.0 million, which are due to expire
in the years 2007 through 2012. These NOLs may be used to offset future taxable
income through 2012 and thereby reduce or eliminate the Company's federal
income taxes otherwise payable. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), imposes significant limitations on the utilization of NOLs in the
event of an "ownership change," as defined in Section 382 of the Code (the
"Section 382 Limitation"). The Section 382 Limitation is an annual limitation
on the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs that a corporation may use to offset
its post-ownership change income. The Section 382 Limitation is calculated by
multiplying the value of a corporation's stock immediately before an ownership
change by the long-term tax-exempt rate (as published by the Internal Revenue
Service). Generally, an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation
if the aggregate increase in the percentage of stock ownership (by value) of
that corporation by one or more 5% shareholders (including certain groups of
shareholders who in the aggregate own at least 5% of that corporation's stock)
exceeds 50 percentage points over a three-year testing period. The
Recapitalization caused the Company to experience an ownership change. As a
result, the Company currently is subject to an annual Section 382 Limitation of
approximately $5.0 million on the amount of NOLs generated prior to the
Recapitalization that the Company may utilize to offset future taxable income.
In addition, the Company believes that it will generate approximately $42.0
million of NOLs in connection with the Refinancing Plan. Such NOLs will not be
subject to the Section 382 Limitation and may be utilized to offset future
taxable income. However, there can be no assurance that any NOLs will be able
to be utilized by the Company to offset future taxable income or that such NOLs
will not become subject to limitation due to future ownership changes

YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE

                  The Company has several computer software systems which will
require modification or upgrading to accommodate the year 2000 and thereafter.
The Company believes that all systems can be changed by the end of 1999 and
does not expect the cost of the changes to be material to the Company's
financial condition or results of operations.

SEASONALITY

                  In general, sales of drugstores items such as prescription
drugs, OTC drugs and health and beauty care products exhibit limited
seasonality in the aggregate, but do vary by product category. Quarterly
results are primarily affected by the timing of new store openings and the sale
of seasonable products. In view of the Company's recent expansion of seasonal
merchandising, the Company expects slightly greater revenue sensitivity
relating to seasonality in the future.

INFLATION

                  The Company believes that inflation has not had a material
impact on results of operations for the Company during the three years ended
December 27 1997.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

<PAGE>

                  In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share," which requires the presentation of
basic and diluted earnings per share in a company's financial statements for
reporting periods ending subsequent to December 15, 1997. As of December 27, 
1997, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 1.65 million
shares of Common Stock, which shares are not included in the 
calculation of earnings per share for the 52 weeks ended December 27, 1997 
and would not be included in such calculation under the guidance prescribed 
by SFAS No. 128 because of the anit-dilutive nature of these instruments.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTS

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Duane Reade Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity/(deficiency) and
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Duane Reade Inc. (formerly known as Duane Reade Holding Corp.) and its 
subsidiaries at December 27, 1997 and December 28, 1996 and the results of 
their operations and their cash flows for each of the 52 week periods ended 
December 27, 1997, December 28, 1996 and December 30, 1995 in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express 
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our 
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing 
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management 
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that 
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

1.   ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Duane Reade Inc. (the "Company") was formed on June 16, 1992 for the
     purpose of acquiring Daboco, Inc. ("Daboco"). The acquisition took place
     on September 25, 1992. Daboco and Duane Reade Inc. ("DR Inc."), a
     subsidiary of Daboco, are general partners in Duane Reade, which operates
     a chain of retail drug stores (67 at December 27, 1997) in the New York
     City area.

     Also in June 1997 the Company entered into a recapitalization agreement 
     (Note 10). 

     Significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the 
     consolidated financial statements are as follows:

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include
     the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany 
     transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain prior period 
     amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.

     REPORTING YEAR: The fiscal year for the Company is the 52/53 week
     reporting period ending on the last Saturday in December.

     RECEIVABLES: Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from various
     insurance companies and governmental agencies under third party payment
     plans for prescription sales and amounts due from vendors, a majority of
     which relate to promotional programs. The Company has not provided an
     allowance for doubtful accounts as its historical write-offs have been
     immaterial. The Company reflects promotional allowances from vendors as
     income when such allowances are earned. The carrying value of the 
     Company's receivables approximate fair value given the short-term maturity
     of these financial instruments.

     INVENTORIES AND COST OF SALES: Substantially all inventories are stated at
     the lower of cost, determined pursuant to the last-in, first-out retail
     dollar value method (LIFO), or market. When appropriate, provision is made
     for obsolete, slow-moving or damaged inventory. If current cost had been
     used, inventories at December 27, 1997 and December 28, 1996 would not be
     materially different from the amounts reflected on the accompanying
     balance sheets.

     Cost of sales includes distribution and occupancy costs.

     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: Property and equipment are stated at cost.
     Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method
     over estimated useful lives of assets as follows:

     Buildings and improvements ...........30 years
     Furniture, fixtures and equipment ....5-10 years

     Leasehold improvements ...............Life of lease or, if shorter, asset
     Property under capital leases ........7 years

     OTHER ASSETS: Deferred financing costs arose in connection with borrowings
     under the Term Loan and with the issuance of the Senior Subordinated 
     Notes and the Zero Coupon Notes and are amortized using the straight-line
     method, the results of which are not materially different from the 
     interest method, over the term of the respective debt issue. Deferred 
     financing costs which arose in connection with the September 30, 1997 
     credit agreement are amortized utilizing the interest method, over the 
     term of the debt. Deferred financing costs which arose in connection 
     with the Old Credit Agreement are amortized utilizing the interest 
     method over the term of the debt.

     Systems development costs, consisting principally of costs relating to the
     new management information systems, are amortized using the straight-line
     method commencing in 1996 over a period of seven years.

     INTANGIBLE ASSETS: In September 1992, Holdings and Duane Reade entered
     into agreements with certain former members of management of Duane Reade,
     former shareholders of Daboco and shareholders of former partners of Duane
     Reade (collectively, the "Group") precluding such persons from competing
     with the operations of Duane Reade for a period of five years. The
     covenants not to compete were recorded at acquisition cost and were being
     amortized over the period of benefit using an accelerated method. During
     the first quarter of 1997, Holdings and Duane Reade entered into
     agreements in which the Company received consideration from the Group to
     terminate the non-compete agreements. In accordance with APB Opinion No.
     17, Intangible Assets, the remaining carrying value of the non-compete
     agreements of $4.86 million as of December 28, 1996 was written off and
     has been included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations
     as amortization expense.

     Goodwill is amortized on the straight-line method over 40 years. The
     carrying value of goodwill is periodically reviewed and evaluated by the
     Company based principally on its expected future undiscounted operating
     cash flows. Should such evaluation result in the Company concluding that
     the carrying amount of goodwill has been impaired, an appropriate
     write-down would be made.

     PRE-OPENING EXPENSES: Store pre-opening costs, other than capital
     expenditures, are expensed when incurred.

     INCOME TAXES: Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method
     prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109.

     RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS: The Financial Accounting Standards
     Board (FASB) has issued several accounting pronouncements which the
     company will be required to adopt in future periods.

     FASB Statement No. 130 "Reporting Comprehensive Income," which the Company
     will adopt during the first quarter of 1998, establishes standards for
     reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in
     financial statements. Comprehensive income generally represents all
     changes in shareholders' equity except those resulting from investments by
     or distributions to shareholders. With the exception of net earnings, such
     changes are generally not significant to the Company and the adoption of
     Statement No. 130, including the required comparative presentation for
     prior periods, is not expected to have a material impact on the
     consolidated financial statements.

     FASB Statement No. 131 "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
     Related Information" requires that a publicly-held company report
     financial and descriptive information about its operating segments in the
     consolidated financial statements issued to shareholders for interim and
     annual periods. In addition, the Statement also requires additional
     disclosures with respect to products and services, geographic areas of
     operation, and major customers which have not previously been presented in
     the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The Company will
     adopt Statement No. 131 in 1998.

     ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in
     conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
     management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
     amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
     liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
     amounts of revenues, costs and expenses during the reporting period.
     Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE: Net loss per common share is based on the
     weighted average shares outstanding during each period (10,160,851 for the
     52 weeks ended December 27, 1997; 10,103,186 for the 52 weeks ended 
     December 28, 1996 and 10,177,782 for the 52 weeks ended December 30, 
     1995). The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 128 
     "Earnings per Share" in 1997. Basic earnings per share is computed based 
     on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the 
     period. Diluted earnings per share gives effect to all dilutive potential 
     common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares 
     include shares issuable upon exercise of the Company's stock options.

     Potential common shares relating to options to purchase common stock were
     not included in the weighted average number of shares for the fiscal years
     1997, 1996 and 1995 because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

</TABLE>

     Amounts presented above are classified based upon their scheduled
maturity dates. As noted below, all amounts were repaid during the first 
quarter of 1998 in connection with the Company's Existing Credit Agreement and
the issuance of Common Stock and Senior Notes.


                                      -34-
<PAGE>




     (A)      Outstanding balances under a credit agreement dated as of
              September 24, 1992, as amended, with a syndicate of lending
              institutions bear interest at floating rates, which at December
              27, 1997 averaged 8.9%. On September 30, 1997, the Company
              entered into a credit agreement (the "Old Credit Agreement")
              with an affiliate of the DLJMB Entities and various financial 
              institutions providing for a term loan of $65.5 million and 
              a revolving credit facility of $30 million. Proceeds of the 
              term loan were used to repay outstanding term loans 
              ($63.5 million) and revolving loans ($2 million).

              The term loan is payable in quarterly installments of $165,000
              from December 1997 through March 2001, with additional payments
              as outlined in schedule below. The balance of the term loan at
              December 27, 1997 of $65.3 million reflects the above amount less
              the first quarterly payment made in December. As of December 27,
              1997, the borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit
              facility were $24.5 million (classified as a noncurrent
              liability); in addition, $285,000 in letters of credit had been
              issued.

              At December 27, 1997, the aggregate principal amount of the term
              loan matures as follows (in thousands):

              1998..............................          $       660
              1999..............................                  660
              2000..............................                  660
              2001..............................               31,495
              2002..............................               31,835
                                                    ------------------
                                                          $    65,310
                                                    ==================



              Subject to certain conditions, voluntary prepayments of the Term
              Loan are permitted without premium or penalty. Mandatory
              prepayments are required with respect to asset sales, permitted
              issuance of debt or equity and 75% of excess cash flows, as
              defined in the Credit Agreement, as amended.

              Obligations under the Old Credit Agreement are secured by a 
              pledge of all of Duane Reade's tangible and intangible assets 
              and are guaranteed by the Company, which has pledged 100% of 
              its partnership interests in support of such guarantees. The 
              guarantees are joint and several and full and unconditional. 
              The Old Credit Agreement contains restrictions on indebtedness, 
              asset sales, dividends and other distributions, capital 
              expenditures, transactions with affiliates and other unrelated 
              business activities. Financial performance covenants include 
              interest coverage, leverage ratio, minimum net worth and
              fixed charge coverage. At December 27, 1997, the Company is in
              compliance with all of the covenants in the Old Credit Agreement.

     (B)      On September 25, 1992, Duane Reade issued $90,000,000 aggregate
              principal amount of 12% Senior Notes due September 15, 2002, at
              face value. Interest is payable at 12% semiannually. The Senior
              Notes are guaranteed by Daboco and DR Inc. All of Daboco's assets
              are pledged to secure indebtedness under the Credit Agreement
              discussed in (A) above. As a result, such indebtedness will have
              claim on those assets that is prior to the claim of holders of
              the Senior Notes. To the extent that the amount of senior
              indebtedness exceeds the value of the collateral securing such
              indebtedness, the Senior Notes will rank pari passu with the Term
              Loans.

              Duane Reade is required to make a sinking fund payment on
              September 15, 2001 sufficient to retire 50% of the aggregate
              principal amount of Senior Notes originally issued. The Senior
              Notes are subject to redemption at the option of the issuer at
              104.5% of par, plus accrued interest, at the end of 1997,
              declining to par, plus accrued interest, at the end of 2000. In
              the event of a change in control, Duane Reade shall be obligated
              to make an offer to purchase all outstanding Senior Notes at a
              repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount.

     (C)      On September 25, 1992, Holdings issued $123,380,000 aggregate
              principal amount of 15% Senior Subordinated Zero Coupon Notes due
              September 15, 2004 (the "Zero Coupon Notes"), net of an
              $81,909,000 discount. The discount accretes through the Final
              Accretion Date of September 15, 1999. Thereafter, cash interest
              is payable at 15% semi-annually through maturity. Interest
              expense is determined using the effective interest method, which
              applies a constant yield to carrying value over the life of the
              Zero Coupon Notes.

              The Credit Agreement and the Senior Note Indenture referred to in
              (A) and (B) above provide for subordination of Holdings' debt to
              partnership debt.

              The notes are redeemable at the option of the issuer, in whole or
              in part, at 107.5% of Accreted Value (as defined in the Zero
              Coupon Note Indenture), plus accrued interest, at the end of 1997
              declining to par, plus accrued interest, at the end of 2002. In
              the event of a change in control, Holdings shall be obligated to
              make an offer to purchase all outstanding Zero Coupon Notes at a
              repurchase price of 101% of Accreted Value (as defined in the
              Indenture) or principal amount, as applicable. The Accreted Value
              of the Zero Coupon Notes was $96,400,000 at December 27, 1997.

              Purchasers of the Zero Coupon Notes received 15% of the fully
              diluted common stock of the Company, with registration rights, 
              for aggregate consideration of $3,529,000.

              The Indentures governing the Zero Coupon Notes and the Senior
              Notes include certain restrictive covenants. Subject to certain
              exceptions, the Indentures restrict transactions with affiliates,
              the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the payment of
              dividends, the creation of liens, certain asset sales, mergers
              and consolidations and certain other payments.

              The Company's debt is thinly traded in the market place.
              Accordingly, management is unable to determine fair market values
              for such debt at December 27, 1997.

              The Zero Coupon Notes and the Senior Notes were issued pursuant
              to Registration Rights Agreements under which Holdings and Duane
              Reade consummated registered exchange offers pursuant to which
              Holdings and Duane Reade exchanged the Zero Coupon Notes and the
              Senior Notes, respectively, for identical notes which have been
              registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

     In connection with the Company's new Credit Agreement (the "Existing
     Credit Agreement") issuance of common stock and Senior Notes in 
     February 1998, all outstanding amounts under (A), (B) and (C) above 
     were repaid in full (see Note 15).

5.   CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS

     As of December 27, 1997, the present value of capital lease obligations
     was $5.8 million (of which $1.9 million was payable during the next twelve
     months). Such obligations are payable in monthly installments over three
     to five year periods and bear interest at an average rate of 12.8%.

     The Company deducted for income tax purposes for the period September 25
     to December 31, 1992 approximately $88 million of payments made to former
     partners of Duane Reade (the "Retirement Payments"). Approximately $22.2
     million of the valuation allowance relates to the Retirement Payments.
     The Retirement Payments and other current tax deductions resulted in an
     available net operating loss of approximately $68.6 million which may be
     used to offset future taxable income of the Company through 2012. Due to
     the nature of the Retirement Payments, future reductions in that portion
     of the valuation allowance related to the Retirement Payments will be
     credited to goodwill. Further, due to the change in ownership arising as a
     result of the recapitalization, certain income tax law provisions apply 
     which limit the ability of the Company to utilize the available net 
     operating loss carryforwards. It is estimated that the annual limitation 
     will be $5.1 million.

8.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     LEASES

     Duane Reade leases all of its store facilities under operating lease 
     agreements expiring on various dates through the year 2022. In addition 
     to minimum rentals, certain leases provide for annual increases based 
     upon real estate tax increases, maintenance cost increases and inflation. 
     Rent expense for the 52 weeks ended December 27, 1997, December 28, 1996 
     and December 30, 1995 was $26,587,000, $24,420,000 and $22,703,000,
     respectively.

     LITIGATION

     The Company from time to time is involved in routine legal matters
     incidental to its business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate
     resolution of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
     Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

     MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS

     The Company has employment agreements with several of its executives
     providing, among other things, for employment terms of up to three years.
     Pursuant to the terms of such employment and related agreements, the
     Company and various executives entered into agreements pursuant to which
     (i) executives' salary and bonuses were established and (ii) executives
     purchased shares of common stock. In the event of employment termination, 
     all of the stock may be repurchased by the Company. As a result of the 
     recapitalization and the reverse stock split (Note 10), all outstanding 
     shares were converted into common stock. As of December 27, 1997, an 
     aggregate 287,578 shares of common stock are held by employees and former 
     employees.

     COMMITMENTS

     The Company has established a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 
     ("SERP") which presently covers only its Chairman. Such SERP provides 
     for vesting over a twenty year period. However, if the Chairman's 
     employment is terminated without cause, as defined, or if the Chairman 
     resigns with cause, as defined, such vesting becomes immediate, in which 
     event the Company would be liable to the Chairman (in addition to amounts 
     accrued in the financial statements) in the amount of approximately 
     $700,000.

     The Company is subject to a loan agreement between the Company, certain of
     the DLJMB Entities and an executive of the Company whereby the Company
     has an obligation to assume a $1 million loan made to said executive, 
     should certain of the DLJMB Entities elect. At December 27, 1997, the 
     such DLJMB Entities have not exercised such election.

9.   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     On October 12, 1992, the Company adopted the 1992 Stock Option Plan of
     Duane Reade Holding Corp. (the "Plan"). Under the Plan, a committee
     designated by the Board of Directors to administer the Plan (the
     "Committee") may grant, to executive and other key employees of the
     Company, nonqualified stock options to purchase up to an aggregate of
     510,757 (adjusted for the recapitalization--See Note 10--and the reverse
     stock split--see Note 15) shares of common stock of the Company at an
     exercise price fixed by the Committee. The options are exercisable at such
     time or times as the Committee determines at or subsequent to grant. The
     term of the options set by the Committee shall not exceed 10 years.

     At December 27, 1997, there were outstanding nonqualified stock options to
     purchase up to an aggregate of 635,207 (adjusted for the recapitalization 
     and the reverse stock split, Note 10) shares of common stock (including 
     options granted outside the Plan), all of which are vested.

     Changes in options outstanding (including options granted outside the
     Plan) during 1997 and 1996 are summarized as follows:

     Participation Plan under which options for a total of 1,321,181 (adjusted
     for the recapitalization and the reverse stock split, Note 10) shares of 
     common stock of the Company may be granted to employees, consultants and 
     non-employee directors of the Company if the Company meets specific 
     performance targets. At December 27, 1997, options for 1,019,284 shares 
     have been granted to employees.

     As permitted, the Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
     25 and related Interpretations in accounting for its stock-based
     compensation plan. Had compensation cost for the Company's stock-based
     compensation plan been determined based on the fair value at the grant
     dates for awards under the Plan, consistent with the alternative method of
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for
     Stock-Based Compensation," the proforma effect on the Company's net loss 
     for the 52 weeks ended December 27, 1997 and December 28, 1996 would have 
     been less than $100,000 and $200,000, respectively. The proforma 
     compensation expense for stock options has been estimated using the 
     Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
     dividend yield of 0.0%, expected volatility of 60.0%, risk free interest
     rate of 6.0% and an expected term of 8 years. These proforma disclosures
     may not be representative of the effects on reported net income for future
     years since options vest over several years and options granted prior to
     1995 are not considered.

     The Company maintains an employee savings plan pursuant to Section 401(k)
     (the "401(k) Plan") of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") which covers
     substantially all non-union employees other than key employees as defined
     by IRC. Eligible participating employees may contribute up to 10% of their
     pretax salaries, subject to certain IRC limitations. The 401(k) Plan, as
     amended, provides for employer matching provisions at the discretion of
     the Company (to a maximum of 1% of pretax salaries) and has a feature
     under which the Company may contribute additional amounts for all eligible
     employees. The Company's policy is to fund such costs under the 401(k)
     Plan as accrued. For the 52 weeks ended December 27, 1997 and December 28,
     1996, there were no employer contributions to the 401(k) Plan. For the 52
     weeks ended December 30, 1995, employer contributions to the 401(k) Plan
     were $166,000.

     Duane Reade is under contract with local unions to contribute to
     multi-employer pension and welfare benefit plans for certain of its
     employees. For the 52 weeks ended December 27, 1997, December 28, 1996 and
     December 30, 1995, contributions to such plans were $6,751,000, $5,783,000
     and $5,200,000, respectively.

10.  RECAPITALIZATION

     During June 1997, the Company entered into a recapitalization agreement
     (the "Agreement") with its stockholders ("Stockholders") and certain
     investors ("Investors"). The Agreement provided for (i) the purchase by
     Investors from the Stockholders of substantially all their stock holdings
     in the Company, (ii) a conversion of all of the outstanding shares of the
     Company into a newly authorized class of Class B Common stock and (iii)
     the creation of a new authorized class of preferred stock which will carry
     the rights and preferences granted by the Company's Board of Directors
     when issued.


                                     -42-
<PAGE>

     Shares were converted as follows:

                                               
                                               
                                                           Approximate      
                   Prior Class                           Conversion Rate    
                   -----------                           ----------------
     Common and Common Class A  .........................         28/1
     Common Class P and Common Class P-1 ................        355/1

     In addition, because of the change in control, the Company was obligated
     to and made offers to repurchase all outstanding Senior Notes and Zero
     Coupon Notes at 101% of the principal amount or accreted value thereof,
     respectively. Such offers expired on September 12, 1997. The Company
     repurchased an aggregate of $107,000 principal amount of Senior Notes and
     $9,000 of Zero Coupon Notes pursuant to the offers.

     These financial statements do not reflect any adjustments as a result of
     the June 1997 change in control.

     On January 14, 1998, the Company effected an 8.326 reverse stock split of
     its common stock. All references to common stock amounts, shares and per
     share data included herein have been adjusted to give retroactive effect
     to such reverse stock split.

11.  NONRECURRING CHARGES

     During the first quarter of 1997, the Company considered a public offering
     of its common stock and took certain steps in connection with these plans.
     Such plans were abandoned upon consummation of the transaction discussed
     in Note 10.

     Costs and expenses incurred in connection with the abandoned public
     offering, the recapitalization and the exchange offers referred to in Note
     10 aggregated approximately $12.7 million, including investment banking
     fees of $7.7 million (including $3.5 million to an affiliate of the
     Investors and $0.6 million to the Stockholders), write-off of unamortized
     deferred financing costs relating to the old credit agreement of $1.8
     million, legal and accounting fees of $1.6 million, stand-by commitment
     fees relating to the exchange offers of $1.2 million to an affiliate of
     the Investors, and other costs of $0.4 million. The Company has treated
     these expenses as non-recurring because such expenses related to financing
     activities in connection with the Recapitalization and related events,
     which the Company does not expect to repeat.

12.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     In 1992, the Company and the then principal stockholder of the Company
     (who has subsequently sold most of its shares, Note 10) entered into a
     professional services agreement whereby consulting, advisory, financial
     and other services were provided at the Company's request, for a five year
     term. During the 52 weeks ended December 28, 1996 and December 30, 1995,
     such fees aggregated approximately $1.0 million.

     In addition, the Investors paid an executive approximately $0.8 million
     for advisory services rendered and a former executive approximately $1.6
     million for the repurchase and cancellation of exercisable stock options.
     The accompanying financial statements do not reflect such payments.

     Costs incurred in connection with the Old Credit Agreement aggregated 
     approximately $2.7 million (including a funding fee of $2.4 million to 
     an affiliate of the DLJMB Entities).

13.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     On February 13, 1998, the Company issued 6,700,000 shares of common stock 
     in an initial public offering for net proceeds of approximately $101.8
     million. In addition to the issuance of common stock, the Company entered
     into the Existing Credit Agreement which provides for borrowings of up to 
     approximately $160 million and issued $80 million of new Senior Notes. The
     net proceeds of the common stock and the sale of the Senior Notes and 
     borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement were used for the (i)
     redemption of all of the Zero Coupon Notes for $99.8 million (including a
     redemption premium of $7.0 million), (ii) redemption of all the Senior
     Notes for $93.9 million (including a redemption premium of $4.0 million),
     (iii) repayment of the outstanding term loan indebtedness of $65.3
     million, (iv) repayment of outstanding revolving indebtedness of $27.5
     million and (v) payment of fees and expenses in connection with the
     Company's refinancing plan.

     The early payment of the Zero Coupon and Senior Notes will result in an
     extraordinary loss of approximately $23.6 million in the first quarter of
     1998.

- ------------------
(1)    Except for 68,101 options grated to Mr. Tennant under a separate
       program, all of such options vest fully on the eighth anniversary of the
       grant date and may vet sooner based on the Company's achievement of
       certain specified targets.

(2)    Amounts reflect certain assumed rates of appreciation for the term of
       the option as set forth in the executive compensation disclosure rules
       of the Securities and Exchange Commission and are not intended to
       forecast future appreciation of the Common Stock. Actual gains, if any,
       on stock option exercises depend on future performance of the Company's
       stock and overall market conditions. For each Named Executive Officer
       other than Mr. Tennant, at an annual rate of appreciation of 5% per year
       for the option term, the price of the Common Stock would be
       approximately $13.57 per share as of the expiration date, and for Mr.
       Tennant such price would be approximately $12.62 per share. For each
       Named Executive Officer other than Mr. Tennant, at an annual rate of
       appreciation of 10% per year for the option term, the price of the
       Common Stock would be approximately $21.61 per share as of the
       expiration date, and for Mr. Tennant such price would be approximately
       $20.10 per share.

(3)    All of such options were granted under the Equity Plan (as defined
       below). The options granted under such plan are subject to repurchase
       provisions upon termination of employment. See "-- Stock Options."

(4)    68,101 of Mr. Tennant's options were granted pursuant to a separate
       program with the Company, and the remaining 47,292 options were granted
       pursuant to the Equity Plan.

(5)    Amounts for Mr. Tennant are calculated based on a weighted average exercise price of $7.75 per share.

                Mr. Barry Weston, the Company's former Chief Executive Officer,
resigned from the Company effective as of February 28, 1997. In connection with
Mr. Weston's severance from the Company and the Recapitalization, Mr. Weston
received approximately $1.6 million from DLJMB and all of his unexercised
options were effectively canceled. In addition, Mr. Weston received
approximately $412,000 from the Company during 1997, a portion of which was
attributable to his 1995 and 1996 bonus and the remainder of which was
attributable to severance payments.

         COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

                Directors of the Company who are employees of the Company, DLJ
or DLJMB or their respective subsidiaries are not compensated for serving as
directors. As of the date of their election to the Board of Directors, each of
Messrs. Roberg and Johnson received 5,000 options to purchase Common Stock at
$21.5625 per share. The Company plans to compensate future Directors who are
not employees of the Company, DLJ or DLJMB ("Non-Employee Directors") with
option grants for serving in such capacity and for serving on committees of the
Board of Directors and to reimburse Non-Employee Directors for out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in such capacity.

         COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

         Prior to the consummation of its initial public offering, the Company
did not have a compensation committee. Instead, compensation decisions
regarding the Company's executive officers were made by the Board of Directors.
Each executive officer of the Company has an 


                                     -51-
<PAGE>

employment agreement with the Company that establishes his annual compensation.
See "--Employment Agreements."

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

         Effective June 18, 1997, the Company entered into an employment
agreement with Anthony J. Cuti (the "Cuti Employment Agreement"). Pursuant to
the Cuti Employment Agreement, Mr. Cuti serves as Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer of the Company. The Cuti Employment Agreement provides for
(i) a base salary of $425,000 per year, which will increase to $500,000 in 1998
and $550,000 in 1999 if certain EBITDA targets (as defined in the Cuti
Employment Agreement) are met and will increase every 18 months commencing July
1, 2001 by not less than the percentage increase in a designated consumer price
index for such 18-month period, (ii) an annual incentive bonus of up to 200% of
base salary based on certain EBITDA targets and (iii) participation in all
benefit plans generally available to executive officers of the Company.

         Pursuant to the Cuti Employment Agreement and the Equity Plan
described below, on June 18, 1997, Mr. Cuti was granted non-qualified stock
options to purchase an aggregate of 496,569 shares of Common Stock at an
exercise price of $8.33 per share. Subject to Mr. Cuti's continued employment
with the Company, the options generally will become 100% vested on the eighth
anniversary of the date of grant, but may vest sooner based on the Company's
achievement of certain specified financial targets. Furthermore, the vesting of
options will accelerate upon the occurrence of a sale of the Company (as
defined in the Cuti Employment Agreement) on or prior to December 30, 2001,
based on the Company's achievement of specified financial targets prior to the
date of any such sale of the Company.

         The Cuti Employment Agreement provides that Mr. Cuti may generally 
only transfer up to 10% of his shares of Common Stock in each calendar year 
while he is an employee of the Company, except pursuant to certain rights and 
obligations (i) to transfer ("put") his shares to the Company upon termination 
of employment and (ii) to transfer shares in connection with certain transfers 
of Common Stock by DLJMBPII. The Cuti Employment Agreement also provides that 
Mr. Cuti will be given the opportunity to invest additional amounts in stock 
of the Company in the event that DLJMBPII invests new equity in the Company 
or creates an instrument that may be dilutive to Mr. Cuti's equity position 
relative to DLJMBPII.

         Mr. Cuti's initial term of employment is for three years and, unless
terminated by notice of non-renewal by either the Company or Mr. Cuti, will
continue thereafter for successive one-year periods. Pursuant to the Cuti
Employment Agreement, if the Company terminates Mr. Cuti without "cause" (as
defined in the Cuti Employment Agreement) or by notice of non-renewal or Mr.
Cuti resigns with "good reason" (as defined in the Cuti Employment Agreement),
Mr. Cuti will be entitled to continued base salary and incentive bonus payments
(at the rate of two times base salary and bonus for the year prior to
termination, which can be increased to three times base salary and bonus upon
the occurrence of certain events, including a sale of 


                                     -52-
<PAGE>

the Company) and employee benefits for a two year period, which, under certain
circumstances, including Mr. Cuti's termination of employment prior to June 18,
2003 and within one year following a Sale of the Company, may be extended by
one year. Additionally, the vesting of Mr. Cuti's options may accelerate upon
such a termination of employment, based on the Company's financial performance
prior to such termination and whether a Sale of the Company has occurred. The
Cuti Employment Agreement also contains certain non-compete, non-solicitation
and confidentiality provisions. See also "Certain Relationships and Related
Transaction-Cuti Loan Agreement."

         The Company has also entered into agreements with Messrs. Charboneau
and Ray and certain other executives that provide for their initial base salary
as well as annual incentive bonuses based on certain EBITDA targets. Mr.
Charboneau's employment agreement provides for an annual base salary of
$220,000 and for additional increases from time to time as the Company may
determine. Mr. Ray's employment agreement provides for an annual base salary of
$150,000 and for additional increases from time to time as the Company may
determine. Each of Messrs. Charboneau and Ray are entitled to severance
payments equalling 12 months of their respective salaries if they are
terminated without "cause" (as respectively defined in the agreements).

         The Company's agreement with Mr. Lacko provides for payment of an
annual base salary of $150,000 as well as for payment of annual incentive
bonuses based upon achievement of certain corporate and financial objectives.
Mr. Lacko's agreement also provides for the grant of stock options to acquire
an aggregate of 6,805 shares of Common Stock. These options vested on June 18,
1997 and have an exercise price of $8.33 per share. In addition, Mr. Lacko's
agreement provides for 12 months of salary continuation in the event Mr. Lacko
is terminated without cause.

         The Company's agreement with Mr. Tennant provides for payment of an
annual base salary of $175,000 per year as well as for payment of annual
incentive bonuses based upon achievements of certain financial targets. Mr.
Tennant's agreement also provides for the grant of stock options to acquire an
aggregate of 68,101 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $7.34 per
share. These options vested on June 18, 1997. The agreement also provides for
12 months of salary continuation in the event Mr. Tennant is terminated without
cause.

SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN

         The Company has established the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
("SERP"), an unfunded retirement plan that provides a lump sum benefit equal to
the actuarial present value of a life annuity commencing at the later of age 65
or termination of employment for any reason other than for "cause." The SERP
benefit is calculated as a percentage of a participant's Final Average Earnings
(defined as the average base salary and bonus for the five years which produce
the greatest amount multiplied by the participant's years of services with the
Company). Currently, Mr. Cuti is the only SERP participant. Mr. Cuti's
estimated SERP benefit, based on his annualized 1996 includable compensation
and upon discount rates effective for termination of employment in December
1997, is estimated to be $619,000, if termination of employment occurs after 10
years when Mr. Cuti will be age 60 1/2, or $1,263,000 if termination of
employment occurs after 14 1/2 years, when Mr. Cuti will be age 65. Pursuant to
the Cuti 


                                     -53-
<PAGE>

Employment Agreement, the Company is required to set aside funds in a "rabbi
trust" to pay Mr. Cuti's SERP benefit in specified circumstances, including a
sale of the Company, termination without "cause" and resignation for "good
reason" (as respectively defined in the Cuti Employment Agreement).
Furthermore, in the event of his termination without "cause" or by reason of
the Company's non-renewal, his resignation for "good reason," or his death or
disability, Mr. Cuti's SERP benefit will be calculated on the basis of 20 years
of employment regardless of his actual number of years of employment with the
Company (the present value of which was approximately $700,000 as of December
27, 1997).

STOCK OPTIONS

         1992 STOCK OPTION PLAN. The Board of Directors adopted and the
Company's stockholders approved the 1992 Stock Option Plan (the "1992 Plan") in
September 1992. Under the 1992 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to
executive and other key employees of the Company nonqualified stock options to
purchase up to an aggregate of 510,757 shares of Common Stock of the Company at
exercise prices and terms specified by the Board of Directors.

         At December 27, 1997, there were outstanding nonqualified stock
options issued under the 1992 Plan to purchase up to an aggregate of 281,657
shares of Common Stock of the Company at exercise prices ranging from $0.58 to
$40.88 per share. The 1992 Plan was frozen as to the future grants following
the initial public offering of the Company's Common Stock. All options issued
under the 1992 Plan are 100% vested.

         1997 EQUITY PARTICIPATION PLAN. As of June 18, 1997, the Board of
Directors and stockholders of the Company approved the 1997 Equity
Participation Plan (the "Equity Plan"). Since consummation of the initial
public offering of the Company's Common Stock, the Equity Plan has been
administered by the Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors is
authorized under the Equity Plan to select the individuals to whom awards will
be made (the "Participants") and determine the terms and conditions of the
awards under the Equity Plan. The Equity Plan provides that the Board of
Directors may grant or issue stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, deferred stock, dividend equivalents, performance awards,
stock payments and other stock related benefits, or any combination thereof,
to any eligible employee or consultant. Each such award will be set forth in a
separate a agreement with the person receiving the award and will indicate the
type, terms, and conditions of the award. An aggregate of 1,321,181 shares of
Common Stock of the Company have been reserved for issuance under the Equity
Plan, subject to certain adjustments reflecting changes in the Company's
capitalization. The Equity Plan provides that no Participant may receive awards
relating to more than 480,429 shares of Common Stock per year.

         SECTION 162(M) LIMITATION. In general, under Section 162(m) of the
Code ("Section 162(m)"), income tax deductions of publicly-held corporations
may be limited to the extent total compensation including base salary, annual
bonus, stock option exercises and non-qualified benefits for certain executive
officers exceeds $1 million (less the amount of any "excess parachute payments"
as defined in Section 280G of the Code) in any one year. Under a Section 162(m)
transition rule for compensation plans of corporations which are privately held
and which 


                                     -54-
<PAGE>

become publicly held in an initial public offering, the Equity Plan will not be
subject to Section 162(m) until the "Transition Date" which is defined as the
earliest of (i) the material modification of the Equity Plan; (ii) the issuance
of all Common Stock and other compensation that has been allocated under the
Equity Plan; and (iii) the first meeting of stockholders at which directors are
to be elected that occurs after December 31, 2001. After the Transition Date,
rights and awards granted under the Equity Plan will not qualify as
"performance-based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) unless such
rights and awards are granted by an independent compensation committee, and
such awards are granted or vest upon pre-established objective performance
goals, the material terms of which are disclosed to and approved by the
stockholders of the Company. The transition rule will also apply to base salary
and bonus payments made pursuant to employment agreements in effect at the time
of the initial public offering of the Company's Common Stock.

         The Board of Directors generally will have the power and authority to
amend the equity Plan at any time without approval of the Company's
stockholders, subject to applicable federal securities and tax law limitations
(including rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange).

CUTI LOAN AGREEMENT

                Pursuant to the terms of the Cuti Employment Agreement and a
Secured Loan Agreement and related agreements among Mr. Cuti, the Company and
DLJ (the "Loan Documents"), on November 20, 1997, Mr. Cuti borrowed $1 million
from DLJ (the "Loan"). The Loan is secured by Mr. Cuti's pledge to DLJ of his
options granted under the equity Plan and his option to purchase 496,569 shares
of Common Stock, and all Common Stock and other proceeds payable upon exercise
or other disposition thereof (the "Pledged Security"). The Loan is subject to
interest at the Federal Mid-Term Rate as in effect from time to time and is
generally payable in five equal installments commencing within 30 days after
Mr. Cuti has the ability to receive cash in exchange for any of the Pledged
Security. In addition, the Company may apply any amounts to which Mr. Cuti is
entitled upon termination of employment to repayment of the Loan. The Cuti
Employment Agreement and the Loan Documents further provide that in the event
of termination of Mr. Cuti's employment by reason of termination by the Company
without "cause" or the Company's non-renewal or his resignation with "good
reason" (as such terms are defined in the Cuti Employment Agreement), the
Company will reimburse Mr. Cuti for all interest accrued as of the date of such
termination if the Company has achieved certain specified financial targets for
the year prior to termination and the year of such termination. The Loan
Documents permits DLJ to assign the Loan to certain of its affiliates,
including the Company, and the Company is obligated pursuant to the Cuti
Employment Agreement to assume the Loan from DLJ as soon as practicable after
the Company and DLJ agree that the Company may do so. At December 27, 1997, the
DLJ Investors had not exercised such election.

OTHER RELATIONSHIPS

         The Company incurred aggregate fees owing to Credit Suisse First
Boston for financial services rendered from March 1995 through the consummation

million was paid upon consummation of the Recapitalization and the remaining
$2.2 million was paid in connection with the consummation of the initial public
offering of the Company's Common Stock.

STOCKHOLDERS AND REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

         In connection with the Recapitalization, certain of the shareholders
of the Company (the "Initial Shareholders") entered into a Stockholders and
Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which the Company has granted the
Initial Shareholders the right to cause the Company to register shares of
Common Stock (the "registrable securities") under the Securities Act. Upon
consummation of the Offering, 9,395,278 outstanding shares of Common Stock will
constitute registrable securities and therefore will be eligible for
registration pursuant to the Stockholders and Registration Rights Agreement.
Under the terms of the Stockholders and Registration Rights Agreement, at any
time after the one year anniversary date of the Offering, (i) the holders of at
least a majority of the registrable securities held by the DLJ Entities can
require the Company, subject to certain limitations, to file a registration
statement under the Securities Act covering all or part of the registrable
securities held by the DLJ Entities and (ii) the remaining 


                                     -59-
<PAGE>

Initial Shareholders can require the Company, subject to certain limitations,
to file a registration statement covering all or part of the registrable
securities held by such Initial Shareholders (each, a "demand registration").
The Company is obligated to pay all registration expenses (other than
underwriting discounts and commissions and subject to certain limitations)
incurred in connection with the demand registrations. In addition, the
Stockholders and Registration Rights Agreement provides the Initial
Shareholders with "piggyback" registration rights, subject to certain

                                   ARTICLE I

                        DEFINITIONS AND ACCOUNTING TERMS

         SECTION 1.1. Defined Terms. The following terms (whether or not
underscored) when used in this Agreement, including its preamble and recitals,

Subordinated Notes and entered into by and between Holdings and The Connecticut
National Bank, as trustee thereunder, as in effect on the date hereof.

         "Administrative Agent" is defined in the preamble and includes each
other Person as shall have subsequently been appointed as the successor
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 10.4.

         "Affiliate" of any Person means any other Person which, directly or
indirectly, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such
Person (excluding any trustee under, or any committee with responsibility for
administering, any Plan). A Person shall be deemed to be 

                                      -3-


<PAGE>

"controlled by" any other Person if such other Person possesses, directly or 
indirectly, power (a) to vote 10% or more of the securities (on a fully 
diluted basis) having ordinary voting power for the election of directors or 
managing general partners, or (b) to direct or cause the direction of the 
management and policies of such Person whether by contract or otherwise.

         "Agent" means, as the context may require, the Administrative Agent

date.

         "Alternate Base Rate" means, for any day and with respect to all Base

established by the Administrative Agent in Boston, Massachusetts, as its "prime
rate." (The "prime rate" is a rate set by the Administrative Agent based upon
various factors including the Administrative Agent's costs and desired return,
general economic conditions and other factors, and is used as a reference point
for pricing some loans, which may be priced at, above or below such announced

such establishment or announcement.

         "Applicable Commitment Fee" means, (a) for each day from the Closing

per annum, and (b) for each day thereafter, a fee which shall accrue at the
applicable rate per annum set forth below under the column entitled "Applicable
Commitment Fee", determined by reference to the Leverage Ratio as in effect for
the Fiscal Quarter last ended as of such time of determination:


                                                           APPLICABLE
                      LEVERAGE RATIO                     COMMITMENT FEE

With respect to any time of determining the Applicable Commitment Fee, the
Leverage Ratio used to compute the Applicable Commitment Fee shall be equal to
the Leverage Ratio set forth in the Compliance Certificate most recently
delivered by Holdings to the Administrative Agent, as of such time of
determination pursuant to clause (d) of Section 7.1.1. Changes in the
Applicable Commitment Fee resulting from a change in the Leverage Ratio shall
become effective upon delivery by Holdings to the Administrative Agent of a new
Compliance Certificate pursuant to clause (d) of Section 7.1.1. If Holdings
fails to deliver a Compliance

Section 7.1.1, the Applicable Commitment Fee from and including the first day 
after the date on which such Compliance Certificate was required to be

         "Applicable Margin" means at all times during the applicable periods
         set forth below,

                  (a) with respect to the unpaid principal amount of each Term
         B Loan maintained as a (i) Base Rate Loan, 1.75% per annum and (ii)
         LIBO Rate Loan, 2.75% per annum;

                  (b) from the Closing Date through (but excluding) the date
         upon which the Compliance Certificate for the second full Fiscal
         Quarter following the Closing Date is delivered by Holdings to the
         Administrative Agent pursuant to clause (d) of Section 7.1.1, with

         Loan), 1.50% per annum, and (ii) each Term A Loan and each Revolving
         Loan maintained as (A) a Base Rate Loan, 1.50% per annum, and (B) a
         LIBO Rate Loan, 2.50% per annum; and

         the unpaid principal amount of each Swing Line Loan (each of which
         shall be borrowed and maintained only as a Base Rate Loan), each Term

         SECTION 2.2.1. Optional. The Borrower may, from time to time on any
Business Day occurring after the time of the initial Credit Extension
hereunder, voluntarily reduce the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount; provided,
however, that all such reductions shall require at least three Business Days'
prior notice to the Administrative Agent and be permanent, and any partial
reduction of any Commitment Amount shall be in an aggregate amount of
$5,000,000 or any larger integral multiple of $1,000,000. Any such reduction of
the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount which reduces the Revolving Loan
Commitment Amount below the Letter of Credit Commitment Amount or the Swing
Line Loan Commitment Amount shall result in an automatic and corresponding
reduction of the Letter of Credit Commitment Amount or the Swing Line Loan
Commitment Amount, as the case may be, to an aggregate amount not in excess of
the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount, as so reduced, without any further action
on the part of the Issuer or the Swing Line Lender.

         SECTION 2.2.2. Mandatory. The Revolving Loan Commitment Amount shall,
without any further action, automatically and permanently be reduced

                  (a) on the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date so that
         the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount equals $0; and

                  (b) following the prepayment in full of the Term Loans, on
         the date the Term Loans would otherwise have been required to be
         prepaid pursuant to clause (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of Section 3.1.1,
         in an amount equal to the amount by which the Term Loans 


                                     -35-
<PAGE>

         would otherwise have been required to be prepaid if any Term Loans had
         been outstanding. Any such reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitment
         Amount which reduces the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount below the
         Letter of Credit Commitment Amount or the Swing Line Loan Commitment
         Amount shall result in an automatic and corresponding permanent
         reduction of the Letter of Credit Commitment Amount or the Swing Line
         Loan Commitment Amount, as the case may be, to an aggregate amount not
         in excess of the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount, as so reduced,
         without any further action on the part of the Issuer or the Swing Line
         Lender.

         SECTION 2.3. Borrowing Procedures and Funding Maintenance. Loans
(other than Swing Line Loans) shall be made by the Lenders in accordance with
Section 2.3.1, and Swing Line Loans shall be made by the Swing Line Lender in
accordance with Section 2.3.2.

         SECTION 2.3.1. Term Loans and Revolving Loans. By delivering a
Borrowing Request to the Administrative Agent on or before 12:00 noon, New York
City time, on a Business Day, the Borrower may from time to time irrevocably
request, on not less than one Business Day's notice (in the case of Base Rate
Loans) or three Business Days' notice (in the case of LIBO Rate Loans) nor more
than five Business Days' notice (in the case of any Loans), that a Borrowing be
made, in the case of LIBO Rate Loans, in an aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or
any larger integral multiple of $500,000, and in the case of Base Rate Loans,
in an aggregate amount of $500,000 or any larger integral multiple of $100,000,
or, in either case, in the unused amount of the applicable Commitment. No
Borrowing Request shall be required, and the minimum aggregate amounts
specified under this Section 2.3.1 shall not apply, in the case of Revolving
Loans made under clause (b) of Section 2.3.2 to refund Refunded Swing Line
Loans or deemed made under Section 2.6.2 in respect of unreimbursed
Disbursements. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
each Borrowing shall be comprised of the type of Loans, and shall be made on
the Business Day, specified in such Borrowing Request. On or before 11:00 a.m.,
New York City time, on such Business Day each Lender shall deposit with the
Administrative Agent same day funds in an amount equal to such Lender's
Percentage of the requested Borrowing. Such deposit will be made to an account
which the Administrative Agent shall specify from time to time by notice to the
Lenders. To the extent funds are received from the Lenders, the Administrative
Agent shall make such funds available to the Borrower by wire transfer to the
accounts the Borrower shall have specified in its Borrowing Request. No
Lender's obligation to make any Loan shall be affected by any other Lender's
failure to make any Loan.

         SECTION 2.3.2. Swing Line Loans. (a) By telephonic notice, promptly
followed (within one Business Day) by the delivery of a confirming Borrowing
Request, to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent on or before
12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day the proposed Swing Line
Loan is to be made, the Borrower may from time to time irrevocably request that
a Swing Line Loan be made by the Swing Line Lender in a minimum principal
amount of $100,000 or any larger integral multiple of $50,000. All Swing Line
Loans shall be made as Base Rate Loans and shall not be entitled to be
converted into LIBO Rate Loans. The proceeds of each Swing Line Loan shall be
made available by the Swing Line Lender, by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the Business Day telephonic notice is received by 



                                     -36-
<PAGE>

it as provided in this clause (a), to the Borrower by wire transfer to the
account the Borrower shall have specified in its notice therefor.

         (b) If (i) any Swing Line Loan (A) shall be outstanding for more than
four Business Days or (B) is or will be outstanding on a date when the Borrower
requests that a Revolving Loan be made or (ii) any Default (other than a
Default of the nature set forth in Section 8.1.9) shall occur and be
continuing, each Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment (other than the Swing
Line Lender) irrevocably agrees that it will, at the request of the Swing Line
Lender and upon notice from the Administrative Agent, make a Revolving Loan
(which shall initially be funded as a Base Rate Loan) in an amount equal to
such Lender's Percentage of the aggregate principal amount of all such Swing
Line Loans then outstanding (such outstanding Swing Line Loans hereinafter
referred to as the "Refunded Swing Line Loans"); provided, that the Swing Line
Lender shall not request, and no Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment shall
make, any Refunded Swing Line Loan if, after giving effect to the making of
such Refunded Swing Line Loan, the sum of all Swing Line Loans and Revolving
Loans made by such Lender, plus such Lender's Percentage of the aggregate
amount of all Letter of Credit Outstandings, would exceed such Lender's
Percentage of the then existing Revolving Loan Commitment Amount. On or before
11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the first Business Day following receipt by
each Lender of a request to make Revolving Loans as provided in the preceding
sentence, each such Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment shall deposit in an
account specified by the Swing Line Lender the amount so requested in same day
funds and such funds shall be applied by the Swing Line Lender to repay the
Refunded Swing Line Loans. At the time the aforementioned Lenders make the
above referenced Revolving Loans, the Swing Line Lender shall be deemed to have
made, in consideration of the making of the Refunded Swing Line Loans, a
Revolving Loan in an amount equal to the Swing Line Lender's Percentage of the
aggregate principal amount of the Refunded Swing Line Loans. Upon the making
(or deemed making, in the case of the Swing Line Lender) of any Revolving Loans
pursuant to this clause (b), the amount so funded shall become outstanding
under such Lender's Revolving Note and shall no longer be owed under the Swing
Line Note. All interest payable with respect to any Revolving Loans made (or
deemed made, in the case of the Swing Line Lender) pursuant to this clause (b)
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the period of time during which the
Swing Line Lender had outstanding Swing Line Loans in respect of which such
Revolving Loans were made.

         (c) If, at any time prior to the making of Revolving Loans to replace
any outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to clause (b) above, any Default of
the nature of the nature set forth in Section 8.1.9 shall have occurred, each
Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment (other than the Swing Line Lender)
irrevocably agrees that it will, at the request of the Swing Line Lender and
upon notice from the Administrative Agent, purchase an undivided participation
interest in all such Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to its Percentage of
the aggregate outstanding amount of such Swing Line Loans and transfer
immediately to an account identified by the Swing Line Lender, in immediately
available funds, the amount of its participation. The Swing Line Lender will
deliver to each such Lender, promptly following receipt of such funds, a
participation certificate, dated the date of receipt of such funds and in the
amount of such Lender's participation if requested to do so by such Lender.

                                     -37-
<PAGE>

         (d) The Borrower expressly agrees that, in respect of each Lender's
funded participation interest in any Swing Line Loan, such Lender shall be
deemed to be in privity of contract with the Borrower and have the same rights
and remedies against the Borrower under the Loan Documents as if such funded
participation interest in such Swing Line Loan were a Revolving Loan.

         (e) Each Lender's obligation (in the case of Lenders with a Revolving
Loan Commitment) to make Revolving Loans or purchase participation interests in
Swing Line Loans, as contemplated by clause (b) or (c) above, shall be absolute
and unconditional and without recourse to the Swing Line Lender and shall not
be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any set-off, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Lender may have against
the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason
whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, an Event of
Default or a Material Adverse Effect; (iii) the acceleration or maturity of any
Loans or the termination of any Commitment after the making of any Swing Line
Loan; (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the
Borrower, any other Obligor or any Lender; or (v) any other circumstance,
happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

         SECTION 2.4. Continuation and Conversion Elections. By delivering a
Continuation/Conversion Notice to the Administrative Agent on or before 12:00
noon, New York City time, on a Business Day, the Borrower may from time to time
irrevocably elect, on not less than one Business Day's notice (in the case of a
conversion of LIBO Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans) or three Business Days'
notice (in the case of a continuation of LIBO Rate Loans or a conversion of
Base Rate Loans into LIBO Rate Loans) nor more than five Business Days' notice
(in the case of any Loans) that all, or any portion (a) in a minimum amount of
$1,000,000 or any larger integral multiple of $500,000, be, in the case of Base
Rate Loans, converted into LIBO Rate Loans or, in the case of LIBO Rate Loans,
continued as LIBO Rate Loans or (b) in a minimum amount of $500,000 or any
larger integral multiple of $100,000, be, in the case of LIBO Rate Loans,
converted into Base Rate Loans (in the absence of delivery of a
Continuation/Conversion Notice with respect to any LIBO Rate Loan at least
three Business Days before the last day of the then current Interest Period
with respect thereto, such LIBO Rate Loan shall, on such last day,
automatically convert to a Base Rate Loan); provided, however, that (x) each
such conversion or continuation shall be pro rated among the applicable
outstanding Loans of the relevant Lenders, and (y) no portion of the
outstanding principal amount of any Loans may be continued as, or be converted
into, LIBO Rate Loans when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing.

         SECTION 2.5. Funding. Each Lender may, if it so elects, fulfill its
obligation to make, continue or convert LIBO Rate Loans hereunder by causing
one of its foreign branches or Affiliates (or an international banking facility
created by such Lender) to make or maintain such LIBO Rate Loan, so long as
such action does not result in increased costs to the Borrower; provided,
however, that such LIBO Rate Loan shall nonetheless be deemed to have been made
and to be held by such Lender, and the obligation of the Borrower to repay such
LIBO Rate Loan 


                                     -38-
<PAGE>

shall nevertheless be to such Lender for the account of such foreign branch,
Affiliate or international banking facility; provided further, however, that,
except for purposes of determining whether any such increased costs are payable
by the Borrower, such Lender shall cause such foreign branch, Affiliate or
international banking facility to comply with the applicable provisions of
clause (b) of Section 4.6 with respect to such LIBO Rate Loan. In addition, the
Borrower hereby consents and agrees that, for purposes of any determination to
be made for purposes of Section 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 or 4.4, it shall be conclusively
assumed that each Lender elected to fund all LIBO Rate Loans by purchasing
Dollar deposits in its LIBOR Office's interbank Eurodollar market.

         SECTION 2.6. Issuance Procedures. By delivering to the Administrative
Agent an Issuance Request on or before 12:00 noon, New York City time, on a
Business Day, the Borrower may, from time to time irrevocably request, on not
less than three nor more than ten Business Days' notice (or such shorter or
longer notice as may be acceptable to the Issuer), in the case of an initial
issuance of a Letter of Credit, and not less than three nor more than ten
Business Days' notice (unless a shorter or longer notice period is acceptable
to the Issuer) prior to the then existing Stated Expiry Date of a Letter of
Credit, in the case of a request for the extension of the Stated Expiry Date of
a Letter of Credit, that the Issuer issue, or extend the Stated Expiry Date of,
as the case may be, an irrevocable Letter of Credit on behalf of the Borrower
(whether the account party on such Letter of Credit is the Borrower or a
Subsidiary of the Borrower) in such form as may be requested by the Borrower
and approved by the Issuer, for the purposes described in Section 7.1.9;
provided, however, that no extension of the Stated Expiry Date of an
outstanding Letter of Credit may provide for a Stated Expiry Date subsequent to
the earlier of (i) the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date and (ii) one
year from the date of such extension. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein or in any separate application for any Letter of Credit, the
Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that it shall be obligated to reimburse
the Issuer upon each Disbursement paid under a Letter of Credit, and it shall
be deemed to be the obligor for purposes of each such Letter of Credit issued
hereunder (whether the account party on such Letter of Credit is the Borrower
or a Subsidiary of the Borrower). Upon receipt of an Issuance Request, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Issuer and each Lender thereof.
Each Letter of Credit shall by its terms be stated to expire on a date (its
"Stated Expiry Date") no later than the earlier to occur of (i) the Revolving
Loan Commitment Termination Date or (ii) one year from the date of its
issuance. The Issuer will make available to the beneficiary thereof the
original of each Letter of Credit which it issues hereunder.

         SECTION 2.6.1. Other Lenders' Participation. Upon the issuance of each
Letter of Credit issued by the Issuer pursuant hereto, and without further
action, each Lender (other than the Issuer) that has a Revolving Loan
Commitment shall be deemed to have irrevocably purchased from the Issuer, to
the extent of its Percentage in respect of Revolving Loans, and the Issuer
shall be deemed to have irrevocably granted and sold to such Lender a
participation interest in such Letter of Credit (including the Contingent
Liability and any Reimbursement Obligation and all rights with respect
thereto), and such Lender shall, to the extent of its Percentage in respect of
Revolving Loans, be responsible for reimbursing promptly (and in any 


                                     -39-
<PAGE>

event within one Business Day) the Issuer for Reimbursement Obligations which
have not been reimbursed by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.6.3. In
addition, such Lender shall, to the extent of its Percentage in respect of
Revolving Loans, be entitled to receive a ratable portion of the Letter of
Credit fees payable pursuant to Section 3.3.3 with respect to each Letter of
Credit and of interest payable pursuant to Section 3.2 with respect to any
Reimbursement Obligation. To the extent that any Lender has reimbursed the
Issuer for a Disbursement as required by this Section, such Lender shall be
entitled to receive its ratable portion of any amounts subsequently received
(from the Borrower or otherwise) in respect of such Disbursement.

         SECTION 2.6.2. Disbursements; Conversion to Revolving Loans. The
Issuer will notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly of the
presentment for payment of any drawing under any Letter of Credit issued by the
Issuer, together with notice of the date (the "Disbursement Date") such payment
shall be made (each such payment, a "Disbursement"). Subject to the terms and
provisions of such Letter of Credit and this Agreement, the Issuer shall make
such payment to the beneficiary (or its designee) of such Letter of Credit.
Prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the first Business Day following
the Disbursement Date (the "Disbursement Due Date"), the Borrower will
reimburse the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuer, for all
amounts which the Issuer has disbursed under such Letter of Credit, together
with interest thereon at the rate per annum otherwise applicable to Revolving
Loans (made as Base Rate Loans) from and including the Disbursement Date to but
excluding the Disbursement Due Date and, thereafter (unless such Disbursement
is converted into a Revolving Loan made as a Base Rate Loan on the Disbursement
Due Date), at a rate per annum equal to the rate per annum then in effect with
respect to overdue Revolving Loans (made as Base Rate Loans) pursuant to
Section 3.2.2 for the period from the Disbursement Due Date through the date of
such reimbursement; provided, however, that, if no Default shall have then
occurred and be continuing, unless the Borrower has notified the Administrative
Agent no later than one Business Day prior to the Disbursement Due Date that it
will reimburse the Issuer for the applicable Disbursement, then the amount of
the Disbursement shall be deemed to be a Borrowing of Revolving Loans
constituting Base Rate Loans and following the giving of notice thereof by the
Administrative Agent to the Lenders, each Lender with a Revolving Loan
Commitment (other than the Issuer) will deliver to the Issuer on the
Disbursement Due Date immediately available funds in an amount equal to such
Lender's Percentage of such Borrowing. Each conversion of Disbursement amounts
into Revolving Loans shall constitute a representation and warranty by the
Borrower that on the date of the making of such Revolving Loans all of the
statements set forth in Section 5.2.1 are true and correct.

         SECTION 2.6.3. Reimbursement. The obligation (a "Reimbursement
Obligation") of the Borrower under Section 2.6.2 to reimburse the Issuer with
respect to each Disbursement (including interest thereon) not converted into a
Revolving Loan made as a Base Rate Loan pursuant to Section 2.6.2, and, upon
the failure of the Borrower to reimburse the Issuer and the giving of notice
thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders, each Lender's (to the
extent it has a Revolving Loan Commitment) obligation under Section 2.6.1 to
reimburse the Issuer or fund its Percentage of any Disbursement converted into
a Revolving Loan made as a Base Rate Loan, shall be absolute and unconditional
under any and all circumstances and irrespective of 


                                     -40-
<PAGE>

any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower or such
Lender, as the case may be, may have or have had against the Issuer or any such
Lender, including any defense based upon the failure of any Disbursement to
conform to the terms of the applicable Letter of Credit (if, in the Issuer's
good faith opinion, such Disbursement is determined to be appropriate) or any
non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of such
Letter of Credit; provided, however, that after paying in full its
Reimbursement Obligation hereunder, nothing herein shall adversely affect the
right of the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, to commence any
proceeding against the Issuer for any wrongful Disbursement made by the Issuer
under a Letter of Credit as a result of acts or omissions constituting gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuer.

         SECTION 2.6.4. Deemed Disbursements. Upon the occurrence and during
the continuation of any Event of Default of the type described in clauses (a)
through (d) of Section 8.1.9 or, with notice from the Administrative Agent
acting at the direction of the Required Lenders, upon the occurrence and during
the continuation of any other Event of Default,

                  (a) an amount equal to that portion of all Letter of Credit
         Outstandings attributable to the then aggregate amount which is
         undrawn and available under all Letters of Credit issued and
         outstanding shall, without demand upon or notice to the Borrower or
         any other Person, be deemed to have been paid or disbursed by the
         Issuer under such Letters of Credit (notwithstanding that such amount
         may not in fact have been so paid or disbursed); and

                  (b) upon notification by the Administrative Agent to the
         Borrower of its obligations under this Section, the Borrower shall be
         immediately obligated to reimburse the Issuer for the amount deemed to
         have been so paid or disbursed by the Issuer.

Any amounts so payable by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be
deposited in cash with the Administrative Agent and held as collateral security
for the Obligations in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by the
Issuer. At such time as the Events of Default giving rise to the deemed
disbursements hereunder shall have been cured or waived, the Administrative
Agent shall return to the Borrower all amounts then on deposit with the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section, together with accrued interest
at the Federal Funds Rate, which have not been applied to the satisfaction of
such Obligations.

         SECTION 2.6.5. Nature of Reimbursement Obligations. The Borrower and,
to the extent set forth in Section 2.6.1, each Lender with a Revolving Loan
Commitment, shall assume all risks of the acts, omissions or misuse of any
Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof. The Issuer (except to the extent
of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct) shall not be responsible for
(i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of
any Letter of Credit or any document submitted by any party in connection with
the application for and issuance of a Letter of Credit, even if it should in
fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate,
fraudulent or forged, (ii) the form, validity, sufficiency, 


                                     -41-
<PAGE>

accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any instrument transferring or
assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights
or benefits thereunder or the proceeds thereof in whole or in part, which may
prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason, (iii) failure of the
beneficiary to comply fully with conditions required in order to demand payment
under a Letter of Credit, (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in
transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or
otherwise, or (v) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any
document or draft required in order to make a Disbursement under a Letter of
Credit. None of the foregoing shall affect, impair or prevent the vesting of
any of the rights or powers granted to the Issuer or any Lender with a
Revolving Loan Commitment hereunder. In furtherance and extension and not in
limitation or derogation of any of the foregoing, any action taken or omitted
to be taken by the Issuer in good faith (and not constituting gross negligence
or willful misconduct) shall be binding upon the Borrower, each Obligor and
each such Lender, and shall not put the Issuer under any resulting liability to
the Borrower, any Obligor or any such Lender, as the case may be.

         SECTION 2.6.6. Indemnity. In addition to amounts payable as elsewhere
provided herein, the Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save
the Issuer harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities,
damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and allocated costs of internal counsel) which the Issuer may incur or be
subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (a) the issuance of the
Letters of Credit, other than as a result of the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of the Issuer as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or
(b) the failure of the Issuer to honor a drawing under any Letter of Credit as
a result of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present
or future de jure or de facto government or governmental authority.

         SECTION 2.6.7. Borrower's Guaranty of Reimbursement Obligations under
Letters of Credit Issued for the Account of its Subsidiaries. The Borrower
agrees as follows in respect of the reimbursement obligations under Letters of
Credit issued for the account of its Subsidiaries:

         (a)  The Borrower hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably

                  (i) guarantees the full and punctual payment when due,
         whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration,
         acceleration, demand or otherwise, of all such reimbursement
         obligations now or hereafter existing, of each of its Subsidiaries
         (the "Account Parties") that is an account party to a Letter of Credit
         which arise out of, or are incurred in connection with, such Letters
         of Credit, whether for principal, interest, fees, expenses or
         otherwise (including all such amounts which would become due but for
         the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the United
         States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. ss.362(a), and the operation of
         Sections 502(b) and 506(b) of the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11
         U.S.C. ss.502(b) and ss.506(b)), and

                  (ii) indemnifies and holds harmless each Secured Party and
         each holder of a Note for any and all costs and expenses (including
         reasonable attorney's fees and expenses)



                                     -42-
<PAGE>

         incurred by such Secured Party or such holder, as the case may be, in
         enforcing any rights under the guaranty set forth in this Section
         2.6.7.

The guaranty set forth in this Section 2.6.7 constitutes a guaranty of payment
when due and not of collection, and the Borrower specifically agrees that it
shall not be necessary or required that any Secured Party or any holder of any
Note exercise any right, assert any claim or demand or enforce any remedy
whatsoever against any Account Party or any other Obligor (or any other Person)
before or as a condition to the obligations of the Borrower under the guaranty
set forth in this Section 2.6.7 (such obligations hereinafter referred to as
the "Guaranteed Obligations").

         (b) The Borrower agrees that upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default of the nature set forth in clauses (a) through (d) of Section 8.1.9, at
a time when any of the Guaranteed Obligations of any Account Party may not then
be due and payable, then the Borrower agrees that it will pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Secured Parties forthwith the full
amount which would be payable under the guaranty set forth in this Section
2.6.7 by the Borrower if all such Guaranteed Obligations were then due and
payable.

         (c) The guaranty set forth in this Section 2.6.7 shall in all respects
be a continuing, absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guaranty of payment,
and shall remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations of
the Account Parties have been paid in full in cash, all Obligations of the
Borrower and each other Obligor hereunder have been paid in full in cash, all
Letters of Credit have been terminated or expired, all Rate Protection
Agreements have been terminated or expired and all Commitments shall have
terminated. The Borrower guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations of the
Account Parties will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and each other Loan Document under which they arise, regardless of
any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction
affecting any of such terms or the rights of any Secured Party or any holder of
any Note with respect thereto. The liability of the Borrower under the guaranty
set forth in this Section 2.6.7 shall be absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable irrespective of:

                  (i) any lack of validity, legality or enforceability of this
         Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document;

                           (ii) the failure of any Secured Party or any holder
                  of any Note

                           (A) to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any
                  right or remedy against any Account Party, any other Obligor
                  or any other Person (including any other guarantor (including
                  the Borrower)) under the provisions of this Agreement, any
                  Note, any other Loan Document or otherwise, or

                           (B) to exercise any right or remedy against any
                  other guarantor (including the Borrower) of, or collateral
                  securing, any Guaranteed Obligations of any Account Party;

                                     -43-
<PAGE>

                  (iii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of,
         or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations of
         any Account Party, or any other extension, compromise or renewal of
         any Guaranteed Obligation of any Account Party;

                  (iv) any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination of
         any Guaranteed Obligations of any Account Party for any reason,
         including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or
         compromise, and shall not be subject to (and the Borrower hereby
         waives any right to or claim of) any defense or setoff, counterclaim,
         recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity,
         illegality, nongenuineness, irregularity, compromise, unenforceability
         of, or any other event or occurrence affecting, any Guaranteed
         Obligations of any Account Party or otherwise;

                  (v) any amendment to, rescission, waiver, or other
         modification of, or any consent to departure from, any of the terms of
         this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document;

                  (vi) any addition, exchange, release, surrender or
         non-perfection of any collateral, or any amendment to or waiver or
         release or addition of, or consent to departure from, any other
         guaranty, held by any Secured Party or any holder of any Note securing
         any of the Guaranteed Obligations of any Account Party; or

                  (vii) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute
         a defense available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, any
         Account Party any surety or any guarantor.

         (d) The Borrower agrees that the guaranty set forth in this Section
2.6.7 shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if
at any time any payment (in whole or in part) of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Secured Party or
any holder of any Note, upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of
any Account Party or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

         (e) The Borrower hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of
acceptance and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed
Obligations of any Account Party or any other Obligor and the guaranty set
forth in this Section 2.6.7 and any requirement that the Administrative Agent,
any other Secured Party or any holder of any Note protect, secure, perfect or
insure any security interest or Lien, or any property subject thereto, or
exhaust any right or take any action against any Account Party, any other
Obligor or any other Person (including any other guarantor) or entity or any
collateral securing the Guaranteed Obligations of any Account Party.

         (f) The Borrower agrees that it will not exercise any rights which it
may acquire by way of rights of subrogation under the guaranty set forth in
this Section 2.6.7, by any payment made under the guaranty set forth in this
Section 2.6.7 or otherwise, until the prior payment in full in cash of all
Guaranteed Obligations of each Account Party, the prior payment in full in cash
of all Obligations of the Borrower, the termination or expiration of all
Letters of Credit, the 


                                     -44-
<PAGE>

         termination or expiration of all Rate Protection Agreements and the
         termination of all Commitments. Any amount paid to the Borrower on
         account of any such subrogation rights prior to the payment in full in
         cash of all Guaranteed Obligations of each Account Party shall be held
         in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and each holder of a
         Note and shall immediately be paid to the Administrative Agent for the
         benefit of the Secured Parties and each holder of a Note and credited
         and applied against the Guaranteed Obligations of each Account Party,
         whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this
         Agreement; provided, however, that if

                  (i) the Borrower has made payment to the Secured Parties and
         each holder of a Note of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations
         of any Account Party, and

                  (ii) all Guaranteed Obligations of each Account Party have
         been paid in full in cash, all Obligations of the Borrower have been
         paid in full in cash, all Letters of Credit have been terminated or
         expired and all Commitments have been permanently terminated,

each Secured Party and each holder of a Note agrees that, at the Borrower's
request, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties and the
holders of the Notes, will execute and deliver to the Borrower appropriate
documents (without recourse and without representation or warranty) necessary
to evidence the transfer by subrogation to the Borrower of an interest in the
Guaranteed Obligations of each Account Party resulting from such payment by the
Borrower. In furtherance of the foregoing, for so long as any Obligations
(including Guaranteed Obligations) or Commitments remain outstanding, the
Borrower shall refrain from taking any action or commencing any proceeding
against any Account Party(or its successors or assigns, whether in connection
with a bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise) to recover any amounts in the
respect of payments made under the guaranty set forth in this Section 2.6.7 to
any Secured Party or any holder of a Note.

         (g)  The guaranty set forth in this Section 2.6.7 shall:

                  (h) be binding upon the Borrower, and its successors,
         transferees and assigns; and

                  (i) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
         Administrative Agent and each other Secured Party.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (b), any Lender may
assign or otherwise transfer (in whole or in part) any Note or Credit Extension
held by it to any other Person or entity, and such other Person or entity shall
thereupon become vested with all rights and benefits in respect thereof granted
to such Lender under any Loan Document (including the guaranty set forth in
this Section 2.6.7) or otherwise, subject, however, to any contrary provisions
in such assignment or transfer, and to the provisions of Section 11.11 and
Article X.

         SECTION 2.6.8. Continued Letters of Credit. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the Letters of Credit (as defined in the Existing
Credit Agreement) described in Schedule 


                                     -45-
<PAGE>

III attached hereto shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit issued hereunder by
the Issuer on the Closing Date.

         SECTION 2.7.  Register; Notes.

                  (a) Each Lender may maintain in accordance with its usual
         practice an account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of the
         Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender,
         including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to
         such Lender from time to time hereunder. In the case of a Lender that
         does not request, pursuant to clause (b)(ii) below, execution and
         delivery of a Note evidencing the Loans made by such Lender to the
         Borrower, such account or accounts shall, to the extent not
         inconsistent with the notations made by the Administrative Agent in
         the Register, be conclusive and binding on the Borrower absent
         manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to
         maintain such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect
         any Obligations of the Borrower or any other Obligor.

                  (b)(i) The Borrower hereby designates the Administrative
         Agent to serve as the Borrower's agent, solely for the purpose of this
         clause (b), to maintain a register (the "Register") on which the
         Administrative Agent will record each Lender's Commitment, the Loans
         made by each Lender and each repayment in respect of the principal
         amount of the Loans of each Lender and annexed to which the
         Administrative Agent shall retain a copy of each Lender Assignment
         Agreement delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section
         11.11.1. Failure to make any recordation, or any error in such
         recordation, shall not affect the Borrower's obligation in respect of
         such Loans. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the
         absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
         and the Lenders shall treat each Person in whose name a Loan (and as
         provided in clause (ii) the Note evidencing such Loan, if any) is
         registered as the owner thereof for all purposes of this Agreement,
         notwithstanding notice or any provision herein to the contrary. A
         Lender's Commitment and the Loans made pursuant thereto may be
         assigned or otherwise transferred in whole or in part only by
         registration of such assignment or transfer in the Register. Any
         assignment or transfer of a Lender's Commitment or the Loans made
         pursuant thereto shall be registered in the Register only upon
         delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Lender Assignment Agreement
         duly executed by the assignor thereof and the compliance by the
         parties thereto with the other requirements of Section 11.11.1. No
         assignment or transfer of a Lender's Commitment or the Loans made
         pursuant thereto shall be effective unless such assignment or transfer
         shall have been recorded in the Register by the Administrative Agent
         as provided in this Section.

                  (ii) The Borrower agrees that, upon the request to the
         Administrative Agent by any Lender, the Borrower will execute and
         deliver to such Lender, as applicable, a Revolving Note, a Term Note
         (or Registered Note) and/or a Swing Line Note evidencing the Loans
         made by such Lender. The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes each
         Lender to make (or cause to be made) appropriate notations on the grid
         attached to such 



                                     -46-
<PAGE>

         Lender's Notes (or on any continuation of such grid), which notations,
         if made, shall evidence, inter alia, the date of, the outstanding
         principal amount of, and the interest rate and Interest Period
         applicable to the Loans evidenced thereby. Such notations shall, to
         the extent not inconsistent with the notations made by the
         Administrative Agent in the Register, be conclusive and binding on the
         Borrower absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of
         any Lender to make any such notations shall not limit or otherwise
         affect any Obligations of the Borrower or any other Obligor. The Loans
         evidenced by any Registered Note and interest thereon shall at all
         times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 11.11.1) be
         payable to the order of the payee named therein and its registered
         assigns. A Registered Note and the obligation evidenced thereby may be
         assigned or otherwise transferred in whole or in part only by
         registration of such assignment or transfer of such Registered Note
         and the obligation evidenced thereby in the Register (and each
         Registered Note shall expressly so provide). Any assignment or
         transfer of all or part of an obligation evidenced by a Registered
         Note shall be registered in the Register only upon surrender for
         registration of assignment or transfer of the Registered Note
         evidencing such obligation, accompanied by a Lender Assignment
         Agreement duly executed by the assignor thereof and the compliance by
         the parties thereto with the other requirements of Section 11.11.1,
         and thereupon, if requested by the assignee, one or more new Notes
         shall be issued to the designated assignee and the old Registered Note
         shall be returned by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower marked
         "exchanged". No assignment of a Registered Note and the obligation
         evidenced thereby shall be effective unless it shall have been
         recorded in the Register by the Administrative Agent as provided in
         this Section.

         SECTION 3.1. Repayments and Prepayments; Application.

         SECTION 3.1.1. Repayments and Prepayments. The Borrower shall repay in

                  (a) may, from time to time on any Business Day, make a
         voluntary prepayment, in whole or in part, of the outstanding
         principal amount of any

                           (i) Loans (other than Swing Line Loans); provided,
                  however, that

                                    (A) any such prepayment of the Term Loans
                           shall be made pro rata among the Term Loans of the
                           same type and, if applicable, having the same
                           Interest Period of all Lenders that have made such
                           Term Loans, and any such prepayment of Revolving
                           Loans shall be made pro rata among 


                                     -47-
<PAGE>

                           the Revolving Loans of the same type and, if

                           Lenders that have made such Revolving Loans;

                                    (B) the Borrower shall comply with Section
                           4.4 in the event that any LIBO Rate Loan is prepaid
                           on any day other than the last day of the Interest
                           Period for such Loan;

                                    (C) all such voluntary prepayments shall
                           require at least one Business Day's notice in the
                           case of Base Rate Loans, three Business Days' notice
                           in the case of LIBO Rate Loans, but no more than
                           five Business Days' notice in the case of any Loans,
                           in each case in writing to the Administrative Agent;
                           and

                                    (D) all such voluntary partial prepayments
                           shall be, in the case of LIBO Rate Loans, in an
                           aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or any larger
                           integral multiple of $500,000, and, in the case of
                           Base Rate Loans, in an aggregate amount of $500,000
                           or any larger integral multiple of $100,000, or, in
                           either case, in the aggregate principal amount of
                           all Loans of the applicable Tranche and type then

                           (ii)  Swing Line Loans; provided, however, that

                                    (A) all such voluntary prepayments shall
                           require prior telephonic notice to the Swing Line
                           Lender on or before 12:00 noon, New York City time,

                           confirmed in writing by the Borrower within 24 hours
                           thereafter); and

                                    (B) all such voluntary partial prepayments
                           shall be in an aggregate amount of $100,000 and an
                           integral multiple of $50,000 or in the aggregate

         financial reports delivered in respect of the 1998 Fiscal Year),
         deliver to the Administrative Agent a calculation of the Excess Cash
         Flow for the Fiscal Year last ended and, no later than five Business
         Days following the delivery of such calculation, make a mandatory
         prepayment of the Term Loans in an amount equal to 75% of the Excess
         Cash Flow (if any) for such Fiscal Year, to be applied as set forth in

                  (d) shall, concurrently with the receipt of any Net Equity
         Proceeds by the Borrower, any Parent Guarantor or any of their
         respective Subsidiaries, deliver to the Administrative Agent a
         calculation of the amount of such Net Equity Proceeds, and no later

         make a mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans in an amount equal to
         50% of such Net Equity Proceeds to be applied as set forth in Section
         3.1.2;

                  (e) shall, following the receipt by the Borrower, any Parent
         Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries of any Casualty
         Proceeds in excess of $500,000 (individually or in the aggregate (when

         following the occurrence of the Casualty Event resulting in such
         Casualty Proceeds of its, such Parent Guarantor's or such Subsidiary's
         good faith intention to apply such Casualty Proceeds to the rebuilding
         or replacement of the damaged, destroyed or condemned assets or
         property and the Borrower, such Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary in
         fact uses such Casualty Proceeds to rebuild or replace such assets or

         Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, all
         Casualty Proceeds (together with Net Disposition Proceeds not applied
         as provided in clause (f) below) shall be deposited in an account
         maintained with the Administrative Agent to pay for such rebuilding or

         or except as otherwise agreed to by the Agents for disbursement at the
         request of the Borrower, such Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary, as
         the case may be, or (ii) if all such Casualty Proceeds (together with
         Net Disposition Proceeds not applied as provided in clause (f) below)
         aggregating in excess of $1,000,000 have not yet been applied as
         described in the notice required above (or in accordance with clause

         of a Fiscal Year), deliver to the Administrative Agent a calculation
         of the amount of such Net Disposition Proceeds and make a mandatory
         prepayment of the Term Loans in an amount equal to 100% of such Net
         Disposition Proceeds within one Business Day of the receipt thereof to
         be applied as set forth in Section 3.1.2; provided, however, that

<PAGE>

         no mandatory prepayment on account of Net Disposition Proceeds shall
         be required under this clause if the Borrower informs the Agents in
         writing no later than one Business Day following the receipt of such
         Net Disposition Proceeds of its, such Parent Guarantor's or such
         Subsidiary's good faith intention to apply such Net Disposition
         Proceeds to the replacement of the sold, conveyed or transferred
         assets or property and the Borrower, such Parent Guarantor or such
         Subsidiary in fact uses such Net Disposition Proceeds to replace such
         assets or property within 365 days following the receipt of such Net
         Disposition Proceeds, with the amount of such Net Disposition Proceeds
         unused after such 365-day period being applied to the Term Loans
         pursuant to Section 3.1.2; provided, further, however, that (i) at any
         time when any Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
         continuing, all Net Disposition Proceeds (together with Casualty
         Proceeds not applied as provided in clause (e) above) shall be
         deposited in an account maintained with the Administrative Agent to
         pay for such replacement whenever no Default or Event of Default is
         then continuing or except as otherwise agreed to by the Agents for
         disbursement at the request of the Borrower, such Parent Guarantor or
         such Subsidiary, as the case may be, or (ii) if all such Net
         Disposition Proceeds (together with Casualty Proceeds not applied as
         provided in clause (e) above) aggregating in excess of $1,000,000 have
         not yet been applied as described in the notice required above (or in
         accordance with clause (e) above), all such Net Disposition Proceeds
         and Casualty Proceeds shall be deposited in an account maintained with
         the Administrative Agent for disbursement at the request of the
         Borrower, such Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary, as the case may
         be, to be used for the purpose(s) set forth in such written notice(s);

         (g) shall, on each date when any reduction in the Revolving Loan
         Commitment Amount shall become effective, make a mandatory prepayment
         of Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans and (if necessary) deposit
         with the Administrative Agent cash collateral for Letter of Credit
         Outstandings in an aggregate amount equal to the excess, if any, of
         the sum of (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all
         Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans and (ii) the aggregate amount of
         all Letter of Credit Outstandings over the Revolving Loan Commitment
         Amount as so reduced;

                  (h) shall on each Quarterly Payment Date occurring during any
         period set forth below, make a scheduled repayment of the outstanding
         principal amount, if any, of Term A Loans in an amount equal to the
         amount set forth below opposite such period (in each case as such
         amounts may have otherwise been reduced pursuant to this Agreement):

                February 15, 2004                          $200,000

               May 15, 2004 through                    $18,800,000; and
                 February 15, 2005

                  (j) shall, immediately upon the occurrence of the Stated
         Maturity Date of any Loans or Obligations, whether by way of
         acceleration pursuant to Section 8.2 or 8.3 or otherwise, repay all
         outstanding Loans and other Obligations, unless, pursuant to Section
         8.3, only a portion of all Loans and other Obligations are so
         accelerated (in which case the portion so accelerated shall be so
         prepaid).


          Each prepayment of any Loans made pursuant to this Section shall be
without premium or penalty, except as may be required by Section 4.4. No
prepayment of principal of any Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans pursuant to
clause (a) of this Section 3.1.1 shall cause a reduction in the Revolving Loan
Commitment Amount or the Swing Line Loan Commitment Amount, as the case may be.

         SECTION 3.1.2. Application. (a) Subject to clause (b) below, each
prepayment or repayment of principal of the Loans of any Tranche shall be
applied, to the extent of such prepayment or repayment, first, to the principal
amount thereof being maintained as Base Rate Loans, and second, to the
principal amount thereof being maintained as LIBO Rate Loans.

         (b) Each prepayment of Term Loans made pursuant to clauses (a), (b),
(c), (d), (e) and (f) of Section 3.1.1 shall be applied, on a pro rata basis,
to the outstanding principal amount of all 


                                     -51-
<PAGE>

remaining Term Loans and the remaining scheduled quarterly amortization
payments in respect thereof, until all such Term Loans have been paid in full;
provided, however, that in the case of any such prepayment of Term B Loans made
pursuant to clause (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of Section 3.1.1, any Lender that
has Term B Loans may elect not to have such Loans prepaid by delivering a
notice to the Administrative Agent at least one Business Day prior to the date
that such prepayment is to be made in which notice such Lender shall decline to
have such Loans prepaid with the amounts set forth above, in which case the
amounts that would have been applied to a prepayment of such Lender's Term B
Loans shall instead be applied to a prepayment of the principal amount (if any)
of all outstanding Term A Loans until all outstanding Term A Loans have been
prepaid in full, then applied to a prepayment of the principal amount (if any)
of all outstanding Swing Line Loans until all outstanding Swing Line Loans have
been prepaid in full and then applied to a prepayment of the principal amount
(if any) of all outstanding Revolving Loans until all outstanding Revolving
Loans have been prepaid in full, with the balance (if any) being returned by
the Administrative Agent to the Borrower. No prepayment of principal of any
Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans pursuant to the proviso of the immediately
preceding sentence shall cause a reduction in the Revolving Loan Commitment
Amount or the Swing Line Loan Commitment Amount, as the case may be.

         SECTION 3.2. Interest Provisions. Interest on the outstanding
principal amount of the Loans shall accrue and be payable in accordance with
this Section 3.2.

         SECTION 3.2.1. Rates. Each Base Rate Loan shall accrue interest on the
unpaid principal amount thereof for each day from and including the day upon
which such Loan was made or converted to a Base Rate Loan to but excluding the
date such Loan is repaid or converted to a LIBO Rate Loan at a rate per annum
equal to the sum of the Alternate Base Rate for such day plus the Applicable
Margin for such Loan on such day. Each LIBO Rate Loan shall accrue interest on
the unpaid principal amount thereof for each day from and including the first
day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to but excluding the date such
Loan is repaid or converted to a Base Rate Loan at a rate per annum equal to
the sum of the LIBO Rate (Reserve Adjusted) for such Interest Period plus the
Applicable Margin for such Loan on such day.

         SECTION 3.2.2. Post-Maturity Rates. After the date any principal
amount of any Loan shall have become due and payable (whether on the applicable
Stated Maturity Date, upon acceleration or otherwise), or any other monetary
Obligation (other than overdue Reimbursement Obligations which shall bear
interest as provided in Section 2.6.2) of the Borrower shall have become due
and payable, the Borrower shall pay, but only to the extent permitted by law,
interest (after as well as before judgment) on such amounts at a rate per annum
equal to (a) in the case of any overdue principal of Loans, overdue interest
thereon, overdue commitment fees or other overdue amounts in respect of Loans
or other obligations (or the related Commitments) under a particular Tranche,
the rate that would otherwise be applicable to Base Rate Loans under such
Tranche pursuant to Section 3.2.1 plus 2% and (b) in the case of other overdue
monetary Obligations, the rate that would otherwise be applicable to Revolving
Loans made as Base Rate Loans plus 2%.

<PAGE>

         SECTION 3.2.3. Payment Dates. Interest accrued on each Loan shall be
payable, without duplication:

                  (a)  on the Stated Maturity Date therefor;

                  (b) on the date of any payment or prepayment, in whole or in
         part, of principal outstanding on such Loan, to the extent of the
         unpaid interest accrued through such date on the principal so paid or
         prepaid;

                  (c) with respect to Base Rate Loans, on each Quarterly
         Payment Date occurring after the Closing Date hereunder;

                  (d) with respect to LIBO Rate Loans, on the last day of the
         applicable Interest Period (and, if such Interest Period shall exceed
         three months, at intervals of three months after the first day of such
         Interest Period);

                  (e) with respect to the principal amount of any Base Rate
         Loans converted into LIBO Rate Loans on a day when interest would not
         otherwise have been payable pursuant to clause (c), on the date of
         such conversion; and

                  (f) on that portion of any Loans the Stated Maturity Date of
         which is accelerated pursuant to Section 8.2 or 8.3, immediately upon
         such acceleration.

Interest accrued on Loans, Reimbursement Obligations or other monetary
Obligations arising under this Agreement or any other Loan Document after the
date such amount is due and payable (whether on the Stated Maturity Date, upon
acceleration or otherwise) shall be payable upon demand.

         SECTION 3.3. Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay the fees set forth in
this Section 3.3. All such fees shall be non-refundable.

         SECTION 3.3.1. Commitment Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender that has a Revolving Loan
Commitment, for each day during the period (including any portion thereof when
any of the Lenders' Revolving Loan Commitments are suspended by reason of the
Borrower's inability to satisfy any condition of Article V) commencing on the
Closing Date and continuing to but excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment
Termination Date, a commitment fee on such Lender's Percentage of the unused
portion of the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount, whether or not then available,
for such day at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Commitment Fee for
such day. Such commitment fees shall be payable by the Borrower in arrears on
each Quarterly Payment Date, commencing with the first such day following the
Closing Date, and on the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date. The making
of Swing Line Loans by the Swing Line Lender shall not constitute usage under
the Revolving Loan Commitment for the purpose of calculating the 


                                     -53-
<PAGE>

commitment fees to be paid by the Borrower to the Lenders (other than the Swing
Line Lender) pursuant to this Section 3.3.1.

         SECTION 3.3.2. Syndication Agent's, Administrative Agent's and
Arranger's Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to each of the Syndication Agent,
the Administrative Agent and the Arranger for each such Person's own account,
the fees set forth in the Fee Letter and the Administrative Agent's Fee Letter
in accordance with their respective terms.

         SECTION 3.3.3.  Letter of Credit Fee.  The Borrower agrees to pay to

                  (a) the Administrative Agent, for the pro rata account of the
         Issuer and each other Lender that has a Revolving Loan Commitment, a
         Letter of Credit fee for each day on which there shall be any Letters
         of Credit outstanding in an amount equal to the product of (i) a rate
         per annum equal to the then Applicable Margin for Revolving Loans
         maintained as LIBO Rate Loans multiplied by (ii) the Stated Amount of
         each such Letter of Credit; and

                  (b) the Issuer (i) a Letter of Credit fronting fee for each
         day on which there shall be any Letters of Credit outstanding in an
         amount equal to 0.25% per annum on the Stated Amount of each such
         Letter of Credit, and (ii) from time to time promptly after demand,
         the normal issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing
         fees, and other standard administrative costs and charges of the
         Issuer relating to Letters of Credit as from time to time in effect.

Fees payable pursuant to this Section shall be payable quarterly in arrears on
each Quarterly Payment Date and on the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination
Date.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                     CERTAIN LIBO RATE AND OTHER PROVISIONS

         SECTION 4.1. LIBO Rate Lending Unlawful. If any Lender shall determine
(which determination shall, upon notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders, be conclusive and binding on the Borrower) that the introduction of or
any change in or in the interpretation of any law makes it unlawful, or any
central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for
such Lender to make, continue or maintain any Loan as, or to convert any Loan
into, a LIBO Rate Loan, the obligations of such Lender to make, continue,
maintain or convert any Loans as or to LIBO Rate Loans shall, upon such
determination, forthwith be suspended until such Lender shall notify the
Administrative Agent that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer
exist (with the date of such notice being the "Reinstatement Date"), and (a)
all LIBO Rate Loans previously made by such Lender shall automatically convert
into Base Rate Loans at the end of the then current Interest Periods with
respect thereto or sooner, if required by such law or assertion and (b) all
Loans thereafter made by such Lender and 


                                     -54-
<PAGE>

outstanding prior to the Reinstatement Date shall be made as Base Rate Loans,
with interest thereon being payable on the same date that interest is payable
with respect to the corresponding Borrowing of LIBO Rate Loans made by Lenders
not so affected.

         SECTION 4.2. Deposits Unavailable. If the Administrative Agent shall
have determined that (a) Dollar deposits in the relevant amount and for the
relevant Interest Period are not available to the Administrative Agent in its
relevant market, or (b) by reason of circumstances affecting the Administrative
Agent's relevant market, adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the
interest rate applicable hereunder to LIBO Rate Loans, then, upon notice from
the Administrative Agent to the Borrower and the Lenders, the obligations of
all Lenders under Sections 2.3 and 2.4 to make or continue any Loans as, or to
convert any Loans into, LIBO Rate Loans shall forthwith be suspended until the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

         SECTION 4.3. Increased LIBO Rate Loan Costs, etc. The Borrower agrees
to reimburse each Lender for any increase in the cost to such Lender of, or any
reduction in the amount of any sum receivable by such Lender in respect of,
making, continuing or maintaining (or of its obligation to make, continue or
maintain) any Loans as, or of converting (or of its obligation to convert) any
Loans into, LIBO Rate Loans. Such Lender shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower in writing of the occurrence of any such
event, such notice to state, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and the
additional amount required fully to compensate such Lender for such increased
cost or reduced amount. Such additional amounts shall be payable by the
Borrower directly to such Lender within five days of its receipt of such
notice, and such notice shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive
and binding on the Borrower.

         SECTION 4.4. Funding Losses. In the event any Lender shall incur any
loss or expense (including any loss or expense incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender
to make, continue or maintain any portion of the principal amount of any Loan
as, or to convert any portion of the principal amount of any Loan into, a LIBO
Rate Loan) as a result of (i) any conversion or repayment or prepayment of the
principal amount of any LIBO Rate Loans on a date other than the scheduled last
day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, whether pursuant to Section 3.1
or otherwise, (ii) any Loans not being made as LIBO Rate Loans in accordance
with the Borrowing Request therefor, or (iii) any Loans not being continued as,
or converted into, LIBO Rate Loans in accordance with the
Continuation/Conversion Notice therefor, then, upon the written notice of such
Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower
shall, within five days of its receipt thereof, pay directly to such Lender
such amount as will (in the reasonable determination of such Lender) reimburse
such Lender for such loss or expense. Such written notice (which shall include
calculations in reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive and binding on the Borrower.

         SECTION 4.5. Increased Capital Costs. If any change in, or the
introduction, adoption, effectiveness, interpretation, reinterpretation or
phase-in of, any law or regulation, directive, 


                                     -55-
<PAGE>

guideline, decision or request (whether or not having the force of law) of any
court, central bank, regulator or other governmental authority affects or would
affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any
Lender, the Issuer or any Person controlling such Lender or the Issuer, and
such Lender or the Issuer determines (in its sole and reasonable discretion)
that the rate of return on its or such controlling Person's capital as a
consequence of its Commitments, participation in, or the issuance or extension
of, any Letter of Credit or any Loan made by such Lender or the Issuer is
reduced to a level below that which such Lender, the Issuer or such controlling
Person could have achieved but for the occurrence of any such circumstance,
then, in any such case upon notice from time to time by such Lender or the
Issuer to the Borrower, the Borrower shall immediately pay directly to such
Lender or the Issuer additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender,
the Issuer or such controlling Person for such reduction in rate of return. A
statement of such Lender or the Issuer as to any such additional amount or
amounts (including calculations thereof in reasonable detail) shall, in the
absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the Borrower. In
determining such amount, such Lender or the Issuer may use any method of
averaging and attribution that it (in its sole and absolute discretion) shall
deem applicable.

         SECTION 4.6. Taxes. (a) All payments by the Borrower of principal of,
and interest on, the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder (including
Reimbursement Obligations, fees and expenses) shall be made free and clear of
and without deduction for any present or future income, excise, stamp or
franchise taxes and other taxes, fees, duties, withholdings or other charges of
any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority, but excluding franchise
taxes and other taxes imposed on or measured by any Agent's, the Documentation
Agent's, the Issuer's or any Lender's net income or receipts (such non-excluded
items being called "Taxes"). In the event that any withholding or deduction
from any payment to be made by the Borrower hereunder is required in respect of
any Taxes pursuant to any applicable law, rule or regulation, then the Borrower
will (i) pay directly to the relevant taxing authority the full amount required
to be so withheld or deducted, (ii) promptly forward to the Administrative
Agent an official receipt or other documentation satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent evidencing such payment to such authority, and (iii) pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Agent, the Documentation
Agent, the Issuer or such Lender such additional amount or amounts as is
necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by such Agent, the
Documentation Agent, the Issuer or such Lender will equal the full amount such
Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer or such Lender would have received
had no such withholding or deduction been required.

         Moreover, if any Taxes are directly asserted against any Agent, the
Documentation Agent, the Issuer or any Lender with respect to any payment
received by such Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer or such Lender
hereunder, such Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer or such Lender may
pay such Taxes and the Borrower will promptly pay to such Person such
additional amounts (including any penalties, interest or expenses) as is
necessary in order that the net amount received by such Person after the
payment of such taxes (including any Taxes on such additional amount) shall
equal the amount such Person would have received had such Taxes not been
asserted.

                                     -56-
<PAGE>

         If the Borrower fails to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate
taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent, for the account
of the respective Lenders, the required receipts or other required documentary
evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Lenders for any incremental Taxes,
interest or penalties that may become payable by any Lender as a result of any
such failure. For purposes of this Section 4.6, a distribution hereunder by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to or for the account of any Lender shall be
deemed a payment by the Borrower.

         (b) Upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, each
Lender that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United
States shall, on or prior to the due date of any payments under this Agreement
to such Lender, provide two or more (as the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent may reasonably request) United States Internal Revenue Service Forms 4224
or Forms 1001 or, solely if such Lender is claiming exemption from United
States withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect
to payments of "portfolio interest", United States Internal Revenue Service
Forms W-8 and a certificate signed by a duly authorized officer of such Lender
representing that such Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section
881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, or such other forms or documents (or successor forms
or documents), appropriately completed, as may be applicable to establish the
extent, if any, to which a payment to such Lender are exempt from withholding
or deduction of Taxes.

         SECTION 4.7. Payments, Computations, etc. Unless otherwise expressly
provided, all payments by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document shall be made by the Borrower
to the Administrative Agent for the pro rata account of the Lenders, the
Documentation Agent, the Agents or the Arranger, as applicable, entitled to
receive such payment. All such payments required to be made to the
Administrative Agent shall be made, without setoff, deduction or counterclaim,
not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date due, in same day or
immediately available funds, to such account as the Administrative Agent shall
specify from time to time by notice to the Borrower. Funds received after that
time shall be deemed to have been received by the Administrative Agent on the
next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall promptly remit in
same day funds to each Lender, the Documentation Agent, each Agent or the
Arranger, as the case may be, its share, if any, of such payments received by
the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, the Documentation
Agent, such Agent or the Arranger, as the case may be. All interest and fees
shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days (including the
first day but excluding the last day) occurring during the period for which
such interest or fee is payable over a year comprised of 360 days (or, in the
case of interest on a Base Rate Loan that is not calculated at the Federal
Funds Rate, 365 days or, if appropriate, 366 days). Whenever any payment to be
made shall otherwise be due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment
shall (except as otherwise required by clause (a) of the definition of the term
"Interest Period") be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such
extension of time shall be included in computing interest and fees, if any, in
connection with such payment.

                                     -57-

         SECTION 4.8. Sharing of Payments. If any Lender shall obtain any
payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of
setoff or otherwise) on account of any Loan or Reimbursement Obligations (other
than pursuant to the terms of Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5) in excess of its pro
rata share of payments then or therewith obtained by all Lenders entitled
thereto, such Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such participations
in the Credit Extensions made by them as shall be necessary to cause such
purchasing Lender to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably with
each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of the excess
payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender,
the purchase shall be rescinded and each Lender which has sold a participation
to the purchasing Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase
price to the ratable extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to
such selling Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the
amount of such selling Lender's required repayment to the purchasing Lender in
respect of such recovery, to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower
agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender
pursuant to this Section may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise
all its rights of payment (including pursuant to Section 4.9) with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation. If under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured
claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section applies, such Lender shall, to
the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in
a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this Section
to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

         SECTION 4.9. Setoff. Each Lender shall, upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default described in clauses (a) through (d) of Section 8.1.9 or, with
the consent of the Required Lenders, upon the occurrence of any other Event of
Default, to the fullest extent permitted by law, have the right to appropriate
and apply to the payment of the Obligations then owing to it (whether or not
then due), and (as security for such Obligations) the Borrower hereby grants to
each Lender a continuing security interest in, any and all balances, credits,
deposits, accounts or moneys of the Borrower then or thereafter maintained with
or otherwise held by such Lender; provided, however, that any such
appropriation and application shall be subject to the provisions of Section
4.8. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender; provided,
however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of
such setoff and application. The rights of each Lender under this Section are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff
under applicable law or otherwise) which such Lender may have.

         SECTION 4.10. Replacement of Lenders. Each Lender hereby severally
agrees as set forth in this Section. If any Lender (an "Affected Lender") makes
demand upon the Borrower for (or if the Borrower is otherwise required to pay)
amounts pursuant to Section 4.3, 4.5 or 4.6 and the payment of such additional
amounts are, and are likely to continue to be, more onerous in the reasonable
judgment of the Borrower than with respect to the other Lenders, the Borrower
may, within 30 days of receipt by the Borrower of such demand or notice (or the
occurrence of 
                                     -58-
<PAGE>

such other event causing the Borrower to be required to pay such compensation),
as the case may be, give notice (a "Replacement Notice") in writing to the
Agents and such Affected Lender of its intention to replace such Affected
Lender with a financial institution (a "Replacement Lender") designated in such
Replacement Notice. If the Agents shall, in the exercise of their reasonable
discretion and within 30 days of their receipt of such Replacement Notice,
notify the Borrower and such Affected Lender in writing that the designated
financial institution is satisfactory to the Agents (such consent not being
required where the Replacement Lender is already a Lender), then such Affected
Lender shall, subject to the payment of any amounts due pursuant to Section
4.4, assign, in accordance with Section 11.11.1, all of its Commitments, Loans,
Notes and other rights and obligations under this Agreement and all other Loan
Documents (including Reimbursement Obligations, if applicable) to such
designated financial institution; provided, however, that (i) such assignment
shall be without recourse, representation or warranty and shall be on terms and
conditions reasonably satisfactory to such Affected Lender and such designated
financial institution, (ii) the purchase price paid by such designated
financial institution shall be in the amount of such Affected Lender's Loans
and its Percentage of outstanding Reimbursement Obligations, together with all
accrued and unpaid interest and fees in respect thereof, plus all other amounts
(including the amounts demanded and unreimbursed under Sections 4.3, 4.5 and
4.6), owing to such Affected Lender hereunder and (iii) the Borrower shall pay
to the Affected Lender and the Agents all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Affected Lender and the Agents in connection with such
assignment and assumption (including the processing fees described in Section
11.11.1). Upon the effective date of an assignment described above, the
Replacement Lender shall become a "Lender" for all purposes under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

Borrower acknowledges that the Agents, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer and
each Lender is entering into this Agreement, and is extending its Commitments,
in reliance upon the subordination provisions of such Senior Subordinated Note

damage exceed, in each such case, $500,000 per occurrence) and will, upon
request of the Agents, furnish to the Agents, the Documentation Agent and each
Lender a certificate of an Authorized Officer of the Borrower setting forth the
nature and extent of all insurance maintained by each of the Borrower, each
Parent Guarantor and each of their respective Subsidiaries in accordance with
this Section. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the


                                     -74-

Borrower and each Parent Guarantor will, and will cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, ensure that:

                  (a) Each policy for property insurance shall show the
         Administrative Agent as loss payee.

                  (b) Each policy for liability insurance shall show the
         Administrative Agent as an additional insured.

                  (c) With respect to each life insurance policy, the Borrower,
         such Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall
         execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a collateral
         assignment, notice of which has been acknowledged in writing by the
         insurer.

                  (d) Each insurance policy shall provide that at least 30
         days' prior written notice of cancellation or of lapse shall be given
         to the Administrative Agent by the insurer.

                  (e) The Borrower, such Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary,
         as the case may be, shall, if so requested by the Administrative
         Agent, deliver to the Administrative Agent a copy of each insurance
         policy.

         SECTION 7.1.5. Books and Records. Each of the Borrower and each Parent
Guarantor will, and will cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, (a)
keep books and records which accurately reflect in all material respects all of
its business affairs and transactions and (b) permit the Agents, the
Documentation Agent, the Issuer and each Lender or any of their respective
representatives, at reasonable times and intervals, and upon reasonable notice,
(i) to visit all of its offices, (ii) to discuss its financial matters with its
officers and, after notice to the Borrower and provision of an opportunity for
the Borrower to participate in such discussion, its independent public
accountant (and each of the Borrower and each Parent Guarantor hereby
authorizes, and will cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to authorize,
such independent public accountant to discuss the Borrower's, such Parent
Guarantor's or such Subsidiary's financial matters with the Issuer and each
Lender or its representatives whether or not any representative of the
Borrower, such Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary is present, so long as the
Borrower, such Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary has been afforded a
reasonable opportunity to be present) and (iii) to examine, and photocopy
extracts from, any of its books or other corporate or partnership records. The
cost and expense of one such visit (the "Paid Visit") by each Agent in each
Fiscal Year shall be borne by the Borrower; provided, however, that the cost
and expenses of any visit made by such Agent after a Default or an Event of
Default has occurred and is then continuing shall be for the account of the
Borrower and shall not count as the Paid Visit made by such Agent.

         SECTION 7.1.6. Environmental Covenant. Each of the Borrower and each
Parent Guarantor will, and will cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to,


                                     -75-
<PAGE>

 

                  (a) use and operate all of its facilities and properties in
         material compliance with all Environmental Laws, keep all necessary

         compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws;

                  (b) (i) ensure that the 10,000 gallon steel underground
         storage tank located at the Borrower's facility at 49-29 30th Place,
         Long Island City, New York, is tested in accordance with accepted
         industry procedures within three months from the Closing Date by an
         environmental consulting firm reasonably acceptable to the Syndication
         Agent and (ii) take corrective measures in accordance with accepted
         industry procedures to ensure the Borrower's compliance with all
         applicable federal and state rules and regulations if leakage is
         found;

                  (c) immediately notify the Agents and provide copies upon
         receipt of all written claims, complaints, notices or inquiries
         relating to the condition of its facilities and properties or
         compliance with Environmental Laws; and

                  (d) provide such information and certifications which the
         Agents may reasonably request from time to time to evidence compliance
         with this Section 7.1.6.

         SECTION 7.1.7. Future Subsidiaries. Each of the Borrower and each
Parent Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that, upon any Person becoming,
after the Closing Date, a Subsidiary of the Borrower, or (in the case of clause
(b) below only) upon the Borrower or any Subsidiary acquiring additional
Capital Stock of any existing Subsidiary, the Borrower shall notify the Agents
of such acquisition, and

                  (a) the Borrower shall promptly cause such Subsidiary to
         execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, with counterparts for
         each Lender, a Subsidiary Guaranty (or a supplement thereto in the
         form of the exhibit thereto), the Subsidiary Security Agreement (or a
         supplement thereto in the form of the exhibit thereto) (and, if such
         Subsidiary owns any real property, a Mortgage) and a Perfection
         Certificate, together with Uniform Commercial Code financing
         statements (form UCC-1) executed and delivered by the Subsidiary
         naming the Subsidiary as the debtor and the Administrative Agent as
         the secured party, or other similar instruments or documents, in
         appropriate form for filing under the Uniform Commercial Code and any
         other applicable recording statutes, in the case of real property, of
         all jurisdictions as may be necessary or, in the opinion of the
         Administrative Agent, desirable to perfect the security interest of
         the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Subsidiary Security Agreement
         or a Mortgage, as the case may be; and

                  (b) the Borrower shall promptly deliver the Borrower Pledge
         Agreement to the Agents, duly executed and delivered by an Authorized
         Officer of the Borrower (unless so executed and delivered previously),
         and shall promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, 


                                     -76-
<PAGE>

         the Subsidiary Pledge Agreement to the Agents, duly executed and
         delivered by an Authorized Officer of the relevant Subsidiary (unless
         so executed and delivered previously), and shall promptly deliver, or
         cause to be delivered, to the Administrative Agent under a Pledge
         Agreement (or a supplement thereto) certificates (if any) representing
         all of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of such
         Subsidiary owned by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower, as
         the case may be, along with undated stock powers for such
         certificates, executed in blank, or, if any securities subject thereto
         are uncertificated securities or are held through a financial
         intermediary, confirmation and evidence satisfactory to the Agents
         that appropriate book entries have been made in the relevant books or
         records of a financial intermediary or the issuer of such securities,
         as the case may be, or other appropriate steps shall have been taken
         under applicable law resulting in the perfection of the security
         interest granted in favor of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the
         terms of a Pledge Agreement;

together, in each case, with such opinions, in form and substance and from
counsel satisfactory to the Agents, as the Agents may reasonably request;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, no Foreign Subsidiary
shall be required to execute and deliver (x) a Mortgage or the Subsidiary
Security Agreement (or a supplement thereto) or (y) the Subsidiary Guaranty (or
a supplement thereto) in the event that such execution and delivery thereof
would result in a material increase in tax or similar liabilities for the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, nor will the Borrower
or any Subsidiary of the Borrower be required to deliver in pledge pursuant to
a Pledge Agreement in excess of 65% of the total combined voting power of all
classes of Capital Stock of a Foreign Subsidiary entitled to vote in the event
that such pledge would result in a material increase in tax or similar
liabilities for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis.

         SECTION 7.1.8. Future Leased Property and Future Acquisitions of Real
Property; Future Acquisition of Other Property. (a) Prior to entering into any
new lease of real property or renewing any existing lease of real property
following the Closing Date, each of the Borrower and each Parent Guarantor
shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries that is not a
Foreign Subsidiary to, use its (and their) commercially reasonable best efforts
(which shall not require the expenditure of cash or the making of any material
concessions under the relevant lease) to deliver to the Administrative Agent a
Waiver executed by the lessor of any real property that is to be leased by the
Borrower, such Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary for a term in excess of one
year in any state which by statute grants such lessor a "landlord's" (or
similar) Lien which is superior to the Administrative Agent's.

         (b) In the event that the Borrower, any Parent Guarantor or any of
their respective Subsidiaries that is not Foreign Subsidiary shall acquire any
real property having a value as determined in good faith by the Agents in
excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate, the Borrower, such Parent Guarantor or
such Subsidiary shall, promptly after such acquisition, execute a Mortgage and
provide the Agents with (i) evidence of the completion (or satisfactory
arrangements for the completion) of all recordings and filings of such Mortgage
as may be necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of the Agents, desirable
effectively to create a valid, 


                                     -77-
<PAGE>

perfected first priority Lien, subject to Liens permitted by Section 7.2.3,
against the properties purported to be covered thereby, (ii) mortgagee's title
insurance policies in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the
Secured Parties in amounts and in form and substance and issued by insurers,
reasonably satisfactory to the Agents, with respect to the property purported
to be covered by such Mortgage, insuring that title to such property is
marketable and that the interests created by the Mortgage constitute valid
first Liens thereon free and clear of all defects and encumbrances other than
as approved by the Agents, and such policies shall also include a revolving
credit endorsement and such other endorsements as the Agents shall request and
shall be accompanied by evidence of the payment in full of all premiums
thereon, and (iii) such other approvals, opinions, or documents as the Agents
may reasonably request.

         (c) In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Security
Documents, provide the Agents with evidence of all recordings and filings as
may be necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of the Agents, desirable to
create a valid, perfected first priority Lien, subject to the Liens permitted
by Section 7.2.3, against all property acquired after the Closing Date
(excluding leases of real property) and not otherwise subject to Section 5.1.7.

         SECTION 7.1.9. Use of Proceeds, etc. The Borrower shall, and each
Parent Guarantor shall cause the Borrower to,

                  (a)  apply the proceeds of the Loans

                                    (i) to (A) make a distribution on the
                           Closing Date to Holdings to enable Holdings to
                           defease and redeem the Holdings Subordinated Notes,
                           (B) defease and redeem the Senior Notes and (C)
                           refinance existing Indebtedness of the Borrower
                           under the Existing Credit Agreement and to pay any
                           and all accrued interest, prepayment premiums and
                           reasonable fees and expenses associated with the
                           Transaction; and

                                    (ii) in the case of Revolving Loans and
                           Swing Line Loans, for the general corporate purposes
                           of (A) the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including
                           working capital needs and financing for store
                           expansions and acquisitions and (B) Holdings, to the
                           extent permitted under Section 7.2.6; and

                  (b) use Letters of Credit only for purposes of supporting
         working capital and general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its
         Subsidiaries.

         SECTION 7.1.10. Hedging Obligations. Within nine months following the
Closing Date, the Syndication Agent shall have received evidence satisfactory
to it that the Borrower has entered into Rate Protection Agreements designed to
protect the Borrower against fluctuations in interest rates with respect to the
Term Loans with terms reasonably satisfactory to the Syndication Agent.

                                     -78-
<PAGE>

         SECTION 7.1.11. Redemptions. (a) Holdings shall redeem all outstanding
Holdings Subordinated Notes at a price of no more than 107.5% of the Accreted
Value thereof no later than March 16, 1998, on terms and conditions (including
in respect of all documentation related thereto) reasonably satisfactory to the
Syndication Agent.

         (b) The Borrower shall redeem all of its outstanding Senior Notes at a
price of no more than 104.5% of the principal amount thereof no later than
March 16, 1998, on terms and conditions (including in respect of all
documentation related thereto) reasonably satisfactory to the Syndication
Agent.

         SECTION 7.1.12. Maintenance of Corporate Separateness. Each Parent
Guarantor will satisfy customary corporate formalities, including the
maintenance of corporate records. Each Parent Guarantor shall not make any
payment to a creditor of any other Obligor in respect of any liability of such
Obligor (other than pursuant to a Contingent Liability permitted hereunder),
and no bank account of such Parent Guarantor shall be commingled with any bank
account of any other Obligor. Any financial statements distributed to any
creditors of any Parent Guarantor shall, to the extent permitted by GAAP,
clearly establish the corporate separateness of such Parent Guarantor from each
other Obligor. Finally, each Parent Guarantor shall not take any action, or
conduct its affairs in a manner, which is likely to result in the corporate
existence of such Parent Guarantor on the one hand and of any other Obligor on
the other hand being ignored, or in the assets and liabilities of such other
Obligor being substantively consolidated with those of such Parent Guarantor in
a bankruptcy, reorganization or other insolvency proceeding.

         SECTION 7.1.13. Borrower Indebtedness. Any Indebtedness of the
Borrower now or hereafter held by any Parent Guarantor or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (other than the Borrower) is hereby subordinated to the
Indebtedness of the Borrower to the Agents, the Issuer and the Lenders; and
such indebtedness of the Borrower to such Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary,
if the Agents, after an Event of Default has occurred, so requests, shall be
collected, enforced and received by such Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary as
trustee for the Agents, the Issuer and the Lenders and be paid over to the
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Agents, the Issuer and the Lenders on
account of the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Agents, the Issuer and the
Lenders, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the obligations of
such Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary hereunder or under each other Loan
Document to which it is a party. Prior to the transfer by any Parent Guarantor
or any their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Borrower) of any note or
negotiable instrument evidencing any indebtedness of the Borrower to such
Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary, such Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary
shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is
subject to this subordination.

         SECTION 7.2. Negative Covenants. Each of the Borrower and each Parent
Guarantor agrees with the Agents, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer and each
Lender that, until all Commitments have terminated, all Letters of Credit have
terminated or expired and all 


                                     -79-
<PAGE>

Obligations have been paid and performed in full, each of the Borrower and each
Parent Guarantor will perform the obligations set forth in this Section 7.2.

         SECTION 7.2.1. Business Activities. (a) The Borrower will not, and
will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, engage in any business activity,
except business activities of the type in which the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries are engaged on the date hereof and such activities as may be
incidental, similar or related thereto.

         (b) No Parent Guarantor will engage in any business activity other
than (i) its continuing ownership of (A) in the case of Holdings, its 99%
general partnership interest in the Borrower and all the shares of Capital
Stock of DRI I and (B) in the case of DRI I, its 1% general partnership
interest in the Borrower, and (ii) its compliance with all applicable laws,
rules and regulations (including SEC reporting requirements) and the
obligations applicable to it under the Loan Documents and the Material
Documents to which such Parent Guarantor is a party. Without limiting the
generality of the immediately preceding sentence, no Parent Guarantor will take
any action, including the filing of any income tax return, that would result in
the Borrower ceasing to be treated as a partnership within meaning of Section
761(a) of the Code for Federal income tax purposes.

         SECTION 7.2.2. Indebtedness. Each of the Borrower and each Parent
Guarantor will not, and will not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries
to, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist or otherwise become or be liable
in respect of any Indebtedness, other than, without duplication, the following:

                  (a) Indebtedness in respect of the Credit Extensions and
         other Obligations;

                  (b) until the Closing Date, Indebtedness identified in Item
         7.2.2(b) ("Indebtedness to be Paid") of the Disclosure Schedule;

                  (c) Indebtedness identified in Item 7.2.2(c) ("Ongoing
         Indebtedness") of the Disclosure Schedule;

         Subordinated Notes and (ii) Indebtedness of the Borrower, DRI I and
         each other Subsidiary of Holdings consisting of Contingent Liabilities
         under the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees in respect of the
         Indebtedness described in clause (d)(i);

                  (e) Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount not to
         exceed $15,000,000 at any time outstanding which is, or has been,
         incurred by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) to a vendor of
         any assets permitted to be acquired pursuant to Section 7.2.7 to
         finance its acquisition of such assets or (ii) in respect of
         Capitalized Lease Liabilities to the extent permitted by Section
         7.2.7;

                  (f) Indebtedness of the Borrower owing to any Subsidiary
         Guarantor;

<PAGE>

                  (g) Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantors that are
         Wholly-owned Subsidiaries of the Borrower owing to the Borrower or any
         other Subsidiary Guarantor;

                  (h) Indebtedness of Subsidiaries of the Borrower owing to the
         Borrower or a Subsidiary Guarantor to the extent permitted by clause
         (e) of Section 7.2.5;

                  (i) Hedging Obligations of the Borrower in respect of the
         Loans;

                  (j) unsecured Indebtedness of the Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries incurred in the ordinary course of business (including
         open accounts extended by suppliers on normal trade terms in
         connection with purchases of goods and services, but excluding
         Indebtedness incurred through the borrowing of money or Contingent
         Liabilities);

                  (k) Indebtedness of the Borrower incurred under the Rapid
         Remit Program in an aggregate amount at any time outstanding not to
         exceed $5,000,000;

                  (l) Indebtedness which refinances Indebtedness permitted by
         clause (c) and (d) above; provided, however, that after giving effect
         to such refinancing, (i) the principal amount of outstanding
         Indebtedness is not increased (other than in the case of a refinancing
         of Indebtedness permitted by clause (d) above by the amount of
         reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with such
         refinancing), (ii) neither the tenor nor the average life thereof is
         reduced, (iii) the respective obligor or obligors shall be the same on
         the refinancing Indebtedness as on the Indebtedness being refinanced,
         (iv) the security, if any, for the refinancing Indebtedness shall be
         the same as that for the Indebtedness being refinanced (except to the
         extent that less security is granted to holders of such refinancing
         Indebtedness), (v) the holders of such refinancing Indebtedness are
         not afforded covenants, defaults, rights or remedies more burdensome
         to the obligor or obligors than those contained in the Indebtedness
         being refinanced and (vi) the refinancing Indebtedness is subordinated
         to the same degree, if any, as the Indebtedness being refinanced; and

                  (m) other unsecured Indebtedness of the Borrower and its
         Subsidiaries in an aggregate amount at any time outstanding not to
         exceed $7,500,000;

provided, however, that (i) no Indebtedness otherwise permitted by clause (e)
or (m) may be incurred if, after giving effect to the incurrence thereof, any
Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) no Indebtedness
otherwise permitted hereunder by any of clauses (a) through (m) may be incurred
if, after giving effect to the application thereof, there shall be a "Default"
or "Event of Default" under and as defined in the Senior Subordinated Note
Indenture, as in effect on the Closing Date.

         SECTION 7.2.3. Liens. Each of the Borrower and each Parent Guarantor
will not, and will not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, create,
incur, assume or suffer to exist any 


                                     -81-

Lien upon any of its property, revenues or assets, whether now owned or
hereafter acquired, except:

         Obligations owed to any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender, granted
         pursuant to any Loan Document;

                  (b) until the Closing Date, Liens securing payment of

         SECTION 9.1. Guaranty. Each Parent Guarantor hereby jointly and
severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably

                  (a) guarantees the full and punctual payment when due,
         whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration,
         acceleration, demand or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Borrower
         now or hereafter existing, whether for principal, interest,



                                     -93-
<PAGE>

         fees, expenses or otherwise (including all such amounts which would
         become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section
         362(a) of the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. ss.362(a), and
         the operation of Sections 502(b) and 506(b) of the United States
         Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. ss.502(b) and ss.506(b)), and

                  (b) indemnifies and holds harmless each Secured Party and
         each holder of a Note for any and all costs and expenses (including
         reasonable attorney's fees and expenses) incurred by such Secured
         Party or such holder, as the case may be, in enforcing any rights
         under the guaranty set forth in this Article IX.

The guaranty set forth in this Article IX constitutes a guaranty of payment
when due and not of collection, and each Parent Guarantor specifically agrees
that it shall not be necessary or required that any Secured Party or any holder
of any Note exercise any right, assert any claim or demand or enforce any
remedy whatsoever against the Borrower or any other Obligor (or any other
Person) before or as a condition to the obligations of each Parent Guarantor
under the guaranty set forth in this Article IX.

         SECTION 9.2. Acceleration of Parent Guaranty. Each Parent Guarantor
agrees that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default of the nature set forth
in clauses (a) through (d) of Section 8.1.9, at a time when any of the
Obligations of the Borrower and each other Obligor may not then be due and
payable, then each Parent Guarantor agrees that it will pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Secured Parties forthwith the full
amount which would be payable under the guaranty set forth in this Article IX
by each Parent Guarantor if all such Obligations were then due and payable.

         SECTION 9.3. Guaranty Absolute, etc. The guaranty set forth in this
Article IX shall in all respects be a continuing, absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable guaranty of payment, and shall remain in full force and effect
until all Obligations of the Borrower and each other Obligor have been paid in
full in cash, all obligations of each Parent Guarantor under the guaranty set
forth in this Article IX shall have been paid in full in cash, all Letters of
Credit have been terminated or expired, all Rate Protection Agreements have
been terminated or expired and all Commitments shall have terminated. Each
Parent Guarantor guarantees that the Obligations of the Borrower will be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and each other Loan
Document under which they arise, regardless of any law, regulation or order now
or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the
rights of any Secured Party or any holder of any Note with respect thereto. The
liability of each Parent Guarantor under the guaranty set forth in this Article
IX shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable irrespective of:

                  (a) any lack of validity, legality or enforceability of this
         Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document;

                  (b) the failure of any Secured Party or any holder of any
         Note

                           (i) to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any
                  right or remedy against the Borrower, any other Obligor or
                  any other Person (including any other guarantor (including
                  any Parent Guarantor)) under the provisions of this
                  Agreement, any Note, any other Loan Document or otherwise, or

                           (ii) to exercise any right or remedy against any
                  other guarantor (including any Parent Guarantor) of, or
                  collateral securing, any Obligations of the Borrower;

                  (c) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
         in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations of the Borrower,
         or any other extension, compromise or renewal of any Obligation of the
         Borrower;

                  (d) any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination of
         any Obligations of the Borrower for any reason, including any claim of
         waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be
         subject to (and the each Parent Guarantor hereby waives any right to
         or claim of) any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or
         termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality,
         nongenuineness, irregularity, compromise, unenforceability of, or any
         other event or occurrence affecting, any Obligations of the Borrower
         or otherwise;

                  (e) any amendment to, rescission, waiver, or other
         modification of, or any consent to departure from, any of the terms of
         this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document;

                  (f) any addition, exchange, release, surrender or
         non-perfection of any collateral, or any amendment to or waiver or
         release or addition of, or consent to departure from, any other
         guaranty, held by any Secured Party or any holder of any Note securing
         any of the Obligations of the Borrower; or

                  (g) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
         defense available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, the
         Borrower, any surety or any guarantor.

         SECTION 9.4. Reinstatement, etc. Each Parent Guarantor agrees that the
guaranty set forth in this Article IX shall continue to be effective or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment (in whole or in
part) of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by
any Secured Party or any holder of any Note, upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had not
been made.

         SECTION 9.5. Waiver, etc. Each Parent Guarantor hereby waives
promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice with respect
to any of the Obligations of the Borrower and the guaranty set forth in this
Article IX and any requirement that the Administrative Agent, any other Secured
Party or any holder of any Note protect, secure, perfect or insure any security
interest or Lien, or any property subject thereto, or exhaust any right or 


                                     -95-
<PAGE>

take any action against the Borrower, any other Obligor or any other Person
(including any other guarantor) or entity or any collateral securing the
Obligations of the Borrower.

         SECTION 9.6. Postponement of Subrogation, etc. Each Parent Guarantor
agrees that it will not exercise any rights which it may acquire by way of
rights of subrogation under the guaranty set forth in this Article IX, by any
payment made under the guaranty set forth in this Article IX or otherwise,
until the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations of the Borrower and
each other Obligor, the termination or expiration of all Letters of Credit, the
termination or expiration of all Rate Protection Agreements and the termination
of all Commitments. Any amount paid to any Parent Guarantor on account of any
such subrogation rights prior to the payment in full in cash of all Obligations
of the Borrower and each other Obligor shall be held in trust for the benefit
of the Secured Parties and each holder of a Note and shall immediately be paid
to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and each
holder of a Note and credited and applied against the Obligations of the
Borrower and each other Obligor, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that if

                  (a) each Guarantor has made payment to the Secured Parties
         and each holder of a Note of all or any part of the Obligations of the
         Borrower, and

                  (b) all Obligations of the Borrower and each other Obligor
         have been paid in full in cash, all Letters of Credit have been
         terminated or expired, all Rate Protection Agreements have been
         terminated or expired and all Commitments have been permanently
         terminated,

each Secured Party and each holder of a Note agrees that, at any Parent
Guarantor's request, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties
and the holders of the Notes, will execute and deliver to the applicable Parent
Guarantor appropriate documents (without recourse and without representation or
warranty) necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to such Parent
Guarantor of an interest in the Obligations of the Borrower resulting from such
payment by such Parent Guarantor. In furtherance of the foregoing, for so long
as any Obligations or Commitments remain outstanding, each Parent Guarantor
shall refrain from taking any action or commencing any proceeding against the
Borrower (or its successors or assigns, whether in connection with a bankruptcy
proceeding or otherwise) to recover any amounts in the respect of payments made
under the guaranty set forth in this Article IX to any Secured Party or any
holder of a Note.

         SECTION 9.7. Successors, Transferees and Assigns; Transfers of Notes,
etc. The guaranty set forth in this Article IX shall:

                  (a) be binding upon each Parent Guarantor and its successors,

                                     -96-
<PAGE>

                  (b) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
         Administrative Agent and each other Secured Party.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (b), any Lender may
assign or otherwise transfer (in whole or in part) any Note or Credit Extension
held by it to any other Person or entity, and such other Person or entity shall
thereupon become vested with all rights and benefits in respect thereof granted
to such Lender under any Loan Document (including the guaranty set forth in
this Article IX) or otherwise, subject, however, to any contrary provisions in
such assignment or transfer, and to the provisions of Section 11.11 and Article
X.


                                   ARTICLE X

                                   THE AGENTS

         SECTION 10.1. Actions. Each Lender hereby appoints DLJ as its
Syndication Agent and Fleet as its Administrative Agent under and for purposes
of this Agreement, the Notes and each other Loan Document. Each Lender
authorizes the Agents to act on behalf of such Lender under this Agreement, the
Notes and each other Loan Document and, in the absence of other written
instructions from the Required Lenders received from time to time by the Agents
(with respect to which each of the Agents agrees that it will comply, except as
otherwise provided in this Section or as otherwise advised by counsel), to
exercise such powers hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to
or required of the Agents by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such
powers as may be reasonably incidental thereto. Each Lender hereby indemnifies
(which indemnity shall survive any termination of this Agreement) the Agents,
ratably in accordance with their respective Term Loans outstanding and
Commitments (or, if no Term Loans or Commitments are at the time outstanding
and in effect, then ratably in accordance with the principal amount of Term
Loans held by such Lender, and their respective Commitments as in effect in
each case on the date of the termination of this Agreement), from and against
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs or
expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on,
incurred by, or asserted against, any of the Agents in any way relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Notes and any other Loan Document, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, and as to which any Agent is not reimbursed by the
Borrower or any other Obligor (and without limiting the obligation of the
Borrower or any other Obligor to do so); provided, however, that no Lender
shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses which are determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction in a final proceeding to have resulted solely
from such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Agents shall not
be required to take any action hereunder, under the Notes or under any other
Loan Document, or to prosecute or defend any suit in respect of this Agreement,
the Notes or any other Loan Document, unless it is indemnified hereunder to its
satisfaction. If any indemnity in favor of any of the Agents shall be or
become, in such Agent's determination, inadequate, such Agent may call for
additional indemnification from the Lenders and cease to do the acts
indemnified against hereunder until such additional indemnity is given.

                                     -97-
<PAGE>

         SECTION 10.2. Funding Reliance, etc. Unless the Administrative Agent
shall have been notified by telephone, confirmed in writing, by any Lender by
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day prior to a Borrowing that such Lender
will not make available the amount which would constitute its Percentage of
such Borrowing on the date specified therefor, the Administrative Agent may
assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative
Agent and, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have made
such amount available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender severally agrees
and the Borrower agrees to repay the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand
such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the
date the Administrative Agent made such amount available to the Borrower to the
date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at the interest rate
applicable at the time to Loans comprising such Borrowing.

         SECTION 10.3. Exculpation. None of the Agents, the Swing Line Lender,
the Issuer or the Arranger nor any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or agents shall be liable to any Lender for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or
in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own willful misconduct or
gross negligence, nor responsible for any recitals or warranties herein or
therein, nor for the effectiveness, enforceability, validity or due execution
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, nor for the creation, perfection
or priority of any Liens purported to be created by any of the Loan Documents,
or the validity, genuineness, enforceability, existence, value or sufficiency
of any collateral security, nor to make any inquiry respecting the performance
by the Borrower of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document.
Any such inquiry which may be made by any Agent, the Swing Line Lender or the
Issuer shall not obligate it to make any further inquiry or to take any action.
The Agents, the Swing Line Lender and the Issuer shall be entitled to rely upon
advice of counsel concerning legal matters and upon any notice, consent,
certificate, statement or writing which the Agents, the Swing Line Lender or
the Issuer, as applicable, believe to be genuine and to have been presented by
a proper Person.

         SECTION 10.4. Successor. The Syndication Agent may resign as such upon
one Business Day's notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent may resign as such at any time upon at least 30 days'
prior notice to the Borrower and all Lenders. If the Administrative Agent at
any time shall resign, the Required Lenders may, with the prior consent of the
Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), appoint another
Lender as a successor Administrative Agent which shall thereupon become the
Administrative Agent hereunder. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have
been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such
appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving
notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of
the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be one of
the Lenders or a commercial banking institution organized under the laws of the
United States or a United States branch or agency of a commercial banking
institution, and having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such 


                                     -98-
<PAGE>

successor Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive from the retiring
Administrative Agent such documents of transfer and assignment as such
successor Administrative Agent may reasonably request, and shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all rights, powers, privileges and duties of
the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall
be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any
retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as the Administrative
Agent, the provisions of (i) this Article X shall inure to its benefit as to
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative
Agent under this Agreement, and (ii) Section 11.3 and Section 11.4 shall
continue to inure to its benefit.

         SECTION 10.5. Credit Extensions by each Agent. Each Agent, the Swing
Line Lender and the Issuer shall have the same rights and powers with respect
to (x) (i) in the case of the Agents and the Swing Line Lender, the Credit
Extensions made by it or any of its Affiliates and (ii) in the case of the
Issuer, the Loans made by it or any of its Affiliates, and (y) the Notes held
by such Agent, the Swing Line Lender, the Issuer or any of their respective
Affiliates as any other Lender and may exercise the same as if it were not an
Agent or the Issuer. Each Agent, the Swing Line Lender, the Issuer and each and
their respective Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate of the Borrower as if such Agent, the Swing Line Lender or Issuer
were not an Agent, the Swing Line Lender or the Issuer hereunder.

         SECTION 10.6. Credit Decisions. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently of each Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Arranger, the Swing
Line Lender, the Issuer and each other Lender, and based on such Lender's
review of the financial information of the Borrower, this Agreement, the other
Loan Documents (the terms and provisions of which being satisfactory to such
Lender) and such other documents, information and investigations as such Lender
has deemed appropriate, made its own credit decision to extend its Commitments.
Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently of each Agent, the
Documentation Agent, the Arranger, the Swing Line Lender, the Issuer and each
other Lender, and based on such other documents, information and investigations
as it shall deem appropriate at any time, continue to make its own credit
decisions as to exercising or not exercising from time to time any rights and
privileges available to it under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

         SECTION 10.7. Copies, etc. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt
notice to each Lender and the Issuer of each notice or request required or
permitted to be given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement (unless concurrently delivered to the Lenders and
the Issuer by the Borrower). The Administrative Agent will distribute to each
Lender and the Issuer each document or instrument received for such Lender's or
the Issuers's account and copies of all other communications received by the
Administrative Agent from the Borrower for distribution to the Lenders and/or
the Issuer by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

         SECTION 10.8. The Swing Line Lender, the Issuer, the Documentation
Agent, the Syndication Agent and the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding
anything else to the contrary 


                                     -99-
<PAGE>

contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Swing Line Lender,
the Issuer, the Documentation Agent and the Agents, in their respective
capacities as such, each in such capacity, shall have no duties or
responsibilities under this Agreement or any other Loan Document nor any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or otherwise exist against the Swing Line Lender, the Issuer, the
Documentation Agent or any Agent, as applicable, in such capacity except as are
explicitly set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

         SECTION 11.1. Waivers, Amendments, etc. The provisions of this
Agreement and of each other Loan Document may from time to time be amended,
modified or waived, if such amendment, modification or waiver is in writing and
consented to by the Borrower and each Obligor party thereto and by the Required
Lenders; provided, however, that no such amendment, modification or waiver
which would:

                  (a) modify any requirement hereunder that any particular
         action be taken by all the Lenders or by the Required Lenders shall be
         effective unless consented to by each Lender;

         in Section 3.3.2), release any Guarantor from its obligations under
         any Guaranty, or release all or substantially all of the collateral
         security (except in each case as otherwise specifically provided in

         Agreement) or extend any Commitment Termination Date shall be made
         without the consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby;

                  (c) extend the due date for, or reduce the amount of, (i) any
         scheduled repayment or prepayment of principal of or interest on any
         Loan (or reduce the principal amount of or rate of interest on any
         Loan) or (ii) any repayment of any Reimbursement Obligation (or reduce
         the amount of or rate of interest on any Reimbursement Obligation)
         shall be made without the consent of the holder of the Note evidencing
         such Loan or, in the case of a Reimbursement Obligation, the Issuer
         owed, and those Lenders participating in, such Reimbursement
         Obligation;

                  (d) affect adversely the interests, rights or obligations of
         any Agent, the Swing Line Lender, the Issuer or the Arranger (in its

         Swing Line Lender, the Issuer or the Arranger, as the case may be; or

                  (e) have the effect (either immediately or at some later
         time) of enabling the Borrower to satisfy a condition precedent to the
         making of a Revolving Loan, the Swing Line Loan or the issuance of a
         Letter of Credit without the consent of Lenders holding at least 51%
         of the Revolving Loan Commitments; or

                  (f) amend, modify or waive the provisions of clause (a)(i) of

         modification or waiver that by its terms adversely affects the Lenders
         participating in any Tranche differently from those of Lenders
         participating in other Tranches, without the consent of the holders of
         the Notes evidencing greater than 50% of the aggregate amount of Loans
         outstanding under each Tranche affected by such modification, or, in
         the case of a modification affecting the Revolving Loan Commitment
         Amount, the Lenders holding greater than 50% of the Revolving Loan
         Commitments.

No failure or delay on the part of any Agent, the Issuer, any Lender or the
holder of any Note in exercising any power or right under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such power or right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. No notice to or
demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle it to any notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances. No waiver or approval by any Agent, the Issuer,
any Lender or the holder of any Note under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall, except as may be otherwise stated in such waiver or approval,
be applicable to subsequent transactions. No waiver or approval hereunder shall
require any similar or dissimilar waiver or approval thereafter to be granted
hereunder.

         SECTION 11.2. Notices. All notices and other communications provided
to any party hereto under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be in
writing or by facsimile and addressed, delivered or transmitted to such party
at its address or facsimile number set forth on its signature page hereto or on
Schedule II hereto or, in the case of a Lender that becomes a party hereto

received).

         SECTION 11.3. Payment of Costs and Expenses. The Borrower agrees to
pay on demand all reasonable expenses of each of the Agents and the Arranger
(including the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel to the
Agents and the Arranger and of local or foreign counsel, if any, who may be
retained by counsel to the Agents) in connection with

                                     -101-

         of the Loans, the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of

         other modifications to this Agreement or any other Loan Document as
         may from time to time hereafter be required, whether or not the

         amendments, supplements and modifications to any thereof and any and
         all other documents or instruments of further assurance required to be
         filed or recorded or refiled or rerecorded by the terms hereof or of
         such Pledge Agreement, Security Agreement or Uniform Commercial Code
         financial statements; and

                  (c) the preparation and review of the form of any document or
         instrument relevant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

The Borrower further agrees to pay, and to save the Agents, the Documentation
Agent, the Arranger, the Issuer and the Lenders harmless from all liability
for, any stamp or other similar taxes which may be payable in connection with
the execution or delivery of this Agreement, the Credit Extensions made
hereunder or the issuance of the Notes or Letters of Credit or any other Loan
Documents. The Borrower also agrees to reimburse each Agent, the Documentation
Agent, the Arranger, the Issuer and each Lender upon demand for all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal
expenses) incurred by such Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Arranger, the
Issuer or such Lender in connection with (x) the negotiation of any
restructuring or "work-out", whether or not consummated, of any Obligations and
(y) the enforcement of any Obligations.

         SECTION 11.4. Indemnification. In consideration of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by each Lender and the extension of the Commitments,
the Borrower hereby, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law,
indemnifies, exonerates and holds each Agent, the Documentation Agent, the
Arranger, the Issuer, and each Lender and each of their respective Affiliates,

the "Indemnified Parties"), free and harmless from and against any and all
actions, causes of action, suits, losses, costs, liabilities and damages, and
expenses actually incurred in connection therewith (irrespective of whether any
such Indemnified Party is a party to the action for which indemnification
hereunder is sought), including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements
(collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), incurred by the Indemnified
Parties or any of them as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to

                  (a) any transaction financed or to be financed in whole or in
         part, directly or indirectly, with the proceeds of any Credit
         Extension;

                                     -102-
<PAGE>

                  (b) the entering into and performance of this Agreement and
         any other Loan Document by any of the Indemnified Parties (including
         any action brought by or on behalf of the Borrower as the result of
         any determination by any Lender to make any Credit Extension
         hereunder);

                  (c) any investigation, litigation or proceeding related to
         any acquisition or proposed acquisition by the Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries of all or any portion of the stock or assets of any
         Person, whether or not such Agent, the Documentation Agent, the
         Issuer, the Arranger or such Lender is party thereto;

                  (d) any investigation, litigation or proceeding related to
         any environmental cleanup, audit, compliance or other matter relating
         to the Borrower's or any of its Subsidiaries' compliance with or
         liability under Environmental Law or the Release by the Borrower or
         any of its Subsidiaries of any Hazardous Material; or

                  (e) the presence on or under, or the escape, seepage,
         leakage, spillage, discharge, emission or release from, any real
         property owned or operated by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof
         of any Hazardous Material present on or under such property in a
         manner giving rise to liability at or prior to the time the Borrower
         or such Subsidiary owned or operated such property (including any
         losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, costs, expenses or claims
         asserted or arising under any Environmental Law), regardless of
         whether caused by, or within the control of, the Borrower or such
         Subsidiary,

except for any such Indemnified Liabilities arising for the account of a
particular Indemnified Party by reason of the relevant Indemnified Party's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Borrower and its permitted
successors and assigns hereby waive, release and agree not to make any claim,
or bring any cost recovery action against, any Agent, the Documentation Agent,
the Issuer, the Arranger or any Lender under CERCLA or any state equivalent, or
any similar law now existing or hereafter enacted, except to the extent arising
out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Indemnified Party. It
is expressly understood and agreed that to the extent that any of such Persons
is strictly liable under any Environmental Laws, the Borrower's obligation to
such Person under this indemnity shall likewise be without regard to fault on
the part of the Borrower, to the extent permitted under applicable law, with
respect to the violation or condition which results in liability of such
Person. If and to the extent that the foregoing undertaking may be
unenforceable for any reason, the Borrower hereby agrees to make the maximum
contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified
Liabilities which is permissible under applicable law.

         SECTION 11.5. Survival. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections
2.6.7(a)(ii), 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 11.3 and 11.4, the obligations of each Parent
Guarantor under Section 9.1(b) and the obligations of the Lenders under
Sections 4.8 and 10.1, shall in each case survive any assignment or
participation pursuant to Section 11.11, any termination of this Agreement, the
payment in full of all Obligations and the termination of all Commitments. The
representations 


                                     -103-
<PAGE>

and warranties made by the Borrower and each other Obligor in this Agreement
and in each other Loan Document shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and each such other Loan Document.

         SECTION 11.6. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
shall, as to such provision and such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or such Loan Document or affecting the validity or
enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

         SECTION 11.7. Headings. The various headings of this Agreement and of
each other Loan Document are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or such other Loan Document or
any provisions hereof or thereof.

         SECTION 11.8. Execution in Counterparts, Effectiveness, etc. This
Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in several counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which shall constitute
together but one and the same agreement.

         SECTION 11.9. Governing Law; Entire Agreement. THIS AGREEMENT, THE
NOTES AND, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED THEREIN, EACH
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL EACH BE DEEMED TO BE A CONTRACT MADE UNDER AND
GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. This Agreement, the
Notes and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire understanding among
the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any
prior agreements, written or oral, with respect thereto.

         SECTION 11.10. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns; provided, however, that (a) the Borrower may not assign
or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of each of the Agents and all Lenders, and (b) the rights of sale,
assignment and transfer of the Lenders are subject to Section 11.11.

         SECTION 11.11. Sale and Transfer of Loans and Notes; Participations in

         SECTION 11.11.1.  Assignments.  Any Lender (the "Assignor Lender"),

                  (a) with the written consents of the Borrower, the Agents and
         (in the case of any assignment of participations in Letters of Credit
         or Revolving Loan Commitments) the Issuer (which consents shall not be
         unreasonably delayed or withheld and which consents of the Agents and
         the Issuer shall not be required in the case of assignments made by or


                                     -104-
<PAGE>

         to DLJ or any of its Affiliates and which consent of the Borrower
         shall not be required if a Default or an Event of Default shall have
         occurred and be continuing), may at any time assign and delegate to
         one or more commercial banks or other financial institutions or funds
         which are regularly engaged in making, purchasing or investing in
         loans or securities, and

                  (b) with notice to the Borrower, the Agents, and (in the case
         of any assignment of participations in Letters of Credit or Revolving
         Loan Commitments) the Issuer, but without the consent of the Borrower,
         the Agents or the Issuer, may assign and delegate to any of its
         Affiliates or Related Funds or to any other Lender

(each Person described in either of the foregoing clauses as being the Person
to whom such assignment and delegation is to be made, being hereinafter
referred to as an "Assignee Lender"), all or any fraction of such Lender's
total Loans, participations in Letters of Credit and Letter of Credit
Outstandings with respect thereto and Commitments (which assignment and
delegation shall be, as among Revolving Loan Commitments, Revolving Loans and
participations in Letters of Credit, of a constant, and not a varying,
percentage) (the "Assigned Amount") in a minimum aggregate amount of (i)
$1,000,000 in the case of an assignment to an existing Lender or an Affiliate
or Related Fund thereof and $5,000,000 in the case of an assignment to an
Assignee Lender that is not an existing Lender or an Affiliate or Related Fund
thereof or (ii) the then remaining amount of such Lender's Loans and
Commitments; provided, however, that any such Assignee Lender will comply, if
applicable, with the provisions contained in Section 4.6 and the Borrower, each
other Obligor, the Agents and the Issuer shall be entitled to continue to deal
solely and directly with such Assignor Lender in connection with the interests
so assigned and delegated to an Assignee Lender until

                  (c) written notice of such assignment and delegation,
         together with payment instructions, addresses and related information
         with respect to such Assignee Lender, shall have been given to the
         Borrower and the Agents by such Assignor Lender and such Assignee
         Lender;

                  (d) such Assignee Lender shall have executed and delivered to
         the Borrower and the Agents a Lender Assignment Agreement, accepted by
         the Agents;

                  (e) the processing fees described below shall have been paid;
         and

                  (f) the Administrative Agent shall have registered such
         assignment and delegation in the Register pursuant to clause (b) of
         Section 2.7.

From and after the date that the Agents accept such Lender Assignment Agreement
and such assignment and delegation is registered in the Register pursuant to
clause (b) of Section 2.7, (i) the Assignee Lender thereunder shall be deemed
automatically to have become a party hereto and to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder have been assigned and delegated to such Assignee Lender
in connection with such Lender Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights 


                                     -105-
<PAGE>

and obligations of a Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and
(ii) the Assignor Lender, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder
have been assigned and delegated by it in connection with such Lender
Assignment Agreement, shall be released from its obligations hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.7,
within ten Business Days after its receipt of notice that the Agent has
received an executed Lender Assignment Agreement, the Borrower shall execute
and deliver to the Administrative Agent (for delivery to the relevant Assignee
Lender) new Notes evidencing such Assignee Lender's assigned Loans and
Commitments and, if the Assignor Lender has retained Loans and Commitments
hereunder, replacement Notes in the principal amount of the Loans and
Commitments retained by the Assignor Lender hereunder (such Notes to be in
exchange for, but not in payment of, those Notes then held by such Assignor
Lender). Each such Note requested shall be dated the date of the predecessor
Notes, if any. The Assignor Lender shall mark such predecessor Notes
"exchanged" and deliver them to the Borrower. Unless otherwise specified in the
Lender Assignment Agreement, interest and fees in respect of the Assigned
Amount that (A) have accrued prior to the date of such assignment shall be for
the account of the Assignor Lender and (B) accrue on and subsequent to the date
of such assignment shall be for the account of the Assignee Lender. Accrued
interest and fees shall be paid at the same time or times provided in this
Agreement. Such Assignor Lender or such Assignee Lender (unless the Assignor
Lender or the Assignee Lender is DLJ or any of its Affiliates) must also pay a
processing fee to the Administrative Agent upon delivery of any Lender
Assignment Agreement in the amount of $3,500, unless such assignment and
delegation is by a Lender to its Affiliate or Related Fund or if such
assignment and delegation consists of a pledge by a Lender to a Federal Reserve
Bank (or in the case of a Lender that is an investment fund, to the trustee
under the indenture to which such fund is a party), as provided below or is
otherwise consented to by the Administrative Agent. Any attempted assignment
and delegation not made in accordance with this Section 11.11.1 shall be null
and void. Nothing contained in this Section 11.11.1 shall prevent or prohibit
any Lender from pledging its rights (but not its obligations to make Loans or
participate in Letters of Credit or Letter of Credit Outstandings) under this
Agreement and/or its Loans and/or its Notes hereunder (i) to a Federal Reserve
Bank in support of borrowings made by such Lender from such Federal Reserve
Bank, or (ii) in the case of a Lender that is an investment fund, to the
trustee under the indenture to which such fund is a party in support of its
obligations to such trustee, in either case without notice to or consent of the
Borrower or the Agents; provided, however, that (A) such Lender shall remain a
"Lender" under this Agreement and shall continue to be bound by the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and (B)
any assignment by such trustee shall be subject to the provisions of clause (a)
of this Section 11.11.1. In the event that S&P, Moody's or Thompson's BankWatch
(or InsuranceWatch Ratings Service, in the case of Lenders that are insurance
companies (or Best's Insurance Reports, if such insurance company is not rated
by Insurance Watch Ratings Service)) shall, after the date that any Lender with
a Commitment to make Revolving Loans or participate in Letters of Credit
becomes a Lender, downgrade the long-term certificate of deposit rating or
long-term senior unsecured debt rating of such Lender, and the resulting rating
shall be below BBB-, Baa3 or C (or BB, in the case of Lender that is an
insurance company (or B, in the case of an insurance company not rated by
InsuranceWatch Ratings Service)) respectively, then the Issuer or the Borrower
(with the consent of the Agents and the Issuer) shall have the right, 


                                     -106-

but not the obligation, upon notice to such Lender and the Agents, to replace
such Lender with an Assignee Lender in accordance with and subject to the
restrictions contained in this Section, and such Lender hereby agrees to
transfer and assign without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the
restrictions contained in this Section) all its interests, rights and
obligations in respect of its Revolving Loan Commitment under this Agreement to
such Assignee Lender; provided, however, that (i) no such assignment shall
conflict with any law, rule and regulation or order of any governmental
authority and (ii) such Assignee Lender shall pay to such Lender in immediately
available funds on the date of such assignment the principal of and interest
and fees (if any) accrued to the date of payment on the Loans made, and Letters
of Credit participated in, by such Lender hereunder and (iii) the Borrower
shall have paid such Lender all other amounts accrued for such Lender's account
or owed to it hereunder or under any other Loan Document.

         SECTION 11.11.2. Participations. Any Lender may at any time sell to
one or more commercial banks or other financial institution (each such
commercial bank and other financial institution being herein called a
"Participant") participating interests in any of the Loans, Commitments,
participations in Letters of Credit and Letters of Credit Outstandings or other
interests of such Lender hereunder; provided, however, that

                  (a) no participation contemplated in this Section shall
         relieve such Lender from its Commitments or its other obligations
         hereunder or under any other Loan Document;

                  (b) such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the
         performance of its Commitments and such other obligations;

                  (c) the Borrower and each other Obligor, the Agents and the
         Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
         connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
         Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents;

                  (d) no Participant, unless such Participant is an Affiliate
         or Related Fund of such Lender, or is itself a Lender, shall be
         entitled to require such Lender to take or refrain from taking any
         action hereunder or under any other Loan Document, except that such
         Lender may agree with any Participant that such Lender will not,
         without such Participant's consent, agree to (i) any reduction in the
         interest rate or amount of fees that such Participant is otherwise
         entitled to, (ii) a decrease in the principal amount, or an extension
         of the final Stated Maturity Date, of any Loan in which such
         Participant has purchased a participating interest or (iii) a release
         of all or substantially all of the collateral security under the Loan
         Documents or any Guarantor under any Guaranty, in each case except as
         otherwise specifically provided in a Loan Document; and

                  (e) the Borrower shall not be required to pay any amount
         under Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 11.3 and 11.4 that is greater than
         the amount which it would have been required to pay had no
         participating interest been sold.

                                     -107-

The Borrower acknowledges and agrees, subject to clause (e) above, that, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each Participant, for purposes
of Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 4.9, 11.3 and 11.4, shall be considered a
Lender.

         SECTION 11.12. Other Transactions. Nothing contained herein shall
preclude any Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer, the Arranger or any
other Lender from engaging in any transaction, in addition to those
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the Borrower or
any of its Affiliates in which the Borrower or such Affiliate is not restricted
hereby from engaging with any other Person.

         SECTION 11.13. Independence of Covenants. All covenants contained in
this Agreement and each other Loan Document shall be given independent effect
such that, in the event a particular action or condition is not permitted by
any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to,
or be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall not, unless
expressly so provided in such first covenant, avoid the occurrence of a Default
or an Event of Default if such action is taken or such condition exists.

         SECTION 11.14. Confidentiality. The Agents, the Documentation Agent,
the Issuer, the Arranger and the Lenders shall hold all non-public information
obtained pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement or obtained by them
based on a review of the books and records of Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries in accordance with their customary procedures for handling
confidential information of this nature, but may make disclosure to any of
their examiners, regulators (including the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners), Affiliates, outside auditors, counsel and other professional
advisors in connection with this Agreement or as reasonably required by any
potential bona fide transferee, participant or assignee, or in connection with
the exercise of remedies under a Loan Document, or as requested by any
governmental agency or representative thereof or pursuant to legal process;
provided, however, that

                  (a) unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court
         order, each Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer, the Arranger
         and each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower of any request by
         any governmental agency or representative thereof (other than any such
         request in connection with an examination of the financial condition
         of such Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer, Arranger and
         Lender by such governmental agency) for disclosure of any such
         non-public information and, where practicable, prior to disclosure of
         such information;

                  (b) prior to any such disclosure pursuant to this Section
         11.14, each Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer, the Arranger
         and each Lender shall require any such bona fide transferee,
         participant and assignee receiving a disclosure of non-public
         information to agree, for the benefit of Holdings and its
         Subsidiaries, in writing

                           (i)  to be bound by this Section 11.14; and

                                     -108-
<PAGE>

                           (ii) to require such Person to require any other
                  Person to whom such Person discloses such non-public
                  information to be similarly bound by this Section 11.14;

                  (c) disclosure may, with the consent of the Agents and the
         Borrower, be made by any Lender to any direct or indirect contractual
         counterparties of such Lender in swap agreements or such contractual
         counterparties' professional advisors; provided that such contractual
         counterparty or professional advisor agrees in writing to keep such
         information confidential to the same extent required of the Lenders
         hereunder; and

                  (d) except as may be required by an order of a court of
         competent jurisdiction and to the extent set forth therein, no Lender
         shall be obligated or required to return any materials furnished by
         the Borrower or any Subsidiary.

         SECTION 11.15. Forum Selection and Consent to Jurisdiction. ANY
LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF
DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF THE AGENTS, THE
DOCUMENTATION AGENT, THE ARRANGER, THE LENDERS, THE ISSUER, THE BORROWER OR ANY
PARENT GUARANTOR RELATING THERETO SHALL BE BROUGHT AND MAINTAINED EXCLUSIVELY
(TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW) IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK, OR IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF
NEW YORK, IN EACH CASE LOCATED IN NEW YORK COUNTY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT ANY SUIT SEEKING ENFORCEMENT AGAINST ANY COLLATERAL OR
OTHER PROPERTY MAY BE BROUGHT, AT THE AGENTS' OPTION, IN THE COURTS OF ANY
JURISDICTION WHERE SUCH COLLATERAL OR OTHER PROPERTY MAY BE FOUND. THE BORROWER
AND EACH PARENT GUARANTOR HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE

NEW YORK COUNTY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH
LITIGATION AS SET FORTH ABOVE AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ANY
JUDGMENT RENDERED THEREBY IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH LITIGATION. THE BORROWER AND
EACH PARENT GUARANTOR IRREVOCABLY CONSENT TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS BY
REGISTERED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, OR BY PERSONAL SERVICE WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE
STATE OF NEW YORK. THE BORROWER AND EACH PARENT GUARANTOR HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH
ANY OF THEM MAY HAVE OR HEREAFTER MAY HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH
LITIGATION BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT REFERRED TO ABOVE AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY
SUCH LITIGATION 


                                     -109-
<PAGE>

HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE BORROWER OR
ANY PARENT GUARANTOR HAS OR HEREAFTER MAY ACQUIRE ANY IMMUNITY FROM
JURISDICTION OF ANY COURT OF FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS (WHETHER THROUGH SERVICE OR
NOTICE, ATTACHMENT PRIOR TO JUDGMENT, ATTACHMENT IN AID OF EXECUTION OR
OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO ITSELF OR ITS PROPERTY, THE BORROWER AND EACH PARENT
GUARANTOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE (TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE
LAW) SUCH IMMUNITY IN RESPECT OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

         SECTION 11.16. Waiver of Jury Trial. THE AGENTS, THE DOCUMENTATION
AGENT, THE ARRANGER, THE ISSUER, THE LENDERS, THE BORROWER AND THE PARENT
GUARANTORS HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS
THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL
OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF THE AGENTS, THE DOCUMENTATION AGENT, THE ARRANGER,
THE LENDERS, THE BORROWER OR THE PARENT GUARANTORS RELATING THERETO. THE
BORROWER AND THE PARENT GUARANTORS ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT EACH SUCH PERSON
HAS RECEIVED FULL AND SUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION FOR THIS PROVISION (AND EACH
OTHER PROVISION OF EACH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT TO WHICH SUCH PERSON IS A PARTY)
AND THAT THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE AGENTS, THE
DOCUMENTATION AGENT, THE ARRANGER, THE ISSUER AND THE LENDERS ENTERING INTO
THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH SUCH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT.

                         PARTNERSHIP SECURITY AGREEMENT


         This PARTNERSHIP SECURITY AGREEMENT (as amended, supplemented, amended

Agreement"), dated as of February 13, 1998, is made by each of the parties

         WHEREAS, as a condition precedent to the making of the Credit

each Grantor is required to execute and deliver this Security Agreement;

         WHEREAS, each Grantor has duly authorized the execution, delivery and
performance of this Security Agreement; and

         WHEREAS, it is in the best interests of each Grantor to execute this

Borrower by the Lenders and the Issuer pursuant to the Credit Agreement;

         NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and in order to induce the

                               SECURITY INTEREST

         SECTION 2.1. Grant of Security. Each Grantor hereby assigns and
pledges to the Administrative Agent for its benefit and the ratable benefit of

its benefit and the ratable benefit of each of the Secured Parties, a security
interest in all of the following, whether now or hereafter existing or acquired

                  (a) all right, title and interest of such Grantor, whether

                  (b) all general or limited partnership interests now owned or
         hereafter acquired by such Grantor in the Partnership as a result of
         exchange offers, direct investments or contributions or otherwise;

                  (c) such Grantor's accounts, general intangibles and other
         rights to payment or reimbursement, now existing or hereafter arising
         or acquired, from the Partnership, existing or arising from loans,
         advances or other extensions of credit by such Grantor from time to
         time to or for the account of the Partnership, or from services
         rendered by such Grantor from time to time to or for the account of
         the Partnership; and

                  (d) all products, offspring, rents, issues, profits, returns,
         income and proceeds of and from any and all of the foregoing
         Collateral (including proceeds which constitute property of the types
         described in clauses (a), (b) and (c), and, to the extent not

         warranty or guaranty, payable by reason of loss or damage to or
         otherwise with respect to any of the foregoing Collateral).

the payment of all Obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under
the Credit Agreement, the Notes and each other Loan Document to which the
Borrower is or may become a party, whether for principal, interest, costs,

<PAGE>

         SECTION 2.3. Continuing Security Interest; Transfer of Notes. This
Security Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the
Collateral and shall

                  (a) remain in full force and effect until payment in full in
         cash of all Secured Obligations, the termination of all Letters of
         Credit, the termination or expiration of all Rate Protection
         Agreements and the termination of all Commitments,

                  (b) be binding upon each Grantor, its successors, transferees
         and assigns, and

                  (c) inure, together with the rights and remedies of the
         Administrative Agent hereunder, to the benefit of the Administrative
         Agent and each other Secured Party.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (c), any Lender may
assign or otherwise transfer (in whole or in part) any Note or Credit Extension
held by it to any other Person or entity, and such other Person or entity shall
thereupon become vested with all the rights and benefits in respect thereof
granted to such Lender under any Loan Document (including this Security
Agreement) or otherwise, subject, however, to any contrary provisions in such
assignment or transfer, and to the provisions of Section 11.11 and Article X of
the Credit Agreement. Upon the payment in full in cash of all Secured
Obligations, the termination or expiration of all Letters of Credit, the
termination of all Rate Protection Agreements and the termination of all
Commitments, the security interest granted herein shall terminate and all
rights to the Collateral shall revert to such Grantor. Upon any such
termination, the Administrative Agent will, at such Grantor's sole expense,
execute and deliver to such Grantor such documents as such Grantor shall
reasonably request to evidence such termination.

         SECTION 2.4.  Grantors Remain Liable.  Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding

                  (a) each Grantor shall remain liable under the Partnership
         Agreement and the contracts and agreements included in the Collateral
         to the extent set forth therein, and shall perform all of its duties
         and obligations under the Partnership Agreement and such contracts and
         agreements to the same extent as if this Security Agreement had not
         been executed,

                  (b) the exercise by the Administrative Agent of any of its
         rights hereunder shall not release any Grantor from any of its duties
         or obligations under the Partnership Agreement and any such contracts
         or agreements included in the Collateral, and

                  (c) neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured
         Party shall have any obligation or liability under the Partnership
         Agreement and any such contracts or agreements included in the
         Collateral by reason of this Security Agreement, nor shall the
         Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party be obligated to
         perform any of the obligations or duties of any Grantor thereunder or
         to take any action to collect or enforce any claim for payment
         assigned hereunder.

         SECTION 2.5. Security Interest Absolute. All rights of the
Administrative Agent and the security interests granted to the Administrative
Agent hereunder, and all obligations of each Grantor hereunder, shall be
absolute and unconditional, irrespective of

                  (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit
         Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document;

                  (b) the failure of any Secured Party or any holder of any
         Note

                           (i) to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any
                  right or remedy against the Borrower, any other Obligor or
                  any other Person under the provisions of the Credit
                  Agreement, any Note, any other Loan Document or otherwise, or

                           (ii) to exercise any right or remedy against any
                  other guarantor of, or collateral securing, any Secured
                  Obligations;

                  (c) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
         in any other term of, all or any of the Secured Obligations or any
         other extension, compromise or renewal of any Secured Obligations;

                  (d) any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination of
         any Secured Obligations for any reason, including any claim of waiver,
         release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject
         to (and each Grantor hereby waives any right to or claim of) any
         defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever
         by reason of the invalidity, illegality, nongenuineness, irregularity,
         compromise, unenforceability of, or any other event or occurrence
         affecting, any Secured Obligations or otherwise;

                  (e) any amendment to, rescission, waiver, or other
         modification of, or any consent to departure from, any of the terms of
         the Credit Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document;

                  (f) any addition, exchange, release, surrender or
         non-perfection of any collateral (including the Collateral), or any
         amendment to or waiver or release of or addition to or consent to
         departure from any guaranty, for any of the Secured Obligations; or

                  (g) any other circumstances which might otherwise constitute
         a defense available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, the
         Borrower, any other Obligor, any surety or any guarantor.

         SECTION 2.6. Postponement of Subrogation, etc. Each Grantor hereby
agrees that it will not exercise any rights which it may acquire by reason of
any payment made hereunder, whether by way of subrogation, reimbursement or
otherwise, until the prior payment in full in cash of all Secured Obligations,

amount paid to any Grantor on account of any payment made hereunder prior to
the payment in full in cash of all Secured Obligations shall be held in trust
for the benefit of the Secured Parties and each holder of a Note and shall
immediately be paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured
Parties and each holder of a Note and credited and applied against the Secured
Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the
Credit Agreement; provided, however, that if

                  (a) such Grantor has made payment to the Administrative Agent
         for the benefit of the Secured Parties and each holder of a Note of
         all or any part of the Secured Obligations, and

                  (b) all Secured Obligations have been paid in full in cash,
         all Letters of Credit have been terminated or expired, all Rate
         Protection Agreements have been terminated and all Commitments have
         been permanently terminated,

each Secured Party and each holder of a Note agrees that, at the requesting
Grantor's request, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties
and the holders of the Notes, will execute and deliver to such Grantor
appropriate documents (without recourse and without representation or warranty)
necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to such Grantor of an
interest in the Secured Obligations resulting from such payment by such
Grantor. In furtherance of the foregoing, for so long as any Secured
Obligations, Commitments or Letters of Credit remain outstanding or any Rate
Protection Agreement remains in full force and effect, each Grantor shall
refrain from taking any action or commencing any proceeding against the
Borrower or any other Obligor (or its successors or assigns, whether in
connection with a bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise) to recover any amounts in
respect of payments made under this Security Agreement to any Secured Party or
any holder of a Note.

         SECTION 3.3. Validity, etc. This Security Agreement creates a valid
security interest in the Collateral securing the payment of the Secured
Obligations, and upon the filing of the Uniform Commercial Code financing
statements delivered by each Grantor to the Administrative Agent with respect
to such Collateral, such security interest will be a first priority perfected
security interest. The Partnership Agreement (and all amendments thereto)
constitutes the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of each Grantor a

respect to the subject matter thereof, has not been further amended or modified
and remains in full force and effect.

Grantor's percentage interest in the Partnership's profits (with profit

forth in Schedule I hereto, as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from
time to time with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 3.5. Certificate. No interest of such Grantor in the
Partnership is represented by a certificate of interest or similar instrument,
except such certificates or instruments, if any, as have been delivered to the
Administrative Agent and are held in its possession (and such Grantor covenants
and agrees that any such certificates or instruments hereafter received by such
Grantor with respect to any of the Collateral will be promptly delivered to the
Administrative Agent, together with all necessary instruments or transfer or
assignment, duly executed in blank).

         SECTION 3.6. Interest in Partnership Agreements. Such Grantor had and
has the power and legal capacity to execute and carry out the provisions of the
Partnership Agreement. Such Grantor has substantially performed all of its
obligations to date under the Partnership Agreement and has not received notice
of the failure of any other party thereto to perform substantially its
obligations thereunder.

         SECTION 3.7. Location, Records, etc. The chief executive office of
such Grantor and the office where such Grantor keeps its records concerning the

reorganization.

         SECTION 3.8. Authorization, Approval, etc. Except as have been
obtained or made and are in full force and effect (or otherwise provided for to
the satisfaction of the Agents), no authorization, approval or other action by,
and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body
is required either

                  (a) for the grant by such Grantor of the security interest
         granted hereby or for the execution, delivery and performance of this
         Security Agreement by such Grantor, or

                  (b) for the perfection of or the exercise by the
         Administrative Agent of its rights and remedies hereunder.

the requirements of all applicable laws (including the provisions of the Fair
Labor Standards Act), rules, regulations and orders of every governmental
authority, the non-compliance with which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or which could reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the worth of the Collateral as
collateral security.

                                   COVENANTS

         SECTION 4.1. Certain Covenants. Each Grantor covenants and agrees
that, so long as any portion of the Secured Obligations shall remain unpaid,
any Rate Protection Agreements shall remain in full force and effect, any
Letters of Credit shall be outstanding or any Lender shall have any outstanding
Commitment, such Grantor will, unless the Required Lenders shall otherwise
consent in writing, perform, comply with and be bound by the obligations set
forth in this Article IV.

         SECTION 4.2. Covenants from Other Agreements. Such Grantor will take
all actions necessary to cause the Partnership to perform, comply with and be
bound by all of the agreements, covenants and obligations contained in Article
VII of the Credit Agreement and in any other Loan Document applicable to the
Partnership and its properties. Each such agreement, covenant and obligation
contained in such Article or in any other Loan Document and all other terms of
the Credit Agreement and the Loan Documents to which reference is made therein,
together with all related definitions and ancillary provisions, is hereby
incorporated into this Security Agreement by reference as though specifically
set forth in this Section, and each such agreement, covenant and obligation
shall, for purposes hereof, survive the termination of the Credit Agreement and
the Loan Documents (other than this Security Agreement).

         SECTION 4.3. Maintenance of Records. Such Grantor will keep, at its
address indicated on Schedule II hereto, all of its records concerning the
Collateral, which records will be of such character as will enable the
Administrative Agent or its designees to determine at any time the status
thereof, or, upon 30 days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, at
such other locations in a jurisdiction where all actions necessary to (a)
perfect, preserve and protect any security interest granted or purported to be
granted hereby and (b) enable the Administrative Agent to exercise and enforce
its rights and remedies hereunder, shall have been taken. Such Grantor shall
not change its name except upon 30 days' prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent and shall hold and preserve such records concerning the
Collateral and permit representatives of the Administrative Agent at any time
during normal business hours to inspect and make abstracts from such records.

         SECTION 4.4. Amendment of Partnership Agreement. Such Grantor will not
amend, supplement or otherwise modify, or permit, consent or suffer to occur
any amendment, supplement or modification of any terms or provisions contained
in, or applicable to, the

                                      -8-

<PAGE>

Partnership Agreement, if the effect thereof is to impair, or is in any manner
adverse to, the rights or interests of any Secured Party under the Credit
Agreement or any other Loan Document, without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders.

         SECTION 4.5. Withdraw from Partnership. No Grantor will, without the
express written consent of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, actively
cause itself to withdraw as a general partner or limited partner, as the case
may be, of the Partnership.

         SECTION 4.6.  Transfers and Other Liens.  Such Grantor shall not

                  (a) sell, assign (by operation of law or otherwise) or
         otherwise dispose of any of the Collateral; or

                  (b) create or suffer to exist any Lien or other charge or
         encumbrance upon or with respect to any of the Collateral to secure
         Indebtedness of any Person or entity, except for the security interest
         created by this Security Agreement and except as permitted by the
         Credit Agreement.

         SECTION 4.7. Further Assurances, etc. Such Grantor agrees that, from
time to time at its own expense, such Grantor will promptly execute and deliver
all further instruments and documents, and take all further action, that may be
necessary or desirable, or that the Administrative Agent may request, in order
to perfect, preserve and protect any security interest granted or purported to
be granted hereby or to enable the Administrative Agent to exercise and enforce
its rights and remedies hereunder with respect to any Collateral. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, such Grantor will

                  (a) execute and file such financing or continuation
         statements, or amendments thereto, and such other instruments or
         notices (including any assignment of claim form under or pursuant to
         the federal assignment of claims statute, 31 U.S.C. ss. 3726, any
         successor or amended version thereof or any regulation promulgated
         under or pursuant to any version thereof), as may be necessary or
         desirable, or as the Administrative Agent may request, in order to
         perfect and preserve the security interests and other rights granted
         or purported to be granted to the Administrative Agent hereby; and

                  (b) furnish to the Administrative Agent, from time to time at
         the Administrative Agent's request, statements and schedules further
         identifying and describing the Collateral and such other reports in
         connection with the Collateral as the Administrative Agent may
         reasonably request, all in reasonable detail.

With respect to the foregoing and the grant of the security interest hereunder,
such Grantor hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to file one or more
financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, relative to all
or any part of the Collateral without the signature of such Grantor where
permitted by law. A carbon, photographic or other reproduction

                                      -9-

of this Security Agreement or any financing statement covering the Collateral
or any part thereof shall be sufficient as a financing statement where
permitted by law.


                                   ARTICLE V

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         SECTION 5.1. Administrative Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. Each
Grantor hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent such Grantor's
attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Grantor
and in the name of such Grantor or otherwise, from time to time in the
Administrative Agent's discretion, following the occurrence and continuation of
a Default of the nature set forth in Section 8.1.9 of the Credit Agreement or
an Event of Default, to take any action and to execute any instrument which the
Administrative Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes
of this Security Agreement, including:

                  (a) to ask, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compromise,
         receive and give acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to become
         due under or in respect of any of the Collateral;

                  (b) to receive, endorse, and collect any drafts or other
         instruments, documents and chattel paper, in connection with clause
         (a) above;

                  (c) to file any claims or take any action or institute any
         proceedings which the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or
         desirable for the collection of any of the Collateral or otherwise to
         enforce the rights of the Administrative Agent with respect to any of
         the Collateral; and

                  (d) to perform the affirmative obligations of such Grantor
         hereunder (including all obligations of such Grantor pursuant to
         Section 4.7).

Such Grantor hereby acknowledges, consents and agrees that the power of
attorney granted pursuant to this Section is irrevocable and coupled with an
interest.

         SECTION 5.2. Administrative Agent May Perform. If any Grantor fails to
perform any agreement contained herein, the Administrative Agent may itself
perform, or cause performance of, such agreement, and the expenses of the
Administrative Agent incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by such
Grantor pursuant to Section 6.2.

         SECTION 5.3. Administrative Agent Has No Duty. In addition to, and not
in limitation of, Section 2.4, the powers conferred on the Administrative Agent
hereunder are solely to protect its interest (on behalf of the Secured Parties)
in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty on it to exercise any such
powers. Except for reasonable care of any Collateral in its possession and the
accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, the Administrative
Agent shall have

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

no duty as to any Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to
preserve rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining to any
Collateral.

         SECTION 5.4. Reasonable Care. The Administrative Agent is required to
exercise reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any of the
Collateral in its possession; provided, however, the Administrative Agent shall
be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of
any of the Collateral, if it takes such action for that purpose as any Grantor
reasonably requests in writing at times other than upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default, but failure of the
Administrative Agent to comply with any such request at any time shall not in
itself be deemed a failure to exercise reasonable care.


                                   ARTICLE VI

                                    REMEDIES

         SECTION 6.1. Certain Remedies. If any Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing:

                  (a) The Administrative Agent may exercise in respect of the
         Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for
         herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a
         secured party on default under the U.C.C. (whether or not the U.C.C.
         applies to the affected Collateral) and also may

                           (i) require each Grantor to, and such Grantor hereby
                  agrees that it will, at its expense and upon request of the
                  Administrative Agent forthwith, assemble all or part of the
                  Collateral as directed by the Administrative Agent and make
                  it available to the Administrative Agent at a place to be
                  designated by the Administrative Agent which is reasonably
                  convenient to all parties, and

                           (ii) without notice except as specified below, sell
                  the Collateral or any part thereof at public or private sale,
                  at any of the Administrative Agent's offices or elsewhere,
                  for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such
                  other terms as the Administrative Agent may deem commercially
                  reasonable. Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notice of
                  sale shall be required by law, at least ten days' prior
                  notice to such Grantor of the time and place of any public
                  sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made
                  shall constitute reasonable notification. The Administrative
                  Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral
                  regardless of notice of sale having been given. The
                  Administrative Agent may adjourn any public or private sale
                  from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed
                  therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made
                  at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.

                  (b) All cash proceeds received by the Administrative Agent in
         respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon,
         all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied by the
         Administrative Agent against, all or any part of the Obligations as
         follows:

                           (i) first, to the payment of any amounts payable to
                  the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11.3 of the
                  Credit Agreement and Section 6.2;

                           (ii) second, to the equal and ratable payment of
                  Obligations, in accordance with each Secured Party's
                  Obligations owing to it under or pursuant to the Credit
                  Agreement or any other Loan Document, or under or pursuant to
                  any Hedging Obligation included in the Obligations as to each
                  Secured Party, applied

                                    (A) first to fees and expense
                           reimbursements then due to such Secured Party,

                                    (B) then to interest due to such Secured
                           Party,

                                    (C) then to pay or prepay principal of the
                           Loans owing to, or to reduce the "credit exposure"
                           of, such Secured Party under such Hedging
                           Obligation, as the case may be, and

                                    (D) then to pay the remaining outstanding
                           Obligations and cash collateralize all Letter of
                           Credit Outstandings;

                           (iii) third, without duplication of any amounts paid
                  pursuant to clause (b)(ii) above, to the Indemnified Parties
                  to the extent of any amounts owing pursuant to Section 11.4
                  of the Credit Agreement; and

                           (iv) fourth, to be held as additional collateral
                  security until the payment in full in cash of all of the
                  Obligations, the termination or expiration of all Letters of
                  Credit, the termination of all Rate Protection Agreements and
                  the termination of all Commitments, after which such
                  remaining cash proceeds shall be paid over to the applicable
                  Grantor or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive
                  such surplus.

         For purposes of this Security Agreement, the "credit exposure" at any
         time of any Secured Party with respect to a Hedging Obligation to
         which such Secured Party is a party shall be determined at such time
         in accordance with the customary methods of calculating credit
         exposure under similar arrangements by the counterparty to such
         arrangements, taking into account potential interest rate movements
         and the respective termination provisions and notional principal
         amount and term of such Hedging Obligation.

         Agreement (including enforcement of this Security Agreement), except

                           (ii) the custody, preservation, use or operation of,
                  or the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon,
                  any of the Collateral,

                  rights of the Administrative Agent or the Secured Parties
                  hereunder, and

                  (a) all equipment in all of its forms of the Grantor,

         of or in connection with the sale or lease of goods or the rendering

         contracts securing or otherwise relating to any such accounts,
         contracts, contract rights, chattel paper, documents, instruments, and
         general intangibles (any and all such accounts, contracts, contract

         Rapid Remit Program), and any and all such security agreements,
         guaranties, leases and other contracts being the "Related Contracts")
         (provided, however, that Related Contracts shall not include the Rapid

                  (e) all books, records, writings, data bases, information and

                  (f) all of the Grantor's other property and rights of every
         kind and description and interests therein; and

                  (g) all products, offspring, rents, issues, profits, returns,
         income and proceeds of and from any and all of the foregoing
         Collateral (including proceeds which constitute property of the types
         described in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f), proceeds
         deposited from time to time in the Collateral Account and in any lock
         boxes of the Grantor, and, to the extent not otherwise included, all
         payments under insurance (whether or not the Administrative Agent is
         the loss payee thereof), or any indemnity, warranty or guaranty,
         payable by reason of loss or damage to or otherwise with respect to
         any of the foregoing Collateral).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Collateral" shall not include any general
intangibles or other rights arising under any contracts, instruments, licenses
or other documents as to which the grant of a security interest would
constitute a violation of a valid and enforceable restriction in favor of a
third party on such grant, unless and until any required consents shall have
been obtained. The Grantor agrees to use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to obtain any such required consent.

         SECTION 2.2. Security for Obligations. This Security Agreement secures
the payment of all Obligations of the Grantor now or hereafter existing under
the Credit Agreement, the Notes and each other Loan Document to which the
Grantor is or may become a party, whether for principal, interest, costs, fees,
expenses or otherwise.

         SECTION 2.3. Continuing Security Interest; Transfer of Notes. This
Security Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the
Collateral and shall

                                      -6-

<PAGE>

                  (a) remain in full force and effect until payment in full in
         cash of all Obligations, the termination or expiration of all Letters
         of Credit, the termination of all Rate Protection Agreements and the
         termination of all Commitments,

                  (b) be binding upon the Grantor, its successors, transferees
         and assigns, and

                  (c) inure, together with the rights and remedies of the
         Administrative Agent hereunder, to the benefit of the Administrative
         Agent and each other Secured Party.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (c), any Lender may
assign or otherwise transfer (in whole or in part) any Note or Credit Extension
held by it to any other Person or entity, and such other Person or entity shall
thereupon become vested with all the rights and benefits in respect thereof
granted to such Lender under any Loan Document (including this Security
Agreement) or otherwise, subject, however, to any contrary provisions in such
assignment or transfer, and to the provisions of Section 11.11 and Article X of
the Credit Agreement. Upon the payment in full in cash of all Obligations, the
termination or expiration of all Letters of Credit, the termination of all Rate
Protection Agreements and the termination of all Commitments, the security
interest granted herein shall terminate and all rights to the Collateral shall
revert to the Grantor. Upon any such termination, the Administrative Agent
will, at the Grantor's sole expense, execute and deliver to the Grantor such
documents as the Grantor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination.
Upon any sale or other transfer of Collateral permitted by the terms of Section
7.2.9 of the Credit Agreement, the security interest created hereunder in such
Collateral (but not in the proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to be
automatically released and the Administrative Agent will, at the Grantor's sole
expense, execute and deliver to the Grantor such documents as the Grantor shall
reasonably request to evidence such release.

         SECTION 2.4.  Grantor Remains Liable.  Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding

                  (a) the Grantor shall remain liable under the contracts and
         agreements included in the Collateral to the extent set forth therein,

         and Trademark Office and in corresponding offices in countries in
         which the failure to so file and/or record could reasonably be
         expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and its claims to the
         Copyright Collateral in the United States Copyright Office and in
         corresponding offices in countries in which the failure to so file
         and/or record could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
         Effect;

                  (d) the Grantor is the exclusive owner of the entire and
         unencumbered right, title and interest in and to such Intellectual
         Property Collateral and no claim has been made that the use of such
         Intellectual Property Collateral does or may violate the asserted
         rights of any third party; and

                  (e) the Grantor has performed and will continue to perform
         all acts and has paid and will continue to pay all required fees and

Obligations, and

                                      -9-

<PAGE>

                  (a) in the case of Collateral comprised of certificated
         securities or instruments, upon the delivery of such Collateral to the
         Administrative Agent, such security interest will be a first priority
         perfected security interest;

                  (b) in the case of Collateral comprised of uncertificated
         securities with respect to which a security interest therein may not
         be perfected under applicable law by the filing of a Uniform
         Commercial Code financing statement, upon a "transfer" (as such term
         is used in Section 8-313 of the U.C.C.) of such Collateral to the
         Administrative Agent, such security interest will be a first priority
         perfected security interest; and

                  (c) in the case of all other Collateral, upon the filing of
         the Uniform Commercial Code financing statements delivered by the
         Grantor to the Administrative Agent with respect to such Collateral,
         such security interest will be a first priority perfected security
         interest.

The Grantor has filed all Uniform Commercial Code financing statements referred
to above in the appropriate offices therefor (or has provided the
Administrative Agent with copies thereof suitable for filing in such offices),
and has taken all of the other actions referred to above necessary to create
perfected, first-priority security interests in the applicable Collateral.

         SECTION 3.8. Authorization, Approval, etc. Except as have been
obtained or made and are in full force and effect (or otherwise provided for to
the satisfaction of the Agents), no authorization, approval or other action by,
and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body
is required either

                  (a) for the grant by the Grantor of the security interest
         granted hereby or for the execution, delivery and performance of this
         Security Agreement by the Grantor, or

                  (b) for the perfection of or the exercise by the
         Administrative Agent of its rights and remedies hereunder.

         SECTION 3.9. Compliance with Laws. The Grantor is in compliance with
the requirements of all applicable laws (including the provisions of the Fair
Labor Standards Act), rules, regulations and orders of every governmental
authority, the non-compliance with which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or which could reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the worth of the Collateral as
collateral security.

         taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon,

<PAGE>

         delivered to the Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement,
         which shall set forth any changes to the information set forth in
         Section 3.2.

                  (b) Upon written notice by the Administrative Agent to the
         Grantor pursuant to this Section 4.3(b), all proceeds of Collateral
         received by the Grantor shall be delivered in kind to the
         Administrative Agent for deposit to a deposit account (the "Collateral
         Account") of the Grantor maintained with the Administrative Agent, and
         the Grantor shall not commingle any such proceeds, and shall hold
         separate and apart from all other property, all such proceeds in
         express trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent until
         delivery thereof is made to the Administrative Agent. The
         Administrative Agent will not give the notice referred to in the
         preceding sentence unless there shall have occurred and be continuing
         a Default of the nature set forth in Section 8.1.9 of the Credit
         Agreement or an Event of Default.

                  (c) The Administrative Agent shall have the right to apply
         any amount in the Collateral Account to the payment of any Obligations
         which are due and payable or payable upon demand, or to the payment of
         any Obligations at any time that an Event of Default shall exist.

         SECTION 4.4.  As to Collateral.

                  (a) Until the occurrence and continuance of a Default of the
         nature set forth in Section 8.1.9 of the Credit Agreement or an Event
         of Default, and such time as the Administrative Agent shall notify the
         Grantor of the revocation of such power and authority the Grantor (i)
         may in the ordinary course of its business (except as otherwise
         permitted under the Credit Agreement), at its own expense, sell, lease
         or furnish under the contracts of service any of the Inventory
         normally held by the Grantor for such purpose, and use and consume, in
         the ordinary course of its business (except as otherwise permitted
         under the Credit Agreement), any raw materials, work in process or
         materials normally held by the Grantor for such purpose, (ii) will, at
         its own expense, endeavor to collect, as and when due, all amounts due
         with respect to any of the Collateral, including the taking of such
         action with respect to such collection as the Administrative Agent may
         reasonably request following the occurrence of a Default of the nature
         set forth in Section 8.1.9 of the Credit Agreement or an Event of
         Default or, in the absence of such request, as the Grantor may deem
         advisable, and (iii) may grant, in the ordinary course of business
         (except as otherwise permitted under the Credit Agreement), to any
         party obligated on any of the Collateral, any rebate, refund or
         allowance to which such party may be lawfully entitled, and may
         accept, in connection therewith, the return of goods, the sale or
         lease of which shall have given rise to such Collateral. The
         Administrative Agent, however, may, at any time following a Default of
         the nature set forth in Section 8.1.9 of the Credit Agreement or an
         Event of Default, whether before or after any revocation of such power
         and authority or the maturity of any of the Obligations, notify any
         parties obligated on any of the Collateral to make payment to the
         Administrative Agent of any amounts due or to become due thereunder
         and enforce collection of any of

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

         the Collateral by suit or otherwise and surrender, release, or
         exchange all or any part thereof, or compromise or extend or renew for
         any period (whether or not longer than the original period) any
         indebtedness thereunder or evidenced thereby. Upon request of the
         Administrative Agent following a Default of the nature set forth in
         Section 8.1.9 of the Credit Agreement or an Event of Default, the
         Grantor will, at its own expense, notify any parties obligated on any
         of the Collateral to make payment to the Administrative Agent of any
         amounts due or to become due thereunder.

                  (b) Following a Default of the nature set forth in Section
         8.1.9 of the Credit Agreement or an Event of Default, the
         Administrative Agent is authorized to endorse, in the name of the
         Grantor, any item, howsoever received by the Administrative Agent,
         representing any payment on or other proceeds of any of the
         Collateral.

         SECTION 4.5. As to Intellectual Property Collateral. The Grantor
covenants and agrees to comply with the following provisions as such provisions
relate to any Intellectual Property Collateral of the Grantor:

                  (a) the Grantor shall not, unless the Grantor shall either
         (i) reasonably and in good faith determine (and notice of such
         determination shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent)
         that any of the Patent Collateral is of negligible economic value to
         the Grantor, or (ii) have a valid business purpose to do otherwise, do
         any act, or omit to do any act, whereby any of the Patent Collateral
         may lapse or become abandoned or dedicated to the public or
         unenforceable.

                  (b) the Grantor shall not, and the Grantor shall not permit
         any of its licensees to, unless the Grantor shall either (i)
         reasonably and in good faith determine (and notice of such
         determination shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent)
         that any of the Trademark Collateral is of negligible economic value
         to the Grantor, or (ii) have a valid business purpose to do otherwise,

                           (i) fail to continue to use any of the Trademark
                  Collateral in order to maintain all of the Trademark
                  Collateral in full force free from any claim of abandonment
                  for non-use,

                           (ii) fail to maintain as in the past the quality of
                  products and services offered under all of the Trademark
                  Collateral,

                           (iii) fail to employ all of the Trademark Collateral
                  registered with any Federal or state or foreign authority
                  with an appropriate notice of such registration,

                           (iv) adopt or use any other Trademark which is
                  confusingly similar or a colorable imitation of any of the
                  Trademark Collateral,

                                      -13-

<PAGE>

                           (v) use any of the Trademark Collateral registered
                  with any Federal or state or foreign authority except for the
                  uses for which registration or application for registration
                  of all of the Trademark Collateral has been made, and

                           (vi) do or permit any act or knowingly omit to do
                  any act whereby any of the Trademark Collateral may lapse or
                  become invalid or unenforceable.

                  (c) the Grantor shall not, unless the Grantor shall either
         (i) reasonably and in good faith determine (and notice of such
         determination shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent)
         that any of the Copyright Collateral or any of the Trade Secrets
         Collateral is of negligible economic value to the Grantor, or (ii)
         have a valid business purpose to do otherwise, do or permit any act or
         knowingly omit to do any act whereby any of the Copyright Collateral
         or any of the Trade Secrets Collateral may lapse or become invalid or
         unenforceable or placed in the public domain except upon expiration of
         the end of an unrenewable term of a registration thereof.

                  (d) the Grantor shall notify the Administrative Agent
         immediately if it knows, or has reason to know, that any application
         or registration relating to any material item of the Intellectual
         Property Collateral may become abandoned or dedicated to the public or
         placed in the public domain or invalid or unenforceable, or of any
         adverse determination or development (including the institution of, or
         any such determination or development in, any proceeding in the United
         States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office
         or any foreign counterpart thereof or any court) regarding the
         Grantor's ownership of any of the Intellectual Property Collateral,
         its right to register the same or to keep and maintain and enforce the
         same.

                  (e) in no event shall the Grantor or any of its agents,
         employees, designees or licensees file an application for the
         registration of any Intellectual Property Collateral with the United
         States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office
         or any similar office or agency in any other country or any political
         subdivision thereof, unless it promptly informs the Administrative
         Agent, and upon request of the Administrative Agent, executes and
         delivers any and all agreements, instruments, documents and papers as
         the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to evidence the
         Administrative Agent's security interest in such Intellectual Property
         Collateral and the goodwill and general intangibles of the Grantor
         relating thereto or represented thereby.

                  (f) the Grantor shall take all necessary steps, including in
         any proceeding before the United States Patent and Trademark Office,
         the United States Copyright Office or any similar office or agency in
         any other country or any political subdivision thereof, to maintain
         and pursue any application (and to obtain the relevant registration)
         filed with respect to, and to maintain any registration of, the
         Intellectual Property Collateral, including the filing of applications
         for renewal, affidavits of use, affidavits of incontestability and
         opposition, interference and cancellation proceedings and the

                                      -14-

         payment of fees and taxes (except to the extent that dedication,
         abandonment or invalidation is permitted under the foregoing clauses
         (a), (b) and (c)).

                  (g) the Grantor shall, contemporaneously herewith, execute
         and deliver to the Administrative Agent a Trademark Security Agreement
         in the form of Exhibit B hereto, and shall execute and deliver to the
         Administrative Agent any other document required to acknowledge or
         register or perfect the Administrative Agent's interest in any part of
         the Intellectual Property Collateral.

         SECTION 4.6. Insurance. The Grantor will maintain or cause to be
maintained with responsible insurance companies insurance with respect to its
business and properties (including the Equipment and Inventory) against such
casualties and contingencies and of such types and in such amounts as is
required pursuant to the Credit Agreement and will, upon the request of the

                  (a) sell, assign (by operation of law or otherwise) or
         otherwise dispose of any of the Collateral, except Inventory in the
         ordinary course of business or as permitted by the Credit Agreement;
         or

                  (b) create or suffer to exist any Lien or other charge or
         encumbrance upon or with respect to any of the Collateral to secure
         Indebtedness of any Person or entity, except for the security interest

         Credit Agreement.

         SECTION 4.8. Further Assurances, etc. The Grantor agrees that, from

its rights and remedies hereunder with respect to any Collateral. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Grantor will

                  (a) mark conspicuously each document included in the
         Inventory, each chattel paper included in the Receivables and each
         Related Contract and, at the request of the Administrative Agent, each
         of its records pertaining to the Collateral with a legend, in form and
         substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, indicating that
         such document, chattel paper, Related Contract or Collateral is
         subject to the security interest granted hereby;

                  (b) if any Receivable shall be evidenced by a promissory note
         or other instrument, negotiable document or chattel paper, deliver and
         pledge to the

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

         Administrative Agent hereunder such promissory note, instrument,
         negotiable document or chattel paper duly endorsed and accompanied by
         duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment, all in form and
         substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent;

                  (c) execute and file such financing or continuation
         statements, or amendments thereto, and such other instruments or
         notices (including any assignment of claim form under or pursuant to
         the federal assignment of claims statute, 31 U.S.C. ss. 3726, any
         successor or amended version thereof or any regulation promulgated
         under or pursuant to any version thereof), as may be necessary or
         desirable, or as the Administrative Agent may request, in order to
         perfect and preserve the security interests and other rights granted
         or purported to be granted to the Administrative Agent hereby; and

                  (d) furnish to the Administrative Agent, from time to time at
         the Administrative Agent's request, statements and schedules further
         identifying and describing the Collateral and such other reports in
         connection with the Collateral as the Administrative Agent may
         reasonably request, all in reasonable detail.

With respect to the foregoing and the grant of the security interest hereunder,
the Grantor hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to file one or more
financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, relative to all
or any part of the Collateral without the signature of the Grantor where
permitted by law. A carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this Security
Agreement or any financing statement covering the Collateral or any part
thereof shall be sufficient as a financing statement where permitted by law.


                                   ARTICLE V

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         SECTION 5.1. Administrative Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. The
Grantor hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent the Grantor's
attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of the Grantor and
in the name of the Grantor or otherwise, from time to time in the
Administrative Agent's discretion, following the occurrence and continuation of
a Default of the nature set forth in Section 8.1.9 of the Credit Agreement or
an Event of Default, to take any action and to execute any instrument which the
Administrative Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes
of this Security Agreement, including:

                  (a) to ask, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compromise,
         receive and give acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to become
         due under or in respect of any of the Collateral;

                  (b) to receive, endorse, and collect any drafts or other
         instruments, documents and chattel paper, in connection with clause
         (a) above;

                                      -16-
<PAGE>

                  (c) to file any claims or take any action or institute any
         proceedings which the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or
         desirable for the collection of any of the Collateral or otherwise to
         enforce the rights of the Administrative Agent with respect to any of
         the Collateral; and

                  (d) to perform the affirmative obligations of the Grantor
         hereunder (including all obligations of the Grantor pursuant to
         Section 4.8).

The Grantor hereby acknowledges, consents and agrees that the power of attorney
granted pursuant to this Section is irrevocable and coupled with an interest.

         SECTION 5.2. Administrative Agent May Perform. If the Grantor fails to
perform any agreement contained herein, the Administrative Agent may itself
perform, or cause performance of, such agreement, and the expenses of the
Administrative Agent incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the
Grantor pursuant to Section 6.2.

         SECTION 5.3. Administrative Agent Has No Duty. In addition to, and not
in limitation of, Section 2.4, the powers conferred on the Administrative Agent
hereunder are solely to protect its interest (on behalf of the Secured Parties)
in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty on it to exercise any such
powers. Except for reasonable care of any Collateral in its possession and the
accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, the Administrative
Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to the taking of any
necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any other rights
pertaining to any Collateral.

         SECTION 5.4. Reasonable Care. The Administrative Agent is required to
exercise reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any of the
Collateral in its possession; provided, however, the Administrative Agent shall
be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of
any of the Collateral, if it takes such action for that purpose as the Grantor
reasonably requests in writing at times other than upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default, but failure of the
Administrative Agent to comply with any such request at any time shall not in
itself be deemed a failure to exercise reasonable care.


                                   ARTICLE VI

                                    REMEDIES

         SECTION 6.1. Certain Remedies. If any Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing:

                  (a) The Administrative Agent may exercise in respect of the
         Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for
         herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a
         secured party on default under the U.C.C. (whether or not the U.C.C.
         applies to the affected Collateral) and also may

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

                           (i) require the Grantor to, and the Grantor hereby
                  agrees that it will, at its expense and upon request of the
                  Administrative Agent forthwith, assemble all or part of the
                  Collateral as directed by the Administrative Agent and make
                  it available to the Administrative Agent at a place to be
                  designated by the Administrative Agent which is reasonably
                  convenient to both parties, and

                           (ii) without notice except as specified below, sell
                  the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at
                  public or private sale, at any of the Administrative Agent's
                  offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future
                  delivery, and upon such other terms as the Administrative
                  Agent may deem commercially reasonable. The Grantor agrees
                  that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law,
                  at least ten days' prior notice to the Grantor of the time
                  and place of any public sale or the time after which any
                  private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable
                  notification. The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated
                  to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale
                  having been given. The Administrative Agent may adjourn any
                  public or private sale from time to time by announcement at
                  the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without
                  further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was
                  so adjourned.

                  (b) All cash proceeds received by the Administrative Agent in
         respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon,
         all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied by the
         Administrative Agent against, all or any part of the Obligations as
         follows:

                           (i) first, to the payment of any amounts payable to
                  the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11.3 of the
                  Credit Agreement and Section 6.2;

                           (ii) second, to the equal and ratable payment of
                  Obligations, in accordance with each Secured Party's
                  Obligations owing to it under or pursuant to the Credit
                  Agreement or any other Loan Document, or under or pursuant to
                  any Hedging Obligation included in the Obligations as to each
                  Secured Party, applied

                                    (A) first to fees and expense
                           reimbursements then due to such Secured Party,

                                    (B) then to interest due to such Secured
                           Party,

                                    (C) then to pay or prepay principal of the
                           Loans owing to, or to reduce the "credit exposure"
                           of, such Secured Party under such Hedging
                           Obligation, as the case may be, and

                                    (D) then to pay the remaining outstanding
                           Obligations and cash collateralize all Letter of
                           Credit Outstandings;

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

                           (iii) third, without duplication of any amounts paid
                  pursuant to clause (b)(ii) above, to the Indemnified Parties
                  to the extent of any amounts owing pursuant to Section 11.4
                  of the Credit Agreement; and

                           (iv) fourth, to be held as additional collateral
                  security until the payment in full in cash of all of the
                  Obligations, the termination or expiration of all Letters of
                  Credit, the termination of all Rate Protection Agreements and
                  the termination of all Commitments, after which such
                  remaining cash proceeds shall be paid over to the Grantor or
                  to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such
                  surplus.

         For purposes of this Security Agreement, the "credit exposure" at any
         time of any Secured Party with respect to a Hedging Obligation to
         which such Secured Party is a party shall be determined at such time
         in accordance with the customary methods of calculating credit
         exposure under similar arrangements by the counterparty to such
         arrangements, taking into account potential interest rate movements
         and the respective termination provisions and notional principal
         amount and term of such Hedging Obligation.

         SECTION 6.2.  Indemnity and Expenses.

                  (a) The Grantor agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent
         from and against any and all claims, losses and liabilities arising
         out of or resulting from this Security Agreement (including
         enforcement of this Security Agreement), except claims, losses or
         liabilities resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence
         or wilful misconduct.

                  (b) The Grantor will upon demand pay to the Administrative
         Agent the amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including the
         reasonable fees and disbursements of its counsel and of any experts
         and agents, which the Administrative Agent may incur in connection
         with

                           (i) the administration of this Security Agreement,

                           (ii) the custody, preservation, use or operation of,
                  or the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon,
                  any of the Collateral,

                           (iii) the exercise or enforcement of any of the
                  rights of the Administrative Agent or the Secured Parties
                  hereunder, and

                           (iv) the failure by the Grantor to perform or
                  observe any of the provisions hereof.

which the Borrower is or may become a party, whether for principal, interest,
costs, fees, expenses, or otherwise, and all obligations of the Pledgor and
each other Obligor whether now or hereafter existing under this Pledge
Agreement and each other Loan Document to which the Pledgor or such other
Obligor is or may become a party (all such obligations of the Borrower, such
Pledgor and such other Obligor being the "Secured Obligations").

         SECTION 2.3. Delivery of Pledged Property. All certificates or
instruments representing or evidencing any Collateral, including all Pledged
Shares and all Pledged Notes, shall be delivered to and held by or on behalf of
(and, in the case of the Pledged Notes, endorsed to the order of) the
Administrative Agent pursuant hereto, shall be in suitable form for transfer by
delivery, and shall be accompanied by all necessary instruments of transfer or
assignment, duly executed in blank.

         SECTION 2.4. Dividends on Pledged Shares and Payments on Pledged
Notes. In the event that any Dividend is to be paid on any Pledged Share or any
payment of principal or interest is to be made on any Pledged Note at a time
when no Default of the nature referred to in Section 8.1.9 of the Credit
Agreement or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result
therefrom, such Dividend or payment may be paid directly to the applicable
Pledgor. If any such Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, then any such Dividend or payment shall be paid directly to the
Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 2.5. Continuing Security Interest; Transfer of Note. This
Pledge Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Collateral
and shall

                  (a) remain in full force and effect until payment in full in
         cash of all Secured Obligations, the termination or expiration of all
         Letters of Credit, the termination of all Rate Protection Agreements
         and the termination of all Commitments,

                                      -4-

<PAGE>

                  (b) be binding upon the Pledgor and its successors,
         transferees and assigns, and

                  (c) inure, together with the rights and remedies of the
         Administrative Agent hereunder, to the benefit of the Administrative
         Agent and each other Secured Party.

Without limiting the foregoing clause (c), any Lender may assign or otherwise
transfer (in whole or in part) any Note or Loan held by it to any other Person
or entity, and such other Person or entity shall thereupon become vested with
all the rights and benefits in respect thereof granted to such Lender under any
Loan Document (including this Pledge Agreement) or otherwise, subject, however,
to any contrary provisions in such assignment or transfer, and to the
provisions of Section 11.11 and Article X of the Credit Agreement. Upon (i) the
sale, transfer or other disposition of Collateral in accordance with the Credit
Agreement or (ii) the payment in full in cash of all Secured Obligations, the
termination or expiration of all Letters of Credit, the termination of all Rate
Protection Agreements and the termination of all Commitments, the security
interests granted herein shall automatically terminate with respect to (x) such
Collateral (in the case of clause (i)) or (y) all Collateral (in the case of
clause (ii)). Upon any such sale, transfer, disposition or termination, the
Administrative Agent will, at the Pledgor's sole expense, deliver to the
Pledgor, without any representations, warranties or recourse of any kind
whatsoever, all certificates and instruments representing or evidencing all
Pledged Shares and all Pledged Notes, together with all other Collateral held
by the Administrative Agent hereunder, and execute and deliver to the Pledgor
such documents as the Pledgor shall reasonably request to evidence such
termination.

         SECTION 2.6. Security Interest Absolute. All rights of the
Administrative Agent and the security interests granted to the Administrative
Agent hereunder, and all obligations of the Pledgor hereunder, shall be
absolute and unconditional, irrespective of

                  (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit
         Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document,

                  (b) the failure of any Secured Party or any holder of any
         Note

                           (i) to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any
                  right or remedy against the Borrower, any other Obligor or
                  any other Person under the provisions of the Credit
                  Agreement, any Note, any other Loan Document or otherwise, or

                           (ii) to exercise any right or remedy against any
                  other guarantor of, or collateral securing, any Secured
                  Obligations,

                                      -5-

<PAGE>

                  (c) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
         in any other term of, all or any of the Secured Obligations or any
         other extension, compromise or renewal of any Secured Obligation,

                  (d) any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination of
         any Secured Obligations for any reason, including any claim of waiver,
         release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject
         to (and the Pledgor hereby waives any right to or claim of) any
         defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever
         by reason of the invalidity, illegality, nongenuineness, irregularity,
         compromise, unenforceability of, or any other event or occurrence
         affecting, any Secured Obligations or otherwise,

                  (e) any amendment to, rescission, waiver, or other
         modification of, or any consent to departure from, any of the terms of
         the Credit Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document,

                  (f) any addition, exchange, release, surrender or
         non-perfection of any collateral (including the Collateral), or any
         amendment to or waiver or release of or addition to or consent to
         departure from any guaranty, for any of the Secured Obligations, or

                  (g) any other circumstances which might otherwise constitute
         a defense available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, the
         Borrower, any other Obligor, any surety or any guarantor.

         SECTION 2.7. Postponement of Subrogation, etc. The Pledgor will not
exercise any rights which it may acquire by reason of any payment made
hereunder, whether by way of subrogation, reimbursement or otherwise, until the
prior payment, in full and in cash, of all Secured Obligations, the termination
or expiration of all Letters of Credit, the termination of all Rate Protection
Agreements and the termination of all Commitments. Any amount paid to the
Pledgor on account of any payment made hereunder prior to the payment in full
in cash of all Secured Obligations shall be held in trust for the benefit of
the Secured Parties and each holder of a Note and shall immediately be paid to
the Secured Parties and each holder of a Note and credited and applied against
the Secured Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the
terms of the Credit Agreement; provided, however, that if

                  (a) the Pledgor has made payment to the Secured Parties and
         each holder of a Note of all or any part of the Secured Obligations,
         and

                  (b) all Secured Obligations have been paid in full in cash,
         all Letters of Credit have been terminated or expired, all Rate
         Protection Agreements have been terminated and all Commitments have
         been permanently terminated,

                                      -6-

<PAGE>

each Secured Party and each holder of a Note agrees that, at the Pledgor's
request, the Secured Parties and the holders of the Notes will execute and
deliver to the Pledgor appropriate documents (without recourse and without
representation or warranty) necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation
to the Pledgor of an interest in the Secured Obligations resulting from such
payment by the Pledgor. In furtherance of the foregoing, for so long as any
Secured Obligations, Letters of Credit or Commitments remain outstanding or any
Rate Protection Agreement remains in full force and effect, the Pledgor shall
refrain from taking any action or commencing any proceeding against the
Borrower or any other Obligor (or its successors or assigns, whether in
connection with a bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise) to recover any amounts in
respect of payments made under this Pledge Agreement to any Secured Party or
any holder of a Note.


                                  ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         SECTION 3.1. Representations and Warranties, etc. The Pledgor
represents and warrants to each Secured Party, as at the date of each pledge
and delivery hereunder (including each pledge and delivery of Pledged Shares
and each pledge and delivery of a Pledged Note) by the Pledgor to the
Administrative Agent of any Collateral, as set forth in this Article III.

         SECTION 3.2. Ownership, No Liens, etc. The Pledgor is the legal and
beneficial owner of, and has good and marketable title to (and has full right
and authority to pledge and assign) such Collateral, free and clear of all
liens, security interests, options, or other charges or encumbrances, except
any lien or security interest granted pursuant hereto in favor of the
Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 3.3. Valid Security Interest. The delivery of such Collateral
to the Administrative Agent is effective to create a valid, perfected, first
priority security interest in such Collateral and all proceeds thereof,
securing the Secured Obligations. No filing or other action will be necessary
to perfect or protect such security interest.

         SECTION 3.4. As to Pledged Shares. In the case of any Pledged Shares
constituting such Collateral, all of such Pledged Shares are duly authorized
and validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable, and constitute all of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each Pledged Share Issuer.
The Pledgor has no Subsidiaries other than the Pledged Share Issuers, except
as set forth in Item C of Attachment 1.

         SECTION 3.5. As to Pledged Notes. In the case of each Pledged Note,
all of such Pledged Notes have been duly authorized, executed, endorsed, issued
and delivered, and are the legal, valid and binding obligation of the issuers
thereof, and are not in default.

                                      -7-

<PAGE>

         SECTION 3.6. Authorization, Approval, etc. No authorization, approval,
or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental
authority, regulatory body or any other Person is required either

                  (a) for the pledge by the Pledgor of any Collateral pursuant
         to this Pledge Agreement or for the execution, delivery, and
         performance of this Pledge Agreement by the Pledgor, or

                  (b) for the exercise by the Administrative Agent of the
         voting or other rights provided for in this Pledge Agreement, or,
         except with respect to any Pledged Shares, as may be required in
         connection with a disposition of such Pledged Shares by laws affecting
         the offering and sale of securities generally, the remedies in respect
         of the Collateral pursuant to this Pledge Agreement.

         SECTION 3.7. Compliance with Laws. The Pledgor is in compliance with
the requirements of all applicable laws (including the provisions of the Fair
Labor Standards Act), rules, regulations and orders of every governmental
authority, the non-compliance with which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or which could reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the worth of the Collateral as
collateral security.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                                   COVENANTS

         SECTION 4.1. Certain Covenants. The Pledgor covenants and agrees
that, so long as any portion of the Secured Obligations shall remain unpaid,
any Letters of Credit shall be outstanding, any Rate Protection Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect or any Secured Party shall have any outstanding
Commitment, the Pledgor will, unless the Required Lenders shall otherwise
consent in writing, perform, comply with and be bound by the obligations set
forth in this Article IV.

         SECTION 4.2. Protect Collateral; Further Assurances, etc. The Pledgor
agrees and covenants that it will not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, or
encumber in any other manner the Collateral (except in favor of the
Administrative Agent hereunder). The Pledgor will warrant and defend the right
and title herein granted unto the Administrative Agent in and to the Collateral
(and all right, title, and interest represented by the Collateral) against the
claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever. The Pledgor agrees that at any
time, and from time to time, at the expense of the Pledgor, the Pledgor will
promptly execute and deliver all further instruments, and take all further
action, that may be necessary or desirable, or that the Administrative Agent
may reasonably request, in order to perfect and protect any security interest
granted or purported to be granted hereby or to enable the

                                      -8-

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder
with respect to any Collateral.

         SECTION 4.3. Stock Powers, etc. The Pledgor agrees that all Pledged
Shares (and all other shares of capital stock constituting Collateral)
delivered by the Pledgor pursuant to this Pledge Agreement will be accompanied
by duly executed undated blank stock powers, or other equivalent instruments of
transfer acceptable to the Administrative Agent. The Pledgor will, from time
to time upon the request of the Administrative Agent, promptly deliver to the
Administrative Agent such stock powers, instruments, and similar documents,
satisfactory in form and substance to the Administrative Agent, with respect to
the Collateral as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request and will,
from time to time upon the request of the Administrative Agent after the
occurrence of any Event of Default, promptly transfer any Pledged Shares or
other shares of common stock constituting Collateral into the name of any
nominee designated by the Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 4.4. Continuous Pledge. The Pledgor will, at all times, keep
pledged to the Administrative Agent pursuant hereto all Pledged Shares and all
other shares of capital stock constituting Collateral, all Dividends and
Distributions with respect thereto, all Pledged Notes, all interest, principal
and other proceeds received by the Administrative Agent with respect to the
Pledged Notes, and all other Collateral and other securities, instruments,
proceeds, and rights from time to time received by or distributable to the
Pledgor in respect of any Collateral and will not permit any Pledged Share
Issuer to issue any capital stock which shall not have been immediately duly
pledged hereunder on a first priority perfected basis.

         SECTION 4.5.  Voting Rights; Dividends, etc.  The Pledgor agrees:

                  (a) after any Default of the nature referred to in Section
         8.1.9 of the Credit Agreement or any Event of Default shall have
         occurred and be continuing, promptly upon receipt of notice thereof by
         the Pledgor and without any request therefor by the Administrative
         Agent, to deliver (properly endorsed where required hereby or
         requested by the Administrative Agent) to the Administrative Agent all
         Dividends, Distributions, all interest, all principal, all other cash
         payments, and all proceeds of the Collateral, all of which shall be
         held by the Administrative Agent as additional Collateral for use in
         accordance with Section 6.4; and

                  (b) after any Event of Default shall have occurred and be
         continuing and the Administrative Agent has notified the Pledgor of
         the Administrative Agent's intention to exercise its voting power
         under this Section 4.5(b)

                           (i) the Administrative Agent may exercise (to the
                  exclusion of the Pledgor) the voting power and all other
                  incidental rights of ownership with respect to any Pledged
                  Shares or other shares of capital stock constituting
                  Collateral and the Pledgor hereby grants the Administrative
                  Agent an

                                      -9-

<PAGE>

                  irrevocable proxy, exercisable under such circumstances, to
                  vote the Pledged Shares and such other Collateral; and

                           (ii) promptly to deliver to the Administrative Agent
                  such additional proxies and other documents as may be
                  necessary to allow the Administrative Agent to exercise such
                  voting power.

All Dividends, Distributions, interest, principal, cash payments, and proceeds
which may at any time and from time to time be held by the Pledgor but which
the Pledgor is then obligated to deliver to the Administrative Agent, shall,
until delivery to the Administrative Agent, be held by the Pledgor separate
and apart from its other property in trust for the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent agrees that unless an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing and the Administrative Agent shall have given the notice
referred to in Section 4.5(b), the Pledgor shall have the exclusive voting
power with respect to any shares of capital stock (including any of the Pledged
Shares) constituting Collateral and the Administrative Agent shall, upon the
written request of the Pledgor, promptly deliver such proxies and other
documents, if any, as shall be reasonably requested by the Pledgor which are
necessary to allow the Pledgor to exercise voting power with respect to any
such share of capital stock (including any of the Pledged Shares) constituting
Collateral; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast, or consent, waiver,
or ratification given, or action taken by the Pledgor that would impair any
Collateral or be inconsistent with or violate any provision of the Credit
Agreement or any other Loan Document (including this Pledge Agreement).

         SECTION 4.6. Additional Undertakings. The Pledgor will not, without
the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent:

                  (a) enter into any agreement amending, supplementing, or
         waiving any provision of any Pledged Note (including any underlying
         instrument pursuant to which such Pledged Note is issued) or
         compromising or releasing or extending the time for payment of any
         obligation of the maker thereof; or

                  (b) take or omit to take any action the taking or the
         omission of which would result in any impairment or alteration of any
         obligation of the maker of any Pledged Note or other instrument
         constituting Collateral.


                                   ARTICLE V

                           THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         SECTION 5.1. Administrative Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. The
Pledgor hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent such Pledgor's
attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of the Pledgor
and in the name of the Pledgor or

                                      -10-

<PAGE>



otherwise, from time to time in the Administrative Agent's discretion, to take
any action and to execute any instrument which the Administrative Agent may
deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Pledge
Agreement, including after the occurrence and during the continuance of a
Default of the nature referred to in Section 8.1.9 of the Credit Agreement or
an Event of Default:

                  (a) to ask, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compromise,
         receive and give acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to become
         due under or in respect of any of the Collateral;

                  (b) to receive, endorse, and collect any drafts or other
         instruments, documents and chattel paper, in connection with clause
         (a) above; and

                  (c) to file any claims or take any action or institute any
         proceedings which the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or
         desirable for the collection of any of the Collateral or otherwise to
         enforce the rights of the Administrative Agent with respect to any of
         the Collateral.

The Pledgor hereby acknowledges, consents and agrees that the power of
attorney granted pursuant to this Section is irrevocable and coupled with an
interest.

         SECTION 5.2. Administrative Agent May Perform. If the Pledgor fails to
perform any agreement contained herein, the Administrative Agent may itself
perform, or cause performance of, such agreement, and the expenses of the
Administrative Agent incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the
Pledgor pursuant to Section 6.4.

         SECTION 5.3. Administrative Agent Has No Duty. The powers conferred on
the Administrative Agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest (on
behalf of the Secured Parties) in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty
on it to exercise any such powers. Except for reasonable care of any Collateral
in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it
hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral or
responsibility for

                  (a) ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls,
         conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative
         to any Pledged Property, whether or not the Administrative Agent has
         or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or

                  (b) taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against
         prior parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral.

         SECTION 5.4. Reasonable Care. The Administrative Agent is required to
exercise reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any of the
Collateral in its possession; provided, however, the Administrative Agent shall
be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of
any of the Collateral, if it takes such action for that

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

purpose as the Pledgor reasonably requests in writing at times other than upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, but failure
of the Administrative Agent to comply with any such request at any time shall
not in itself be deemed a failure to exercise reasonable care.


                                   ARTICLE VI

                                    REMEDIES

         SECTION 6.1. Certain Remedies. If any Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing:

                  (a) The Administrative Agent may exercise in respect of the
         Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for
         herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a
         secured party on default under the U.C.C. (whether or not the U.C.C.
         applies to the affected Collateral) and also may, without notice
         except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in
         one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the
         Administrative Agent's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or
         for future delivery, and upon such other terms as the Administrative
         Agent may deem commercially reasonable. The Pledgor agrees that, to
         the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten days'
         prior notice to the Pledgor of the time and place of any public sale
         or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall
         constitute reasonable notification. The Administrative Agent shall not
         be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of
         sale having been given. The Administrative Agent may adjourn any
         public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time
         and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice,
         be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.

                  (b)  The Administrative Agent may

                           (i) transfer all or any part of the Collateral into
                  the name of the Administrative Agent or its nominee, with or
                  without disclosing that such Collateral is subject to the
                  lien and security interest hereunder,

                           (ii) notify the parties obligated on any of the
                  Collateral to make payment to the Administrative Agent of any
                  amount due or to become due thereunder,

                           (iii) enforce collection of any of the Collateral by
                  suit or otherwise, and surrender, release or exchange all or
                  any part thereof, or compromise or extend or renew for any
                  period (whether or not longer than the original period) any
                  obligations of any nature of any party with respect thereto,

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

                           (iv) endorse any checks, drafts, or other writings
                  in the Pledgor's name to allow collection of the Collateral,

                           (v) take control of any proceeds of the Collateral,
                  and

                           (vi) execute (in the name, place and stead of the
                  Pledgor) endorsements, assignments, stock powers and other
                  instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to all or
                  any of the Collateral.

         SECTION 6.2. Securities Laws. If the Administrative Agent shall
determine to exercise its right to sell all or any of the Collateral pursuant
to Section 6.1, each Pledgor agrees that, upon request of the Administrative
Agent, the Pledgor will, at its own expense:

                  (a) execute and deliver, and cause each issuer of the
         Collateral contemplated to be sold and the directors and officers
         thereof to execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents,
         and do or cause to be done all such other acts and things, as may be
         necessary or, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, advisable to
         register such Collateral under the provisions of the Securities Act of
         1933, as from time to time amended (the "Securities Act"), and to
         cause the registration statement relating thereto to become effective
         and to remain effective for such period as prospectuses are required
         by law to be furnished, and to make all amendments and supplements
         thereto and to the related prospectus which, in the opinion of the
         Administrative Agent, are necessary or advisable, all in conformity
         with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and
         regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable
         thereto;

                  (b) use its best efforts to qualify the Collateral under the
         state securities or "Blue Sky" laws and to obtain all necessary
         governmental approvals for the sale of the Collateral, as requested by
         the Administrative Agent;

                  (c) cause each such issuer to make available to its security
         holders, as soon as practicable, an earnings statement that will
         satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act; and

                  (d) do or cause to be done all such other acts and things as
         may be necessary to make such sale of the Collateral or any part
         thereof valid and binding and in compliance with applicable law.

The Pledgor further acknowledges the impossibility of ascertaining the amount
of damages that would be suffered by the Administrative Agent or the Secured
Parties by reason of the failure by the Pledgor to perform any of the covenants
contained in this Section and, consequently, agrees that, if such Pledgor shall
fail to perform any of such covenants, it shall pay, as liquidated damages and
not as a penalty, an amount equal to the value (as determined

                                      -13-

<PAGE>

by the Administrative Agent) of the Collateral on the date the Administrative
Agent shall demand compliance with this Section.

         SECTION 6.3. Compliance with Restrictions. The Pledgor agrees that in
any sale of any of the Collateral whenever an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to
comply with any limitation or restriction in connection with such sale as it
may be advised by counsel is necessary in order to avoid any violation of
applicable law (including compliance with such procedures as may restrict the
number of prospective bidders and purchasers, require that such prospective
bidders and purchasers have certain qualifications, and restrict such
prospective bidders and purchasers to persons who will represent and agree that
they are purchasing for their own account for investment and not with a view to
the distribution or resale of such Collateral), or in order to obtain any
required approval of the sale or of the purchaser by any governmental
regulatory authority or official, and the Pledgor further agrees that such
compliance shall not result in such sale being considered or deemed not to have
been made in a commercially reasonable manner, nor shall the Administrative
Agent be liable nor accountable to the Pledgor for any discount allowed by the
reason of the fact that such Collateral is sold in compliance with any such
limitation or restriction.

         SECTION 6.4. Application of Proceeds. All cash proceeds received by
the Administrative Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other
realization upon, all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent against, all or any part of the Secured Obligations as
follows:

                  (a) first, to the payment of any amounts payable to the
         Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11.3 of the Credit Agreement
         and Section 6.5;

                  (b) second, to the equal and ratable payment of Secured
         Obligations, in accordance with each Secured Party's Secured
         Obligations owing to it under or pursuant to the Credit Agreement or
         any other Loan Document, or under or pursuant to any Hedging
         Obligation included in the Secured Obligations as to each Secured
         Party, applied

                           (i) first to fees and expense reimbursements then
                  due to such Secured Party,

                           (ii) then to interest due to such Secured Party,

                           (iii) then to pay or prepay principal of the Loans
                  owing to, or to reduce the "credit exposure" of, such Secured
                  Party under such Hedging Obligation, as the case may be, and

                           (iv) then to pay the remaining outstanding Secured
                  Obligations and cash collateralize all Letter of Credit
                  Outstandings;

                                     -14-

<PAGE>

                  (c) third, without duplication of any amounts paid pursuant
         to clause (b) above, to the Indemnified Parties to the extent of any
         amounts owing pursuant to Section 11.4 of the Credit Agreement; and

                  (d) fourth, to be held as additional collateral security
         until the payment in full in cash of all of the Secured Obligations,
         the termination or expiration of all Letters of Credit, the
         termination of all Rate Protection Agreements and the termination of
         all Commitments, after which such remaining cash proceeds shall be
         paid over to the Pledgor or to whomsoever may be lawfully
         entitled to receive such surplus.

For purposes of this Pledge Agreement, the "credit exposure" at any time of any
Secured Party with respect to a Hedging Obligation to which such Secured Party
is a party shall be determined at such time in accordance with the customary
methods of calculating credit exposure under similar arrangements by the
counterparty to such arrangements, taking into account potential interest rate
movements and the respective termination provisions and notional principal
amount and term of such Hedging Obligation.

         SECTION 6.5. Indemnity and Expenses. The Pledgor hereby agrees to
jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent from
and against any and all claims, losses, and liabilities arising out of or
resulting from this Pledge Agreement (including enforcement of this Pledge
Agreement), except claims, losses, or liabilities resulting from the
Administrative Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct. Upon demand, such
Pledgor will pay to the Administrative Agent the amount of any and all
reasonable expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of its
counsel and of any experts and agents, which the Administrative Agent may incur
in connection with:

                  (a) the administration of this Pledge Agreement, the Credit
         Agreement and each other Loan Document;

                  (b) the custody, preservation, use, or operation of, or the
         sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, any of the
         Collateral;

                  (c) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the
         Administrative Agent hereunder; or

                  (d) the failure by such Pledgor to perform or observe any of
         the provisions hereof.

         SECTION 7.2. Amendments, etc. No amendment to or waiver of any
provision of this Pledge Agreement nor consent to any departure by the Pledgor
herefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Lenders or the
Required Lenders, as the case may be) and the Pledgor in the case of an
amendment, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it is given.

         SECTION 7.3. Protection of Collateral. The Administrative Agent may
from time to time, at its option, perform any act which the Pledgor agrees
hereunder to perform and which the Pledgor shall fail to perform after being
requested in writing so to perform (it being understood that no such request
need be given after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default) and the Administrative Agent may from time to time take any other
action which the Administrative Agent reasonably deems necessary for the
maintenance, preservation or protection of any of the Collateral or of its
security interest therein.
