ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

     GENERAL

     Transworld Healthcare, Inc. (the "Company") is a provider of a broad range
of health care services and products with operations in the United Kingdom
("U.K.") and the United States ("U.S."). The Company provides the following
services and products: (i) patient services, including nursing and
para-professional services; (ii) specialty mail-order pharmaceuticals, medical
supplies, respiratory therapy and home medical equipment; and (iii) infusion
therapy. The Company provides these services and products from the following
reportable business segments: (i) U.K. operations ("U.K. Operations"); (ii) U.S.
specialty mail-order pharmaceuticals and medical supplies operations
("Mail-Order Operations"); and (iii) U.S. hi-tech operations ("Hi-Tech
Operations"). The Company's U.K. Operations include the U.K.'s second largest
commercial provider of nursing and para-professional care to the community and
U.K. healthcare institutions, the U.K.'s second largest home respiratory
supplier as well as a leading value-added medical supplies distributor, all with
operations located throughout the U.K. The Company's Mail-Order Operations
provide products to patients in their home nationwide and in Puerto Rico while
its Hi-Tech Operations are concentrated in New Jersey and New York.

     The Company changed its fiscal year end from October 31 to September 30
effective for fiscal 1997. This resulted in an eleven month reporting period
ended September 30, 1997 (sometimes referred to herein as the "Eleven Month
Period") included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     The Company took a number of significant steps during the fiscal year ended
September 30, 1998 and the Eleven Month Period to realign its business as a
focused regional home health care provider and specialty pharmacy and medical
supply distributor in the U.S. and as an integrated national provider of health
care products and services in the U.K. These steps included: (i) selling
non-core assets such as the Company's Radamerica, Inc. ("Radamerica") business,
which provided radiation therapy in the Baltimore, Maryland area and the sale of
the assets of the Company's Transworld Home HealthCare - Nursing Division, Inc.
("TNI") operations (the "TNI Sale"), which provided nursing and
para-professional services in New Jersey and Florida; (ii) exiting businesses
that were deemed not to have the potential to earn an adequate return on capital
over the long term (such as wound care and orthotic product lines in the
continental U.S., as well as the Company's pulmonary rehabilitation center in
Cherry Hill, New Jersey); (iii) completing the sale of substantially all of the
assets of Health Management, Inc. ("HMI") to Counsel Corporation (the "HMI Asset
Sale"); and (iv) terminating the agreements to purchase Kwik Care, Ltd. and VIP
Health Services, Inc. (the "VIP Companies"), nursing service companies serving
New York City and the surrounding areas. The Company also completed the
acquisitions of Omnicare plc ("Omnicare") and Allied Medicare Ltd ("Allied") in
July 1997 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $91,000,000. Omnicare
provides respiratory equipment and services and supplies a range of medical and
surgical products to patients at home throughout the U.K. through its network of
seven regional facilities. Allied is a national provider of nursing and other
care-giving services to the community and U.K. healthcare institutions with
seventy-five locations throughout the U.K.

     The Company's principal executive offices are located at 555 Madison
Avenue, New York, New York 10022, and the Company's telephone number at that
location is (212) 750-0064.


                                      -1-

     STRATEGY

     The Company's strategic focus is to become the leading health care staffing
and services company in the U.K. The Company's growth strategy is to take
advantage of recent major policy moves by the government funded National Health
Service ("NHS") and by private payors seeking to treat a much larger number of
patients than in the past and to shorten waiting lists for access to care, as
well as the general trend of local government toward outsourcing its home care
requirements to private industry.

     It is the Company's intention to focus on internal growth, as well as to
acquire additional nursing and other care giving operations to expand and
complement its Allied operations. The Company believes that the health care
staffing and services industry in the U.K. is highly fragmented and that
additional acquisition opportunities will continue to arise in a general trend
toward industry consolidation. Consistent with this strategy, the Company
acquired a total of 17 nursing and carer operations during fiscal 1997, 1998 and
1999 in the U.K.

     The Company believes that valuations for health care staffing and services
companies in the U.K. market are significantly more attractive than in the U.S.
Therefore, the Company has executed a program to establish its U.K. Operations
as a stand-alone entity with its own financing in order to enable it to execute
an aggressive expansion program. To that end, on December 20, 1999, the
Company's U.K. subsidiaries completed a $124,500,000 refinancing which repaid
the Company's existing senior indebtedness of $55,755,000 and provided
approximately $46,000,000 for additional acquisitions in the U.K. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources."

     The Company believes that by structuring its U.K. Operations in such a
manner, it enables the U.K. subsidiaries to raise capital on more favorable
terms than may be available currently in the U.S., as well as positions the
Company to maximize the value of its ownership interest in the U.K. Operations
in the future, whether it be by way of a public offering of the U.K. Operation's
shares, through a strategic business combination, or other alternative means.

     In addition, the Company's strategy for its U.S. operations is to expand
its Mail-Order Operations through increasing the number of patients serviced,
with a primary focus on its respiratory medication and diabetic supply product
lines. The Company also seeks to expand its Hi-Tech Operations through marketing
its services to physicians, managed care organizations, hospitals, and other
referral sources in its market area.

     U.K. OPERATIONS

     U.K. SERVICES AND PRODUCTS

     The Company provides the following services and products in the U.K.: (i)
patient services, principally nursing and para-professional services, and (ii)
specialty pharmaceutical and medical supplies and respiratory therapy. The
Company's U.K. Operations' products and services are provided to patients
throughout the U.K.

     During fiscal 1999, the Company derived 67.6% of its revenues from U.K.
Operations, with the following contributions by product line: 76.7% of its U.K.
revenues from patient services, 19.1% from specialty pharmaceutical and medical
supplies and 4.2% from respiratory therapy.


                                      -2-
<PAGE>

     PATIENT SERVICES.

     The Company offers its U.K. patient services through Allied, a commercially
oriented provider of nursing and care staff services to a broad range of
clients, particularly NHS trusts, nursing homes, private clients and local
authority social services departments. Allied was founded in 1972 as a home
nursing service and has expanded through the establishment and acquisition of
branch offices throughout the U.K. The branch network has expanded substantially
in recent years, through both organic growth and an on-going nursing and care
agency acquisition program. Allied is now represented by 75 branches spread
across the U.K.

     The Company believes that the demand for most forms of nursing and other
health care services is expected to increase during the next twenty years as the
U.K. population grows older in line with demographic trends. Consequently, it is
anticipated that requirements for temporary nursing services will increase in
the future, benefiting Allied.

     SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES OPERATIONS AND RESPIRATORY
THERAPY.

     The Company offers its U.K. specialty pharmaceutical and medical supplies
and respiratory therapy through the following Omnicare subsidiaries: (i) Amcare
Ltd ("Amcare"); (ii) Allied Oxycare Ltd ("Oxycare"); and (iii) Medigas Ltd
("Medigas").

     Specialty Pharmaceutical and Medical Supplies Operations. Amcare supplies
ostomy, continence care and wound care products directly to patients at home
under a prescription written by the patients' family doctor. Amcare also
receives reimbursement and remuneration fees from the U.K. Department of Health
for providing dispensing services as defined by the terms of service for
contractors to the NHS and the "Drug Tariff" (a booklet listing all current
prescribable goods) for prescribable goods. These services are offered
throughout the mainland of the U.K.

     Respiratory Therapy. Medigas and its parent Oxycare service patients with
chronic respiratory diseases either directly at home or via the community
pharmacist. Medigas supplies filled oxygen cylinders to pharmacies for patients
at home who require lower volumes of oxygen per day or who may have temporary
respiratory conditions. These services are offered throughout the U.K. Oxycare
provides oxygen concentrators, which filter room air to provide a 95% oxygen
gas, to patients in their homes.

     U.K. QUALITY ASSURANCE; DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH LICENSES

     The Company's U.K. Operations maintain quality assurance policies and
procedures and closely monitor operations to provide quality care and services
to patients and health care professionals in the U.K. Where appropriate, the
Company's U.K. Operations operate under license of the U.K. Department of Health
and Medicines Control Agency ("MCA"), adhering to the terms and conditions of
service demanded by such licensing authority.

     The European Quality Standards BS EN ISO 9002 have been awarded to both
Amcare and Oxycare. The awarding authority checks the continued adherence to
these standards on a six month basis with procedure manuals being available for
review at any time.

     U.K. SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES

     The Company's U.K. Operations primarily market their products and services
to health care professionals who act as referral sources to patients. These
health care professionals include medics, nurses, pharmacists, administrators,
the NHS and private health care providers. Other important targets for
promotional activity include



                                      -3-
<PAGE>

patient associations and community social services organizations. Fundamental to
Allied's ability to obtain and retain referral sources is the ability to
establish and maintain a reputation for quality service and responsiveness to
the needs of referral sources and their patients and clients.

     Allied markets its nursing agency service via superintendents and their
staff within each of its seventy-five independent locations. These branch
locations are supported by small teams of sales and marketing professionals
based centrally to coordinate and support the sales activity.

     Amcare employs representatives to promote the dispensing and delivery
services of the Company in the U.K. and supports this with marketing and
managerial staff centrally based for coordination and customer support
activities.

     Medigas and Oxycare are marketed directly to the pharmacist for oxygen
cylinders and the NHS Supplies for oxygen concentrator services, by a senior
manager. In addition to primary sales activity, delivery drivers play a key role
as secondary sales staff.

     In general, the sales representatives and managers of the Company's U.K.
Operations market the Company's U.K. products and services through direct
contact with referral sources in the form of meetings, telephone calls and
solicitations. Contact is maintained with these sources to strengthen their
relationships. While representatives strive to develop the strongest provider
relationship possible, referral sources often choose to use several service and
product providers.

     As in many European and U.S. markets, the escalating pressures to reduce
the cost of health care has, for some lines of business (prescribed products and
services, including cylinder oxygen, concentrators and medical supplies) in the
Company's U.K. Operations, resulted in reductions in reimbursement rates.
However, the focus towards offering integrated home health care can result in an
overall cost saving leading to, the Company believes, substantial sales
opportunities for the Company's U.K. Operations.

     U.K. RECRUITING AND TRAINING OF PERSONNEL

     The Company's U.K. Operations recruit, train, provide on-going education,
offer benefits and other programs to its staff appropriate to their needs and
the requirements of the business. Recruiting of staff is conducted primarily
through advertising, direct contact with employment and governmental
organizations and through the use of competitive salary and benefit packages.

     The U.K. health care industry continues to face shortages of certain
qualified personnel. In particular, Allied's nursing business experiences
significant competition in recruiting qualified health care personnel for its
operations. Most of the registered and licensed health care professionals
employed by Allied are also registered with and accept placements from
competitors.

     U.K. THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT

     For the years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, the Company's U.K.
Operations received approximately 54.0% and 53.8%, respectively of revenues from
U.K. governmental payors (primarily the NHS). The remaining 46.0% and 46.2%,
respectively of revenues were derived from products and services provided to the
private health care sector and other commercial organizations, such as privately
owned nursing homes.

     In general, reimbursement is received regularly and reliably from all
governmental department payors and


                                      -4-
<PAGE>

this is also the case for most of the remaining customer base. The Company's
U.K. Operations generally collects payments from all third-party payors within
two months after products are supplied or services are rendered but pays its
accounts payable and employees currently.

     The billing and reimbursement process includes the rendering of invoices
for products and services rendered, as well as prescriptions and other support
documentation for reimbursement of drugs and medical supplies.

     U.K. SUPPLIERS

     The Company's U.K. Operations purchase their equipment and supplies
required in connection with the provision of its services from various approved
suppliers. The Company believes that there are a number of alternative sources
for these items at prices comparable to its current sources.

     U.K. COMPETITION

     The Company believes that there are no major integrated service providers
and few multi-regional or national providers of any individual product or
service in the U.K. The Company also believes that home health care providers
who possess the infrastructure to provide an integrated network of products and
service will have significant growth opportunities.

     The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in the U.K.
are: quality of care; breadth of services; reputation and professional
presentation; innovation; and value for services. The Company believes that the
success of its U.K. Operations is related to all of the above factors.

     The Company's U.K. Operations' nursing, medical supplies and respiratory
therapy services compete with local, national and international companies. The
nursing agency business of Allied is the second largest in the U.K.; however,
the leading competitor is approximately four times larger in sales revenue.

     U.K. PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

     The Company's U.K. Operations own no patents. The Company's U.K. Operations
operate under the following trade names: "Allied Medicare Ltd," "Medicare,"
"Medigas Ltd," "Allied Oxycare Ltd," "Omnicare Ltd," "Transworld Healthcare (UK)
Ltd," "Amcare Ltd," "Allied Medicare Services Ltd" and "Allied Medical Nursing
Services." The Company does not believe that its business in the U.K. is
dependent upon the use of any patent or trademark or similar property.

     U.K. EMPLOYEES

     As of December 31, 1999, the Company's U.K. Operations employed
approximately 179 full-time employees and 42 part-time employees.

     In addition, the Company's U.K. Operations maintain registers of
approximately 4,020 registered nurses, carers and aides available to staff home
and health service nursing arrangements on a temporary basis. The Company
considers its relationships with its U.K. employees to be satisfactory.

     U.S. OPERATIONS

     During fiscal 1999, the Company derived 32.4% of its revenues from U.S.
operations, with the following


                                      -5-
<PAGE>

contributions by reportable business segments: 73.8% of its U.S. revenues from
Mail-Order Operations and 26.2% from Hi-Tech Operations.

     U.S. SERVICES AND PRODUCTS

     MAIL-ORDER OPERATIONS.

     The Company's Mail-Order Operations provide specialty mail-order
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to patients in their home nationwide and in
Puerto Rico. The Company operates its Mail-Order Operations in Jacksonville,
Florida and Puerto Rico, which specialize in supplying diabetic patients with
glucose monitors and test strips, as well as respiratory, diabetic, maintenance
and other commonly prescribed medications. The Company also provides ostomy
products nationwide. As part of its service to patients, the Company provides
direct billing to Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies, thereby
reducing or eliminating up-front cash outlays for the patient. In addition, the
Company provides free routine home delivery, eliminating trips to the pharmacy.
The Company believes that its patients elect to receive their prescription drugs
and supplies via mail-order primarily because of convenience and the cash
savings. During 1997, the Company exited its wound care and orthotic product
lines in the continental U.S. As a result of this action, the Company recorded
special charges of $12,079,000 for the write-off of goodwill and intangible
assets and additional bad debt reserves of $6,060,000 related to the wound care
and orthotic product lines. In addition, during fiscal 1999, the remaining
accounts receivable associated with the wound care and orthotic product lines
were reserved for, as the Company became aware of deterioration in their
collectibility. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."

     HI-TECH OPERATIONS.

     The Company's Hi-Tech Operations provide the following services and
products in the U.S.: (i) infusion therapy; (ii) respiratory therapy; and (iii)
home medical equipment. The Company's Hi-Tech Operations are concentrated in New
Jersey and New York. During fiscal 1999, the Company's Hi-Tech Operations
derived 70.6% of its revenues from infusion therapy, 22.0% from respiratory
therapy and 7.4% from home medical equipment.

     Infusion Therapy. Infusion therapy involves the intravenous administration
of antibiotics, nutrients or other medications to patients in their homes
usually as a continuation of treatment initiated in the hospital. The Company's
related support services include patient training in the self-administration of
infusion therapies, nursing support, pharmacy operations and related delivery
services and insurance reimbursement assistance. The Company offers these
therapies and services to patients in the New York metropolitan area and in New
Jersey from its facility located in Clark, New Jersey.

     Respiratory Therapy. The Company provides home respiratory services to
patients with a variety of conditions, primarily chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (e.g., emphysema, chronic bronchitis and asthma). The Company employs a
clinical staff of respiratory care professionals to provide support to its home
respiratory therapy patients. These professionals manage the needs of the
Company's patients according to physician-directed plans of care. The Company's
respiratory therapy revenues are derived primarily from the provision of oxygen
systems, nebulizers (devices to aerosolize medication), home ventilators and
respiratory medication on a unit dose basis. The Company offers its respiratory
therapy services principally in New Jersey and the New York metropolitan area.

     Home Medical Equipment. The Company's U.S. product offerings in home
medical equipment consist of patient room equipment (such as hospital beds,
patient lifts and commodes), ambulatory aids (such as walkers and canes) and
bathroom safety items. The Company generally purchases this equipment from
manufacturers and rents it to patients. Accordingly, the Company generally
promotes its home medical equipment and services business as a


                                      -6-
<PAGE>

complementary product line in each of the markets where it also provides
respiratory therapy and infusion therapy.

     U.S. QUALITY ASSURANCE; JCAHO ACCREDITATIONS

     The Company maintains quality assurance policies and procedures and closely
monitors operations in order to provide high quality care with respect to the
services it offers. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations ("JCAHO"), a not-for-profit private organization that has
established standards for health care organizations, has granted accreditation
status to all of the Company's Hi-Tech Operations. JCAHO does not accredit
mail-order pharmacy operations and as such, the Company's U.S. Mail-Order
Operations are not eligible for such accreditation. The Company believes that
accreditations of its eligible facilities by JCAHO is a prerequisite for
entering into contracts with managed care providers and other intermediaries and
for obtaining and maintaining required licensure or certification.

     U.S. SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES

     The Company primarily markets its services and products to referral sources
such as physicians, hospital discharge planners and social service workers,
insurance companies, prepaid health plans, health maintenance organizations
("HMOs"), county medical services and private charitable organizations.
Fundamental to the Company's ability to obtain and retain referral sources is
establishing and maintaining a reputation for quality service and responsiveness
to the requirements of the referral sources.

     The Company currently employs full-time sales representatives for its
Hi-Tech Operations. The Company uses primarily the same sales force to
cross-market its products and services. The Company uses full-time and part-time
sales employees for its Mail-Order Operations.

     In general, the sales representatives market the Company's services through
direct contact with referral sources in the form of meetings, telephone calls
and sales presentations. The representatives maintain contact with these sources
in order to strengthen their relationships. While the sales representatives
strive to develop exclusive provider relationships, referral sources frequently
utilize the services of several home health care companies. The sales
representatives are trained by the Company to provide information to referral
sources concerning the quality and convenience of the Company's home health care
services and the potential cost-saving advantages of such services. Primarily
due to escalating pressures to contain health care costs, third-party payors are
participating to a greater extent in decisions regarding health care
alternatives and are consequently becoming more important in the referral and
case management process.

     During the latter part of 1996 and thereafter, there continued to be a
changing regulatory environment with respect to certain of the Company's product
lines, including, for example, developments affecting the respiratory
medications and the diabetic supplies segments of the Company's business. The
Company has increased its internal and external sales and marketing staff, as
well as developed new marketing programs in order to address these developments.
See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations -- General."

     U.S. THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT

     Substantially all of the Company's U.S. revenues are attributable to
third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, private insurers, managed
care plans and HMOs. The amounts received from government programs and private
third-party payors are dependent upon the specific benefits included under the
program or the patient's insurance policies. Like other medical service
providers, the Company is subject to lengthy reimbursement delays as


                                      -7-
<PAGE>

a result of third-party payment procedures. The Company generally collects
payments from third-party payors within three months after products are supplied
or services are rendered, but pays its accounts payable and employees currently.

     The billing and reimbursement process involves the collection, review and
approval of a significant number of required documents. Certain payors such as
Medicare, Medicaid and managed care plans require very specific procedures and
documentation prior to approving any request for reimbursement. Reimbursement
specialists of the Company work together to assess patient coverage, review the
adequacy of documentation, submit documentation and claims to the third-party
payors and expedite payment. The Company accepts assignment of insurance
benefits from the patient, and in most instances the third-party payors pay the
Company directly.

     For the year ended September 30, 1999, 64.5% and 6.9%, respectively, of the
Company's U.S. revenues were directly attributable to the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. For the year ended September 30, 1998, 60.6% and 12.9%, respectively,
of the Company's U.S. revenues were directly attributable to the Medicare and
Medicaid programs. The increase in the percentage of revenues directly
attributable to Medicare during the year ended September 30, 1999 versus 1998
was primarily the result of a decrease in revenues attributable to the sale of
the Company's nursing operations which did not derive any revenue from Medicare.

     U.S. SUPPLIERS

     The Company purchases its equipment and supplies, including drugs, home
medical equipment, nutritional solutions and other materials required in
connection with its therapies and specialty mail-order pharmacy and medical
supplies operations, from various suppliers. The Company believes that there are
a number of available sources of supply for the Company's products. The Company
has, from time to time, experienced difficulties in obtaining generic equivalent
diabetic testing strips due to shipping suspensions or product shortages from
its supplier. Historically, in these instances the Company has been able to
obtain equivalent product from alternate suppliers at similar cost. In the
future, any lengthy shortages or suspensions of their shipments, coupled with
the inability to secure product from alternate suppliers at similar cost, could
have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash
flows.

     U.S. COMPETITION

     The home health care market is highly fragmented and consists of numerous
providers, relatively few of which are national or regional in scope. The
Company competes with a large number of companies in all areas in which it
conducts business. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors
in the U.S. are quality of care, including responsiveness of services and
quality of professional personnel; breadth of services offered; referrals from
physicians, hospitals and HMOs; general reputation with physicians, other
referral sources and potential patients; and for certain payors, price.

     The Company's Mail-Order and Hi-Tech Operations, compete with numerous
local, regional and national companies. The Company believes that there are no
dominant competitors in the diabetic and respiratory generic drug market. The
Company's primary competition for its mail-order sales of diabetic and
respiratory drugs is generated from retail pharmacies.

     U.S. PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

     The Company owns no patents in the U.S. The Company owns the following
service marks in the U.S.: "Steri-Pharm," "Transworld Nurses, Inc.," "Advocate
Home Care" and "Respiflow." The Company does not believe that its business is
dependent upon the use of any patent or trademark or similar property.


                                      -8-
<PAGE>

     U.S. EMPLOYEES

     As of December 31, 1999, the Company had approximately 279 full-time
employees and approximately 44 part-time employees in the U.S. The Company
considers its relationship with its U.S. employees to be satisfactory.

     GOVERNMENT REGULATION

     U.K. GOVERNMENT REGULATION.

     General. The Company's U.K. Operations are subject to regulations by the
government of the U.K. via acts of Parliament related to health care provision.
These acts generally fall under the Department of Health and relate to services
provided to the general public under the NHS.

     Approximately 85% of health care in the U.K. is provided under the NHS with
the remaining 15% being provided by private health care organizations. However,
all care provision is regulated under the general health regulations of the
Department of Health.

     Health Care Reform. The NHS has released a green paper "Towards a Healthier
Future" and two white papers, one concerned with community care and the second
with primary care reforms.

     The current Labour government has continued to develop the previous Tory
government's plans of devolving decisions on patient care down to the family
doctor. Primary Care Groups, based on local communities are now in operation,
which will increasingly mean that decisions related to patient care and the
funding required, will be decided by a group representing general practitioners,
nurses, pharmacists and community care workers operating in conjunction with the
District Health Authorities and Local Authorities.

     In addition to this top-level development change, the NHS continues to seek
ways in which it can reduce costs. The Company believes that contractors to the
NHS will continue to come under pressure over the next 5 years, until the next
election, with the current government's determination to fund changes in the NHS
without increasing direct taxation.

     Licenses for Contractors and Suppliers. The Company's U.K. Operations are
subject to licensing and approval regulations from both governmental and
non-governmental bodies according to terms of service and operating procedures
decided by the U.K. government.

     Allied operates under the Nurses Act (England and Wales) 1957 and 1961
Amendment and the Nurses Agency Act (Scotland) 1957. In addition, Allied is
accredited by various U.K. social services agencies for the supply of carers to
the Community Services, within that specific area. The MCA has granted licenses
to Oxycare and Medigas for the production and distribution of medical grade
oxygen to the network of 12,000 pharmacies throughout the U.K. Amcare operates
as a dispensing appliance contractor and as such holds nine licenses for
premises which provide dispensing services to patients on the mainland of the
U.K. The Company operates under terms of service for pharmacy contractors
outlined in the National Service Act 1977(a) and the NHS (Pharmaceutical
Services) Regulations 1992. Levels of reimbursement and remuneration are
published monthly in the NHS's Drug Tariff.

     Fraud and Abuse. In late 1997, the Prescription Pricing Authority released
a report on "Prescription Fraud in the NHS" and certain recommendations have
been introduced to reduce the level of fraud by patients and contractors to the
NHS since April 1998. New prescription forms have been issued which are more
"secure" for the prescriber


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

while patients have to make signed undertakings that they are entitled to
receive the prescribed drugs. Regarding contractor fraud with prescriptions, a
number of practices were identified and challenged as to their legality.

     The Company believes that its practices regarding claim for reimbursement
and remuneration are in substantial compliance with applicable law and it has
recently amended, while continuing to review its practices in light of recent
recommendations to ensure they are in line with governmental regulations.

     The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance in all material
respects with U.K. health care laws and regulations applicable to its U.K.
Operations.

     U.S. GOVERNMENT REGULATION.

     General. The Company's business is subject to extensive Federal and state
regulation. Federal regulation covers, among other things, Medicare and Medicaid
billing and reimbursement, reporting requirements, supplier standards,
limitations on ownership and other financial relationships between a provider
and its referral sources and approval by the Food and Drug Administration of the
safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. In addition, the
requirements that the Company must satisfy to conduct its businesses vary from
state to state. The Company believes that its operations are in substantial
compliance with applicable Federal and state laws and regulations in all
material respects. However, changes in the law or new interpretations of
existing laws could have a material effect on permissible activities of the
Company, the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of
reimbursement for the Company's products and services paid by government and
other third-party payors.

     Health Care Reform. Political, economic and regulatory influences are
subjecting the health care industry in the U.S. to fundamental change. Although
Congress has failed to pass comprehensive health care reform legislation, the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (the "Balanced Budget Act") made several changes to
the Medicare reimbursement system that affect payment for the products provided
by the Company. Some of these provisions include an expansion of coverage of
diabetic testing supplies to non-insulin-treated Medicare diabetics, a 10%
reduction of Medicare payment rates for diabetic testing strips, as of January
1, 1998, a 5% reduction of Medicare payment rates for respiratory drugs, as of
January 1, 1998, a requirement that skilled nursing facilities provide directly
and bundle into their payment certain items, including medical supplies, which
may have been previously provided by outside suppliers, a freeze on the update
factor for durable medical equipment and supplies, and parenteral and enteral
equipment and supplies, a provision regarding billing for upgraded medical
equipment, and authorization for a competitive pricing demonstration program.
Under the Social Security Act's authority to the Health Care Financing
Administration ("HCFA") to alter certain reimbursement rates that are not
inherently reasonable, Medicare is proposing additional inherent reasonableness
cuts to Medicare payment rates as follows: (i) up to a 3.38% (depending on the
state) reduction for diabetic testing strips; (ii) a 15% reduction in Medicare
payment rates for diabetic lancets, and an additional 15% and 2.32% in
subsequent years; and (iii) a 10.5% reduction for albuterol sulfate (a
respiratory drug). On November 29, 1999, President Clinton signed into law the
Medicare, Medicaid and S-CHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, better
known as the Provider Relief Act. The Provider Relief Act provides that HCFA may
not use or permit its contractors to use the inherent reasonableness process
until after (i) the Comptroller General of the United States issues a report
regarding the impact of HCFA's and/or its contractor's use of such authority;
and (ii) HCFA has published final regulations implementing the agency's inherent
reasonableness authority. Consequently, it is unclear if or when HCFA will be
able to implement any of its previously proposed inherent reasonableness
reductions for diabetic testing strips, diabetic lancets or albuterol sulfate or
any other items and services supplied by the Company to Medicare beneficiaries.

     The Company anticipates that Congress and state legislatures will continue
to review and assess alternative health care delivery and payment systems and
may in the future propose and adopt legislation effecting fundamental


                                      -10-
<PAGE>

changes in the health care delivery system. The Company cannot predict the
ultimate timing, scope or effect of any legislation concerning health care
reform. Any proposed Federal legislation, if adopted, could result in
significant changes in the availability, delivery, pricing and payment for
health care services and products. Various state agencies also have undertaken
or are considering significant health care reform initiatives. Although it is
not possible to predict whether any health care reform legislation will be
adopted or, if adopted, the exact manner and the extent to which the Company
will be affected, it is likely that the Company will be affected in some
fashion, and there can be no assurance that any health care reform legislation,
if and when adopted, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
consolidated business, financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

     Permits and Licensure. Certain of the Company's facilities are subject to
state licensure laws, including licensing from state boards of pharmacy. Federal
laws require certain of the Company's facilities to comply with rules applicable
to controlled substances. These rules include an obligation to register with the
Drug Enforcement Administration of the United States Department of Justice and
to meet certain requirements concerning security, record keeping, inventory
controls, prescription and order forms and labeling. The Company's pharmacists
and nurses also are subject to state licensing requirements. The Company
believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable licensure
requirements.

     Fraud and Abuse Laws. The Company is subject to Federal and state laws
prohibiting direct or indirect payments for patient referrals for items and
services reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid and state programs, as well as in
relation to private payors. The Company also is subject to Federal and state
laws governing certain financial relationships with physicians and other fraud
and abuse laws prohibiting the submission of false claims.

     The Federal Medicare and Medicaid "Anti-kickback Statute" prohibits certain
conduct involving improper payments in connection with the delivery of items or
services covered by a number of Federal and state health care programs. Among
other things, these prohibitions apply to anyone who knowingly and willfully
solicits, receives, offers, or pays any remuneration in return for referring an
individual to another person for the furnishing, or arranging for the
furnishing, of any item or service that may be paid, in whole or in part, by the
Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health care programs. To date, courts have
interpreted the Anti-kickback Statute to apply to a broad range of financial
relationships between providers and referral sources, including physicians and
other direct health care providers, as well as persons who do not have a direct
role in the provision of health care services. Violations of the statute may
result in criminal penalties, including fines of up to $25,000 and imprisonment
for up to five years for each violation, exclusion from participation in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs, and civil penalties of up to $50,000 and treble
the amount of remuneration for each violation. The Balanced Budget Act increases
accountability and strengthens program integrity through additional fraud and
abuse penalties.

         The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' ("HHS") Office of
Inspector General ("OIG") has adopted regulations creating "safe harbors" from
Federal criminal and civil penalties under the Anti-kickback Statute by
identifying certain types of ownership interests and other financial
arrangements that do not appear to pose a threat of Medicare and Medicaid
program abuse. Additional safe harbors have also been proposed, and OIG has
recently solicited proposals for developing new and modifying existing safe
harbors. Transactions covered by the Anti-kickback Statute that do not conform
to an applicable safe harbor are not necessarily in violation of the
Anti-kickback Statute, but such arrangements would risk scrutiny and may be
subject to civil sanctions or criminal enforcement action.

     The Federal self-referral or "Stark Law" provides that where a physician
has a "financial relationship" with a provider of "designated health services"
(including, among other things, parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment and
supplies, outpatient prescription drugs and home medical equipment, which are
products and services provided by the Company), the physician is prohibited from
referring a Medicare patient to the health care provider, and that


                                      -11-
<PAGE>

provider is prohibited from billing Medicare, for the designated health service.
The Stark Law has certain statutory exceptions. In August 1995, regulations were
issued pursuant to the Stark Law as it existed prior to significant amendments
enacted in 1993. The preamble to these regulations states that HCFA intends to
rely on the language and interpretations in the regulations when reviewing
compliance under the Stark Law, as amended (the "Amended Stark Law"). Certain
exceptions from the referral prohibitions are available under the Amended Stark
Law, including the referral of patients to providers owned by certain qualifying
publicly-traded companies in which a referring physician owns an investment
security. At this time, the Company believes that its investments will qualify
for the publicly-traded securities exception because it has shareholder equity
of at least $75,000,000. Submission of a claim that a provider knows or should
know is for services for which payment is prohibited under the Amended Stark
Law, and which does not meet an exception could result in refunds of any amounts
billed, civil money penalties of not more than $15,000 for each such service
billed, and possible exclusion from the Medicare program. In addition a state
cannot receive Federal financial participation payments under the Medicaid
program for designated health services furnished to an individual on the basis
of a physician referral that would result in a denial of payment under Medicare
if Medicare covered the services to the same extent as under a state Medicaid
plan.

     A number of Federal laws impose civil and criminal liability for knowingly
presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly
making a false statement to get a false claim paid or approved by the
government. Under one such law, the "False Claims Act," civil damages may
include an amount that is three times the amount of claims falsely made or the
government's actual damages, and up to $10,000 per false claim. In addition, a
civil penalty of up to $15,000 may be assessed for engaging in other activities
prohibited by this statute. Actions to enforce the False Claims Act may be
commenced by a private citizen on behalf of the Federal government, and such
private citizens receive between 15 and 30 percent of the recovery. Recent
government efforts have been made (with mixed success) to assert that any claim
resulting from a relationship in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute or the
Amended Stark Law is false or fraudulent under the False Claims Act. The Company
carefully monitors its submissions of Medicare and Medicaid claims and all other
claims for reimbursement to assure that they are not false or fraudulent, and as
noted above, believes that it is in substantial compliance with the
Anti-kickback Statute or the Amended Stark Law.

     The OIG of HHS instituted "Operation Restore Trust" in May 1995 in the five
states with the highest Medicare expenditures (California, Florida, New York,
Texas and Illinois). Operation Restore Trust is intended to counter health care
fraud, waste and abuse in targeted areas that HHS believes to be particularly
vulnerable to fraud and abuse, including home health care, nursing homes and
home medical equipment. The OIG also has issued "Fraud Alerts" relating to
improper business practices in the provision of medical supplies to nursing
homes, and is expected to issue additional Fraud Alerts in the future as a means
of advising the public of suspect business arrangements and practices in the
health care industry. In addition, providers of home medical equipment, wound
care supplies and other products and services are expected to be subject to
increased scrutiny for practices involving fraud and abuse.

     Many states, including the states in which the Company operates, have
adopted statutes and regulations prohibiting payments for patient referrals and
other types of financial arrangements with health care providers, which, while
similar in certain respects to the Federal legislation, vary from state to
state. Sanctions for violating these state restrictions may include loss of
licensure and civil and criminal penalties. Certain states also have begun
requiring health care practitioners and/or other providers to disclose to
patients any financial relationship with a provider, including advising patients
of the availability of alternative providers.

     The Company continues to review all aspects of its operations and believes
that it is in substantial compliance with all material respects with applicable
provisions of the Anti-kickback Statute, the Amended Stark Law, False Claims and
applicable state laws, although because of the broad and sometimes vague nature
of these laws, there can be no assurance that an enforcement action will not be
brought against the Company or that the Company will not be


                                      -12-
<PAGE>

found to be in violation of one or more of these provisions. The Company intends
to monitor developments under these Federal and state fraud and abuse laws. At
this time, the Company cannot anticipate what impact, if any, subsequent
administrative or judicial interpretation of the applicable Federal and state
fraud and abuse laws may have on the Company's consolidated business, financial
position, cash flows or results of operations.

     On July 11 and July 22, 1997, the Company's RespiFlow, Inc. ("RespiFlow")
and MK Diabetic Support Services, Inc. ("MK") subsidiaries, respectively, each
received a letter (the "Audit Letters") from the HHS' Office of Audit Services,
a division of the OIG. The Company was subsequently informed that the Audit
Letters cover its DermaQuest, Inc. ("DermaQuest") subsidiary. The Company has
produced certain documents and provided related information to the OIG and to
the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas regarding these
subsidiaries' financial relationships with suppliers of durable medical
equipment and various other practices including the subsidiaries' practices
regarding the collection of coinsurance and deductible amounts due from Medicare
beneficiaries. Additionally, on November 19, 1997, the Company was notified by
the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas that the Company, RespiFlow,
MK, and various other non-affiliated entities had been named defendants in a qui
tam action under the Federal False Claims Act. The qui tam action was recently
unsealed and a copy the complaint was provided to the Company. The relator is a
private party who has brought action on behalf of the Federal government. At
present, the Company has entered into settlement discussions with the Department
of Justice ("DOJ") and the OIG in an effort to bring closure to this matter and
to avoid the expense, disruption and uncertainty of litigation. The counsel for
the relator has been involved in these settlement discussions as well. At
present, the Company is not able to determine when a final settlement will be
reached with the DOJ, the OIG and the relator or whether any proposed settlement
can be concluded on terms acceptable to the Company. Accordingly, the Company is
unable to estimate what the appropriate loss might be at this time. In the event
that these settlement discussions are unsuccessful the Company will defend
vigorously its interest in these matters. As such, the Company cannot predict
whether the outcome of these actions will have a material adverse effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of
operations.

     INSURANCE

     Participants in both the U.K. and U.S. health care markets are subject to
lawsuits alleging negligence, product liability or other similar legal theories,
many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs. The Company,
from time to time, is subject to such suits as a result of the nature of its
business. The Company maintains general liability insurance, professional
liability insurance and excess liability coverage, as appropriate. Each of these
policies provides coverage on an "occurrence" basis and has certain exclusions
from coverage. The Company's insurance policies must be renewed annually. While
the Company has been able to obtain liability insurance in the past, such
insurance varies in cost, is difficult to obtain and may not be available in the
future on terms acceptable to the Company, if it is available at all. The
failure to maintain insurance coverage or a successful claim not covered by or
in excess of the Company's insurance coverage could have a material adverse
effect on the Company's consolidated business, financial position, cash flows
or results of operations. In addition, claims, regardless of their merit or
eventual outcome, may have a material adverse effect on the Company's
reputation. There can be no assurance that the Company's insurance will be
sufficient to cover liabilities that it may incur in the future.

     The Company owns three and leases forty-nine facilities in the U.K. (of
which sixteen are for a period of three months or less) and leases a total of
six facilities in three states and Puerto Rico. In addition, there are
thirty-nine facilities in the U.K. which are owned or leased by branch
representatives. Management believes that its existing leases will be
renegotiated as they expire or that alternative properties can be leased on
acceptable terms. The Company also believes that its present facilities are well
maintained and are suitable for it to continue its existing


                                      -13-

operations. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

     THE COMPANY

     On February 4, 1997, Patient Care Systems, Inc. ("PCS") filed a lawsuit
against DermaQuest and the Company in the Court of Common Pleas of Chester
County, Pennsylvania, for breach of contract, conversion, unjust enrichment and
misrepresentation. Subsequently, PCS withdrew all claims except for its breach
of contract claim. On April 22, 1997, DermaQuest filed a counterclaim against
PCS for breach of contract. The action related to a contract initially entered
into between DermaQuest and PCS to market alternating pressure mattresses. A
jury trial in this matter began on June 28, 1999. On July 2, 1999, the jury
reached their verdict finding in favor of PCS on its breach of contract claim
and finding in favor of DermaQuest on its breach of contract counterclaim. Post
verdict, the parties settled the litigation whereby DermaQuest and the Company
agreed to pay a total of $180,000, as a full, final and complete resolution of
the dispute.

     On August 20, 1999, TNI was named a defendant in a suit brought by Teresa
Crutcher, in New Jersey state court, as administrator of the estate of Aaron
Pernell, who was an infant and Teresa Crutcher's son. The claim is for wrongful
death of Aaron Pernell alleged to have been caused by the negligent manner in
which a TNI home care nurse placed him in an infant car seat. TNI has answered
the complaint. The claim is insured. As the case is in a preliminary stage, the
Company is not able to estimate any potential exposure and has not recorded any
amounts in its financial statements. It is possible that irrespective of
insurance coverage, the ultimate outcome of this action could be materially
unfavorable to the Company's consolidated financial condition, cash flows, or
results of operations. However, the Company intends to defend the proceedings
vigorously and believes that the ultimate liability, if any, will be within the
policy limits of its insurance, and will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of
operations.

     On April 13, 1998, a shareholder of the Company, purporting to sue
derivatively on behalf of the Company, commenced a derivative suit in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, entitled Kevin Mak,
derivatively and on behalf of Transworld Healthcare, Inc., Plaintiff, vs.
Timothy Aitken, Scott A. Shay, Lewis S. Ranieri, Wayne Palladino and Hyperion
Partners II L.P., Defendants, and Transworld Healthcare, Inc., Nominal
Defendant, Index No. 98-106401. The suit alleges that certain officers and
directors of the Company, and Hyperion Partners II L.P. ("HPII"), breached
fiduciary duties to the Company and its shareholders, in connection with a
transaction, approved by a vote of the Company's shareholders on March 17, 1998,
in which the Company was to issue certain shares of stock to HPII in exchange
for the HMI Receivables (as defined and described in "Certain Relationships and
Related Transactions - Transactions with Principal Shareholders"). The action
seeks injunctive relief against this transaction, damages and costs and
attorneys' fees in unspecified amounts. The transaction subsequently closed and
the plaintiff has, on numerous occasions, stipulated to extend the defendants'
time to respond to this suit. The most recent stipulation provides for an
extension to March 3, 2000.

     HMI

     Effective October 1, 1997, the Company owned 100% of the stock of HMI.

     HMI and certain of its current and former officers have been named as
defendants in a class action lawsuit filed on April 3, 1997 in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of New York formerly entitled Nicholas
Volonnino et al. v. Health Management, Inc., W. James Nicol, Paul S. Jurewicz
and James Mieszala, 97 Civ.


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

1646. The action was amended on September 12, 1997, and is now entitled Dennis
Baker et al. v. Health Management, Inc., BDO Seidman, LLP, Transworld
HealthCare, Inc., W. James Nicol, Paul S. Jurewicz and James Mieszala. The
plaintiffs asserted claims under Sections 10(b) and 20 (a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, arising out of
alleged misrepresentations and omissions by HMI in connection with certain of
its previous securities filings and press releases. The Company was sued as an
alleged control entity of HMI, based upon its acquisition of 49% of HMI's
outstanding common stock on January 13, 1997. The plaintiffs purport to be a
class of persons who purchased shares of HMI common stock between April 26, 1996
and March 17, 1997, the date that HMI announced that it would have to restate
certain of its financial statements and that it was renegotiating its deal with
the Company. Plaintiffs sought unspecified compensatory damages from the harm
that allegedly resulted from the alleged wrongdoing. Following the filing of
several motions by the parties and the filings of an amended complaint by the
plaintiffs, to which defendants responded, a memorandum of understanding, dated
March 16, 1999, setting forth the terms of a settlement of this litigation, was
executed by the plaintiffs, the Company, W. James Nicol, Paul S. Jurewicz, James
Mieszala, and HMI (the "HMI Defendants") and National Union Fire Insurance
Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania ("National"). The total settlement to be
paid by the HMI Defendants is $2,375,000. The Company is directly responsible to
pay $325,000 of the settlement amount and National (as a separate party to the
settlement) is directly responsible to pay the remaining $2,050,000. Of the
$325,000 to be paid by the Company, $50,000 will be reimbursed by the Company's
directors' and officers' insurance policy carrier. On July 26, 1999, the
plaintiffs and BDO Seidman LLP entered into a preliminary agreement to settle
the claims against BDO Seidman LLP for $100,000. The Court subsequently
certified the class of plaintiffs to include all persons or entities who
purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of HMI between April 26, 1996
and March 17, 1997 inclusive, except the defendants and related parties. In
November 1999, the Court gave final approval to the settlement.

     On July 2, 1998, a former shareholder of HMI purporting to sue on behalf of
a class of shareholders of HMI as of June 6, 1997, commenced a suit in the
Delaware Chancery Court, New Castle County, entitled Kathleen S. O'Reilly v.
Transworld HealthCare, Inc., W. James Nicol, Andre C. Dimitriadis, Dr. Timothy
J. Triche and D. Mark Weinberg, Civil Action No. 16507-NC. Plaintiff alleged
that the Company, as majority shareholder of HMI, and the then directors of HMI,
breached fiduciary duties to the minority shareholders of HMI by approving a
merger between HMI and a subsidiary of the Company for inadequate consideration.
Plaintiff demands an accounting, damages, attorney's fees and other payment for
other expenses for unspecified amounts. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss
this action on September 18, 1998. The Court denied defendants' motion in part
and granted the motion in part, leaving intact certain claims. Plaintiff has
propounded discovery requests. The claims are insured.

     HMI was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed on November 25, 1997, in
the Chancery Court for the State of Delaware for New Castle County, entitled
Clifford E. Hotte v. Health Management, Inc., CA No. 1606-NC. The plaintiff
sought reimbursement and advancement of legal fees and expenses in the amount of
$1,000,000 incurred or anticipated in connection with his defense of certain
claims against him, a director and officer of HMI, in various litigation. The
Court granted plaintiff a preliminary injunction requiring HMI to pay $824,000
for plaintiff's legal expenses. As part of the settlement of a class action
litigation in which Clifford Hotte was still a defendant, but to which the
Company was not a party (although it had been previously), HMI's insurer,
National agreed to pay $1,000,000 to settle all of the class action plaintiffs'
claims against Clifford Hotte and his wife, who was a co-defendant, in exchange
for mutual releases of the parties and a release from Clifford Hotte of his
judgement and any further claims against HMI, including the $824,000 legal
expenses.

     By letter dated December 20, 1999, the Company received formal written
notification of the intent of two plaintiffs to file a civil action in the Court
of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania against Transworld Healthcare,
Inc., Transworld Home Healthcare, Inc., Health Management, Inc. and HMI
Pennsylvania, Inc. The two plaintiffs, Irwin Hirsch and Lloyd Myers, formerly
were employees of HMI Pennsylvania, Inc.


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

a subsidiary of the Company, and had written employment agreements. Myers also
served as an officer of HMI. In their capacities as employees and as officers,
both had some contractual indemnification rights against HMI and HMI
Pennsylvania, Inc. for defense and indemnification. In 1994, Hirsch and Myers
also sold two retail pharmacies they owned to HMI.

     Hirsch and Myers were named as defendants in an action filed in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of New York entitled In re Health
Management, Inc. Securities Litigation, Master File No. 96 Civ. 0889 (ADS),
which was a class action by shareholders of HMI alleging, among other claims
against the defendants, fraud in connection with the valuation of certain
securities. Hirsch and Myers incurred non-reimbursed legal expenses of $100,000
in defending that litigation and, ultimately, settled their liability jointly
for $1,325,000, which was non-reimbursed. They demand that defendants reimburse
to them their non-reimbursed legal fees and the settlement amount pursuant to
the indemnification provisions of their employee contracts.

     In addition to their indemnification claims, Hirsch and Myers also claim
damages in the amount of $7,000,000 for losses in connection with the pharmacies
sale transaction they entered into with HMI under which they sold their retail
pharmacies to HMI. Hirsch and Myers claim that the pharmacies sale transaction
was based upon fraudulent misrepresentations by HMI.

     The Company and HMI entities will vigorously defend against these claims.
The Company believes that Hirsch and Myers' indemnification claims should not
have any real merit because of testimony given by Hirsch and Myers under oath in
connection with a criminal trial against Clifford Hotte, a director and former
officer of HMI. In their testimony, Hirsch and Myers acknowledged malfeasance
and nonfeasance, which should render their contractual entitlement to
indemnification void. Even if they are entitled to indemnification despite their
acknowledgements, they are liable to defendants for the economic losses and
damages suffered by defendants as a result of the malfeasance and nonfeasance.
Therefore if the civil actions are filed, the Company and HMI entities will
aggressively pursue counterclaims against Hirsch and Myers for damages which,
conservatively, are far in excess of their claims, including the claims
associated with the pharmacies sale transaction.

     The enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") has issued a formal order of investigation relating to matters
arising out of HMI's public announcement on February 27, 1996 that HMI would
have to restate its financial statements for prior periods as a result of
certain accounting irregularities. HMI is fully cooperating with this
investigation and has responded to the requests of the Commission for
documentary evidence.

     The outcomes of certain of the foregoing lawsuits and the investigation
with respect to HMI are uncertain and the ultimate outcomes could have a
material adverse affect on the Company.

     The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings and claims
incidental to its normal business activities. The Company is vigorously
defending its position in all such proceedings. Management believes these
matters should not have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial
position, cash flows, or results of operations of the Company.

     See also "Business Government Regulation."

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

     The Company held its annual meeting of shareholders on September 14, 1999
(the "Annual Meeting"). The proposals voted upon at the Annual Meeting were (1)
to elect five directors to serve for a term of one year and


                                      -16-
<PAGE>

until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified and (2) to
ratify the appointment by the Company's Board of Directors of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as independent accountants of the Company for the
fiscal year ending September 30, 1999.

     The voting results with respect to each proposal are set forth below:

     As of January 3, 2000, there were approximately 168 stockholders of record
of the Common Stock.

     The Company has neither declared nor paid any dividends on its Common Stock
and does not anticipate paying dividends in respect of its Common Stock in the
foreseeable future. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of
the Company's Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, the
Company's earnings, financial position, cash flows, capital requirements and
other relevant considerations, including the extent of its indebtedness and any
contractual restrictions with respect to the payment of dividends. Under the
terms of the Company's former senior secured revolving credit facility (the
"Credit Facility), the Company was prohibited from paying dividends or making
other cash distributions. Under the terms of the Refinancing (as defined and
described in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources"), the Company's U.K.
subsidiaries are prohibited from paying dividends or making other cash
distributions. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

     GENERAL

     The Company changed its fiscal year to end on September 30 from October 31
effective for fiscal 1997. This resulted in an eleven month reporting period for
the period ended September 30, 1997.

     The Company is a provider of a broad range of health care services and
products with operations in the U.K. and the U.S. The Company provides the
following services and products: (i) patient services, including nursing and
para-professional services; (ii) specialty mail-order pharmaceuticals, medical
supplies, respiratory therapy and home medical equipment; and (iii) infusion
therapy. The Company provides these services and products from the following
reportable business segments: (i) U.K. Operations; (ii) U.S. Mail-Order
Operations; and (iii) U.S. Hi-Tech Operations. The Company's U.K. Operations
include the U.K.'s second largest commercial provider of nursing and
para-professional care to the community and U.K. healthcare institutions, the
U.K.'s second largest home respiratory supplier as well as a leading value-added
medical supplies distributor, all with operations located throughout the U.K.
The Company's Mail-Order Operations provide specialty mail-order pharmaceutical
and medical supplies (including respiratory and diabetic medications and
supplies, as well as ostomy and orthotic products) to patients in their home
nationwide and in Puerto Rico while its U.S. Hi-Tech Operations provide infusion
and respiratory therapy services and home medical equipment and are concentrated
in New Jersey and New York.

     The Company took a number of significant steps during the fiscal year ended
September 30, 1998 and the Eleven Month Period to realign its business as a
focused regional home health care provider and specialty pharmacy and medical
supply distributor in the U.S. and as an integrated national provider of home
and alternate site health care products and services in the U.K. These steps
included (i) selling non-core assets such as the Company's Radamerica business
which provided radiation therapy in the Baltimore, Maryland area and the
Company's TNI operations, which provided nursing and para-professional services
in New Jersey and Florida; (ii) exiting businesses that were deemed not to have
the potential to earn an adequate return on capital over the long term (such as
wound care and orthotic product lines in the continental U.S., as well as the
Company's pulmonary rehabilitation center in Cherry Hill, New Jersey); (iii)
completing the HMI Asset Sale; and (iv) terminating the agreements to purchase
the VIP Companies. The Company also completed the acquisitions of Omnicare and
Allied in July 1997 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
$91,000,000. Omnicare provides respiratory equipment and services and supplies a
range of medical and surgical products to patients at home throughout the U.K.
through its network of seven regional facilities. Allied is a national provider
of nursing and other care-giving services to the community and U.K. healthcare
institutions with seventy-five locations throughout the U.K.

     The Company's revenue mix and payor mix will be influenced to a significant
degree by the relative


                                      -21-

contribution of acquired businesses and their respective payor profiles. The

each of the Company's product lines:

</TABLE>

     The increase in net patient services as a percentage of total revenues for
the year ended September 30, 1999 as compared to 1998 is primarily due to growth
in Allied's branch network (both organically and through the on-going nursing
and care agency acquisition program). The decrease in net respiratory medical
equipment and supplies sales as a percentage of revenues for the year ended
September 30, 1999 as compared to 1998 is due primarily to a decrease in
revenues in the Company's U.S. Mail-Order and Hi-Tech Operations due principally
to a reduction in the number of patients serviced. Acquisitions, when completed,
will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues. On a pro forma basis,
assuming the Company owned 100% of Omnicare and Allied on November 1, 1996, the
percentage of total revenues for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997
would have been as follows: net respiratory, medical equipment and supplies
sales 47.3%; net patient services 44.9%; and net infusion services 7.8%.

     The following table shows the historical payor mix for the Company's total
revenues for the periods presented:

</TABLE>

     The increase in U.K. NHS and other U.K. governmental payors and private
payors as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 1999
as compared to 1998 is primarily due to the growth in Allied's branch network,
as described above. The decrease in Medicare and Medicaid as a percentage of
total revenues for the year ended September 30, 1999 as compared to 1998 is
primarily due to the decrease in revenues in the Company's U.S. Mail-Order and
Hi-Tech Operations, as described above. The decrease in Medicare as a percentage
of total revenues for the year ended September 30, 1998 as compared to the
Eleven Month Period is primarily a result of the Omnicare and Allied
acquisitions. The Company believes that its payor mix in the future will be
determined primarily by the payor profile of completed acquisitions and, to a
lesser extent, from shifts in existing business among payors. On a pro forma
basis, assuming the Company owned 100% of


                                      -22-
<PAGE>

Omnicare and Allied on November 1, 1996, the payor mix for the Eleven Month
Period would have been as follows: U.K. NHS and other U.K. governmental payors
30.4%; Medicare 27.8%; Medicaid 7.4%; and private payors (including managed care
payors) 34.4%.

     The Company believes that a substantial portion of its revenues derived
from private payors in the U.S. was subject to case management and managed care
and that this relationship will continue in the future. The Company maintains a
diversified offering of home services and products in an attempt to mitigate the
impact of potential reimbursement reductions for any individual product or
service.

     The Company's gross margins will be influenced by the revenue mix of its
product lines and by changes in reimbursement rates. The Company historically
has recognized higher gross margins from its specialized mail-order and medical
supplies pharmacy and respiratory therapy operations than from its nursing and
infusion therapy operations. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Company owned
100% of Omnicare and Allied on November 1, 1996, the gross profit margin for the
Eleven Month Period would have been 38.8% versus the actual 45.1% for the same
period. Subsequent acquisitions, when completed, will continue to impact the
relative mix of revenues and overall gross margin.

     At September 30, 1999 and 1998, the Company had $103,248,000 and
$105,784,000, respectively of intangible assets (primarily goodwill) on its
balance sheet. This represented 60.0% of total assets and 113.1% of total
stockholders' equity at September 30, 1999 and 58.9% of total assets and 103.8%
of total stockholders' equity at September 30, 1998. Amortization of intangibles
for the years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998 and the eleven months ended
September 30, 1997 was $3,459,000, $3,147,000 and $1,866,000, respectively.
Subsequent acquisitions, when completed, will continue to increase the amount of
intangible assets on the balance sheet and amortization of intangibles on the
statement of operations.

     The Company amortizes goodwill over a period of 40 years. The Company has
selected the forty-year amortization convention based on the likely period of
time over which related economic benefits will be realized. The Company believes
its estimated goodwill life is reasonable given, among other factors, the
continuing movement of patient care to non-institutional settings, expanding
demand due to demographic trends, the emphasis of the Company on establishing
coverage in each of its local and regional markets and the consistent practice
of other home health care companies. At each balance sheet date, or if a
significant adverse change occurs in the Company's business, management assesses
the carrying amount of enterprise goodwill. The Company measures impairment of
goodwill by comparing the future undiscounted cash flows (without interest) to
the carrying amount of goodwill. This evaluation is done at the reportable
business segment level (primarily by subsidiary). If the carrying amount of
goodwill exceeds the future cash flows, the excess carrying amount of goodwill
is written off. The factors considered by management in estimating future cash
flows include current operating results, the effects of any current or proposed
changes in third-party reimbursement or other governmental regulations, trends
and prospects of acquired businesses, as well as the effect of demand,
competition, market and other economic factors. If permanent impairment of
goodwill were to be recognized in future period it could have a material adverse
effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999 VS. YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1998.

     Revenues. Total revenues decreased by $581,000 or .4% to $154,728,000 for
the year ended September 30, 1999 from $155,309,000 for the year ended September
30, 1998. This decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the number
of patients serviced by the Company's U.S. Mail-Order Operations ($9,514,000)

Hi-Tech Operations ($1,666,000) and the incremental impact of the Balanced
Budget Act, which reduced revenue in the Company's U.S. Mail-Order Operations by
$611,000. In addition, the sale of TNI accounted for a decrease of $7,661,000.
These decreases were substantially offset by increases in the Company's U.K.
Operations, specifically, patient services ($18,934,000). The U.K. Operations
increased principally due to continued expansion, increased billing rates and an
increase in the number of patients serviced.

     Pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act, a 10% reduction in Medicare
reimbursement of diabetic testing strips and a 5% reduction in Medicare
reimbursement of respiratory drugs became effective January 1, 1998. These
reductions reduced revenue, increased cost of revenues as a percentage of
revenues and decreased gross profit for respiratory, medical equipment and
supplies sales effective with the reimbursement reduction (as discussed herein).

     In addition, pursuant to the Social Security Act, which gives HCFA
authority to alter certain reimbursement rates that are not inherently
reasonable, Medicare is proposing further inherent reasonableness reductions in
Medicare reimbursement rates. See "Business -- Government Regulation." These
reductions, if implemented, are expected to increase cost of revenues as a
percentage of revenues, decrease gross profit and decrease operating income for
respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales effective with the
reimbursement reduction. The amount of the impact will be dependent upon product
mix, the amount of product cost concessions that the Company is able to obtain
from its suppliers and the number of patients serviced whose primary insurance
coverage is Medicare.

     Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased by $2,218,000 to $99,410,000
for the year ended September 30, 1999 from $97,192,000 for the year ended
September 30, 1998. As a percentage of total revenues, cost of revenues for the
year ended September 30, 1999 increased to 64.2% in comparison to 62.6% for the
year ended September 30, 1998. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues
declined for patient services (68.1% for the year ended September 30, 1999
versus 69.4% for the year ended September 30, 1998), increased for respiratory,
medical equipment and supplies sales (57.7% for the year ended September 30,
1999 versus 55.0% for the year ended September 30, 1998) and increased for
infusion services (76.9% for the year ended September 30, 1999 versus 73.4% for
the year ended September 30, 1998). The decrease in patient services is
primarily due to increased billing rates. The increase in respiratory, medical
equipment and supplies sales is due to an increase in respiratory, medical
equipment and supplies sales in the U.S. Mail-Order Operations with higher
product costs. The increase in infusion services is due to an increase in
infusion therapies in the Hi-Tech Operations with higher product costs.

     Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by $5,966,000 or 11.5% to $57,946,000 for the
year ended September 30, 1999 from $51,980,000 for the year ended September 30,
1998. This increase was due to additional bad debt expense ($3,605,000)
principally as a result of fully reserving for DermaQuest's accounts receivables
(see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Accounts Receivable). In addition, there
were higher levels of overhead in the U.K. Operations ($3,585,000) due to its
continued expansion and the U.S. Mail-Order Operations incurred additional costs
for overhead related to sales and collection efforts in the U.S. operations
during the first half of fiscal 1999 ($1,942,000). Year ended September 30, 1999
included $1,392,000 of charges primarily related to the attempted acquisitions
of Sinclair and Gateway and additional legal reserves versus $554,000 of charges
included in fiscal 1998 primarily relating to costs incurred from its attempted
acquisitions of Healthcall and Apria. These increases were offset by an overhead
reduction program in the Mail-Order Operations ($2,642,000). The sale of TNI
accounted for an additional decreases of $1,871,000.

     Gain on Sale of Assets. For the year ended September 30, 1998, the Company
recorded a $2,511,000


                                      -24-
<PAGE>

gain on the TNI Sale.

     Operating (Loss) Income. The Company incurred an operating loss of
$2,628,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999 compared to operating income of
$8,648,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998. Excluding the $1,392,000 of
charges related to attempted acquisitions and additional legal reserves and
$3,605,000 of additional bad debt expenses in the year ended September 30, 1999,
the Company would have recorded operating income of $2,369,000.

     Interest Income. Interest income decreased by $408,000 to $227,000 for the
year ended September 30, 1999 from $635,000 for the year ended September 30,
1998. This decrease was attributable to lower interest income earned on a lower
level of funds invested.

     Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $841,000 to $5,445,000 for
the year ended September 30, 1999 from $6,286,000 for the year ended September
30, 1998. This favorable variance was primarily attributable to a lower level of
borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility combined with a reduced borrowing
rate.

     (Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes. (Benefit) provision for income taxes
as a percentage of income before income taxes was a benefit of 6.4% for the year
ended September 30, 1999 and a provision of 61.5% for the year ended September
30, 1998. The difference between the 6.4% effective tax rate for fiscal 1999 and
the statutory tax rate resulted from non-deductible expenses, primarily
amortization of intangible assets.

     Management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will
generate sufficient levels of taxable income in the future to realize the
$11,369,000 net deferred tax assets comprised of the tax benefit associated with
future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards,
prior to their expiration (primarily 13 years or more). This belief is based
upon, among other factors, changes in operations over the last few years,
management's focus on its business realignment activities and current business
strategies primarily with respect to its U.K. Operations. Failure to achieve
sufficient levels of taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the
net deferred tax assets. If this were to occur, management is committed to
implementing tax planning strategies, such as the sale of net appreciated assets
of the Company to the extent required (if any) to generate sufficient taxable
income prior to the expiration of these benefits. Should such strategies be
required, they could potentially result in the sale of a portion of the
Company's interest in the U.K. Operations and repatriation of such proceeds to
the U.S.

     Net Loss (Income). As a result of the foregoing, the Company incurred a net
loss of $7,346,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999 compared to net income
of $1,153,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998.

     YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1998 VS. ELEVEN MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997.

     Revenues. Total revenues increased by $61,865,000 or 66.2% to $155,309,000
for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $93,444,000 for the eleven months
ended September 30, 1997 with $13,153,000 accounting for the one additional
month's revenue in fiscal 1998. The remaining increase was primarily
attributable to the inclusion of eleven months of results for the year ended
September 30, 1998 versus three months in the comparable prior period for Allied
($42,322,000 in patient services) and Omnicare ($16,735,000 in respiratory,
medical equipment and supplies sales), as well as an increase in respiratory,
medical equipment and supplies sales due primarily to an increase in the number
of patients serviced in the Company's Mail-Order Operations ($5,395,000). These
increases were partly offset by a decrease in patient services revenue
attributable to the sale of Radamerica and the TNI Sale ($8,830,000), decreases
in respiratory, medical


                                      -25-
<PAGE>

equipment and supplies sales due to exiting certain product lines of DermaQuest
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997 ($2,719,000) as well as a
reduction in revenue in the Mail-Order Operations due to the Balanced Budget Act
($1,846,000) and lower infusion services revenue ($1,836,000) due to a decline
in number of patients serviced in the Hi-Tech Operations.

     Pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act, a 10% reduction in Medicare
reimbursement of diabetic testing strips and a 5% reduction in Medicare
reimbursement of respiratory drugs became effective January 1, 1998. These
reductions reduced revenue, increased cost of revenues as a percentage of
revenues and decreased gross profit for respiratory, medical equipment and
supplies sales effective with the reimbursement reduction (as discussed herein).

     Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased by $45,805,000 to $97,192,000
for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $51,387,000 for the eleven months
ended September 30, 1997 with $7,920,000 accounting for the one additional
month's cost of revenues in fiscal 1999. As a percentage of total revenues, cost
of revenues increased to 62.6% from 55.0% for the year ended September 30, 1998
and eleven months ended September 30, 1997, respectively. Cost of revenues as a
percentage of sales increased for respiratory, medical equipment and supplies
sales (55.0% for the year ended September 30, 1998 versus 48.9% for the eleven
months ended September 30, 1997) increased for patient services (69.4% for the
year ended September 30, 1998 versus 60.8% for the eleven months ended September
30, 1997) and increased for infusion services (73.4% for the year ended
September 30, 1998 versus 68.6% for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997).
The increase in cost of revenues of respiratory, medical equipment and supplies
sales as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 1998 are primarily attributable to
the impact of the Balanced Budget Act, which reduced revenues for diabetic
testing strips by 10% and respiratory drugs by 5% effective January 1, 1998 for
Medicare patients and the inclusion of a full year of Omnicare's results (versus
three months in the comparable period) which carry a higher cost of revenues
(70.7%) than the U.S. respiratory, medical equipment and supplies sales
operations (47.6%). The increase in patient services costs as a percentage of
revenues for fiscal 1998 are due to the inclusion of Allied's results for a full
year (versus three months in the comparable prior period) which carry a cost of
revenues of 69.4% and the sale of Radamerica in July 1997 which carried a lower
cost of service (26.4%). The increase in infusion services is a result of an
increase in therapies with higher product costs, as well as the effects of
reduced reimbursement rates for certain payors.

     Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by $9,049,000 or 21.1% to $51,980,000 for the
year ended September 30, 1998 from $42,931,000 for the eleven months ended
September 30, 1997 with $4,217,000 accounting for the one additional month's
expenses in fiscal 1998. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to
the inclusion of eleven months of results for fiscal 1998 versus three months in
the comparable prior period for the U.K. Operations ($12,952,000) and additional
costs incurred for overhead related to sales efforts, collections and additional
bad debt expense based upon a higher level of revenue. The increases were offset
by the sale of Radamerica in July 1997 ($2,922,000). In addition, the Company
recorded $554,000 of charges in fiscal 1998, primarily relating to costs
incurred from its attempted acquisitions of Healthcall and Apria and $7,023,000
of additional bad debt expense in the eleven months ended September 30, 1997
primarily related to the Company's DermaQuest product lines ($6,060,000) and
pulmonary rehabilitation center ($663,000).

     Gain on Sale of Assets. For the year ended September 30, 1998, the Company
recorded a $2,511,000 gain on the TNI Sale. For the eleven months ended
September 30, 1997, the Company recorded a $606,000 gain on the sale of
Radamerica.

     Special Charges. The Company recorded special charges of $16,677,000 during
the eleven months


                                      -26-
<PAGE>

ended September 30, 1997 related to the following items: (i) $1,841,000 non-cash
charge related to impairment of the investment in HMI as well as to record
estimated costs, fees and other expenses related to completion of the HMI Asset
Sale (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); (ii)
$12,079,000 non-cash charge for the write-off of goodwill and other intangible
assets related to exiting the wound care and orthotic product lines of the
Company's DermaQuest subsidiary; (iii) $1,622,000 non-cash charge for the
termination of the agreements to purchase the VIP Companies; (iv) $437,000
charge for closure of the Company's pulmonary rehabilitation center in Cherry
Hill, New Jersey; and (v) $698,000 of other charges.

     Equity in Loss of HMI, Net. Equity in loss of HMI was $18,076,000 for the
eleven months ended September 30, 1997. This represented 49% of HMI's loss for
the six months ended July 31, 1997 after adjustments to book the Company's
adjustment to historical goodwill amortization based on its fair value
adjustments ($132,000) and to eliminate intercompany interest ($720,000). The
49% interest in HMI was acquired in mid January 1997 and was included in the
results of operations effective February 1, 1997. Due to the Company's decision,
during the third quarter of fiscal 1997, to sell HMI and the recording of HMI's
obligations that the Company was required to fund, in connection with the sale
to Counsel Corporation ("Counsel"), no equity in loss of HMI has been recorded
subsequent to July 31, 1997.

     Interest Income. Interest income decreased by $1,636,000 to $635,000 for
the year ended September 30, 1998 from $2,271,000 for the eleven months ended
September 30, 1997 with $65,000 attributable to the one additional month's
interest income in fiscal 1998. The gross decrease was primarily attributable to
interest income earned (after elimination of intercompany interest) under a
credit agreement with HMI ($1,417,000) for the eleven months of 1997 and lower
interest income earned on a lower level of funds invested in fiscal 1998 as
compared to fiscal 1997.

     Interest Expense. Interest expense, increased by $1,223,000 to $6,286,000
for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $5,063,000 for the eleven months
ended September 30, 1997 with $585,000 accounting for the one additional month's
interest expense in fiscal 1998. The remaining increase was primarily
attributable to an increased level of borrowings under the Credit Facility in
the early part of fiscal 1998.

     Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. Provision (benefit) for income taxes
as a percentage of income before income taxes was a provision of 61.5% for the
year ended September 30, 1998 and a benefit of 13.4% for the eleven months ended
September 30, 1997. The difference between the 61.5% effective tax rate for
fiscal 1998 and the statutory tax rate resulted from non-deductible expenses,
primarily amortization of intangible assets.

     Net deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, were $8,674,000 at
September 30, 1998, an increase of $970,000 from net deferred tax assets of
$7,704,000 at September 30, 1997, primarily as a result of an increase in the
provision for doubtful accounts and federal net operating loss carryforwards. A
valuation allowance, was provided for deferred tax assets where it was not
likely that such assets would be realized through future income levels nor
future or prior tax liabilities. During fiscal 1998, the Company decreased the
valuation allowance by $114,000 primarily due to utilization of state net
operating loss carryforwards.

     Net Income (Loss). As a result of the foregoing, the Company produced net
income of $1,153,000 for the year ended September 30, 1998 compared to net loss
of $32,735,000 for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997.

     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     GENERAL.

     During the year ended September 30, 1999, the Company generated $3,258,000
from its operating activities. Cash flow from operating activities, combined
with the use of existing cash, funded a $1,500,000 payment to further reduce the
Company's Credit Facility and the following investing activities: $3,824,000 for
further expansion of the Company's U.K. Operations and $2,642,000 for capital
expenditures.

     During the year ended September 30, 1998, the Company received $22,241,000
from investing activities as follows: $32,328,000 received from the HMI Asset
Sale partly offset by $11,122,000 paid to complete the merger with HMI as well
as for fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger and to satisfy
existing HMI obligations which were retained by the Company; $6,029,000 received
from asset sales net of utilization of $3,346,000 for capital expenditures and
$1,648,000 for acquisitions and purchases of other intangibles. Funds generated
by investing activities along with net proceeds of $6,492,000 from the exercise
of the Company's warrants were used to reduce the Company's borrowings under the
Credit Facility by $29,100,000 and to fund operating activities.

     During the eleven months ended September 30, 1997, the Company utilized
$130,302,000 ($117,138,000 net of proceeds from asset sales and other
miscellaneous transactions) in investing activities as follows: $93,586,000 for
the acquisition of the U.K. Operations (Omnicare and Allied); $32,189,000 for
the purchase of 49% of HMI and HMI's senior debt and related advances;
$2,694,000 for capital expenditures and $1,833,000 for acquisitions payable. In
addition, the Company utilized $1,089,000 for operating activities.
Substantially all of the financing for the operating and investing activities
was provided by net borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility of
$73,864,000, the equity investment by HPII and Hyperion TW Fund L.P. (the
"Fund") aggregating $50,650,000 and proceeds of $12,100,000 from the sale of
Radamerica.

     The Company believes it has adequate capital resources to conduct its
operations for the next twelve months. On December 20, 1999, the Company's U.K.
subsidiaries completed a $124,500,000 refinancing which repaid the Company's
existing senior indebtedness of $55,755,000 and provided funds for additional
acquisitions in the U.K., subject to the terms of the refinancing agreements.
See "-Refinancing."

     ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

     The Company maintains a cash management program that focuses on the
reimbursement function, as growth in accounts receivable has been the main
operating use of cash historically. At September 30, 1999 and 1998, $30,814,000
(17.9%) and $32,223,000 (17.9%), respectively, of the Company's total assets
consisted of accounts receivable substantially from third-party payors. Such
payors generally required substantial documentation in order to process claims.
The collection time for accounts receivable is typically the longest for
services that relate to new patients or additional services requiring medical
review for existing patients.

     Accounts receivable decreased by $1,409,000 from September 30, 1998 to
September 30, 1999 primarily due to the decision to fully reserve for the
remaining DermaQuest accounts receivable ($2,205,000) (see below).

     During fiscal 1996 and the eleven months ended September 30, 1997, the
Company experienced a significant increase in accounts receivable at its
DermaQuest operation whose main product lines include wound care and orthotic
products. Medicare, to whom substantially all DermaQuest claims are initially
submitted for payment, has subjected these claims to an extensive review process
and, in many cases, has required DermaQuest to pursue payment through the fair
hearing process of the Medicare intermediary. This has created significant
delays in payments, in many cases extending beyond twelve months, leading to the
significant buildup in accounts receivable and corresponding negative impact on
cash flow. The Company conducted an extensive review of the DermaQuest
receivables in connection with the decision to discontinue these product lines
in the continental U.S.


                                      -28-
<PAGE>

and, as a result, established additional reserves of $6,060,000 based on the
potential inability to secure required documentation in a timely manner for
reimbursement as a result of no longer being in these business lines. In
establishing the net realizable value of its accounts receivable for DermaQuest,
the Company had relied on its historical and anticipated payment experience.
During fiscal 1999, the decision to fully reserve for the remaining DermaQuest
accounts receivable was made in light of the Company's payment history over the
first three quarters of fiscal 1999. During fiscal 1998 it appeared that
collections of $1,013,000 on the remaining receivables during the fiscal year
justified the carrying value at September 30, 1998 ($2,253,467). However,
payments slowed dramatically during fiscal 1999. It only became apparent that
this slow down was permanent in nature (and not a temporary issue) during the
third quarter of fiscal 1999, as the total collected on the receivables year to
date was $168,000, with only $37,000 collected during the third quarter. The
decision was made to reserve the remaining receivables based on this evidence.

     Management's goal is to maintain accounts receivable levels equal to or
less than industry averages, which will tend to mitigate the risk of recurrence
of negative cash flows from operations by reducing the required investment in
accounts receivable and thereby increasing cash flows from operations. Days
sales outstanding ("DSOs") is a measure of the average number of days taken by
the Company to collect its accounts receivable, calculated from the date
services are rendered. For the years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998 and the
Eleven Month Period, the Company's average DSOs were 73, 72 and 73,
respectively.

     CREDIT FACILITY.

     The Credit Facility contained affirmative and negative financial covenants
customarily found in agreements of this kind, including the maintenance of
certain financial ratios, such as interest coverage, debt to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and minimum EBITDA. As
of September 30, 1999, the Company was in technical default of the Credit
Facility due to non-compliance with certain financial covenants (debt to EBITDA,
interest coverage and minimum EBITDA). On December 20, 1999, the Company
refinanced and repaid the Credit Facility with funds obtained in the
Refinancing.

     During the year ended September 30, 1999, the Company amended the Credit
Facility to allow for further expansion of its U.K. Operations.

     REFINANCING.

     General. As described more fully below, on December 20, 1999, the Company's
UK subsidiaries, Transworld Holdings (UK) Limited ("UK Parent") and its
subsidiary Transworld Healthcare (UK) Limited ("TW UK") obtained an aggregate of
$124,500,000 in new financing consisting of a $73,000,000 senior secured term
and revolving credit facility (the "Senior Credit Facility"), $16,000,000 in
mezzanine indebtedness (the "Mezzanine Loan") and $36,000,000 principal amount
of senior subordinated notes (the "Notes") (each of the foregoing are sometimes
referred to collectively herein as the "Refinancing"). $55,755,000 of the net
proceeds of the Refinancing were used to repay the Company's existing Credit
Facility, $11,000,000 was provided to the Company for general corporate
purposes, with the balance to be used for acquisitions and working capital in
the U.K., subject to the terms of the documents governing the Refinancing. In
connection with the repayment of the Company's existing Credit Facility, the
Company will record a non-cash, pre-tax, extraordinary charge of approximately
$1,200,000 in its first quarter of fiscal 2000 relating to the write-off of the
deferred financing costs associated with the Credit Facility.

     Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility consists of a (i)
$44,800,000 term loan A, maturing December 17, 2005, (ii) $20,000,000
acquisition term loan B, maturing December 17, 2006 which may be drawn upon
during the first three years following closing, and (iii) $8,000,000 revolving
facility, maturing


                                      -29-
<PAGE>

December 17, 2005. Repayment of the loans commences on July 30, 2000 and
continues until final maturity. The loans bear interest at rates equal to LIBOR
plus 2% to 2.75% per annum. As of January 3, 2000, TW UK had outstanding
borrowings of $50,700,000 under the Senior Credit Facility. As of January 3,
2000, borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bore interest at a rate of
7.7241% to 8.4741%.

     Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Credit Facility prohibits or
restricts, among other things, the incurrence of liens, the incurrence of
indebtedness, certain fundamental corporate changes, dividends (including
distributions to the Company), the making of specified investments and certain
transactions with affiliates. In addition, the Senior Credit Facility contains
affirmative and negative financial covenants customarily found in agreements of
this kind, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, such as senior
interest coverage, debt to EBITDA, fixed charge coverage and minimum net worth.

     The loans under the Senior Credit Facility are collateralized by, among
other things, a lien on substantially all of TW UK's and its subsidiaries'
assets, a pledge of TW UK's ownership interest in its subsidiaries and
guaranties by TW UK's subsidiaries.

     Mezzanine Loan. The Mezzanine Loan is a term loan maturing December 17,
2007 and bears interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 7% per annum, where LIBOR plus
3.5% will be payable in cash, with the remaining interest being added to the
principal amount of the loan. The Mezzanine Loan contains other terms and
conditions substantially similar to those contained in the Senior Credit
Facility. The lenders of the Mezzanine Loan also received warrants to purchase
2% of the fully diluted ordinary shares of TW UK. As of January 3, 2000,
borrowings under the Mezzanine Loan bore interest at a rate of 12.7204%.

     Senior Subordinated Notes and Warrants. Notes. The Notes consist of
$36,000,000 principal amount of senior subordinated notes of UK Parent purchased
by several institutional investors and certain members of management
(collectively, the "Investors"), plus equity warrants issued by TW UK
concurrently with the sale of the Notes (the "Warrants") exercisable for
ordinary shares of TW UK ("Warrant Shares") representing in the aggregate 27% of
the fully diluted ordinary shares of TW UK. See "Certain Relationships and
Related Transactions--Transactions with Directors and Executive Officers."

     The Notes bear interest at the rate of 9.375% per annum payable quarterly
in cash subject to restrictions contained in the Senior Credit Facility
requiring UK Parent to pay interest in-kind through the issuance of additional
notes ("PIK Notes") for the first 18 months, with payment of interest in cash
thereafter subject to a fixed charge coverage test (provided that whenever
interest cannot be paid in cash, additional PIK Notes shall be issued as payment
in-kind of such interest). The Notes mature nine years from issuance.

     UK Parent will not have the right to redeem the Notes and the PIK Notes
except as provided in, and in accordance with the documents governing the
issuance of the Notes and Warrants (herein the "Securities Purchase Documents").


                                      -30-
<PAGE>

The redemption price of the Notes and the PIK Notes will equal the principal
amount of the Notes and the PIK Notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest on
each.

     The Investors have the right, at their option, to require UK Parent to
redeem all or any portion of the Notes and the PIK Notes under certain
circumstances and in accordance with the terms of the Securities Purchase
Documents. The redemption price of the Notes and the PIK Notes shall be equal to
the principal amount of the Notes and the PIK Notes, plus all accrued and unpaid
interest on each.

     UK Parent's redemption obligation of the Notes and the PIK Notes is
guaranteed by TW UK, which guarantee is subordinated to the existing senior
indebtedness of TW UK to the same extent as the Notes and the PIK Notes are
subordinated to senior indebtedness of UK Parent. If UK Parent fails to perform
in full its obligations following exercise of the Investors put of Notes and TW
UK fails to perform its obligations as a guarantor of such obligations, the
Investors shall have the right to among other things exercise directly (through
the voting trust described below) the drag-along rights described without the
requirement that the Board of Directors of TW UK first take any action.

     Warrants. The Warrants may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time,
unless previously purchased or cancelled upon a redemption of the Notes, at the
option of the holders prior to the time of maturity of the Notes for Warrant
Shares representing approximately 27% of TW UK's fully diluted ordinary share
capital, subject to antidilution adjustment as contained in the Securities
Purchase Documents.

     The exercise price of the Warrants shall equal the entire principal amount
of the Notes (other than PIK Notes and excluding any accrued unpaid interest)
for all Warrants in the aggregate and must be paid through the tender of Notes
(other than PIK Notes) to TW UK, whereby TW UK shall issue to the Investors the
appropriate number of Warrant Shares and pay to the Investors in cash an amount
equal to the principal amount of the PIK Notes and all accrued unpaid interest
on the Notes and the PIK Notes.

     The Warrants will automatically be exercised for Warrant Shares in the
event that TW UK consummates


                                      -31-
<PAGE>

a public offering of shares valuing the Investors ordinary shares of TW UK
issuable upon a voluntary exercise of the Warrants at or above 2.5x the initial
investment.

     The Investors will have the right, at their option, to require UK Parent to
purchase all or any portion of the Warrants or the Warrant Shares under certain
circumstances and in accordance with the terms of the Securities Purchase
Documents. The purchase price of the Warrants shall be equal to the difference,
if a positive number, between (i) the fair market value of the Warrant Shares
which the Investors have the right to acquire upon exercise of such Warrants and
(ii) the exercise price of such Warrants. The purchase price of the Warrant
Shares shall be equal to the fair market value of such Warrant Shares.

     UK Parent's purchase obligation of the Warrants is guaranteed by TW UK,
which guarantee is subordinated to existing senior indebtedness of TW UK. If UK
Parent fails to perform in full its obligations following exercise of the
Investors put of Warrants and TW UK fails to perform its obligations as a
guarantor of such obligations, the Investors shall have the right to among other
things exercise directly through the voting trust the drag-along rights without
the requirement that the Board of Directors of TW UK first take any action.

     If UK Parent fails to perform in full its obligations following exercise of
the Investors put of Warrant Shares, the Investors shall have the right to among
other things exercise directly through the voting trust the drag-along rights
without the requirement that the Board of Directors of TW UK first take any
action.

     Following an initial public offering and upon exchange of the Warrants the
Investors shall be entitled to two demand and unlimited piggyback registrations
with respect to the Warrant Shares. The Warrant Shares shall be listed for
trading on any securities exchange on which the ordinary shares of TW UK are
listed for trading.

     All ordinary shares of UK Parent owned by the Company and all
ordinary shares of TW UK owned by UK Parent are held in a voting trust for
the benefit of the holders of ordinary shares of TW UK and the holders of the
Warrants, with the trustee of the trust being obligated to vote the shares held
in trust as follows: (i) to elect to the Board of Directors of TW UK individuals
designated in accordance with the Securities Purchase Documents and on any other
matter, pursuant to instructions approved by the required majority of the Board
of Directors of TW UK as contemplated by the Securities Purchase Documents; and
(ii) following the breach by UK Parent and TW UK of their obligations to honor
an Investor put of Notes, an Investor put of Warrants or an Investor put of
Warrant Shares, the Investors have the right to exercise drag-along rights
directly without any action of the Board of Directors of TW UK on a transaction
to which such drag-along rights apply pursuant to instructions from the
Investors. G. Richard Green, a Director of the Company, is the trustee of the
voting trust. The voting trust includes provisions to the effect that under
certain circumstances the shares held in trust shall thereafter be voted on all
matters, including the election of directors, pursuant to instructions from a
majority of those members of the Board of Directors of TW UK who are not
affiliated or associated with the Company, HPII, or any of their successors.

     The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effect of the
provisions of the voting trust and other aspects of the Refinancing on its
ability to continue to consolidate the operations of TW UK in its fiscal 2000
financial statements.

     The Articles of Association of TW UK and the Securities Purchase Documents
provide that neither UK Parent nor TW UK will enter into any transaction with or
make contributions to the Company or UK Parent (except as required by the terms
of the Notes, the Warrants or the Warrant Shares) in the form of dividends,
fees, re-charges, loans, guarantees or any other benefit, in any form, unless
they have been previously agreed upon by all shareholders.

     The Securities Purchase Documents also provide that the Investors will have
the benefit of customary shareholder rights for a transaction of this type
including, without limitation: (i) pre-emptive rights with respect to new
securities; (ii) rights of first refusal with respect to proposed transfers of
ordinary shares of TW UK; (iii) drag-along rights; (iv) tag-along rights; and
(v) the exercise of voting rights by the holders of the Warrants as therein
described including the right to elect one director to the TW UK Board of
Directors. The Securities Purchase Documents also include limitations on TW UK's
ability to do the following, among others, without the consent of the Investors:
(i) issue additional equity securities of TW UK; (ii) pay dividends or make
other restricted payments, except as required by the terms of the Notes, the
Warrants or the Warrant Shares; (iii) sell, lease or otherwise dispose of assets
exceeding specified values; (iv) enter into any transactions with affiliates;
(v) amend the Memorandum or Articles of Association; or (vi) merge or
consolidate with another entity.

     TNI SALE.

     On July 15, 1998, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of its
domestic home nursing


                                      -33-
<PAGE>

subsidiary for $5,300,000 which was paid in cash at closing. Subject to the
terms of the agreement, $300,000 of such amount was placed into escrow for a
period of one year following the closing to secure TNI's obligations under the
agreement. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce borrowings under the
Credit Facility ($4,100,000) and to satisfy transaction costs and liabilities
that were retained by the Company.

     ACQUISITION OF HMI/SALE TO COUNSEL.

     On October 1, 1997, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
completed the merger with HMI. Under the terms of a merger agreement, HMI
stockholders received $.30 in cash for each outstanding share of HMI common
stock not already owned by the Company. Concurrently with the closing of the
merger, the Company completed the HMI Asset Sale to Counsel for $40,000,000 at
which time substantially all of the businesses and operations of HMI were sold
to Counsel. Of the $40,000,000 proceeds, $30,000,000 was received in cash with
$7,500,000 to be paid to the Company as HMI's accounts receivable, existing at
date of sale, were collected, with the remaining $2,500,000 held in escrow for
post-closing adjustments. As of September 30, 1999 an aggregate (including
interest earned on such escrow funds) of $37,648,000 was received (including the
$7,500,000 escrow that was held for accounts receivable collection) of which,
$25,000,000 was used to reduce the senior secured debt owed by the Company under
the Credit Facility, $2,800,000 was used to complete the merger and the
remainder was used for costs, fees and other expenses to complete the HMI Asset
Sale as well as to satisfy liabilities not assumed by Counsel. The remaining
$2,500,000 escrow was fully utilized for post-closing adjustments.

     Pursuant to the HMI Asset Sale, Counsel did not assume any liabilities of
HMI other than certain liabilities arising after the closing under assumed
contracts and certain employee-related liabilities. Liabilities not assumed by
Counsel, as well as certain wind-down and contingent obligations of HMI
(including litigation - see "Legal Proceedings" with respect to certain legal
proceedings concerning HMI), were recorded in the Company's consolidated
financial statements in accordance with purchase accounting.

     YEAR 2000.

     General. The Year 2000 computer issue refers to potential conditions in
computer programs whereby a two-digit field rather than a four-digit field is
used to define the applicable year. Unless corrected, some computer programs may
not appropriately function as of January 1, 2000 because these programs will
read the "00" in the year 2000 as January 1, 1900. If uncorrected, the problem
could have resulted in computer system failures or equipment and medical device
malfunctions (affecting patient diagnosis and treatment) thereby disrupting the
Company's business operations and subjecting the Company to potentially
significant legal liabilities.

     During the early part of 1998, the Company formed a task force consisting
of members of senior management, in-house legal counsel, representatives from
each of the Company's operating subsidiaries (in both the U.K. and the U.S.),
and other Company personnel. The task force also consulted with the Company's
insurance carrier and risk management advisors. The task force developed an
action plan to address the potential problems of the Year 2000, which considered
the following critical phases: (i) the Company's state of readiness; (ii) risks
of the Company's Year 2000 issues; (iii) costs to address Year 2000 compliance;
and (iv) the Company's contingency plans.

     Company's State of Readiness. The information technology ("IT") and IT
infrastructure portions of the Company's Year 2000 project, addressed the
inventory, assessment, necessary corrective actions, testing and implementation
of external vendor products, mission critical third-party software and
internally developed


                                      -34-
<PAGE>

software. In that regard, the Company believes it has identified (in both the
U.K. and the U.S.), the various software applications that may have been
potentially impacted. The Company's assessment of all IT related components has
been completed and any remediation of external vendor products, mission critical
third-party software and internally developed software has been completed. The
Company has also implemented and tested all remediation.

     With respect to the non-IT portion of the Company's Year 2000 project, the
Company had undertaken a program to inventory, assess and correct or replace
(where necessary) impacted mission critical as well as non-mission critical
vendor and supplier products (including but not limited to drugs, medical
supplies and specialty mail-order pharmaceutical products), medical equipment,
telephone systems, postage machines and other related equipment with Year 2000
risk. These types of supplies and equipment play a vital role in the day to day
operations of the Company. The Company had implemented (in both the U.K. and the
U.S.), a program of contacting vendors and suppliers, analyzing and acting upon
information provided to replace or otherwise amend any devices or equipment that
pose a Year 2000 impact. The Company had prioritized its non-IT efforts by
allocating resources to equipment and medical devices that would have a direct
impact on patient safety and health with a goal of minimizing and/or eliminating
the associated risks. The Company recognizes, to a certain degree, that it has
relied upon information that was being provided by equipment and medical device
manufacturers regarding the Year 2000 status of their respective products. While
the Company has attempted to evaluate information provided by its present
vendors and suppliers, there can be no assurance that in all instances accurate
information was provided. The Company's assessment of potentially non-IT
affected components has been completed and any required corrective actions have
been completed. The Company has also implemented and tested all remediation.

     Lastly, the Company relies heavily upon third party payors, including to a
large extent governmental payors such as the NHS in the U.K. and Medicare and
Medicaid in the U.S. for accurate and timely reimbursement of claims, often
through the use of electronic data interfaces. Although much has been published
publicly stating that the government was working to solve its own Year 2000
issues in a timely manner, the Company has received no assurance that their
systems and interfaces were converted timely. Failure of any of the Company's
third party payors, especially governmental payors, to solve their Year 2000
issues could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated
financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.

     Risks of the Company's Year 2000 Issues. Failure from any of the
aforementioned IT and/or non-IT equipment and components, including the support
from third parties, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's
operations (in both the U.K. and the U.S.) resulting in the potential inability
to provide health care services to its patients. This inability could result in
the loss of revenue (which at the present time is unable to be quantified) and
give rise to litigation. Failure of the third party payor's systems also could
have a material adverse affect on the Company's consolidated financial
position, cash flows or results of operations.

     Costs to Address Year 2000 Compliance. As of January 3, 2000, costs
incurred for all efforts of the Company's Year 2000 action plan amounted to
$245,000 and have not been material to the Company. These costs have been
expensed as incurred and have been funded by operating cash flows. Based upon
the best estimate by the Company's management and the Year 2000 task force, the
Company does not expect any additional costs associated with the Company's Year
2000 action plan. If additional costs are incurred they will also be expensed as
incurred and be funded by operating cash flow.

     The Company's Contingency Plans. Each operating subsidiary (both in the
U.K. and the U.S.) has been asked to develop a contingency plan to restore the
material functions of each of its systems or activities in the case of a Year
2000 failure. To date, there have been no material malfunctions of the Company's
systems or

                                      -35-
<PAGE>

activities due to Year 2000 issues.

     However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated events still will not
occur or that the Company was able to identify all Year 2000 issues before
problems arise. In addition, the Company has no assurance that third party
payors and vendors have or had the ability to identify and solve all or
substantially all their Year 2000 issues. Therefore, there can be no assurance
that the Year 2000 issue still will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

     LITIGATION.

     See "Legal Proceedings" with respect to certain legal proceedings
concerning the Company and HMI.

     IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued
SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."
SFAS No. 133 addresses the accounting for derivative instruments including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging
activities. As the Company currently does not enter into transactions involving
derivative instruments, the Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS
No. 133 will have a material effect on the Company's financial statements. As
issued, SFAS No. 133 is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 1999, with earlier application encouraged. In June
1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS No. 133," which
amended the effective date of SFAS No. 133 for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2000.

     INFLATION

     Inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company's operations to
date.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

     The Company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency
exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices
evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's consolidated
financial results. The Company's primary exposure relates to non-U.S. dollar
denominated sales in the U.K. where the principal currency is Pounds Sterling.
Currently, the Company does not hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposures.

     INTEREST RATE RISK

     The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate
primarily to the Company's cash equivalents, Senior Credit Facility and
Mezzanine Loan. The Company's cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term
investments purchased with initial maturities of 90 days or less. The Company is
subject to fluctuating interest rates that may impact, adversely or otherwise,
its consolidated results of operations or cash flows for its variable rate
Senior Credit Facility, Mezzanine Loan and cash equivalents. The Company has
agreed as part of the Refinancing to hedge 66 2/3% of its floating rate debt
within 90 days of the completion of the Refinancing.

     BOARD COMMITTEES

     The Company's Board of Directors has an Audit Committee and a Compensation
Committee but does not have a nominating committee. The members of each
committee are appointed by the Board of Directors.

     AUDIT COMMITTEE.

     The Audit Committee recommends to the Board of Directors the auditing firm
to be selected each year as independent auditors of the Company's consolidated
financial statements and to perform services related to the completion of such
audit. The Audit Committee also has responsibility for: (i) reviewing the scope
and results of the audit; (ii) reviewing the Company's financial condition and
results of operations with management; (iii) considering the adequacy of the
internal accounting and control procedures of the Company; and (iv) reviewing
any non-audit services and special engagements to be performed by the

Committee.

     COMPENSATION COMMITTEE.

     The Compensation Committee reviews and approves overall policy with respect

employees and employment agreements and compensation for executive officers. The
Compensation Committee consists of Messrs. Ranieri and Shay.

     COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

     The Commission has comprehensive rules relating to the reporting of
securities transactions by directors, officers and shareholders who beneficially
own more than 10% of the Company's Common Stock (collectively, the "Reporting
Persons"). These rules are complex and difficult to interpret. Based solely on a
review of Section 16 reports received by the Company from Reporting Persons, the
Company believes that no Reporting Person has failed to file a Section 16 report
on a timely basis during the most recent fiscal year other than G. Richard
Green, a director of the Company, who filed one Form 4 late with respect to one
transaction which occurred in December 1998 and Jeffery S. Peris, a director of
the Company, who did not timely file his Form 3 and one Form 4 with respect to
one transaction which occurred in December 1998.

     COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

     See "Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant" with respect to
compensation of non-employee directors.

     EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS; TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL
ARRANGEMENTS

     In January 1997, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr.
Aitken, which expired in January 1998. The agreement renewed for a one-year term
in January 1998 and will renew for one-year terms absent notice of non-renewal
from either party. This agreement provided for a base salary of $250,000,
increasing to $300,000 when the agreement was renewed in January 1998. The
agreement contains, among other things, customary confidentiality and
termination provisions and provides that in the event of the termination of the
executive following a "change of control" of the Company (as defined therein),
Mr. Aitken will be entitled to receive a cash payment of up to 2.9 times his
average annual base salary during the preceding five years.

     In connection with Ms. Eames' employment with the Company, the Company has
agreed that if Ms. Eames' employment is terminated (other than for cause) she
will be entitled to one year's salary (currently $240,000 per year) plus
relocation expenses to California.

     COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors consists of Messrs.
Ranieri and Shay. Messrs. Ranieri and Shay among others, control the general
partner of HPII and the Fund, each of which are principal shareholders of the
Company, which principal shareholders engaged in certain transactions with the
Company described under Item 13 of this Report under the heading "Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions -- Transactions with Principal
Shareholders." See also "Directors and Officers of the Registrant -- Board
Committees."

     STOCK OPTION PLANS

     1992 STOCK OPTION PLAN.

     In July 1992, the Company's Board of Directors and shareholders approved
the Company's 1992 Stock Option


                                      -42-
<PAGE>

Plan (the "Option Plan"). The Option Plan provides for the grant of options to
key employees, officers, directors and non-employee independent contractors of
the Company. The Option Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors. The number of shares of Common Stock available for
issuance thereunder is 3,175,361 shares as of September 30, 1999. Beginning in
fiscal 1999 and ending in July 2002, the number of shares available for issuance
under the Option Plan, as amended, increases by one percent of the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the first day of each fiscal year. As
of January 3, 2000, the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance
thereunder is 3,350,872 shares.

     Options granted under the Option Plan may be either incentive stock options
("Incentive Options"), which are intended to meet the requirements of Section
422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or options that do not
qualify as Incentive Options ("Non-Qualified Options"). Under the Option Plan,
the Compensation Committee may grant (i) Incentive Options at an exercise price
per share which is not less than the fair market value of a share of Common
Stock on the date on which such Incentive Options are granted (and not less than
110% of the fair market value in the case of any optionee who beneficially owns
more than 10% of the total combined voting power of the Company) and (ii)
Non-Qualified Options at an exercise price per share which is determined by the
Compensation Committee (and which may be less than the fair market value of a
share of Common Stock on the date on which such Non-Qualified Options are
granted). The Option Plan further provides that the maximum period in which
options may be exercised will be determined by the Compensation Committee,
except that Incentive Options may not be exercised after the expiration of ten
years from the date the Incentive Option was initially granted (and five years
in the case of any optionee who beneficially owns more than 10% of the total
combined voting power of the Company). Under the Option Plan, if an optionee's
employment is terminated, generally the unexercised Incentive Options must be
exercised within three months after termination. However, if the termination is
due to the optionee's death or permanent disability, the option must be
exercised within one year of the termination of employment. If the optionee's
employment is terminated for cause by the Company, or if the optionee
voluntarily terminates his employment, his options will expire as of the
termination date. Any option granted under the Option Plan will be
nontransferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and
generally may be exercised upon payment of the option price in cash or by
delivery of shares of Common Stock with a fair market value equal to the option
price.

     Shares delivered under the Option Plan will be available from authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock or from shares of Common Stock reacquired by
the Company. Shares of Common Stock that are subject to options under the Option
Plan which have terminated or expired unexercised will return to the pool of
shares available for issuance under the Option Plan.

     On December 15, 1998, the Company granted options to purchase shares of
Common Stock at $4.31 per share under the Option Plan as follows: (i) 5,000 to
Mr. Peris and (ii) 5,000 to Mr. Green.

     1997 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR PLAN.

     In May 1997, the Company adopted the Company's 1997 Option Plan for
Non-Employee Directors (the "Director Plan") pursuant to which 100,000 shares of
Common Stock of the Company were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of
options granted to non-employee directors of the Company. The purpose of the
Director Plan is to encourage ownership of Common Stock by non-employee
directors of the Company whose continued services are considered essential to
the Company's future progress and to provide them with a further incentive to
remain as directors of the Company. The Director Plan is administered by the
Board of Directors. Directors of the Company who are not employees of the
Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company are eligible to
participate in the Director Plan. The term of the Director Plan is ten years
from the date of approval by the


                                      -43-
<PAGE>

stockholders; however, options outstanding on the expiration of the term shall
continue to have full force and effect in accordance with the provisions of the
instruments evidencing such options. The Board of Directors may suspend,
terminate, revise or amend the Director Plan, subject to certain limitations.

     Under the Director Plan, the Board of Directors may from time to time at
its discretion determine which of the eligible directors should receive options,
the number of shares subject to such options and the dates on which such options
are to be granted. Each such option is immediately exercisable for a period of
ten years from the date of grant generally, but may not be exercised more than
90 days after the date an optionee ceases to serve as a director of the Company.
Options granted under the Director Plan are not transferable by the optionee
other than by will, laws of descent and distribution, or as required by law.

     Common Stock may be purchased from the Company upon the exercise of an
option by payment in cash or cash equivalent, through the delivery of shares of
Common Stock having a fair market value equal to the cash exercise price of the
option or any combination of the above, subject to the discretion of the Board
of Directors.

     INDEMNIFICATION

     As permitted under the Business Corporation Law of the State of New York,
the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a director of
the Company will not be personally liable to the Company or its shareholders for
monetary damages for breach of a fiduciary duty owed to the Company or its
shareholders. By its terms and in accordance with the law of the State of New
York, however, this provision does not eliminate or otherwise limit the
liability of a director of the Company for any breach of duty based upon (i) an
act or omission (A) resulting from acts committed in bad faith or involving
intentional misconduct or involving a knowing violation of law or (B) from which
the director personally derived a financial benefit to which he was not legally
entitled, or (ii) an improper declaration of dividends or purchases of the
Company's securities.

     The Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws provide
that the Company shall indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest
extent permitted by New York state law. The Company also has entered into
indemnification agreements with each of its directors and officers.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS.

     TRANSACTIONS WITH PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS

     Under a unit purchase agreement dated November 20, 1995, as amended (the
"HPII Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which HPII acquired its initial equity
interest in the Company, until July 31, 2001, HPII has the right to designate to
the Board of Directors of the Company the greater of three directors or 40% of
the number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors. Messrs.
Ranieri and Shay are the HPII designees presently serving on the Board of
Directors.

     The HPII Purchase Agreement also provides that for a period of five (5)
years commencing on May 30, 1996, all shares of Common Stock held by HPII will
be voted by HPII on any matter submitted to the shareholders in the same
proportion as the votes cast by the other holders of Common Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, HPII retains its right to vote its shares of
Common Stock in any manner it chooses with respect to the following specified
matters: (i) the election to the Board of Directors of HPII's designees; (ii)
amendments to the Company's By-Laws or Certificate of Incorporation; (iii)
mergers and the sale, lease or exchange of the Company's assets; (iv) the
authorization or issuance of Company securities; (v) a reclassification of
securities or reorganization of the Company; (vi) the liquidation or dissolution
of the Company; and (vii) any affiliated party transaction. The HPII Purchase
Agreement provides that the requirement that HPII votes its shares in proportion
with all other shareholders shall terminate in the event that the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock owned by Mr. Palladino and certain former
officers of the Company shall be less than 415,000 shares or on the date when
any person or group unaffiliated with HPII becomes the beneficial owner of 25%
or more of the then-outstanding shares of the Company's capital stock.

     Mr. Palladino in his individual capacity, has agreed to take all steps
necessary, including voting his shares for the election of HPII's designees to
the Board of Directors, and to utilize his best efforts, to secure the election
by the Company's shareholders of HPII's designees to the Board of Directors. The
Company has also agreed to such provisions (other than the voting of shares).

     The HPII Purchase Agreement further provides that commencing July 31, 1996,
all actions to be taken by the Board of Directors will require the affirmative
vote of a majority of the directors present at a duly constituted meeting (which
is the status currently), except that it shall require the affirmative vote of
66-2/3% of the entire Board of Directors to authorize any action taken with
respect to a proposed acquisition, whether by purchase of stock or assets, of
another company and any action to increase above seven (7) the number of
directors constituting the entire Board of Directors.

     In November and December, 1996, HPII purchased from various unrelated third
parties certain trade receivables due from HMI (the "HMI Receivables") at
various discounts. The aggregate face amount of these receivables was
approximately $18,300,000. On March 26, 1997, HPII and the Company entered into
the a stock purchase agreement (the "AP Stock Purchase Agreement"), as amended,
pursuant to which HPII and the Company agreed, subject to the conditions stated
in the AP Stock Purchase Agreement, that the Company would issue shares of its
Common Stock (the "HPII Shares") equal to the Agreed Value (as defined herein)
divided by the Agreed Price (as defined herein) in consideration of the
assignment by HPII to the Company of the HMI Receivables. For the purposes of
the AP Stock Purchase Agreement, (A) "Agreed Value" means the sum of the
following amounts: (i) $4,000,000, plus (ii) 10% of the first $20,000,000 of Net
Recovery (as defined herein), plus (iii) 30% of the next $10,000,000 of Net
Recovery, plus (iv) 50% of any amount of Net Recovery in excess of $30,000,000;
(B) "Net Recovery" means the amount realized or recovered by the Company on or
after September 1, 1997 on or in respect of (i) any indebtedness owed by HMI
and/or its subsidiaries to the Company;


                                      -46-

(ii) any investment made by the Company in HMI and/or its subsidiaries; and
(iii) the HMI Receivables (including, without limitation, by reason of any
claims against third parties relating to the purchase of any of the foregoing),
net of (x) the merger consideration paid by the Company to acquire HMI and (y)
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with such realization or recovery. Net Recovery does not include any
tax benefit to the Company from the net loss on its equity and debt investments
in HMI; and (C) "Agreed Price" means the lesser of $7-5/8 and the closing price
of the Common Stock of the Company on the last trading day prior to the closing
of the AP Stock Purchase Agreement. This transaction was approved at a special
meeting of the shareholders held on March 17, 1998 and subsequently during April
1998, HPII contributed the HMI Receivables to the Company in exchange for
1,159,288 shares of the Company's Common Stock with a value per share of $6.00.
The aggregate value of the HPII Shares was $6,956,000. The shares of Common
Stock issued pursuant to this agreement are also covered by a registration
agreement entered into with HPII in connection with the HPII Purchase Agreement.
The Company will bear all expenses, other than underwriting discounts and
commissions, in connection with any such registration.

     On April 13, 1998, a shareholder derivative action was filed against
certain officers and directors of the Company, alleging that consummation of the
AP Stock Purchase Agreement was against the best interests of the Company's
shareholders (see "Legal Proceedings").

     During the summer of 1999 the Company's U.K. Operations were in the process
of acquiring three nursing and carer agencies when the Company was informed by
its senior lenders that they would not consent to these pending acquisitions.
The Company then requested that HPII complete these acquisitions on the
Company's behalf. Affiliates of HPII (the "HP Affiliates") completed these
acquisitions in August and September, 1999. Effective December 17, 1999, the
Company acquired all three businesses from the HPII Affiliates for the aggregate
amount of $2,992,000 representing HPII's acquisition cost plus, interest at a
rate of 12% per annum and reimbursement of transaction costs. Messrs. Ranieri
and Shay did not participate in any action by the Board of Directors with
respect to these acquisitions.

     TRANSACTIONS WITH DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

     On December 14, 1992, a former principal shareholder and a former director
and officer of the Company, each sold 6,666 shares of Common Stock at a price of
$5.00 per share to Mr. Palladino. On such date, the Company loaned Mr. Palladino
the funds necessary to consummate such purchases. On April 8, 1998, the Company
forgave the $66,666 loan provided that Mr. Palladino remain employed by the
Company as follows: one-third as of April 9, 1998, one-third on January 1, 1999
and one-third on September 30, 1999.

     Mr. Palladino among others, (collectively, the "Restricted Transferees")
has entered into a stock restriction agreement (the "Restriction Agreement"),
pursuant to which he agreed to limit the transferability of his shares of Common
Stock, as well as other "Common Equivalents" to the extent described therein.
Unless otherwise consented to in writing by HPII, none of the Restricted
Transferees may transfer any of his shares of Common Stock or other Common
Equivalents owned by him if, at the time of such transfer or after giving effect
thereto, the Restricted Transferee's "Shareholder Percentage" would be less than
the lesser of 0.75 and the "HPII Percentage." For purposes of the Restriction
Agreement, the term "Shareholder Percentage" means a fraction, the denominator
of which is the number of Common Equivalents that such shareholder and his
related persons owned or had the right to acquire on the date of the HPII
Purchase Agreement, and the numerator of which is the numerical amount of the
denominator less the number of Common Equivalents transferred by such Restricted


                                      -47-
<PAGE>

Transferee; and the term "HPII Percentage" means a fraction, the denominator of
which is the number of Common Equivalents purchased by HPII or which HPII has
the right to purchase pursuant to the HPII Purchase Agreement, and the numerator
of which is the numerical amount of the denominator less the number of Common
Equivalents transferred by HPII. The effect of the Restriction Agreement, in
general, is to limit a Restricted Transferee's ability to sell his shares of
Common Stock to the extent that his shareholdings would be less than 75% of his
current holdings or, if less, the HPII Percentage.

     In connection with the Refinancing, Mr. Aitken (the Company's Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer), Ms. Eames (the Company's President), Mr. Palladino
(the Company's Chief Financial Officer), Mr. Green (a director of the Company)
and certain other directors and officers of TW UK and its subsidiaries
co-invested, alongside the other Investors, $800,000, $100,000, $25,000 and
$1,100,000, respectively, in senior subordinated notes and also received
warrants exercisable into approximately 2% in the aggregate of the fully diluted
ordinary shares of TW UK. The terms of the senior subordinated notes and
warrants acquired by the foregoing persons are identical to the senior
subordinated notes and warrants acquired by the other Investors. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."

     Certain directors of the Company have been granted options to purchase
shares of Common Stock under the Company's stock option plans. See "Executive
Compensation-Stock Option Plans."

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Transworld Healthcare, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index on page F-i present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Transworld Healthcare, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at
September 30, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for the years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, and the eleven months
ended September 30, 1997 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the accompanying index on page F-i present fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

     The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on the
     accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
     accounting standards.

     FISCAL YEAR CHANGE:

     The Company changed its fiscal year end from October 31 to September 30
     effective for fiscal 1997.

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
     and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
     transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
     Investments in entities that are 20% to 50% owned are accounted for under
     the equity method of accounting.

     REVENUE RECOGNITION:

     Patient services and infusion and respiratory therapy revenues are
     recognized when services are performed and are recorded net of estimated
     contractual adjustments based on agreements with third-party payors, where
     applicable. Revenues from home medical equipment (including respiratory
     equipment) are recognized over the period the equipment is rented
     (typically on a month-to-month basis) and approximated $5,884, $6,711 and
     $5,402 in fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):

     Revenues from the sale of pharmaceuticals and supplies are recognized when
     products are shipped and are recorded at amounts expected to be paid by
     third-party payors.

     The Company receives a majority of its revenue from third-party insurance
     companies, the National Health Services (the "NHS") and other U.K.
     governmental payors, Medicare and Medicaid. The amount paid by third-party
     payors is dependent upon the benefits included in the patient's policy or
     as allowable amounts set by third-party payors. Certain revenues are
     subject to review by third-party payors, and adjustments, if any, are
     recorded when determined. For the years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998
     and the eleven months ended September 30, 1997, 36%, 30% and 13%,
     respectively of the Companies net revenues were attributable to the NHS and
     other U.K. governmental payors programs. For the years ended September 30,
     1999 and 1998 and the eleven months ended September 30, 1997, the Company's
     net revenues attributable to the Medicare and Medicaid programs were
     approximately 23%, 33% and 53%, respectively, of the Company's total
     revenues.

     INCOME TAXES:

     The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in
     accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.
     109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under this method, deferred income tax
     assets and liabilities reflect tax carryforwards and the net effects of
     temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
     liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes, as determined
     under currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are recorded if
     future realization is more likely than not.

     Deferred taxes are provided primarily for bad debts, Federal and state net
     operating losses, acquisition liabilities, depreciation and amortization of
     intangibles, which are reported for Federal income tax purposes in
     different periods than for financial reporting purposes. Valuation
     allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred taxes to the
     amounts expected to be realized.

     EARNINGS PER SHARE:

     Effective October 1, 1997, the Company adopted the provisions SFAS No. 128,
     "Earnings per Share" ("EPS"). SFAS No. 128 replaced primary EPS with basic
     EPS and fully diluted EPS with diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed using the
     weighted average number of common shares outstanding, after giving effect
     to issuable shares per agreements. Diluted EPS is computed using the
     weighted average number of common shares outstanding, after giving effect
     to contingently issuable shares per agreements and dilutive stock options
     and warrants using the treasury stock method. At September 30, 1999, 1998
     and 1997, the Company had outstanding stock options and warrants to
     purchase 3,683, 3,965 and 3,809 shares, respectively of common stock
     ranging in price from $4.31 to $12.45, $4.38 to $12.45 and $7.88 to $12.45
     per share, respectively, that were not included in the computation of
     diluted EPS because the exercise price was greater than the average market
     price of the common shares. In addition, for the year ended September 30,
     1999 and for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997, the Company had an
     incremental weighted average of 128 and 699 shares, respectively, of stock
     options and warrants which were not included in the diluted computation as
     the effect of such inclusion would have been anti-dilutive due to a net
     loss position.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):

     The weighted average number of common shares outstanding have been restated
     for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 to reflect the provisions of
     SFAS No. 128. This restatement had no effect on EPS.

     The weighted average number of shares used in the basic and diluted
     earnings per share computations for the years ended September 30, 1999 and
     1998 and eleven months ended September 30, 1997 are as follows:

     IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS:

     Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
     circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If
     the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying
     amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the
     fair value (discounted future cash flows) and carrying value of the asset.
     Impairment loss on assets to be sold, if any, is based on the estimated
     proceeds to be received, less estimated costs to sell.

     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:

     The accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statement of Operations of
     the Company have been prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles
     Board's Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ("APB No.
     25"). Under APB No. 25, generally, no compensation expense is recognized in
     the accompanying consolidated financial statements in connection with the
     awarding of stock option grants to employees provided that, as of the
     grant date, all terms associated with the award are fixed and the quoted
     market price of the Company's stock is equal to or less than the amount an
     employee must pay to acquire the stock as defined. The Company only issues
     fixed term stock option grants at the quoted market price on the date of
     the grant.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):

     Effective November 1, 1996, the Company adopted the disclosures required by
     SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," including pro
     forma operating results had the Company prepared it consolidated financial
     statements in accordance with the fair value based method of accounting for
     stock-based compensation, and they have been included in Note 11.

     COMPREHENSIVE INCOME:

     Effective October 1, 1998, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
     130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income." This statement established standards
     for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in
     a full set of general purpose financial statements. Components of
     comprehensive income include net income and all other non-owner changes in
     equity, such as the change in the cumulative translation adjustment,
     unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale and minimum
     pension liability. Currency translation is the only item of other
     comprehensive income impacting the Company. The following table displays
     comprehensive (loss) income for the years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998

     SEGMENT INFORMATION:

     Effective October 1, 1998, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
     131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."
     SFAS No. 131 supercedes SFAS No. 14, "Financial Reporting for Segments of a
     Business Enterprise," replacing the "industry segment" approach with the
     "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal
     organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and
     assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.
     SFAS No. 131 also requires disclosures about products and services,
     geographic areas and major customers. The adoption of SFAS No. 131 had no
     impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the periods
     presented.

     CONTINGENCIES:

     Contingent liabilities, including any material claims, disputes, or
     unsettled matters with third-party

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):

     payors, are disclosed where management believes they are material to the
     Company's financial position.

     CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:

     Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments
     purchased with initial maturities of 90 days or less.

     INVENTORIES:

     Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined using a first-in,
     first-out method) or market. Inventories, which consists primarily of
     finished goods, include pharmaceuticals, ancillary medical supplies and
     certain medical equipment.

     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT:

     Property and equipment, including revenue producing equipment, is carried
     at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Revenue
     producing equipment in the U.K. consists of oxygen cylinders and oxygen
     concentrators. Depreciation for these oxygen cylinders and oxygen
     concentrators is provided on the straight-line method over their estimated
     useful lives of twenty and seven years, respectively. Revenue producing
     equipment in the U.S. consists of home medical equipment (e.g., respiratory
     equipment, beds and wheelchairs). Depreciation for this home medical
     equipment is provided primarily on the straight-line method over their
     estimated useful lives of three to seven years. Buildings are being
     depreciated over their useful lives of twenty-five to fifty years and
     leasehold improvements are amortized over the related lease terms or
     estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter. Routine maintenance and
     repairs that do not extend the useful life of property and equipment are
     charged against results of operations as incurred. When assets are retired
     or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are
     reversed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in
     the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.

     INTANGIBLE ASSETS:

     Intangible assets, consisting principally of goodwill and covenants
     not-to-compete, are carried at cost, net of accumulated amortization. All
     goodwill is enterprise goodwill and is amortized on a straight-line basis
     primarily over forty years. Amortization of other intangible assets
     (primarily covenants not-to-compete) is provided on a straight-line basis
     over three to fifteen years.

     The Company selected the forty-year amortization period based on the likely
     period of time over which the related economical benefit will be realized.
     The Company believes that the estimated goodwill life is reasonable given
     the continuing movement of patient care to non-institutional settings,
     expanding demand due to demographic trends, the emphasis of the Company on
     establishing significant coverage in its local and regional markets, the
     consistent practice with other alternate site health care

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):

     companies and other factors.

     At each balance sheet date, or if a significant adverse change occurs in
     the Company's business, management assesses the carrying amount of
     enterprise goodwill. The Company measures impairment of goodwill by
     comparing the future undiscounted cash flows (without interest) to the
     carrying amount of goodwill. This evaluation is done at the reportable
     business segment level (primarily by subsidiary). If the carrying amount of
     goodwill exceeds the future cash flows, the excess carrying amount of
     goodwill is written off. Factors considered by management in estimating
     future cash flows include current operating results, the effects of any
     current or proposed changes in third-party reimbursement or other
     governmental regulations, trends and prospects of acquired businesses, as
     well as the effect of demand, competition, market and other economic
     factors.

     DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS:

     Costs incurred in obtaining long-term financing are amortized over the
     terms of the long-term financing agreements using the interest method. At
     September 30, 1999 and September 30, 1998, other assets included $1,357 and
     $2,425, respectively of deferred financing costs associated with the Credit
     Facility (as defined and described in Note 6), net of accumulated
     amortization of $3,242 and $2,156, respectively. In addition, at September
     30, 1999, other assets included $655 of deferred financing costs associated
     with the Refinancing (as defined and described in Note 15). Amortization of
     deferred financing costs is included in interest expense in the
     accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION:

     Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is
     other than the U.S. dollar are translated to U.S. dollars using the
     exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations
     are translated using weighted average exchange rates during the period.
     Adjustments resulting from the translation process are included as a
     separate component of stockholders' equity.

     CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK:

     Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
     concentrations of credit risk are cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
     The Company places its cash equivalents with high credit quality financial
     institutions. The Company believes no significant concentration of credit
     risk exists with respect to these cash equivalents.

     The Company grants credit without collateral to its patients, who are
     primarily insured under third-party agreements. The Company maintains an
     allowance for doubtful accounts based on the expected collectibility of
     accounts receivable. Accounts receivable at September 30, 1999 is comprised
     of amounts due from the NHS and other U.K. governmental payors, Medicare
     and Medicaid (40.3%, 10.9% and 3.8%, respectively) and various other
     third-party payors and self-pay patients (none of which comprise greater
     than 10% of the balance). At September 30, 1998, 22.8%, 27.8% and 4.1% of

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):

     accounts receivable was due from the NHS and other U.K. governmental
     payors, Medicare and Medicaid, respectively with the balance due from
     various other third-party payors and self-pay patients (none of which
     comprise greater than 10% of the balance).

     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

     Cash, accounts receivable, intangible assets, other assets, accounts
     payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value
     due to the short-term maturity of those instruments. The estimated fair
     value of the Company's borrowing under the Credit Facility approximates the
     carrying value at September 30, 1999 and 1998 due to interest rates which
     fluctuate with market rates.

     IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS:

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued
     SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
     Activities." SFAS No. 133 addresses the accounting for derivative
     instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
     contracts and for hedging activities. As the Company currently does not
     enter into transactions involving derivative instruments, the Company does
     not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 133 will have a material effect
     on the Company's financial statements. As issued, SFAS No. 133 is effective
     for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999,
     with earlier application encouraged. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No.
     137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities -
     Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS No. 133," which amended the
     effective date of SFAS No. 133 for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years
     beginning after June 15, 2000.

     USE OF MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES:

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
     accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
     assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
     disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
     financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
     during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
     estimates. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for
     allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventories, accrued
     expenses, depreciation and amortization.

     RECLASSIFICATIONS:

     Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the
     current year presentation.

3.   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DISPOSALS:

     COMBINATIONS:

     During the eleven months ended September 30, 1997, the Company acquired the
     entities described below, which were accounted for by the purchase method
     of accounting. The results of operations of the acquired companies are
     included in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations from
     their respective dates of acquisition.

     OMNICARE

     At the end of June 1997, Transworld Healthcare (UK) Limited ("TW UK"), a
     wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Omnicare pursuant to a
     recommended cash offer to acquire all the issued and to be issued shares of
     Omnicare not already owned by TW UK for approximately $29,028, which was
     paid during July 1997. In addition, 1,765 shares had previously been
     purchased from Hyperion Partners II L.P. ("HPII"), a related party, on May
     30, 1997 for $2,857. Accordingly, the Company has included the results of
     operations, financial position and cash flows of Omnicare in its
     consolidated results effective July 1, 1997.

     Omnicare provides respiratory equipment and services to patients at home in
     the U.K. under the terms of contracts and licenses with various NHS
     agencies. The Company also dispenses and supplies a range of medical and
     surgical products, principally ostomy products, to patients at home, as
     well as providing those patients with advisory and other services through
     its network of regional care centers.

     The total cost of the acquisition was allocated on the basis of the fair
     value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and incurred.
     Accordingly, assets and liabilities were assigned values of approximately
     $9,669 and $6,016, respectively, with the excess of $28,232 allocated to
     goodwill which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over forty
     years.

     ALLIED

     Effective June 23, 1997, TW UK acquired all of the issued and outstanding
     capital stock of Allied, a privately held provider of nursing and other
     care-giving services to home care patients throughout the U.K., for
     approximately $60,042. Accordingly, the Company has included the results of
     operations, financial position and cash flows of Allied in its consolidated
     results effective June 23, 1997.

     The total cost of the acquisition was allocated on the basis of the fair
     value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and incurred.
     Accordingly, assets and liabilities were assigned values of approximately
     $10,062 and $7,667, respectively, with the excess allocated to covenants
     not-to-compete of $734 and goodwill of $56,913. The covenants and goodwill
     are being amortized on a straight-line basis over three and forty years,
     respectively.

     DISPOSITIONS:

     RADAMERICA

     Effective July 31, 1997, the Company sold Radamerica, Inc. ("Radamerica")
     for $13,304 and received $12,100 in fiscal 1997 with the remaining $1,204
     subsequently received on November 10, 1997. As part of the consideration
     for the acquisition of Radamerica, the Company had issued 250 shares of its
     common stock valued at $5,000 based on a $20 per share market price
     guarantee to the selling shareholders of Radamerica. Per the agreement, the
     incremental per share amount due under the market price guarantee of $10.60
     was paid to the selling shareholders through issuance of 321 shares of
     common stock of the Company ($8.25 per share fair market value) during
     August 1997, resulting in a reclassification of $3 from additional paid-in
     capital to common stock.

     Results for Radamerica through July 31, 1997 have been included in the
     overall Company's results for the eleven months ended September 30, 1997.
     Accordingly, for purposes of earnings per share computations, the weighted
     average actual shares issued of the Company's common stock under the per
     share market price guarantee have been included in both basic and diluted
     earnings per share computations.

3.   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DISPOSALS (CONTINUED):

     The Company recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of Radamerica of
     approximately $606.

     TNI

     Effective July 12, 1998, the Company sold substantially all of the assets
     of Transworld Home HealthCare-Nursing Division, Inc. ("TNI") for $5,300,
     which was paid in cash at closing with $300 of such amount placed into
     escrow and released one year following the closing (the "TNI Sale").

     Results for TNI through July 12, 1998 have been included in the overall
     Company's results for the year ended September 30, 1998. The Company
     recognized a pre-tax gain on the TNI Sale of approximately $2,511.

     TERMINATION OF PENDING ACQUISITIONS:

     VIP COMPANIES

     On June 30, 1994, the Company entered into stock purchase agreements, as
     amended, to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of VIP
     Health Services, Inc. and Kwik Care, Ltd. (collectively, the "VIP
     Companies"). On July 23, 1997, the Company and the VIP Companies terminated
     the stock purchase agreements principally due to delays in completing the
     transaction.

     As a result of the termination of the agreements, the Company has taken a
     pre-tax non-cash charge of approximately $1,622 during its third quarter of
     fiscal 1997 relating to the termination of the transaction, a contract
     deposit and other acquisition-related expenses. This charge has been
     recorded in special charges (Note 8).

     HMI

     During fiscal 1997, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding
     stock of Health Management, Inc. ("HMI") and disposed of all of HMI's
     assets and businesses in a series of transactions. HMI is a Buffalo Grove,
     Illinois based provider of integrated pharmacy management services to
     patients with chronic medical conditions and to health care professionals,
     drug manufacturers and third-party payors involved in such patients' care.

     On November 13, 1996, the Company acquired HMI's senior secured
     indebtedness under the credit agreement between HMI and its senior lenders
     for $21,263 directly from such lenders. In mid January 1997, the Company
     acquired 8,964 newly issued shares of HMI common stock, representing
     approximately 49% of HMI's outstanding common stock for $1 per share or
     $8,964.

     The $9,714 investment in HMI was recorded as of January 31, 1997 and
     represents 49% of HMI's equity in net tangible assets and after fair value
     adjustments, $15,835 was preliminarily allocated to goodwill, which was
     being amortized on a straight-line basis over thirty years. The acquisition
     of

(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)


3.   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DISPOSALS (CONTINUED):

     49% of the outstanding shares of HMI common stock was accounted for by the
     Company under the equity method of accounting (effective as of January 31,
     1997). During the eleven months ended September 30, 1997, the Company
     recorded $18,076 of equity in loss of HMI which represented 49% of HMI's
     loss for the six months ended July 31, 1997, after adjustments to book the
     Company's adjustment to historical goodwill amortization based on its fair
     value adjustments ($132) and to eliminate intercompany interest ($720). Due
     to the Company's decision, during the third quarter of fiscal 1997, to sell
     HMI and the recording of HMI's obligations that the Company was required to
     fund, in connection with the sale to Counsel Corporation ("Counsel"), no
     equity in loss of HMI has been booked subsequent to July 31, 1997.

     On August 14, 1997, the Company entered into an agreement (the "Asset Sale
     Agreement") with Counsel, an unrelated party, relating to the sale of
     substantially all of the businesses and operations of HMI (the "Asset
     Sale") for approximately $40,000. The Asset Sale Agreement required the
     Company to acquire the remaining 51% of HMI prior to the sale to Counsel.

     As a result of the Asset Sale Agreement, the Company recorded an impairment
     charge of $1,841 for its investment in HMI at July 31, 1997. The carrying
     amount of the investment was adjusted for costs and obligations to sell HMI
     (including contractually obligated costs to be incurred) compared with the
     gross proceeds on the Asset Sale. Such adjustments included the cost to
     purchase the remaining 51% of HMI ($2,800), transaction costs (principally
     legal expenses) associated with the sale to Counsel ($1,000), purchase
     price adjustments (primarily working capital adjustments) ($4,470), the
     acquisition of the HMI Receivables (as defined and described in Note 7)
     from HPII ($6,956) and the retained liabilities of HMI ($10,774). These
     retained liabilities consisted principally of legal expenses and settlement
     costs associated with the shareholder and class action litigation,
     settlement of accounts payable, severance and employee related costs and
     lease termination costs.

     On October 1, 1997, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
     purchased the remaining 51% of the outstanding shares of HMI's common stock
     for $.30 per common share. Concurrently, the Company completed the Asset
     Sale to Counsel for $40,000. Of the $40,000 proceeds, $30,000 was received
     in cash with $7,500 being paid to the Company as HMI's accounts receivable,
     existing at date of sale, were collected, with the remaining $2,500 held in
     escrow for post-closing adjustments. As of September 30, 1999 an aggregate
     (including interest earned on such escrow funds) of $37,648 was received
     (including the $7,500 that was held for accounts receivable collection) of
     which, $25,000 was used to reduce the senior secured debt owed by the
     Company under the Credit Facility, $2,800 was used to acquire the remaining
     51% of HMI and the remainder was used for costs, fees and other expenses to
     complete the HMI Asset Sale as well as to satisfy liabilities not assumed
     by Counsel. The remaining $2,500 escrow was fully utilized for post-closing
     adjustments.

     The Company also amended its Credit Facility on October 1, 1997 to
     accommodate the acquisition of the remaining 51% of HMI and the concurrent
     Asset Sale to Counsel.

     Pursuant to the Asset Sale, Counsel did not assume any liabilities of HMI
     other than certain liabilities arising after the closing under assumed
     contracts and certain employee-related liabilities.

6.   DEBT (CONTINUED):

     the TNI Sale. On July 15, 1998, the Company reduced outstanding borrowings
     under the Credit Facility by $4,100 with proceeds from the TNI Sale.

     The Company amended the Credit Facility during the eleven months ended
     September 30, 1997 to accommodate the sale of the Shares (as defined in
     Note 7) and issuance of the HPII Shares (as defined in Note 7), the
     purchase of HMI's senior debt and 100% of HMI's common stock, certain
     working capital advances to HMI, the sale of substantially all of HMI's
     assets, the purchases of Omnicare and Allied and to amend certain financial
     covenants.

     The Credit Facility provides that subject to the terms thereof, the Company
     may make borrowings either at the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit
     Facility), plus 1% or the Eurodollar Rate (ranging from 5.375% to 5.4375%
     at September 30, 1999 and from 5.375% to 5.5625% at September 30, 1998),
     plus 2%. In addition, 0.5% is charged on the unused portion of the Credit
     Facility. As of September 30, 1999, the Company had $55,755 outstanding
     under the Credit Facility and the unused portion under the Credit Facility
     was $23,645. Additional borrowings require the approval of the required
     banks under the Credit Facility.

     The loans under the Credit Facility are collateralized by, among other
     things, a lien on substantially all of the Company's and its domestic
     subsidiaries' assets, a pledge of the Company's ownership interest in its
     subsidiaries and guaranties by the Company's domestic subsidiaries. The
     loans mature on July 31, 2001 with quarterly reductions in availability
     which commenced July 31, 1998 and continue through maturity. The
     availability at September 30, 1999 was $79,400.

     Subject to certain exceptions, the Credit Facility prohibits or restricts,
     among other things, the incurrence of liens, the incurrence of
     indebtedness, certain fundamental corporate changes, dividends, the making
     of specified investments and certain transactions with affiliates. In
     addition, the Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative financial
     covenants customarily found in agreements of this kind including the
     maintenance of certain financial ratios, such as interest coverage, debt to
     earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA")
     and minimum EBITDA. At September 30, 1999, the Company was in technical
     default of the Credit Facility due to non-compliance with certain financial
     covenants (i.e.: interest coverage, debt to EBITDA and minimum EBITDA). On
     December 20, 1999, the Company refinanced and repaid the Credit Facility
     with funds obtained in the Refinancing (Note 15).

7.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:

     On April 21, 1997, HPII purchased 899 shares of the Company's common stock
     at $11.125 per share and Hyperion TW Fund L.P. ( the "Fund") purchased
     4,116 shares of the Company's common stock at $9.875 per share for an
     aggregate purchase price of $50,650 (collectively, the "Shares").
     Collectively, HPII and the Fund are the Company's principal shareholders.

     In November and December, 1996, HPII purchased from various unrelated third
     parties certain receivables (the "HMI Receivables") due from HMI at various
     discounts. The aggregate face amount of these receivables was approximately
     $18,300. On March 26, 1997, the Company entered into a stock purchase
     agreement, with HPII, as amended, to purchase these receivables from HPII
     for a number of shares of common stock (the "HPII Shares") as determined by
     a formula geared to the net cash proceeds ultimately realized by the
     Company upon sale of the HMI assets. The value per share of the HPII Shares
     was determined by the market value of the Company's common stock on the
     date of issuance. This transaction was approved at a special meeting of the
     shareholders held on March 17, 1998 and subsequently during April 1998,
     HPII was issued 1,159 shares of the Company's common stock with a value per
     share of $6.00. The aggregate value of the HPII Shares was $6,956 (Note
     12).

7.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (CONTINUED):

     No gain or loss was directly recorded as a result of this transaction, as
     it was considered a cost of acquiring HMI (Note 3).

8.   BUSINESS REALIGNMENT:

     The Company took a number of significant steps during the year ended
     September 30, 1998 and the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 to
     realign its business as a focused regional home health care provider and
     specialty pharmacy and medical supply distributor in the U.S. and an
     integrated national provider of health care products and services in the
     U.K. These steps included: (i) selling non-core assets (i.e.: Radamerica
     and TNI); (ii) exiting businesses that were deemed not to have the
     potential to earn an adequate return on capital over the long term (such as
     wound care and orthotic product lines in the continental U.S., as well as
     the Company's pulmonary rehabilitation center in Cherry Hill, New Jersey);
     (iii) completing the Asset Sale; and (iv) terminating the agreements to
     purchase the VIP Companies. In addition, during fiscal 1998, the Company
     attempted the acquisitions of Healthcall Group plc ("Healthcall") and Apria
     Healthcare Group, Inc. ("Apria"). During fiscal 1999, the Company attempted
     the acquisitions of Sinclair Montrose Healthcare PLC ("Sinclair") and
     Gateway HomeCare, Inc. ("Gateway").

     For the eleven months ended September 30, 1997, the Company incurred
     pre-tax special charges in relation to these actions of $16,677, comprised
     of the following items: (i) $1,841 related to the impairment of the
     investment in HMI upon the sale to Counsel (Note 3); (ii) $12,079 for the
     write-off of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the decisions
     to exit substantially all of DermaQuest, Inc.'s ("DermaQuest") product
     lines in the continental U.S. (principally wound care and orthotics); (iii)
     $1,622 for the termination of the agreements to purchase the VIP Companies
     (Note 3); (iv) $437 principally for the write-off of goodwill and other
     intangible assets and estimated costs associated with the closure of the
     Company's pulmonary rehabilitation center in Cherry Hill, New Jersey (Note
     3); and (v) $698 of other charges. In addition, the Company recorded
     $18,076 of equity in loss of HMI and a gain of $606 on the sale of
     Radamerica in the eleven months ended September 30, 1997 (Note 3).

     In addition to these special charges, during the eleven months ended
     September 30, 1997, the Company recognized additional bad debt expenses of
     $7,023 principally related to its DermaQuest product lines ($6,060) and
     pulmonary rehabilitation center ($663), which is reflected in selling,
     general and administrative expenses. The Company established $3,986 of
     these reserves as a result of the decision to discontinue these product
     lines, and the associated impact on the ability to secure required
     documentation in a timely manner for reimbursement. The additional $2,737
     was reserved as the Company became aware of deterioration in the collection
     of DermaQuest receivables.

     For the year ended September 30, 1998, the Company recorded in selling,
     general and administrative expenses $554 of charges primarily related to
     costs incurred from its attempted acquisitions of Healthcall and Apria and
     recorded a gain of $2,511 on the TNI Sale (Note 3).

8.   BUSINESS REALIGNMENT (CONTINUED):

     For the year ended September 30, 1999, the Company recorded in selling,
     general and administrative expenses $1,392 of charges primarily related to
     costs incurred from its attempted acquisitions of Sinclair and Gateway and
     legal reserves and recognized additional bad debt expenses of $3,605
     principally as a result of fully reserving for DermaQuest's accounts
     receivable, as the Company became aware of additional deterioration in
     their collectiblity, based upon the Company's payment history over the
     first nine months of fiscal 1999.

9.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION:

     On April 8, 1998, the Company forgave a $67 note receivable due from an
     officer of the Company. The debt was forgiven over a two year period
     (one-third in fiscal 1998 and two-thirds in fiscal 1999). The compensation
     expense recorded on the forgiveness of debt was $45 and $22 in fiscal 1999
     and 1998, respectively.

10.  INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED):

     For 1999, 1998 and 1997, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects
     of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
     liabilities recorded for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
     for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company's deferred

</TABLE>

     The valuation allowance at September 30, 1999 relates to deferred tax
     assets established for certain state net operating loss carryforwards and
     deferred tax assets which are not expected to be realized based on
     historical or future earnings. The increase in the valuation allowance of
     $3 is primarily due to the net increase in state net operating loss
     carryforwards.

     Management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will
     generate sufficient levels of taxable income in the future to realize the
     $11,369 net deferred tax assets comprised of the tax benefit associated
     with future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss
     carryforwards, prior to their expiration (primarily 13 years or more). This
     belief is based upon, among other factors,

10.  INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED):

     changes in operations over the last few years, management's focus on its
     business realignment activities and current business strategies primarily
     with respect to its U.K. operations. Failure to achieve sufficient levels
     of taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred
     tax assets. If this were to occur, management is committed to implementing
     tax planning strategies, such as the sale of net appreciated assets of the
     Company to the extent required (if any) to generate sufficient taxable
     income prior to the expiration of these benefits. Should such strategies be
     required, they could potentially result in the sale of a portion of the
     Company's interest in the U.K. operations and repatriation of such proceeds
     to the U.S.

     As of September 30, 1999, the Company has state net operating loss
     carryforwards of $23,058 which, if unused, will expire in the years 2000
     through 2014, and has a Federal net operating loss carryforward of $16,037
     which if unused, will expire in the years 2013 through 2019. The Company
     has a capital loss carryforward of $2,528 which if unused, will expire in
     2002.

     statutory tax rates and consolidated provisions for income taxes are as

     On May 28, 1997, the Company adopted a stock option plan for non-employee
     directors (the "Directors Plan") which gives non-employee directors options

     The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
     "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." In accordance with SFAS No. 123,
     the Company continues to apply APB No. 25 and related Interpretations to
     account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method for
     its stock option plans and, accordingly, does not recognize compensation
     expense. If the Company had elected to recognize compensation expense based
     on the fair value of the options at grant date as prescribed by SFAS No.
     123, net (loss) income and net (loss) earnings per share would have been

</TABLE>

      The compensation cost as generated by the Black-Scholes option-pricing
      model, may not be indicative of the future benefit, if any, that may be
      received by the option holder.

      Effective January 15, 1997, the Company granted Mr. Aitken (the Company's
      Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer) options under the
      Option Plan to purchase 500 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
      $11.375 per share. Such options were repriced on August 13, 1997 to an
      exercise price of $7.25 per share which represented the fair value at that
      date.

      In connection with the initial public offering, the Company issued
      warrants to purchase 1,600 common shares. The warrants were exercisable at
      $6.294 (reduced from $6.50 in accordance with an anti-dilution clause in
      the agreement) per share and expired on December 8, 1997. During 1994, the
      Company repurchased 500 of the public warrants, 250 for $1.25 per warrant
      and 250 at $1.3125 per warrant in open market purchases. During the eleven
      months ended September 30, 1997, 7 warrants were exercised for $44 and
      prior to their expiration an additional 960 warrants were exercised for an
      aggregate of $6,041 in fiscal 1998.

12.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

      EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS:

      The Company has two employment agreements with certain of its executive
      officers which provide for minimum aggregate annual compensation of $325
      in fiscal 2000. One expires January 2000 and amounts to $85 of the fiscal
      2000 minimum aggregate compensation. The agreement contains customary
      termination and non-compete provisions and a change in control provision
      that would entitle the individual up to 2.9 times of his salary then in
      effect, plus any unpaid bonus and unreimbursed expense upon a change of
      control of the Company (as defined) or significant change in the
      responsibilities of such person. The other agreement entitles the employee
      to a severance payment equal to one year's salary (currently $240 per
      year) plus relocation expenses.

      In fiscal 1996, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with its
      former Chairman, which expires on April 30, 2000, which provides for
      annual compensation of $150 less the amount by which certain amounts paid
      to or on his behalf exceed $60.

12.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED):

      The Company has a performance based bonus plan for the Company's executive
      officers and certain other employees. Under this plan, amounts may be
      granted up to 50% of their base salaries at the sole discretion of the
      Compensation Committee. Bonuses may be paid in whole or in part, in cash
      or shares of common stock.

      OPERATING LEASES:

      The Company has entered into various operating lease agreements for office
      space and equipment. Certain of these leases provide for renewal options
      with extension dates in fiscal 2008 and 2013.

      Future minimum rental commitments required under operating leases that

      CONTINGENCIES:

      On February 4, 1997, Patient Care Systems, Inc. ("PCS") filed a lawsuit
      against DermaQuest and the Company in the Court of Common Pleas of Chester
      County, Pennsylvania, for breach of contract, conversion, unjust
      enrichment and misrepresentation. Subsequently, PCS withdrew all claims
      except for its breach of contract claim. On April 22, 1997, DermaQuest
      filed a counterclaim against PCS for breach of contract. The action
      related to a contract initially entered into between DermaQuest and PCS to
      market alternating pressure mattresses. A jury trial in this matter began
      on June 28, 1999. On July 2, 1999, the jury reached their verdict finding
      in favor of PCS on its breach of contract claim and finding in favor of
      DermaQuest on its breach of contract counterclaim. Post verdict, the
      parties settled the litigation whereby DermaQuest and the Company agreed
      to pay a total of $180, as a full, final and complete resolution of the
      dispute.

      On August 20, 1999, TNI was named a defendant in a suit brought by Teresa
      Crutcher, in New Jersey state court, as administrator of the estate of
      Aaron Pernell, who was an infant and Teresa Crutcher's son. The claim is
      for wrongful death of Aaron Pernell alleged to have been caused by the
      negligent manner in which a TNI home care nurse placed him in an infant
      car seat. TNI has answered the

      complaint. The claim is insured. As the case is in a preliminary stage,
      the Company is not able to estimate any potential exposure and has not
      recorded any amounts in its financial statements. It is possible that
      irrespective of insurance coverage, the ultimate outcome of this action
      could be materially unfavorable to the Company's consolidated financial
      condition, cash flows, or results of operations. However, the Company
      intends to defend the proceedings vigorously and believes that the
      ultimate liability, if any, will be within the policy limits of its
      insurance, and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
      consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.

      On April 13, 1998, a shareholder of the Company, purporting to sue
      derivatively on behalf of the Company, commenced a derivative suit in the
      Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, entitled Kevin
      Mak, derivatively and on behalf of Transworld Healthcare, Inc., Plaintiff,
      vs. Timothy Aitken, Scott A. Shay, Lewis S. Ranieri, Wayne Palladino and
      Hyperion Partners II L.P., Defendants, and Transworld Healthcare, Inc.,
      Nominal Defendant, Index No. 98-106401. The suit alleges that certain
      officers and directors of the Company, and HPII, breached fiduciary duties
      to the Company and its shareholders, in connection with a transaction,
      approved by a vote of the Company's shareholders on March 17, 1998, in
      which the Company was to issue certain shares of stock to HPII in exchange
      for the HMI Receivables (Note 7). The action seeks injunctive relief
      against this transaction, and damages, costs and attorneys' fees in
      unspecified amounts. The transaction subsequently closed and the plaintiff
      has, on numerous occasions, stipulated to extend the defendants' time to
      respond to this suit. The most recent stipulation provides for an
      extension to March 3, 2000.

      On July 11 and July 22, 1997, the Company's RespiFlow, Inc. ("RespiFlow")
      and MK Diabetic Support Services, Inc. ("MK") subsidiaries, respectively,
      each received a letter (the "Audit Letters") from the U.S. Department of
      Health and Human Services' Office of Audit Services, a division of the
      Office of Inspector General ("OIG"). The Company was subsequently informed
      that the Audit Letters cover its DermaQuest subsidiary. The Company has
      produced certain documents and provided related information to the OIG and
      to the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas regarding these
      subsidiaries' financial relationships with suppliers of durable medical
      equipment and various other practices including the subsidiaries'
      practices regarding the collection of coinsurance and deductible amounts
      due from Medicare beneficiaries. Additionally, on November 19, 1997, the
      Company was notified by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of
      Texas that the Company, RespiFlow, MK, and various other non-affiliated
      entities had been named defendants in a qui tam action under the Federal
      False Claims Act. The qui tam action was recently unsealed and a copy of
      the complaint was provided to the Company. The relator is a private party
      who has brought action on behalf of the Federal government. At present,
      the Company has entered into settlement discussions with the Department of
      Justice ("DOJ") and the OIG in an effort to bring closure to this matter
      and to avoid the expense, disruption and uncertainty of litigation. The
      counsel for the relator has been involved in these settlement discussions
      as well. At present, we are not able to determine when a final settlement
      will be reached with the DOJ, the OIG and the relator or whether any
      proposed settlement can be concluded on terms acceptable to the Company.
      Accordingly, the Company is unable to estimate what the appropriate loss
      might be at this time. In the event that these settlement discussions are
      unsuccessful

      the Company will defend vigorously its interest in these matters. As such,
      the Company cannot predict whether the outcome of these actions will have
      a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial
      position, cash flows or results of operations.

      In addition to the above allegations, during the normal course of
      business, the Company continues to carefully monitor and review its
      submission of Medicare, Medicaid and all other claims for reimbursement.
      The Company believes that it is substantially in compliance, in all
      material respects, with the applicable provisions of the Federal statutes,
      regulations and laws and applicable state laws. Because of the broad and
      sometimes vague nature of these laws, there can be no assurance that an
      enforcement action will not be brought against the Company, or that the
      Company will not be found to be in violation of one or more of these
      provisions. At present, the Company cannot anticipate what impact, if any,
      subsequent administrative or judicial interpretation of the applicable
      Federal and state laws may have on the Company's consolidated financial
      position, cash flows or results of operations.

      Effective October 1, 1997, the Company owned 100% of the stock of HMI.

      HMI and certain of its current and former officers have been named as
      defendants in a class action lawsuit filed on April 3, 1997 in the United
      States District Court for the Eastern District of New York formerly
      entitled Nicholas Volonnino et al. v. Health Management, Inc., W. James
      Nicol, Paul S. Jurewicz and James Mieszala, 97 Civ. 1646. The action was
      amended on September 12, 1997, and is now entitled Dennis Baker et al. v.
      Health Management, Inc., BDO Seidman, LLP, Transworld HealthCare, Inc.,
      W. James Nicol, Paul S. Jurewicz and James Mieszala. The plaintiffs
      asserted claims under Sections 10(b) and 20 (a) of the Securities
      Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, arising out
      of alleged misrepresentations and omissions by HMI in connection with
      certain of its previous securities filings and press releases. The
      Company was sued as an alleged control entity of HMI, based upon its
      acquisition of 49% of HMI's outstanding common stock on January 13, 1997.
      The plaintiffs purport to be a class of persons who purchased shares of
      HMI common stock between April 26, 1996 and March 17, 1997, the date that
      HMI announced that it would have to restate certain of its financial
      statements and that it was renegotiating its deal with the Company.
      Plaintiffs sought unspecified compensatory damages from the harm that
      allegedly resulted from the alleged wrongdoing. Following the filing of
      several motions by the parties and the filings of an amended complaint by
      the plaintiffs, to which defendants responded, a memorandum of
      understanding, dated March 16, 1999, setting forth the terms of a
      settlement of this litigation, was executed by the plaintiffs, the
      Company, W. James Nicol, Paul S. Jurewicz, James Mieszala, and HMI (the
      "HMI Defendants") and National Union Fire Insurance Company of
      Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania ("National"). The total settlement to be paid by
      the HMI Defendants is $2,375. The Company is directly responsible to pay
      $325 of the settlement amount and National (as a separate party to the
      settlement) is directly responsible to pay the remaining $2,050. Of the
      $325 to be paid by the Company, $50 will be reimbursed by the Company's
      directors' and officers' insurance policy carrier. On July 26, 1999, the
      plaintiffs and BDO Seidman LLP entered into a preliminary agreement to
      settle the claims against BDO Seidman LLP for $100. The Court
      subsequently certified the class of plaintiffs to include all persons or
      entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of

      HMI between April 26, 1996 and March 17, 1997 inclusive, except the
      defendants and related parties. In November 1999, the Court gave final
      approval to the settlement.

      On July 2, 1998, a former shareholder of HMI purporting to sue on behalf
      of a class of shareholders of HMI as of June 6, 1997, commenced a suit in
      the Delaware Chancery Court, New Castle County, entitled Kathleen S.
      O'Reilly v. Transworld HealthCare, Inc., W. James Nicol, Andre C.
      Dimitriadis, Dr. Timothy J. Triche and D. Mark Weinberg, Civil Action No.
      16507-NC. Plaintiff alleged that the Company, as majority shareholder of
      HMI, and the then directors of HMI, breached fiduciary duties to the
      minority shareholders of HMI by approving a merger between HMI and a
      subsidiary of the Company for inadequate consideration. Plaintiff demands
      an accounting, damages, attorney's fees and other payment for other
      expenses for unspecified amounts. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss
      this action on September 18, 1998. The Court denied defendants' motion in
      part and granted the motion in part, leaving intact certain claims.
      Plaintiff has propounded discovery requests. The claims are insured

      HMI was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed on November 25, 1997, in
      the Chancery Court for the State of Delaware for New Castle County,
      entitled Clifford E. Hotte v. Health Management, Inc., CA No. 1606-NC. The
      plaintiff sought reimbursement and advancement of legal fees and expenses
      in the amount of $1,000 incurred or anticipated in connection with his
      defense of certain claims against him, a director and officer of HMI, in
      various litigation. The Court granted plaintiff a preliminary injunction
      requiring HMI to pay $824 for plaintiff's legal expenses. As part of the
      settlement of a class action litigation in which Clifford Hotte was still
      a defendant, but to which the Company was not a party (although it had
      been previously), HMI's insurer, National agreed to pay $1,000 to settle
      all of the class action plaintiffs' claims against Clifford Hotte and his
      wife, who was a co-defendant, in exchange for mutual releases of the
      parties and a release from Clifford Hotte of his judgement and any further
      claims against HMI, including the $824 legal expenses.

      By letter dated December 20, 1999, the Company received formal written
      notification of the intent of two plaintiffs to file a civil action in the
      Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania against Transworld
      Healthcare, Inc., Transworld Home Healthcare, Inc., Health Management,
      Inc. and HMI Pennsylvania, Inc. The two plaintiffs, Irwin Hirsch and Lloyd
      Myers, formerly were employees of HMI Pennsylvania, Inc. a subsidiary of
      the Company, and had written employment agreements. Myers also served as
      an officer of HMI. In their capacities as employees and as officers, both
      had some contractual indemnification rights against HMI and HMI
      Pennsylvania, Inc. for defense and indemnification. In 1994, Hirsch and
      Myers also sold two retail pharmacies they owned to HMI.

      Hirsch and Myers were named as defendants in an action filed in the United
      States District Court for the Eastern District of New York entitled In re
      Health Management, Inc. Securities Litigation, Master File No. 96 Civ.
      0889 (ADS), which was a class action by shareholders of HMI alleging,
      among other claims against the defendants, fraud in connection with the
      valuation of certain securities. Hirsch and Myers incurred non-reimbursed
      legal expenses of $100 in defending that litigation and, ultimately,

12.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED):

     settled their liability jointly for $1,325, which was non-reimbursed. They
     demand that defendants reimburse to them their non-reimbursed legal fees
     and the settlement amount pursuant to the indemnification provisions of
     their employee contracts.

     In addition to their indemnification claims, Hirsch and Myers also claim
     damages in the amount of $7,000 for losses in connection with the
     pharmacies sale transaction they entered into with HMI under which they
     sold their retail pharmacies to HMI. Hirsch and Myers claim that the
     pharmacies sale transaction was based upon fraudulent misrepresentations by
     HMI.

     The Company and HMI entities will vigorously defend against these claims.
     The Company believes that Hirsch and Myers' indemnification claims should
     not have any real merit because of testimony given by Hirsch and Myers
     under oath in connection with a criminal trial against Clifford Hotte, a
     director and former officer of HMI. In their testimony, Hirsch and Myers
     acknowledged malfeasance and nonfeasance, which should render their
     contractual entitlement to indemnification void. Even if they are entitled
     to indemnification despite their acknowledgements, they are liable to
     defendants for the economic losses and damages suffered by defendants as a
     result of the malfeasance and nonfeasance. Therefore if the civil actions
     are filed, the Company and HMI entities will aggressively pursue
     counterclaims against Hirsch and Myers for damages which, conservatively,
     are far in excess of their claims, including the claims associated with the
     pharmacies sale transaction.

     The enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
     "Commission") has issued a formal order of investigation relating to
     matters arising out of HMI's public announcement on February 27, 1996 that
     HMI would have to restate its financial statements for prior periods as a
     result of certain accounting irregularities. HMI is fully cooperating with
     this investigation and has responded to the requests of the Commission for
     documentary evidence.

     The outcomes of certain of the foregoing lawsuits and the investigation
     with respect to HMI are uncertain and the ultimate outcomes could have a
     material adverse affect on the Company.

     The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings and claims
     incidental to its normal business activities. The Company is vigorously
     defending its position in all such proceedings. Management believes these
     matters should not have a material adverse impact on the consolidated
     financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

13.  OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS:

     During the years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998 and the eleven months
     ended September 30, 1997, the Company operated in the following reportable
     business segments: (i) U.K. operations; (ii) U.S. specialty mail-order
     pharmaceuticals and medical supplies operations ("Mail-Order"); and (iii)
     U.S. hi-tech operations ("Hi-Tech"). The U.K. operations derives its
     revenues from nursing and para-professional services, mail-order of ostomy,
     continence and wound care products and oxygen concentrators and cylinders
     throughout the U.K. The Mail-Order operations derives its revenues from

      mail-order of diabetic test strips and glucose monitors, respiratory,
      diabetic, maintenance and other commonly prescribed medications, as well
      as ostomy and orthotic products. The Mail-Order operations provides
      products to patients in their home nationwide and Puerto Rico. The
      Hi-Tech operations derives its revenues from infusion and respiratory
      therapy services and home medical equipment operations concentrated in
      New Jersey and New York.

      During the year ended September 30, 1998 and the eleven months ended
      September 30, 1997, the Company also operated a U.S. nursing operation,
      TNI ("Nursing") which provided professional nursing and para-professional
      services in New Jersey and Florida. This operation was sold in July 1998.

      During the eleven months ended September 30, 1997, the Company also
      operated a U.S. radiation therapy operation, Radamerica ("Radiation")
      which provided radiation therapy services in the Baltimore, Maryland
      metropolitan area. This operation was sold in July 1997.

      The Company uses differences in geographic areas, as well as in products
      and services to identify the reportable segments. The Company evaluates
      performance and allocates resources based on profit and loss from
      operations before corporate expenses, interest and income taxes. The
      accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those
      described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Inter segment
      sales are not material. The following tables presents certain financial
      information by reportable business segments and geographic areas of
      operations for the years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998 and the eleven

14.   PROFIT SHARING PLAN:

      The Company has a profit sharing plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the
      Internal Revenue Code, concerning all U.S. employees who meet certain
      requirements. These requirements include, among other things, at least one
      year of service and attainment of the age of 21.

      The plan operates as a salary reduction plan whereby participants
      contribute anywhere from 1% to 15% of their compensation, not to exceed
      the maximum available under the Code.

      The Company may make an additional matching contribution at its discretion
      which had been and will be in the form of its common stock through
      December 31, 1998 and will be in cash thereafter. The Company's
      contributions to the plan were approximately $28, $28 and $27 for the
      years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998 and the eleven months ended
      September 30, 1997, respectively.

      In addition to the U.S. plan described above, the Company also sponsors
      personal pension plans at selected U.K. subsidiaries. The plans operate as
      salary reduction plans, which also allows for lump sum contributions,
      whereby participants contribute anywhere from 1% to 40% of their
      compensation, not to exceed the maximum available under the U.K. tax laws.

      The Company may make an additional contribution (which varies according to
      employee contracts and contribution elections) which is in the form of
      cash. The Company's contributions to the U.K. plans were $91 and $71 for
      the years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively and $13 for the
      eleven months ended September 30, 1997.

      On December 20, 1999 the Company's U.K. subsidiaries obtained an aggregate

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)



15.   SUBSEQUENT EVENT (Unaudited) (CONTINUED):

      The mezzanine lenders and the purchasers of the Notes were also issued
      warrants to purchase approximately 2% and 27%, respectively, of the fully
      diluted shares of TW UK. $55,755 of the net proceeds of the Refinancing
      were used to repay the Company's existing Credit Facility, $11,000 was
      provided to the Company for general corporate purposes in the U.S., with
      the balance to be used for acquisitions and working capital in the U.K.

      Repayment of the loans under the senior credit facility commences on July
      30, 2000 and continues until final maturity. The acquisition loan may be
      drawn upon through December 17, 2002. As of January 3, 2000, borrowings
      under the senior credit facilities bore interest at a rates of 7.72% to
      8.47%. Subject to certain exceptions, the senior credit facilities
      contains restrictions, prohibitions and affirmative and negative financial
      covenants customarily found in agreements of this kind.

      The loans under the senior credit facilities are collateralized by, among
      other things, a lien on substantially all of TW UK's assets, a pledge of
      TW UK's ownership interest in its subsidiaries and guaranties by TW UK's
      subsidiaries.

      With respect to the mezzanine term loan interest, LIBOR + 3.5% will be
      payable in cash, with the remaining interest being added to the principal
      amount of the loan. The mezzanine term loan contains terms and conditions
      substantially similar to those contained in the senior credit facility. As
      of January 3, 2000, borrowings under the mezzanine term loan bore interest
      at a rate of 12.72%.

      Interest payments on the Notes are subject to restrictions contained in
      the senior credit facilities which require interest on the Notes to be
      paid in-kind through the issuance of additional notes for the first 18
      months, with payment of interest in cash thereafter subject to meeting
      certain financial tests. The documents covering the Notes provide for
      customary shareholder rights for a transaction of this type, including:
      (i) pre-emptive rights with respect to new securities; (ii) rights of
      first refusal with respect to proposed transfers of shares of TW UK; (iii)
      drag-along rights; (iv) tag-along rights; (v) put and call provisions; and
      (vi) certain corporate actions which require the consent of the holder of
      the Notes.

      Concurrent with the Refinancing, the Company placed 100% of its ownership
      interest in TW UK into a voting trust (the "Voting Trust"). The trustee of
      the Voting Trust is generally obligated to vote the shares held in trust
      pursuant to the instructions of the Board of Directors of TW UK, as well
      as to elect to the board of directors of TW UK, individuals designated in
      accordance with the documents governing the Notes. G. Richard Green, a
      director of the Company, is the trustee of the Voting Trust.

      In connection with the repayment of the Company's existing Credit
      Facility, the Company will record a non-cash, pre-tax, extraordinary
      charge of approximately $1,200 in its first quarter of fiscal 2000,
      relating to the write-off of the deferred financing costs associated with
      the Credit Facility.

                             VOTING TRUST AGREEMENT


        VOTING TRUST AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") made the 17th day of December
1999, by and among Transworld Holdings (UK) Limited, a company incorporated in
England and Wales with registered number 3370146, ("UK Parent"), Transworld
Healthcare (UK) Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales with
registered number 3370146 ("TW UK"), Transworld Healthcare, Inc., a New York
corporation ("US Parent"), Triumph Partners III, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership ("Triumph"), and Richard Green (hereinafter sometimes referred to,
together with his successor in trust, as the "Trustee"). UK Parent and US Parent
are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Initial Shareholders."
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings
ascribed thereto in the Securities Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase
Agreement"), dated as of the date hereof, among UK Parent, TW UK, the Purchasers
and US Parent (solely for the purposes of certain Sections of the Purchase
Agreement).

                               W I T N E S S E T H


        WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, TW UK, the Initial Shareholders, Triumph
and the other Purchasers have entered into the Purchase Agreement, which, as a
condition precedent to the investment by the Purchasers in the securities of UK
Parent and TW UK, requires the Initial Shareholders and the other parties to
this Agreement to enter into this Agreement for the benefit of the Purchasers as
beneficial holders of up to 22,600,000 warrants (the "Warrants") to acquire in
the aggregate up to 22,600,000 ordinary shares of 5p each of TW UK (the "Warrant
Shares");

        WHEREAS, the Purchasers have on the date hereof agreed to subscribe for
the Warrants and Triumph, as the majority Investor, has been issued one special
share of 5p of TW UK (the "Special Share") for the purpose of exercising the
voting rights that would be exercisable by the Warrant Shares if all of the
Warrants were exercised prior to the vote being taken in the manner set forth in
the Memorandum and Articles of Association of TW UK (as in effect from time to
time, the "TW UK Charter");

        WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, US Parent is the holder of 100 ordinary
shares of (pounds sterling)1 each of UK Parent,  representing  all of the issued
shares of UK Parent as of such date,  and UK Parent is the holder of  48,000,000
ordinary  shares of 5p each of TW UK respectively of all of the issued shares of
TW UK as of such date (collectively the "Issued Shares");

        WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that for so long as the
Warrants are exercisable but have not been exercised, the Special Shareholder
(as defined in the TW UK Charter) is to be afforded the right to vote on an as
exercised basis on matters submitted to a vote of the holders of ordinary shares
of TW UK for all purposes on the basis of one vote per Warrant Share;


                                        2

<PAGE>



        WHEREAS, the Purchasers have required as a condition of their investment
in UK Parent and TW UK that the voting rights attributable to the Special Share
and the Warrant Shares be coupled with and supplemented by the mechanisms
provided in this Agreement for exercising the voting rights attributable to the
Issued Shares, so as to give effect to the commercial understanding between the
Purchasers, on the one hand, and the Initial Shareholders, on the other hand,
with respect to the exercise of control over the business and policies of TW UK
and UK Parent and other matters of corporate governance as between majority and
minority shareholders;

        WHEREAS, it has been agreed between the Purchasers and TW US that
Triumph on behalf of the Purchasers will be entitled to select one member of
each of the Boards of Directors of UK Parent and TW UK and the Initial
Shareholders will be entitled to select one member of each of the Boards of
Directors of UK Parent and TW UK, with the total number of members of each such
Board of Directors being fixed at five and the remaining members of such Boards
of Directors to be selected as provided in this Agreement, provided that the
size of such Boards of Directors is subject to increase upon the occurrence of a
Covenant Breach and Triumph on behalf of the Purchasers will be entitled to
select the additional director or directors as provided herein;

        WHEREAS, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Triumph has been appointed
as the representative of the Purchasers for the purposes of exercising the
rights of the Purchasers under the Transaction Documents, including this
Agreement, and as such representative, Triumph is a party hereto;

        WHEREAS, this Agreement, together with the Purchase Agreement and
various provisions of the Charter Documents of UK Parent and TW UK are designed
to protect the Purchasers from the risk of, among other things, UK Parent or TW
UK (i) entering into any transaction with or contributions to US Parent in the
form of dividends, fees, re-charges, loans, guarantees or any other benefit, in
any form, unless they have been previously agreed upon by the Purchasers and
(ii) being exposed to any liabilities of US Parent or claims of creditors of US
Parent of a security interest or other right to any assets of UK Parent or TW
UK;

        WHEREAS, in consideration of the foregoing, the Initial Shareholders
desire to grant the voting power with respect to the Issued Shares legally and
beneficially owned by them as of this date, as well as any other ordinary shares
of UK Parent or TW UK hereafter legally and beneficially hereafter acquired or
held by them, to the Trustee in all matters on the terms and conditions set
forth herein; and

        WHEREAS, the Trustee has consented to act under this Agreement for the
purposes hereinafter provided.

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein
contained and for other good, valuable and sufficient consideration, the receipt
of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto promise, covenant, undertake
and agree as follows:

        1. Transfer of Shares to the Trustee. Immediately upon executing this
Agreement, each of the Initial Shareholders shall deposit with the Trustee one
or more certificates


                                        3

<PAGE>



representing the number of Issued Shares listed opposite its name on Schedule 1
hereto, and shall also deposit with the Trustee immediately upon receipt
certificates representing any other shares of any class or series of TW UK and
UK Parent having voting powers which they acquire, legally or beneficially,
during the term of this Agreement, including any such shares acquired through
the exercise of any rights, warrants, options, conversion rights, as dividends,
on a consolidation, reorganization, by way of bonus issue or otherwise (the
Issued Shares and such other shares collectively the "Shares"). All such share
certificates shall be accompanied by such instruments of transfer duly executed
and stamped by or on behalf of the Initial Shareholders depositing such
certificates and such other documents as may be required so as to enable the
Trustee to cause such shares to be transferred into the name of the Trustee.
Subject to stamping, each of UK Parent and TW UK (as appropriate) shall
immediately register the transfer of the Shares in the register of members. All
certificates for the Shares transferred and delivered to the Trustee pursuant
hereto shall be canceled and new certificates therefor shall promptly be issued
to and held by the Trustee in its own name in its capacity as Trustee hereunder
and shall bear a legend indicating that the Shares represented by such
certificate are subject to this Agreement. Upon receipt by the Trustee of the
certificates for any such Shares and the transfer of such Shares into the name
of the Trustee, the Trustee shall hold such Shares, and any dividends and other
distributions in respect thereof on trust for US Parent and UK Parent,
respectively, absolutely, subject to the terms of this Agreement and shall issue
and deliver to each Initial Shareholder voting trust certificates representing
its interest in such Shares deposited pursuant to this Agreement ("Voting Trust
Certificates"). Each Voting Trust Certificate to be issued and delivered by the
Trustee in respect of the Shares shall state the number of Shares which it
represents, shall identify the company in which such Shares represent an
interest in shall be signed by the Trustee and shall be in substantially the
same form as Exhibit A attached hereto and bear the restrictive legends set
forth thereon. The Trustee shall at all times keep, or cause to be kept,
complete and accurate records of all Shares or other securities deposited with
it hereunder, the identity, addresses and ownership of the depositing Initial
Shareholders, and all certificates of beneficial interest issued by the Trustee.
Such records shall be open to inspection by any depositing Initial Shareholder
or holder of Voting Trust Certificates at all reasonable times. If any Initial
Shareholder shall fail to transfer, or procure the transfer of, any Shares held
or acquired by it or any of its Affiliates in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 1 within 2 days of first becoming bound so to do, such Initial
Shareholder (for itself and (as the case may be) as trustee on behalf of its
Affiliates) shall be deemed to have irrevocably appointed hereunder the Trustee
as its true and lawful attorney for and in its name and on its behalf to do all
such things and execute as a deed or under hand (as the case may be) all such
documents as may be necessary to transfer the entire legal interest in any such
Shares to the Trustee in accordance with, and for the purposes of, this
Agreement. The Trustee shall be obliged and hereby undertakes to take such
action as may be necessary as true and lawful attorney for that shareholder and
for its Affiliates to effect any transfer of shares pursuant to this Section 1
and the power of attorney granted hereunder.

        2. Dividends. If any dividend in respect of the Shares deposited with or
acquired by the Trustee hereunder is paid, in whole or in part, in shares of TW
UK or UK Parent having voting powers, the Trustee shall likewise hold on trust
for the registered holders of the Voting Trust Certificates, absolutely, subject
to the terms of this Agreement, the shares and the related


                                        4

<PAGE>



share certificates which are received by TW UK or UK Parent on account of such
dividend, and the holder of each outstanding Voting Trust Certificate
representing shares on which such dividend has been paid shall be entitled to
receive a further Voting Trust Certificate issued under this Agreement for the
number and class of shares received as such dividend with respect to the shares
represented by such outstanding Voting Trust Certificate. Holders entitled to
receive the Voting Trust Certificates issued in respect of the shares received
as such dividends shall be those registered as such on the books of the Trustee
at the close of business on the record date for such dividend.

        The Trustee shall at all times direct TW UK and UK Parent, and they are
hereby directed, with respect to the Shares of which the Trustee is the
registered member to pay all cash dividends or other cash distributions whether
of income or capital paid in respect of or in relation to the Shares (other than
any dividends or distributions paid in shares of TW UK or of UK Parent having
voting powers) to the registered holders of the Voting Trust Certificates or
such other person(s) as they may direct. If the Trustee shall receive any such
cash dividends or distributions or other monies, it shall account to UK Parent
or US Parent, as the case may be, for such monies.

        3. Transfer of Securities. No Initial Shareholder shall, directly or
indirectly, Transfer any Voting Trust Certificates except in circumstances where
an identical Transfer of Shares would be permitted by the Purchase Agreement,
subject to the condition precedent that the transferee shall have entered into
an enforceable written agreement satisfactory to the Board of Directors of TW UK
agreeing to be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement to the same
extent as the transferring Initial Shareholder as if such Voting Trust
Certificates were still owned by the Initial Shareholders.

        Subject to the preceding paragraph, the provisions of the Charter
Documents of UK Parent and TW UK shall apply to any transfer or purported
transfer of any Voting Trust Certificates as they shall to any transfer or
purported transfer of any Shares represented thereby. Any Transfer in violation
of such restrictions shall cause the transferring holder to lose its rights and
privileges with respect to (but shall continue to be bound by), as applicable,
(i) Articles 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the TW UK Charter, (ii) the corresponding
provisions of the Articles and Memorandum of Association of UK Parent, (iii)
Articles 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the Purchase Agreement and (iv) all rights to
vote or direct the voting of Shares held by the Trustee hereunder pursuant to
Section 6 hereof. The Trustee shall not register such transfer or recognize the
intended transferee as the holder of the Voting Trust Certificate for any
purpose. To the extent permitted by law, Voting Trust Certificates shall not be
subject to attachment, garnishment, judicial order, levy, execution or similar
process, however instituted, for satisfaction of a judgment or otherwise.

        Subject to the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs, the Voting Trust
Certificates shall be transferable on the books of the Trustee, at such office
as the Trustee may designate, by the registered owner thereof, either in person
or by attorney duly authorized, upon surrender thereof, according to the rules
established for that purpose by the Trustee, and the Trustee may treat the
registered holder as owner thereof for all purposes whatsoever, but it shall not
be required to deliver new Voting Trust Certificates hereunder without the
surrender of such existing Voting Trust Certificates.


                                         5

         If a Voting Trust Certificate is lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed,
the Trustee, in its discretion, may issue a duplicate of such certificate upon
receipt of (a) evidence of such fact satisfactory to it; (b) indemnity
satisfactory to it, including, without limitation, an indemnity bond, sufficient
in the judgment of the Trustee, to protect the Trustee, or any agent, from any
loss which any of them may suffer if a Voting Trust Certificate is replaced; (c)
the existing certificate, if mutilated; and (d) its reasonable fees and expenses
in connection with the issuance of a new trust certificate.

        4. Withdrawal of Shares from Voting Trust. Any registered holder of
Voting Trust Certificates hereunder may from time to time withdraw Shares
represented thereby from the voting trust arrangements created hereby only upon
the occurrence of any of the following circumstances:

                (a) at any time after the fifteenth anniversary of the date
hereof, provided that all Obligations of UK Parent and TW UK arising from (i) an
exercise of Warrants for Warrant Shares, (ii) an exercise of a Purchasers'
Warrant Put or (iii) an exercise of a Purchasers' Warrant Shares Put, shall have
been duly and fully satisfied; or

                (b) at any time after a Qualified Public Offering in connection
with and immediately prior to any bona fide sale of the Shares to be so
withdrawn which are represented by a Voting Trust Certificate to any Person who
is not an Affiliate of any of the Initial Shareholders, subject to such sale
being in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Charter Documents;
provided, however, that only the portion of the Shares represented by a Voting
Trust Certificate which are actually sold to such Person shall be so withdrawn.

        Any Shares withdrawn from the voting trust arrangements created pursuant
to this Agreement, when so withdrawn in compliance with this Section 4, shall be
free of any restrictions imposed by this Agreement, but shall remain subject to
any and all other restrictions imposed by the Charter Documents of TW UK and UK
Parent, as the case may be, the Transaction Documents or other agreements or by
law. Such withdrawal shall be effected only by a written amendment to this
Agreement in the form of Exhibit B hereto executed by the Trustee. Upon the
surrender by such holder to the Trustee of the Voting Trust Certificate or
Certificates designated in such amendment, the Trustee is authorized to deliver
or cause to be delivered to such holder a certificate or certificates for the
Shares so withdrawn, with any appropriate restrictive legends, accompanied by
such instruments of transfer duly executed by or on behalf of the Trustee and
such other documents of title as may be required so as to enable such holder to
cause such shares to be transferred into its, his or her own name, and a Voting
Trust Certificate in respect of the remaining shares, if any. Nothing in this
Section 4 or in any such amendment shall modify, amend, limit or terminate any
other restrictions contained in, or be construed as a consent to any transfer of
Shares subject to, this Agreement under the Charter Documents of TW UK and UK
Parent, the other Transaction Documents or any other agreement or instrument,
unless such amendment specifically refers to such other agreement or instrument
and satisfies all requirements for amendment or waiver thereof (including
execution and delivery by appropriate parties).

                copy of the original) of a board resolution of TW UK or UK

                damages, actions, demand or expenses or for any breach of any of

                accepting, acting or relying on such letter, notice or certified
                copy;

                (iv) With respect to all other matters, the Trustee shall vote

                Trustee shall not be allowed or bound to call for further

                the Extraordinary Event, are neither employees of US Parent, UK
                Parent, TW UK or any of their Subsidiaries, nor Affiliates of US
                Parent or Hyperion Capital (the "Designated Directors"). The
                occurrence of an Extraordinary Event shall be determined by a
                majority of the Designated Directors. The Trustee shall be
                required to accept as evidence of the determination and
                instructions of the Designated Directors a copy (duly certified
                by the secretary of TW UK, any Designated Director or other
                authorized person as being a true copy of the original) of a
                resolution of the Designated Directors duly signed, or
                purporting to be signed, by a majority of the Designated
                Directors, a copy of which the Trustee shall deliver to US
                Parent promptly. The Trustee shall not be allowed or bound to
                call for further evidence nor to verify the accuracy of the
                contents of such certified copy nor be responsible for any
                losses, liabilities, costs, damages, actions, demand or expenses
                or for any breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement
                that may be occasioned by accepting, acting or relying on such
                certified copy.

                        If the registered holders of the Voting Trust
                Certificates dispute the determination of a majority of the
                Designated Directors that an Extraordinary Event has occurred,
                it shall have the right to take such action as it may determine,
                including seeking injunctive relief, instituting an action for
                damages or an appropriate judicial declaration. Pending
                resolution of any dispute or legal proceeding initiated by the
                registered holders of the Voting Trust Certificates, the Trustee
                shall be required to act in accordance with the instructions of
                the Designated Directors except in the case that an injunction
                to the contrary is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.
                The Designated Directors shall respond promptly to any request
                by the registered holders of the Voting Trust Certificates for a
                statement of the grounds upon which they based their
                determination that an Extraordinary Event has occurred and shall
                afford the registered holders of the Voting Trust Certificates
                an opportunity to address the Designated Directors and
                illustrate any objections or other matters relevant to such
                determination.

                (vi) If a Put Breach shall have occurred and be continuing, with
                respect to any matters relating to, or required by the Purchase
                Agreement or the Charter Documents of UK Parent or TW UK to be
                acted upon in connection with a Liquidity Event, a Qualifying
                Liquidity Event, a Qualifying Offer, an Exit Offer, an Asset
                Disposition, a Disposition or any of the matters set forth in
                Articles 8.1 through 8.4 of the TW UK Charter, or in connection
                with the exercise of the "Drag-Along Rights" provided in Article
                XII of the Purchase Agreement, the Trustee (A) shall vote, sell
                and transfer the Shares strictly in accordance with the
                instructions of Triumph without any requirement as to action by
                the Board of Directors of UK Parent or TW UK and (B) shall
                execute and deliver as the registered holder of the


                                       11

<PAGE>



                Shares such agreements, documents or instruments as may be
                reasonably required by Triumph to carry out the same
                consistently with the Purchase Agreement and the TW UK Charter.
                The Trustee shall be required to accept as evidence of the
                occurrence of a Put Breach and of the instructions of Triumph a
                letter or notice duly signed by an authorized representative of
                Triumph stating that a Put Breach has occurred and setting forth
                any other actions to which such instructions shall apply. The
                Trustee shall not be allowed or bound to call for further
                evidence nor to verify the accuracy of the contents of such
                letter or notice nor be responsible for any losses, liabilities,
                costs, damages, actions, demand or expenses or for any breach of
                any of the provisions of this Agreement that may be occasioned
                by accepting, acting or relying on such letter or notice.

                         If US Parent disputes the determination of Triumph that
                a Put Breach has occurred, it shall have the right to take such
                action as it may determine, including seeking injunctive relief,
                instituting an action for damages or an appropriate judicial
                declaration. Pending resolution of any dispute or legal
                proceeding initiated by US Parent, the Trustee shall be required
                to act in accordance with the instructions of Triumph except in
                the case that an injunction to the contrary is issued by a court
                of competent jurisdiction. Triumph shall respond promptly to any
                request by US Parent for a statement of the grounds upon which
                Triumph based its determination that a Put Breach has occurred
                and shall afford US Parent an opportunity to address Triumph and
                illustrate any obligations or other matters relevant to such
                determination.

                (vii) If any resolutions are required to be passed by the
                shareholders to approve or authorize any purchase of Securities
                pursuant to Articles VI, VII or VIII of the Purchase Agreement,
                including, without limitation, any special resolutions required
                under Sections 164, 165 and/or 171 of the Companies Act 1985
                (whether out of distributable profits or out of the proceeds of
                any new issuance of shares or otherwise), then, subject to the
                requirements of Applicable Laws, the Trustee shall vote the
                Shares strictly in accordance with the instructions of Triumph.
                The Trustee shall be required to accept as evidence of the
                instructions of Triumph a letter or notice duly signed by an
                authorized representative of Triumph stating that a resolution
                is required and setting forth any other actions to which such
                instructions shall apply. The Trustee shall not be allowed or
                bound to call for further evidence nor to verify the accuracy of
                the contents of such letter or notice nor be responsible for any
                losses, liabilities, costs, damages, actions, demand or expenses
                or for any breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement
                that may be occasioned by accepting, acting or relying on such
                letter or notice.

                (b) The following terms shall have the following meaning for
purposes of this Section 6:

        "Transworld Change of Control" means any of the following: (i) any

transfer by US Parent of any Capital Shares of UK Parent or by UK Parent of any

by one or more underwriters of Capital Shares of TW UK pursuant to a firm
commitment underwriting in connection with a public offering of such Capital
Shares or (ii) following a Qualified Public Offering, the purchase by any Person
of Capital Shares of TW UK in a transaction which allows such Shares to be

                (or, in the case of derivative or other actions, on behalf of
                the Initial Shareholders or their successors or assigns by any
                representative, trustee, agent, court, or administrative agency,
                receiver or administrator preliminary proceedings seeking
                permission or authority for the filing of any suit or complaint)
                with any court of competent jurisdiction, or the commencement of
                any other legal proceeding or administrative process seeking in
                any manner whatsoever to (i) have the creation of the voting
                trust pursuant to this Agreement or the transfer to such voting
                trust of the Shares declared void or invalid or rescinded, (ii)
                challenge the validity, enforceability or effectiveness of this
                Agreement or the voting trust created hereby, or (iii) direct

                legal challenge involving the voting trust created by this
                Agreement, the TW UK Charter or the rights of the Purchasers

                Directors of TW UK, as evidenced by a Board Resolution and (B)
                does not constitute and would not become (with the passage of
                time, the giving of notice or otherwise) a default or event of
                default under the Credit Agreements; or

                (iii) Any insolvency or bankruptcy or similar case or proceeding
                involving US Parent, any reorganization, receivership,

                voluntary or involuntary, or any assignment for the benefit of
                creditors or any other marshaling of assets and liabilities of
                US Parent.


                                       13

        "Put Breach" means, with respect to any of (i) a Purchasers' Put, (ii) a
Purchasers' Warrant Put or (iii) a Purchasers' Share Put (each a "Put"), the
failure of UK Parent and/or TW UK to fulfill their respective Obligations in all
material respects in the manner and at the time provided in the Purchase
Agreement provided that a failure by UK Parent so to fulfill its obligations
shall not be deemed to be a Put Breach unless TW UK shall also have failed to
fulfill its obligations on the corresponding Put.

                (c) Subject to the last paragraph of this Section 6(c), US
Parent, UK Parent and Triumph (in their capacities as shareholders of UK Parent
and TW UK, respectively) hereby undertake to each other that they will use all
reasonable endeavors to procure (subject to the requirements of Applicable Law),
that the Boards of Directors of each of UK Parent and TW UK shall consist of the
following:

                (i) The chief executive officer of TW UK (the "Management
                Director"), provided that the initial Management Director shall
                be Timothy Aitken;

                (ii) One person designated by Triumph (the "Investor Director"),
                provided, that the initial Investor Director shall be Frederick
                S. Moseley IV;

                (iii) One person designated by the registered holders of the
                Voting Trust Certificates (the "Parent Director"), provided,
                that the initial Parent Director shall be L. Ranieri;

                (iv) Up to two additional persons who are neither partners,
                directors, agents, Affiliates, officers or employees of any of
                US Parent, Triumph or their Affiliates, nor officers or
                employees of UK Parent or TW UK or any of its Subsidiaries (the
                "Independent Directors"), who will be nominated with the
                affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office
                following the nomination procedure set forth below, provided,
                that one of the initial Independent Directors shall be H. J.
                Mark Tompkins.

        If at any time, (i) any of Triumph or the registered holders of the
Voting Trust Certificates shall notify the Trustee and the other parties hereto
of its desire to remove, with or without cause (as defined below), any director
of TW UK or UK Parent previously designated by it pursuant to this Section 6(c),
(ii) the Management Director ceases to be employed as the chief executive
officer of TW UK, or (iii) the directors (other than the director who is
proposed to be removed) then in office unanimously agree to request the removal
of an Independent Director, then the Trustee agrees to vote all of the Shares so
as to remove such director. If at any time, any of the Investor Director or the
Parent Director ceases to serve on the Board of Directors of TW UK or UK Parent
(whether by reason of death, resignation, removal or otherwise), the party who
designated such director shall be entitled to designate a successor director to
fill the vacancy created thereby on the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Section 6(c) and the Trustee shall vote all of the Shares so as to elect
any such director. If at any time an Independent Director ceases to serve on the
Board of Directors of TW UK or UK Parent (whether by reason


                                       14

<PAGE>


of death, resignation, removal or otherwise), a successor director shall be
designated and elected on the terms and subject to the conditions provided in
this Section 6(c).

        US Parent, UK Parent and Triumph (in their capacity as shareholders of
UK Parent and TW UK, respectively) hereby undertake to each other that they will
use all reasonable endeavors to procure (subject to the requirements of
Applicable Law) that the directors nominated by them to the Board of Directors
of UK Parent and TW UK exercise their respective powers under the Articles and
Memorandum of Association of UK Parent and the TW UK Charter to give effect to
the provisions of this Section 6(c).

        Whenever a Covenant Breach occurs, Triumph will be entitled to nominate
one additional director to be appointed to the Board of Directors of each of UK
Parent and TW UK (an "Additional Investor Director") and thereafter on each six
month anniversary of the occurrence of such Covenant Breach, so long as such
Covenant Breach continues, Triumph will be entitled to nominate one Additional
Investor Director to be appointed to the Board of Directors of each of UK Parent
and TW UK. Each appointment of an Additional Investor Director shall take place
at an extraordinary meeting of shareholders called for such purpose by the Board
of Directors or requisitioned by the Trustee at the request of Triumph. The
Trustee, US Parent, UK Parent and TW UK hereby undertake to take all such action
and exercise all their powers (including voting powers) to procure the
appointment of all such Additional Directors as may be nominated by Triumph
pursuant to this Section 6(c). If and when the original Covenant Breach and all
other Covenant Breaches that may have arisen while such original Covenant Breach
was continuing have been eliminated or waived in writing by Triumph and are no
longer continuing, the right of Triumph to nominate Additional Investor
Directors shall lapse and all Additional Investor Directors shall resign or, in
the absence of such resignation, be removed, subject to the rights set forth in
this paragraph revesting in the event of each and every Covenant Breach. The
provisions of this Section 6(c) applicable to the Investor Director shall apply
equally to all Additional Investor Directors.

        7. Compensation and Reimbursement of the Trustee. The Trustee shall have
the right to incur and pay such reasonable expenses and charges and, provided it
shall have acted reasonably in its selection of any such person, to employ and
pay such agents, attorneys and counsel as it may deem necessary and proper in
the performance of its obligations and exercise of its powers under this
Agreement. Any such expenses or charges incurred by and due to the Trustee shall
be reimbursed by TW UK. Nothing herein contained shall disqualify the Trustee or
any successor Trustee, from serving TW UK, UK Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in any other capacity, holding any class of securities in TW UK or
UK Parent, becoming a creditor of TW UK or UK Parent or otherwise dealing with
it in good faith, or taking any other action in connection with any matter in
which such Trustee has any direct or indirect interest. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Trustee shall be entitled to be fully indemnified by TW UK
against all costs, charges, expenses, loss, liability and damage properly
incurred by the Trustee in the administration of this trust or in the proper
exercise of any power conferred upon the Trustee by this Agreement. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall, in any case where the Trustee or, as the case
may be, any attorney, agent, delegate or other person appointed by the Trustee
under this Agreement, has been guilty of fraud or wilful default in the
performance of any of its duties


                                       15

<PAGE>



hereunder exempt the Trustee or, as the case may be, such attorney, agent,
delegate or other person appointed by the Trustee under this Agreement from, or
indemnify it, him or her against any liability for breach of contract or any
liability which by virtue of any rule of law would otherwise attach to it, him
or her in respect of any such fraud or default of which it, he or she may be
guilty in relation to its, his or her duties under this Agreement.

        8. Additional and Successor Trustee. The power of appointing new and
additional trustees shall be vested in the Board of Directors of TW UK, subject
to the consent of US Parent and Triumph, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed to the appointment of any professional trust company. The
Trustee may retire at any time upon giving at least 30 days' written notice to
each of the registered holders of the Voting Trust Certificates and the Board of
Directors of TW UK without giving any reason provided that the retirement of the
Trustee (if it is the sole trustee) will not be effective until another trustee
is appointed as successor trustee. The Trustee shall be required, upon receipt
of written notice from the Board of Directors of TW UK, to retire with immediate
effect or within the time specified in such notice. If a sole Trustee gives or
is given notice of retirement, the Board of Directors of TW UK will use all
reasonable endeavors to procure that another trustee is appointed as Trustee.
The rights, powers and privileges of the successor Trustee named hereunder shall
be possessed by the successor Trustee with the same effect as though such
successor had originally been a party to this Agreement.

        The Trustee shall affix its signatures to this Agreement and each
successor Trustee appointed pursuant to this Section 8 shall accept appointment
or election hereunder by affixing its signature to this Agreement at the time it
becomes a Trustee hereunder. By affixing its signature to this Agreement, the
Trustee and each successor Trustee agree to be bound by the terms hereof.

        9. Sale and Transfer of Shares. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the Trustee shall not sell, hypothecate, pledge, assign or otherwise
transfer or deal in any way with the Shares held in the voting trust pursuant to
this Agreement.

        10. Rights of Company with Respect to Shares Hereafter Acquired. With
respect to any shares of either TW UK or UK Parent acquired by any of the
Initial Shareholders and their Affiliates subsequent to the date hereof which,
pursuant to the provisions of Section 1, were required to have been properly
transferred into the voting trust (unless such shares shall have been
subsequently withdrawn pursuant to Section 4), the Trustee shall be entitled and
obliged (and hereby undertakes) to exercise the power of attorney granted under
Section 1 hereof to transfer such shares into the voting trust and the Board of
Directors of TW UK or UK Parent, as the case may be, and the Trustee shall have
the right to consider such shares to be properly transferred into the voting
trust and governed by the terms of this Agreement for any and all purposes,
including, without limitation, the right to refuse to enter the Initial
Shareholders or their Affiliates (or any subsequent transfer by them or such
shares, other than into the voting trust) in the register of members of TW UK or
UK Parent, recognize any purported exercise of voting rights by the Initial
Shareholders with respect to such shares or to consider any such shares to be
issued or outstanding for purposes of any shareholder vote or for purposes of
determining a quorum for such vote. This Section 10 shall apply regardless of
the identity of the

                                       16

<PAGE>



holder of such shares and whether or not the certificates evidencing ownership
of such shares were ever actually surrendered for deposit into the voting trust,
as contemplated hereby.

        11. Amendment and Termination. This Agreement may be amended or
terminated only by a deed executed by the Trustee and with the prior consent of
the Board of Directors of TW UK, evidenced by a Board Resolution, US Parent and
Triumph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the voting trust automatically shall
terminate (a) following the withdrawal, in a single transaction or a series of
transactions, of all of the Shares held in the voting trust in accordance with
the provisions of Section 4 hereof or (b) as soon as both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (i) a Qualified Public Offering has occurred and (ii)
UK Parent ceases to have beneficial ownership of 29.9% or more of the ordinary
share capital of TW UK.

        12. Termination Procedure. Upon the termination of the voting trust at
any time, in accordance with Section 11 of this Agreement, the Trustee shall
mail written notice of such termination to the registered owners of the
outstanding Voting Trust Certificates, at the addresses appearing on the
transfer books of the Trustee. From the date specified in any such notice (which
date shall be fixed by the Trustee) the Voting Trust Certificates shall cease to
have any effect, and the holders of such Voting Trust Certificates shall have no
further rights under this voting trust other than to receive certificates for
Shares or other property distributable under the terms hereof upon the surrender
of such Voting Trust Certificates.

        Forthwith following the termination of this voting trust, the Trustee
shall deliver to the registered holders of all Voting Trust Certificates
outstanding as of the date of such termination, share certificates for the
number of Shares of such class or classes of TW UK's Shares represented thereby
as to which they shall be entitled upon the surrender for cancellation of such
Voting Trust Certificates, accompanied by properly endorsed and executed
instruments of transfer, as appropriate, at the place designated by the Trustee,
and after payment, if the Trustee so requires, by the persons entitled to
receive such share certificates, of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp tax or
governmental charge in respect of the transfer or delivery of such share
certificates. Such certificates shall bear such legend referring to the
restrictions on transfer of such Shares as may be required by this Agreement, by
law or otherwise. Thereupon, all liability of the Trustee for delivery of such
certificates, instruments of transfer or Shares shall terminate, and the Voting
Trust Certificates representing the beneficial interest in the Shares so
delivered by the Trustee shall be null and void.

        If upon such termination, one or more registered holders of outstanding
Voting Trust Certificates shall fail to surrender such Voting Trust
Certificates, or the Trustee for any reason shall be unable to comply with the
provisions of the preceding paragraph, the Trustee may, at any time subsequent
to 30 days after the termination of this Agreement, deposit with TW UK or UK
Parent ordinary share certificates representing the number of Shares represented
by such Voting Trust Certificates, together with duly executed instruments of
transfer and written instructions authorizing TW UK or UK Parent to deliver such
Share certificates in exchange for Voting Trust Certificates representing a like
interest in the Shares of TW UK or UK Parent, as the case may be; and upon such
deposit, all further liability of the Trustee for the delivery of such shares,
Share certificates and instruments of transfer and the delivery or payment of
dividends upon


                                       17

<PAGE>



surrender of the Voting Trust Certificates shall cease, and the Trustee shall
not be required to take any further action hereunder.

        13. Notices, Etc. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
notices and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be delivered by courier, or mailed by a nationally recognized overnight
courier, postage prepaid, addressed, (a) if to TW UK, at its address set forth
on the signature page attached hereto, to the attention of the chief executive
officer, or at such other address, or to the attention of such other officer, as

        14. Headings. The descriptive headings of the articles and sections of
this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not control or affect
the meaning or construction of any of the provisions hereof.

        15. Construction. This Agreement and the documents to be entered into
pursuant to it, except as expressly referred to herein, shall be governed by,
and constructed in accordance with, the laws of England and the parties
irrevocably agree that the courts of England are to have exclusive jurisdiction
to settle any disputes which may arise out of or in connection with this
Agreement and such documents. This Agreement shall take effect as a deed, and is
binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
successors and assigns. If any provision in this Agreement or of any Voting
Trust Certificate shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in
whole or in part, under any enactment or rule of law, such provision or part
shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of this Agreement or of any
Voting Trust Certificate but the legality, validity and enforceability of the
remainder hereof or thereof shall not be affected. If there is a conflict
between the provisions of (i) this Agreement and the Charter of TW UK or (ii)
this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement during the continuance of this
Agreement, the Charter of TW UK or the Purchase Agreement (as the case may be),
it is the intention of the parties (other than the Trustee) in their capacity as
beneficial shareholders of TW UK and UK Parent (as the case may be) that the
provisions of this Agreement shall prevail over the Charter of TW UK and the
Purchase Agreement during such period and accordingly the parties (other than
the Trustee) shall exercise or direct the Trustee to exercise all voting and
other rights and powers available to them so as to give effect to the provisions
of this Agreement and shall further if necessary procure any required amendment
to the Charter Documents.

                               WARRANTIES OF TW UK

        As a material inducement for the Purchasers to enter into this Agreement
and subscribe for the Purchasers' Securities, TW UK hereby warrants to the
Purchasers that the statements contained in this Article IV are correct and
complete as of the date of this Agreement. In this Article IV, where any
statement is qualified by the awareness or knowledge of TW UK or other similar
expression, TW UK shall be deemed to have the knowledge it would have had if it
had made reasonable inquiries to ascertain whether the Warranties in question
were correct in all material respects and not misleading in any material
respect, including reasonable inquiry of the Officers of and such management
personnel of each of the Group Companies as they deemed appropriate.

        4.1 Organization and Qualification; Authority. Each of the Group
Companies is a limited liability company duly incorporated and validly existing
under the laws of England and Wales, has the legal right, full power and
authority to own and lease its properties and carry on its business as presently
conducted, is duly qualified, registered or licensed to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the ownership or leasing of its properties or the
character of its present operations makes such qualification, registration or
licensing necessary, except where the failure so to qualify would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. TW UK has heretofore delivered to the Purchasers
complete and correct copies of the Memorandum and Articles of Association and
any other applicable constitutional documents of the Companies, each as amended
to date and as presently in effect (collectively, with respect to particular
Company, the "Charter Documents").

        4.2 Subsidiaries. UK Parent has no Subsidiaries other than TW UK. Except
as referred to in the Disclosure Letter, TW UK has no Subsidiaries.

        4.3 Licenses.

               (a) Each of the Group Companies has such licenses, franchises,
authorizations, permits, consents, registrations, certificates, approvals,
orders, authorities, exemptions and other rights and privileges as are necessary
to permit it to own its properties and to conduct its business and operations as
presently conducted (individually, a "License" and collectively,


                                       32

<PAGE>




"Licenses"), except where the failure to have such Licenses would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of TW UK, each License was duly and
validly issued by the issuer thereof pursuant to procedures which complied in
all material respects with the requirements of Applicable Law. Each License is
valid and current and each of the Group Companies is, and has been, in
compliance with the terms thereof, with no known conflict with the valid rights
of others, except where non-compliance or the existence of such conflict would
not have a Material Adverse Effect. No event has occurred which permits, or
after notice or lapse of time or both would permit, the revocation, suspension,
material modification or termination of any License, except where such event
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. There is no investigation, inquiry or
proceeding which has been notified to any of the Group Companies or, to the
knowledge of TW UK, threatened which is likely to result in the suspension,
cancellation, material modification, or revocation of any such License. To the
extent necessary, each of the Group Companies has filed all applications for
renewal or extension of the Licenses and any required renewal or extensions have
been granted, except where such non-renewals or non-extensions would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. TW UK does not know of any fact that is likely to
result in the revocation, material modification, non-renewal, cancellation or
suspension of any of the Licenses which would have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (b) The statements set forth in Schedule 4.3(b) with respect to
the Licenses and regulatory consents required by each of the Group Companies
(the "Regulatory Information") are true, correct and complete in all material
respects and not misleading in any material respect, and no fact or matter with
respect to the Group Companies has been omitted from the Regulatory Information
which renders the statements set forth in Schedule 4.3(b) untrue, inaccurate or
misleading in any material respect.

               (c) To the knowledge of TW UK, each of the Relevant Employees and
Contractors has obtained all licenses, authorizations, permits, consents,
registrations, certificates, approvals, exemptions and other rights and
privileges necessary to permit him or her to perform his or her duties as
presently performed (individually, a "Personal License" and collectively,
"Personal Licenses"), except where the failure to have such Personal License
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. To TW UK's knowledge, each Personal
License is valid and current and each of such Persons is in compliance in all
material respects with the terms thereof, with no known conflict with the valid
rights of others, except where non-compliance or the existence of such conflict
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. To TW UK's knowledge, no event has
occurred which is likely to result in the denial of an application or renewal,
or the revocation, material modification, non-renewal or suspension of any of
the Personal Licenses.

execution, delivery and performance by each of the Companies of the Transaction

retire any of its shares except as expressly provided for herein. Except as
contemplated by the Voting Trust Agreement, there are no voting trusts or other
agreements or understandings to which any of the Group Companies is a party with
respect to the voting of its respective shares and there are no Liens on or over
the shares of the Group Companies or any arrangements or obligations to create
any Liens other than Permitted Liens or the Liens contemplated by the Credit
Agreements.

        4.7 Litigation; Compliance with Laws; Breaches. There is no action,
suit, proceeding, investigation, inquiry, under decree, decision or judgment,
which has been notified to any of


                                       34

<PAGE>




the Group Companies or, to the knowledge of TW UK, threatened against or
affecting any of the Group Companies, before or by any court or arbitrator or
any Governmental Entity which (individually or in the aggregate) (i) has
impaired or could reasonably be expected to impair the ability of the Companies
to perform fully on a timely basis any obligation which the Companies have or
will have under any Transaction Document to which the Companies are a party, or
(ii) otherwise has or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse

judgment, decree, order, statute, exemption, injunction, Applicable Laws,
Environmental Law or other governmental regulation, rule or ordinance applicable

come to the attention of the Group Companies since the date of the Financial
Statements which would indicate that the Financial Statements did not present a
true and fair view of the financial position of the Group Companies as of the
respective dates thereof.

        4.18 Intellectual Property. Except as described in the Disclosure
Letter, the Group Companies have ownership of, or license to use, all material
patents, registered and unregistered decision rights, copyright, database
rights, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, get-up or
other proprietary rights, including, without limitation, Know-how (as defined
below), necessary for the operation of the business of the Group Companies and
in any jurisdiction in which the Group Companies conduct business (collectively,
"Intellectual Property"). There are no claims or demands of any other Person
pertaining to any of such Intellectual Property and no proceedings have been
instituted, or notified to any of the Group Companies or, to the knowledge of TW
UK, threatened, which challenge the rights of the Group Companies in respect
thereof. The Group Companies have the right to use, free and clear of claims or
rights of other Persons, all confidential and proprietary industrial and
commercial information and techniques in any form (including, without
limitation, paper, electronically stored data, magnetic media, film and
microfilm), including, without limitation, drawings, formulae, reports, project
reports and testing procedures, institution and training manuals, tables of
operations, market forecasts, lists and particulars of customers and suppliers,
lists, designs, manufacturing, billing systems or other processes, computer
software systems, data compilations, research results and other information
(collectively "Know-how") required to conduct their business as presently


                                       39

conducted or contemplated. In the case of such Intellectual Property that is
registered or the subject of an application for registration, all renewal fees
which are due and steps which are required for their maintenance and protection
have been paid or taken. All of the licenses or other agreements under which the
Group Companies is granted rights in Intellectual Property are in full force and
effect and no notice having been given on either side to terminate them, the
obligations of all parties to such licenses and agreements have been performed
and complied with in all material respects, no disputes have arisen or, to the
knowledge of TW UK, are threatened with respect to the ownership or use of any
Intellectual Property or Know-how.

        The Group Companies have taken all steps considered reasonable by them
to establish and preserve their ownership of Intellectual Property and Know-how.

        To the best of TW UK's knowledge, the present business, activities and
products of the Group Companies do not infringe any Intellectual Property of any
other Person. No proceeding charging the Group Companies with infringement of
any adversely held Intellectual Property is, to the knowledge of TW UK,
threatened. The Group Companies are not making unauthorized use of any
confidential information or trade secrets of any Person, including without
limitation any former employer of any past or present employee of the Group
Companies. No moral rights have been asserted which would affect the use of any
of the Intellectual Property in the business or operations of any of the Group
Companies.

        TW UK and each of its Subsidiaries have each obtained and maintained in
force any registration under the Data Protection Act 1984 necessary and
appropriate in relation to its business and operations. Each of the Group
Companies, with respect to any personal data relating to its business and
operations, at all times, has complied with the Data Protection Principles
contained in Schedule 1 to the Data Protection Act 1984. None of the records,
systems, data or information of any of the Group Companies is recorded, stored,
maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or partially dependent on or held or
accessible by any means, which are no under the ownership and control of the
Group Companies.

        4.19 Taxes. The Group Companies, and any predecessors to the Group
Companies, have filed or obtained extensions of all Tax Returns heretofore
required by law to be filed by any of them and have paid all Taxes shown as due
on such returns in full. All Taxes required by law to be withheld with respect
to Taxes constituting employees' income withholding taxes, have been duly made,
withheld, collected or provided for and have been paid over to the proper
federal, provincial, state, municipal or local authority, or are held by the
applicable Person for such payment. None of the Group Companies, including any
predecessors thereto, has executed or filed with any taxing authority any
agreement or document extending, or having the effect of extending, the period
for assessment or collection of any Taxes. None of the Group Companies is a
party to any tax sharing agreement or arrangement. No audits or investigations
have been notified to any of the Group Companies or, to the knowledge of TW

UK, threatened with respect to any tax returns or taxes of the Group Companies,
or any predecessor thereto.

        4.20 Transactions with Affiliates. Other than as disclosed to the
Purchasers, there are no transactions, agreements or understandings, existing or
presently contemplated between or among the Group Companies and any of their
respective officers or directors or shareholders or any of their respective
Affiliates or associates.

transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, each of the Group
Companies is not Insolvent and there is no Event of Breach or Event of Default.

        4.22 Limitations.

               (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, TW
UK shall be under no liability with respect to any claim under this Article IV
to the extent that the facts giving rise thereto are fairly disclosed in the
Disclosure Letter. No liability shall attached to TW UK with respect to any
claim under this Article IV to the extent that: (i) the claim or the events
giving rise to the claim would not have arisen but for a voluntary act, omission
or transaction of the Purchasers outside the ordinary course of business; (ii)
the claim is based upon a liability which is contingent only, unless and until
such contingent liability becomes an actual liability provided that this
sub-clause shall not operate to avoid a claim made with respect to a contingent
liability within the applicable time limit specified in this Section 4.22; (iii)
provision or reserve with respect to the matter giving rise to the claim shall
have been made, and as of the date of this Agreement shall not have been
released, in the Financial Statements; (iv) the claim occurs out of or the
amount thereof is increased as a result of (A) any increase in the rates of
taxation made after the date hereof; or (B) any change in law or regulation not
actually, or prospectively, in effect at the date of this Agreement; and (v) the
loss or damage giving rise to the claim is recovered by the Purchasers under any
policy of insurance, after deduction of any increase in premium and all expenses
of recovery including, if applicable, taxation costs incurred by the Purchasers
in making the insurance claim.

               (b) TW UK shall be under no liability with respect to any claim
under this Article IV unless written notice of such claim setting out reasonable
details (so far as the same are known to the Purchasers) of the relevant claim
shall have been served upon TW UK by the Purchasers: (i) in the case of a claim
under the warranties (other than those relating to Tax), by no later than 5:00
p.m. on the second anniversary of the date hereof; and (ii) in the case of a
claim under the warranties relating to Tax, by no later than 5:00 p.m. on the
seventh anniversary of the date hereof. The liability of TW UK for any claim
specified in such notice shall cease (unless the amount payable with respect to
a relevant claim has been agreed by TW UK within twelve months of the date of
such written notice) if legal proceedings have not been instituted with respect
to such claim by the service of process on TW UK within twelve months of the
date of such written notice. For purposes of this Section 4.22, legal
proceedings shall


                                       41

<PAGE>




not be deemed to have been commenced unless they shall have been issued and
served upon TW UK.

               (c) TW UK shall be under no liability with respect to any claim
under this Article IV unless and until the aggregate amount of all claims
against TW UK exceed (pounds sterling)250,000, but if liability exceeds that
figure then all claims, including claims previously notified, shall accrue
against TW UK. The aggregate liability of TW UK with respect to all claims under
this Article IV shall not exceed (pounds sterling)22.0 million, plus all
outstanding and accrued interest on the Subordinated Notes and the PIK Notes.

               (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, none
of the limitations set forth in this Section 4.22 shall apply to any claim which
arises or is increased or to the extent to which it arises or is increased or
delayed as a result of fraud, wilful misconduct or wilful concealment by any of
the Group Companies or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
agents.

               (e) The Purchasers shall (i) promptly inform TW UK in writing of
any fact, matter, event or circumstance which comes to their notice whereby it
appears that TW UK are or will be liable to make any payment with respect to any
claim under this Article IV and (ii) subject to the legal privilege and
confidentiality, thereafter keep TW UK informed of all material developments in
relation thereof; provided, however, that the failure of the Purchasers to
comply with this provision shall no in any way prejudice their rights to make a
claim under this Article IV.

               (f) The only remedies available to the Purchasers with respect to
the Warranties set forth in this Article IV shall be for damages for breach of
contract (subject to limitation set out in this Agreement) and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Purchasers shall not have any right to rescind or
terminate this Agreement for breach of contract or for negligent or innocent
misrepresentations or otherwise; provided that the provisions of this Section
4.22(f) shall not (i) exclude any liability which any of the parties would
otherwise have to any other party or any right which any of them may have to
rescind this Agreement in respect of any statements made fraudulently by any of
them prior to the execution of this Agreement or any rights which any of them
may have in respect of fraudulent concealment by any of them or (ii) limit any
of the Purchasers' rights to seek an injunction against a violation of any
breach of the covenants set forth in Article IX hereof.

               (g) In the event that TW UK at any time after the date hereof
shall wish to take out insurance against their liability hereunder, the
Purchasers undertake (subject to any concerns that they may have regarding
confidentiality) to provide such information, at the cost of TW UK, as the
prospective insurer may reasonably require before effecting such insurance.

               (h) The Purchasers hereby acknowledge that they have not entered
into this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents in reliance on any
warranty, except the Warranties.

               (i) In assessing any liabilities, damages or other amounts
recoverable by the Purchasers as a result of any claims under this Article IV,
there shall be taken into account any Taxes for which the claiming Purchaser is
liable in respect of the same or any Tax Benefit to the claiming Purchaser so
that the Purchaser is in no better and no worse position after such Tax than he,
she or it would have been had no claim arisen under this Article IV. For
purposes of this Section 4.22(i), "Tax Benefit" shall mean (i) an amount equal
to the cash value of the amount by which the Taxes payable by a Purchaser are
actually reduced simultaneously with or immediately prior to the liabilities,
damages or other amounts incurred by such Purchaser or (ii) an amount equal to
any cash refund such Purchaser receives in the taxable period in which such
liability, damage or amount was incurred or in a prior relevant taxable period;
provided, however, that any such amount will not be included in this
determination if it is subject to forfeiture in future periods; and, provided,
further that any such amount shall be adjusted for any Tax detriment established
to be associated with the payment of any liabilities or damages hereunder.


                                    ARTICLE V

                                   ARTICLE VI
                               REDEMPTION OF NOTES

        6.1 Optional Redemption of Subordinated Notes by UK Parent.

               (a) The Subordinated Notes may be redeemed by UK Parent at its
option, in whole, but not in part, at the Subordinated Note Redemption Price,
subject to the Purchasers' Exercise Right, after the later to occur of (i) the
third anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) payment in full of the Bank
Indebtedness and the Mezzanine Debt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, UK Parent
shall not have the right to redeem the Subordinated Notes unless and until
either (i) TW UK consummates a Qualified Public Offering or (ii) a Qualified
Public Value is achieved. In the event UK Parent elects to redeem the
Subordinated Notes pursuant to this Section 6.1(a), it shall promptly notify the
Purchasers and TW UK in writing of such proposed redemption. The Purchasers will
have the right (which right if exercised, will take priority over UK Parent's
right of redemption) to exercise the Warrants, in whole or in part, at any time
on or before the redemption date (such date shall be referred to herein as the
"Redemption Date") of the Subordinated Notes by tendering cash or Subordinated
Notes in the appropriate principal amount to satisfy the exercise price of the
Warrants to TW UK in exchange for (A) the Ordinary Shares issuable pursuant to
the exercise of the Warrants and (B) a cash payment from TW UK equal to all
accrued and unpaid interest on the tendered Subordinated Notes as of the date of
such tender (the "Purchasers' Exercise Right"). In the event that any Purchaser
elects to exercise any Warrants by tendering Subordinated Notes, UK Parent shall
cause TW UK to, and TW UK shall, issue to such Purchaser the Ordinary Shares
issuable upon exercise of his, her or its Warrants and pay the cash amount
referred to in clause (B) in the foregoing sentence; provided, however, that if
for any reason such cash payment is not paid by TW UK, it will remain the sole
and absolute obligation of UK Parent to pay such accrued and unpaid interest.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that any
Purchaser elects to exercise any Warrants by tendering cash, UK Parent shall
have the right, at its option, to redeem from such Purchaser the aggregate
principal amount of Subordinated Notes held by such Purchaser equal to the
number of Warrants so exercised multiplied by the Warrant Exercise Price.

               (b) If the Purchasers do not exercise some or all of the Warrants
prior to the Redemption Date, subject to and upon actual receipt by the
Purchasers of payment in full in cash of the Subordinated Note Redemption Price
and the PIK Note Redemption Price (as provided in Section 6.4), the Warrants
shall automatically lapse without further action by UK Parent or TW UK.

               (c) The "Subordinated Note Redemption Price" shall mean a price
equal to the principal amount of the Subordinated Notes outstanding plus any and
all accrued and unpaid interest on the Subordinated Notes up to and including
the Redemption Date.

        6.2 Mandatory Redemption of Mirror Notes.


                                       44

<PAGE>




               (a) Upon written notice to TW UK of UK Parent's election to
redeem the Subordinated Notes pursuant to Section 6.1(a) above, TW UK shall,
immediately prior to such redemption by UK Parent, redeem the Mirror Notes at
the Mirror Note Redemption Price. UK Parent shall use the funds it receives from
such redemption of the Mirror Notes to redeem the Subordinated Notes.

               (b) "Mirror Note Redemption Price" shall mean, with respect to
the Mirror Notes being redeemed, a price equal to the principal amount of the
Mirror Notes outstanding plus any and all accrued and unpaid interest on the
Mirror Notes up to and including the Redemption Date.

        6.3 Optional Redemption of PIK Notes by UK Parent. If permitted under
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or anytime after the Bank Indebtedness
and the Mezzanine Indebtedness have been paid in full, the PIK Notes shall be
subject to redemption by UK Parent at its option, in whole or in part, at any
time after issuance thereof at the PIK Note Redemption Price. The "PIK Note
Redemption Price" shall mean the aggregate principal amount of the PIK Notes
called for redemption by UK Parent, plus a cash payment equal to the sum of any
and all accrued and unpaid interest on the PIK Notes to be redeemed up to and
including the date of redemption. If less than all outstanding PIK Notes are to
be redeemed, UK Parent may select specific PIK Notes for redemption in its sole
discretion.

        6.4 Mandatory Redemption of PIK Notes. Upon any optional redemption of
the Subordinated Notes by UK Parent pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof, UK Parent
shall be obligated, on such Redemption Date, to redeem all outstanding PIK Notes
at the PIK Note Redemption Price.

        6.5 Mandatory Redemption of Mirror PIK Notes. Upon written notice to TW
UK of UK Parent's election to redeem any PIK Notes pursuant to Section 6.3 above
or upon a mandatory PIK Note redemption pursuant to Section 6.4 above, TW UK
shall, immediately prior to such redemption by UK Parent, redeem the Mirror PIK
Notes, at the Mirror PIK Note Redemption Price. UK Parent shall use the funds it
receives from such redemption of the Mirror PIK Notes to redeem the PIK Notes.
The "Mirror PIK Note Redemption Price" shall mean, with respect to the Mirror
PIK Notes being redeemed, the aggregate principal amount of such Mirror PIK
Notes plus a cash payment equal to the sum of any and all accrued and unpaid
interest on such Mirror PIK Notes.

        6.6 Redemption Procedures for Subordinated Notes and PIK Notes. The
election of UK Parent to redeem Subordinated Notes or PIK Notes pursuant to
Section 6.1(a) or 6.3 hereof shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution. Notice of
redemption of the Subordinated Notes or any of the PIK Notes ("Redemption
Securities") shall be mailed, at UK Parent's expense, not less than thirty (30)
nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Purchaser
with a copy to TW UK, at its address appearing on the signature page hereto. All
notices of redemption shall include the following information: (1) the
Redemption


                                       45

<PAGE>




Date; (2) the Redemption Price for the Redemption Securities and the amount of
unpaid and accrued interest on such Redemption Securities as of the Redemption
Date; (3) the place or places where such Redemption Securities are to be
surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price; (4) that the Purchasers may
exercise the Warrants prior to the Redemption Date of the Subordinated Notes;
and (5) a copy of the Board Resolution, certified by the Secretary of UK Parent.

        6.7 Deposit of Subordinated Note and PIK Note Redemption Price. Prior to
any Redemption Date with respect to the Subordinated Notes or any PIK Note, UK
Parent shall deposit with a paying agent, or into a segregated account of UK
Parent, an amount of money sufficient to pay the Subordinated Note Redemption
Price and PIK Note Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall
be an Interest Payment Date, in which case, UK Parent shall pay the interest due
as of such Interest Payment Date in cash on the Redemption Date) any and all
accrued and unpaid interest on all the Subordinated Notes and any of the PIK
Notes which are to be redeemed. The Purchasers' obligation to tender the
Subordinated Notes or the PIK Notes called for redemption by UK Parent or the
exercise of the Purchasers' Exercise Right shall not arise until such time as
sufficient funds have been deposited to pay the Subordinated Note Redemption
Price and the PIK Note Redemption Price for the Redemption Securities to be
redeemed.

        6.8 Redemption Securities Payable on Redemption Date. Notice of
redemption having been given as provided in Section 6.6 hereof, the Redemption
Securities to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable
at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless
UK Parent shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and any unpaid
and accrued interest) such Redemption Securities shall cease to bear interest
and any other rights shall cease, other than the right to receive the payment of
the Redemption Price, whether pursuant to this Agreement, the instrument
representing the Redemption Securities or otherwise. Upon surrender of any such
Redemption Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such
Redemption Security shall be paid by UK Parent at the applicable Redemption
Price, together with any unpaid and accrued interest up to and including the
Redemption Date. If any Redemption Security called for redemption by UK Parent
shall not be paid upon surrender thereof by the Purchasers for the Redemption
Price, the principal and interest, until paid, shall bear interest from the
Redemption Date at the rate borne by the Redemption Security. Interest shall
cease to run on any Redemption Security not validly tendered in accordance with
the notice of redemption and no interest shall accrue on any amount payable
thereon.

        6.9 Payment of Mirror Note and Mirror PIK Note Redemption Price. Upon
the mailing of a notice pursuant to Section 6.6 hereof, TW UK promptly shall
deliver to UK Parent cash sufficient to pay the Mirror Note Redemption Price and
the Mirror PIK Note Redemption Price on the Redemption Date in accordance with
the terms of this Article VI such as to allow UK Parent to deposit the amounts
required by Section 6.7 hereof.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                                  PUT OF NOTES

        7.1 Put of Subordinated Notes and PIK Notes Pursuant to Purchasers'
Election. The Subordinated Notes and the PIK Notes, subject to the terms and
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, shall be subject to redemption, in
whole or in part, at the Subordinated Note Redemption Price and the PIK Note
Redemption Price at the option of a Majority in Interest of the Purchasers
("Purchasers' Put") upon and after the occurrence of a Put Event; provided,
however, that the Purchasers' Put cannot be exercised on more than three (3)
separate occasions or for an aggregate Subordinated Note Redemption Price plus
PIK Note Redemption Price equal to less than (i) (pounds sterling)5.0 million on
any occasion or (ii) 100% of the remaining Subordinated Notes and PIK Notes
outstanding at the time if exercise of the Purchasers' Put would result in less
than (pounds sterling)5.0 million in the aggregate remaining outstanding.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchasers may not elect such redemption
unless they also exercise their right to require UK Parent to purchase the
Warrants pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof. The date on which such Put Event occurs
is referred to as the "Put Event Trigger Date." A "Put Event" shall mean, with
respect to the Subordinated Notes and the PIK Notes elected to be redeemed ("Put
Securities"): (1) any Liquidity Event; or (2) a date subsequent to the eighth
anniversary of the Closing Date if the Bank Indebtedness and the Mezzanine
Indebtedness have been paid in full on or before such date.

        7.2 Put Offer Procedures. Within five (5) Business Days after UK Parent
becomes aware of the occurrence of a Put Event and in any event not later than
the Put Event Trigger Date, UK Parent shall mail a notice (the "Offer") to each
of the Purchasers notifying them that the Subordinated Notes and the PIK Notes
will be redeemable at the election of the Purchasers in accordance with this
Article VII. If a Majority in Interest of the Purchasers elect to exercise their
redemption rights pursuant to this Article VII, they shall give notice to UK
Parent setting forth the amount of Put Securities to be redeemed and the
redemption date shall be the earlier of (i) a date selected by UK Parent, but
not be later than 30 days from the date such notice is given, or (ii) if such
notice relates to a Liquidity Event and is given prior to the occurrence of the
Liquidity Event, the date of completion of the Liquidity Event (the "Purchase
Date"). An election to exercise redemption rights pursuant to this Article VII
in connection with a Liquidity Event shall in all circumstances be conditional
upon the completion of the Liquidity Event and no obligation to redeem Put
Securities shall arise if the Liquidity Event cannot be completed. In the event
of a Purchaser's Put exercised with respect to a Liquidity Event, the Purchaser
will be entitled to withdraw his or its election to tender the Put Securities by
delivering to UK Parent, not later than the close of business on the second
Business Day preceding the Purchase Date, a telegram, telex, facsimile
transmission or letter to that effect. Any Subordinated Note or PIK Note not
tendered in accordance with this Section 7.2 will continue to accrue interest.
Upon a Purchaser's election to tender any Put Securities, the Purchasers will be
required to surrender such Put Securities with a form requiring redemption
completed to UK Parent at the address specified in the signature page hereto
prior to the close of business on the Business Day preceding the Purchase Date.
On the Purchase Date, UK


                                       47

<PAGE>




Parent will redeem the Put Securities tendered for cash in an amount equal to
the aggregate principal amount of all Subordinated Notes and PIK Notes tendered
for redemption plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to and including
the Purchase Date. If not all of the Put Securities can be redeemed by UK Parent
for any reason, UK Parent shall select, on or prior to the Purchase Date, the
specific Put Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed pro rata among the
Purchasers and interest shall continue to accrue on all Subordinated Notes and
PIK Notes not redeemed; provided, however, that nothing in this Article VII
shall be deemed a waiver or contractual impairment of the right of the
Purchasers to have all Put Securities redeemed in full pursuant to Section 7.1
and UK Parent shall not be relieved of its obligation to redeem any unredeemed
Put Securities in full. Promptly after the Purchase Date UK Parent shall, with
respect to any Put Securities not redeemed in whole, return to the appropriate
Purchaser the unredeemed Put Securities or a new Subordinated Note or PIK Note,
as the case may be, equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the
Put Securities, as the case may be.

        7.3 Mandatory Redemption of Mirror Notes and Mirror PIK Notes. Upon
written notice to TW UK of UK Parent's redemption of the Put Securities and the
accompanying purchase by UK Parent of the Warrants referred to in Section 7.1
above (which notice UK Parent will be required to serve as soon as possible), TW
UK shall, immediately prior to such redemption and/or purchase by UK Parent,
redeem the Mirror Notes and the Mirror PIK Notes, at the Mirror Note Redemption
Price and the Mirror PIK Note Redemption Price, respectively. UK Parent shall
use the funds it receives from such redemption of the Mirror Notes and the
Mirror PIK Notes to redeem the Subordinated Notes and the PIK Notes tendered by
the Purchasers and accepted for redemption by UK Parent.

        7.4 Obligations of UK Parent and TW UK Upon Purchasers' Put. Prior to
the Purchase Date in connection with a Liquidity Event, UK Parent will, and UK
Parent shall cause TW UK to, in good faith seek to obtain any required consent
of the holders of the Bank Indebtedness and/or Mezzanine Indebtedness the terms
of which prohibit UK Parent from redeeming the Subordinated Notes or PIK Notes,
as the case may be, or TW UK from redeeming the Mirror Notes or the Mirror PIK
Notes, as the case may be, so as to permit the making of the Offer and the
redemption of all Put Securities pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof, including
repayment out of the proceeds of such Liquidity Event of all Obligations under
such Bank Indebtedness and/or Mezzanine Indebtedness to the extent necessary to
permit the making of the Offer and the redemption of Subordinated Notes and PIK
Notes pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof.

        7.5 Redemption Prohibited. Subject to compliance with Section 7.4
hereof, if, at a Purchase Date, UK Parent is prohibited under Applicable Laws or
under any other contractual or other arrangement, including, without limitation,
the Credit Agreements or the Intercreditor Agreement, or other legal restriction
whatsoever from redeeming all Subordinated Notes and PIK Notes for which
redemption is elected hereunder pursuant to the Purchasers' Put, then UK Parent
shall redeem such Subordinated Notes and PIK Notes to the extent permissible and
shall redeem


                                       48

<PAGE>




the remaining Subordinated Notes or PIK Notes to be redeemed as soon as UK
Parent is not so prohibited. UK Parent shall use all reasonable endeavors to
take such action as shall be necessary or appropriate to review and promptly
remove any impediment to its ability to redeem the Subordinated Notes and PIK
Notes under the circumstances contemplated by Section 7.1 hereof other than the
Credit Agreements and the Intercreditor Agreement; provided, however, that this
provision shall not require the repayment of Designated Indebtedness other then
upon the occurrence of a Liquidity Event. In the event that UK Parent fails for
any reason to redeem any Subordinated Notes or PIK Notes for which redemption is
required pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof, then during the period from the
applicable Purchase Date through to the date on which such Subordinated Notes or
PIK Notes are redeemed the Subordinated Notes and PIK Notes which remain
outstanding and shall continue to accrue interest at the rate provided therein,
plus two percent (2%). Nothing in this Section 7.5 shall impair or be deemed to
limit, modify or affect the rights of the Purchasers (unless otherwise
restricted, including, without limitation, under the Intercreditor Agreement) to
pursue any available remedy, at law or in equity, to enforce or seek to enforce,
in any manner whatsoever, UK Parent's obligations under this Article VII,
including without limitation filing any suit or complaint or seeking to file a
suit or complaint with any court of competent jurisdiction to obtain injunctive
or other equitable relief and/or damages arising from a breach of UK Parent's
obligation to redeem the Subordinated Notes and the PIK Notes and enforcing any
judgment obtained in any such suit in any manner available under Applicable Law
to judgment creditors in general.

        7.6 Failure of UK Parent and TW UK to Honor Purchasers' Put. In the
event that UK Parent fails to perform in full its obligations following the
Purchasers' election to exercise the Purchasers' Put pursuant to Section 7.1
hereof and TW UK fails to perform its obligations as a guarantor of such
obligations pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof, then a Majority in Interest of the
Purchasers shall have the right, at their or its option, to: (i) exercise the
Purchaser's Put against TW UK to the same extent and with the same effect as
such exercise against UK Parent and TW UK hereby agrees that it shall be fully
bound by this Article VII as if it were UK Parent, except that (A) to the extent
that any deductions and withholdings on account of Taxes are required under
Applicable Law or of any Taxes imposed on any Purchaser as a result of failure
of UK Parent to fulfill its obligations under Section 7.1 above and TW UK to
fulfill its obligations under Section 7.7 below which would not have been
required had no such failure occurred and taking into account all such Taxes
(unless such failure was directly attributable to a prohibition against such
fulfillment by UK Parent or TW UK, as the case may be, under Applicable Law),
the Subordinated Note Redemption Price and PIK Note Redemption Price shall be
increased, as may be necessary, so that after making all such deductions and
withholdings and taking into account all such Taxes (whether applicable to the
original redemption price payable or to additional sums payable under this
Section 7.6 and taking into account all Taxes on and arising by reason of the
payment of additional sums payable under this Section 7.6), the Purchasers
receive an amount equal to the sum that it would have received had no such
deductions or withholdings been made or Taxes imposed, (B) the Companies shall
make required deductions or withholdings, and (C) the Companies shall pay the
full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing or other Governmental
Entity; or


                                       49

<PAGE>




(ii) exercise directly through instructions to the Trustee under the Voting
Trust Agreement the "drag-along rights" set forth in the Charter Documents of TW
UK without any requirement that the Board of Directors of UK Parent or TW UK
first take any action and, on such election by a Majority in Interest of the
Purchasers, all of the parties hereto undertake to take all such action and give
all such instructions as may be necessary to effect in full such drag-along
rights.

        7.7 TW UK Guaranty.

               (a) TW UK hereby unconditionally, irrevocably and absolutely
guarantees payment in full of the obligations of UK Parent to the Purchasers
upon the election of the Purchasers to exercise the Purchasers' Put with respect
to the Subordinated Notes and the PIK Notes. To the extent that UK Parent
defaults on such obligations, TW UK shall be absolutely and unconditionally
obligated to pay the Subordinated Note Redemption Price and the PIK Note
Redemption Price in immediately available funds in full on the Purchase Date and
shall not be entitled to set off any claim of any kind which UK Parent or TW UK
may have against anyone whether arising under or by reason of this Agreement,
the other Transaction Documents or for any other reason of any kind. In the
event that the Purchasers shall not for any reason receive on the Purchase Date
the full payment of the Subordinated Note Redemption Price and the PIK Note
Redemption Price, including, without limitation, any accrued and unpaid
interest, for the Subordinated Notes and/or the PIK Notes being redeemed, then
in any proceeding instituted by the Purchasers, no defense by TW UK to its
obligation to pay the Subordinated Note Redemption Price and the PIK Note
Redemption Price, whether by counterclaim, affirmative defense or new matter,
that is not also available to UK Parent with respect to the primary obligation
to redeem the Put Securities, shall be interposed or shall be of any force or
effect, said defenses being waived for purposes of such proceeding.

               (b) Subject to compliance in full with this Article VII by the
Purchasers, TW UK waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension
or accrual of any component of the Subordinated Note Redemption Price and the
PIK Note Redemption Price and notice of or proof of reliance by the Purchasers
upon this Section 7.7 or acceptance of this Section 7.7; the obligation to pay
the Subordinated Note Redemption Price and the PIK Note Redemption Price shall
conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred in reliance
upon this Section 7.7; and all dealings between UK Parent or TW UK, on the one
hand, and the Purchasers, on the other, shall likewise be conclusively presumed
to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Section 7.7. TW UK waives
diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or
nonpayment to or upon TW UK with respect to the Subordinated Note Redemption
Price and the PIK Note Redemption Price. TW UK's obligations under this Section
7.7 shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of
payment to pay the Subordinated Note Redemption Price and the PIK Note
Redemption Price and shall not be diminished or impaired by (i) any defense,
set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment) which may at any time
be available to or be asserted by UK Parent or TW UK against the Purchasers, or
(ii) any other circumstance


                                       50

<PAGE>




whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of UK Parent or TW UK) which
constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal
discharge of UK Parent from the obligation to pay the entire Subordinated Note
Redemption Price and the PIK Note Redemption Price, or of TW UK under this
Section 7.7, on the occurrence of any Insolvency Proceedings or in any other
instance.

               (c) This Section 7.7 shall continue to be effective, or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of
any of the Subordinated Note Redemption Price and the PIK Note Redemption Price
is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Purchasers upon
the occurrence of any Insolvency Proceedings relating to UK Parent or upon or as
a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or
trustee or similar officer for, UK Parent or any substantial part of its
property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

               (d) Any provision of this Section 7.7 which is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

               (e) No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the
part of the Purchasers, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as
a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Purchasers of any right
or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any
right or remedy which the Purchaser would otherwise have on any future occasion.
The rights and remedies provided in this Section 7.7 are cumulative, may be
exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by law.


                                  ARTICLE VIII
                       PUT OF WARRANTS AND WARRANT SHARES

        8.1 Put of Warrants. The Warrants, subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, shall be subject to purchase by UK Parent, in whole or
in part, at the Warrant Purchase Price, at the option of a Majority in Interest
of the Purchasers ("Purchasers' Warrant Put") upon and after the occurrence of a
Warrant Put Event; provided, however, that the Purchasers' Warrant Put cannot be
exercised on more than three (3) separate occasions or for an aggregate Warrant
Purchase Price equal to less than (i) (pounds sterling)5.0 million on any
occasion or (ii) 100% of the remaining Warrants outstanding at the time if
exercise of the Purchasers' Warrant Put would result in less than (pounds
sterling)5.0 million of Warrant Purchase Price being owed with respect to all
remaining outstanding Warrants in the aggregate. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Purchasers may not elect such purchase unless they also exercise their right
to require UK


                                       51

<PAGE>




Parent to redeem Subordinated Notes pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof having a
principal amount equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Warrants the
subject of the Purchasers's Warrant Put, and in such event UK Parent shall be
required to redeem such Subordinated Notes in the manner provided in Article VII
hereof and TW UK shall be required to redeem the Mirror Notes in the manner
provided in Article VII hereof. The date on which such Warrant Put Event occurs
is referred to as the "Warrant Put Event Trigger Date." A "Warrant Put Event"
shall mean, with respect to the Warrants elected to be purchased by the
Purchasers, (i) any Liquidity Event, (ii) a date subsequent to the eighth
anniversary of the Closing Date if the Bank Indebtedness and the Mezzanine
Indebtedness have been paid in full on or before such date or (iii) a date
subsequent to the Stated Maturity of the Subordinated Notes. The "Warrant
Purchase Price" shall be equal to: (i) the Fair Market Value of the Ordinary
Shares which the Purchasers have the right to acquire upon exercise of the
Warrants which are the subject of the Purchasers' Warrant Put, minus (ii) the
product of (x) the exercise price of each Warrant, as provided therein,
multiplied by (y) the number of Ordinary Shares which correspond to the Warrants
for which such Purchasers' Warrant Put is exercised.

        8.2 Warrant Put Offer Procedures. Within five (5) Business Days after UK
Parent becomes aware of the occurrence of a Warrant Put Event and in any event
not later than the Warrant Put Event Trigger Date, UK Parent shall mail a notice
(the "Warrant Put Offer") to each of the Purchasers notifying them that the
Warrants and Subordinated Notes will be purchased and redeemed, respectively, at
the election of the Purchasers in accordance with this Article VIII. If a
Majority in Interest of the Purchasers elect to exercise their redemption rights
pursuant to this Article VIII, they shall give notice to UK Parent setting forth
the number of Warrants to be purchased and the aggregate amount of Subordinated
Notes to be redeemed and the purchase date shall be the earlier of (i) a date
selected by UK Parent, but not later than 30 days from the date such notice is
given, or (ii) if such notice relates to a Liquidity Event and is given prior to
the occurrence of the Liquidity Event, the date of completion of the Liquidity
Event (the "Warrant Purchase Date"). An election to exercise purchase and
redemption rights pursuant to this Article VIII in connection with a Liquidity
Event shall in all circumstances be conditional upon the completion of the
Liquidity Event and no obligation to purchase or redeem, as the case may be,
Purchasers' Securities shall arise if the Liquidity Event cannot be completed.
In the event a Warrant Put is exercised with respect to a Liquidity Event, the
Purchasers will be entitled to withdraw their election to tender the Warrants
and the Subordinated Notes by delivering to UK Parent, not later than the close
of business on the second Business Day preceding the Warrant Purchase Date, a
telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter to that effect. Upon a
Purchaser's election to tender any Warrant or Subordinated Note, the Purchaser
will be required to surrender such Warrant and Subordinated Note with a form
requiring purchase and redemption completed to UK Parent at the address
specified in the signature page hereto prior to the close of business on the
Business Day preceding the Warrant Purchase Date. On the Warrant Purchase Date,
UK Parent will (i) purchase the Warrants tendered pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof
for cash in an amount equal to the aggregate Warrant Purchase Price for all
Warrants tendered for purchase and (ii) redeem the Subordinated Notes tendered
pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof for cash in an amount equal to


                                       52

<PAGE>




the aggregate Subordinated Note Redemption Price for all Subordinated Notes
tendered for redemption. If not all of the Warrants and Subordinated Notes
tendered pursuant to a Warrant Put Offer can be purchased or redeemed,
respectively, by UK Parent for any reason, UK Parent shall select, on or prior
to the Warrant Put Date, the Warrants and Subordinated Notes (or portions
thereof, provided, that, UK Parent shall select for purchase the same proportion
of the Warrants as Subordinated Notes) to be purchased and redeemed, as the case
may be, pro rata among the Purchasers and interest shall continue to accrue on
all Subordinated Notes not redeemed, provided, however, that nothing in this
Article VIII shall be deemed a waiver or contractual impairment of the right of
the Purchasers to have all Warrants purchased and all Subordinated Notes
redeemed in full pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof and UK Parent shall not be
relieved of its obligations to purchase unpurchased Warrants and redeem
unredeemed Subordinated Notes in full. Promptly after the Warrant Put Date, UK
Parent shall, with respect to any Warrants and Subordinated Notes not purchased
or redeemed, respectively, in whole, return to the appropriate Purchaser, the
unpurchased Warrants and the unredeemed Subordinated Notes or a new Warrant
certificate and Subordinated Note, as the case may be, equal in number and
principal amount, as the case may be, to the unpurchased portion of the tendered
Warrants and unredeemed portion of the tendered Subordinated Notes.

        8.3 Put of Ordinary Shares; Share Put Offer Procedures.

               (a) The Ordinary Shares issued to the Purchasers upon exercise of
the Warrants, subject to the terms and provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, shall be subject to purchase by UK Parent, in whole or in part, at
the Share Purchase Price, at the option of a Majority in Interest of the
Purchasers ("Purchasers' Share Put") upon and after the occurrence of a Share
Put Event; provided, however, that the Purchasers' Share Put cannot be exercised
on more than three (3) separate occasions or for an aggregate Share Purchase
Price equal to less than (i) (pounds sterling)5.0 million on any occasion or
(ii) 100% of the remaining Ordinary Shares held by the Purchasers at the time if
exercise of the Purchasers' Share Put would result in less than (pounds
sterling)5.0 million of Share Purchase Price being owed with respect to all
Ordinary Shares which are the subject of the Purchasers' Share Put held by the
Purchasers in the aggregate. In the event the Purchasers exercise the
Purchasers' Share Put, UK Parent shall be required to purchase such Ordinary
Shares in the manner provided in this Article VIII. The date on which a Share
Put Event occurs is referred to as the "Share Put Event Trigger Date." A "Share
Put Event" shall mean (i) any Liquidity Event or (ii) if TW UK has not
consummated a Qualified Public Offering and the Qualified Public Value has not
been achieved, the earlier of (A) a date subsequent to the eighth anniversary of
the Closing Date if the Bank Indebtedness and the Mezzanine Indebtedness have
been paid in full, on or before such date or (B) a date subsequent to the Stated
Maturity of the Subordinated Notes. The "Share Purchase Price" shall be equal to
the Fair Market Value of the Ordinary Shares which are the subject of the
Purchasers' Share Put.

               (b) Within five (5) Business Days after UK Parent becomes aware
of the occurrence of a Share Put Event and in any event not later than the Share
Put Event Trigger Date, UK Parent shall mail a notice (the "Share Put Offer") to
each of the Purchasers,


                                       53

<PAGE>




notifying them that the Ordinary Shares which are the subject of the Purchasers'
Share Put will be purchased at the election of the Purchasers in accordance with
this Article VIII. If a Majority in Interest of the Purchasers elect to exercise
their purchase rights pursuant to this Article VIII, they shall give notice to
UK Parent setting forth the amount of Ordinary Shares to be purchased and the
purchase date shall be the earlier of (i) a date selected by UK Parent, but not
later than 30 day from the date such notice is given, or (ii) if such notice
relates to a Liquidity Event and is given prior to the occurrence of the
Liquidity Event, the date of completion of the Liquidity Event (the "Share Put
Purchase Date"). An election to exercise purchase rights pursuant to this
Article VIII in connection with a Liquidity Event shall in all circumstances be
conditional upon the completion of the Liquidity Event and no obligation to
purchase Ordinary Shares shall arise if the Liquidity Event cannot be completed.
In the event a Purchasers' Share Put is exercised with respect to a Liquidity
Event, the Purchasers will be entitled to withdraw their election to tender the
Ordinary Shares by delivering to UK Parent, not later than the close of business
on the second Business Day preceding the Share Put Purchase Date, a telegram,
telex, facsimile transmission or letter to that effect. Upon a Purchaser's
election to tender any Ordinary Shares, the Purchaser will be required to
surrender such Ordinary Shares with a form requiring purchase completed, to UK
Parent at the address specified in the signature page hereto prior to the close
of business on the Business Day preceding the Share Put Purchase Date. On the
Share Put Purchase Date UK Parent will purchase the Ordinary Shares tendered for
cash in an amount equal to the aggregate Share Purchase Price for all the
Ordinary Shares tendered for purchase. If not all of the Ordinary Shares can be
purchased by UK Parent for any reason, UK Parent shall select, on or prior to
the Share Put Purchase Date, the specific Ordinary Shares or portions thereof to
be purchased pro rata among the Purchasers; provided, however, that nothing in
this Article VIII shall be deemed a waiver or contractual impairment of the
right of the Purchasers to have all Ordinary Shares which are the subject of the
Purchasers' Share Put purchased in full pursuant to Section 8.3(a) hereof and UK
Parent shall not be relieved of its obligations to purchase unpurchased Ordinary
Shares in full. Promptly after the Share Put Purchase Date, UK Parent shall,
with respect to any Ordinary Shares which are the subject of the Purchasers'
Share Put not redeemed in whole, return to the appropriate Purchaser the
unpurchased Ordinary Shares or a new Ordinary Share certificate equal in number
to the unpurchased portion of the tendered Ordinary Shares.

        8.4 Mandatory Redemption of Mirror Notes. Upon written notice to TW UK
of UK Parent's purchase of (i) the Warrants and accompanying redemption of the
Subordinated Notes pursuant to Section 8.1 above and (ii) the Ordinary Shares
pursuant to Section 8.3 above (which notice UK Parent will be required to serve
as soon as practical), TW UK shall, immediately prior to such purchase and
redemption by UK Parent, redeem the Mirror Notes. UK Parent shall use the funds
it receives from such redemption of the Mirror Notes to purchase the Warrants
accepted for purchase by UK Parent and redeem the Subordinated Notes or PIK
Notes tendered by the Purchasers and accepted for redemption by UK Parent
pursuant to Section 8.2 hereof or to purchase the Ordinary Shares tendered by
the Purchasers and accepted for purchase by UK Parent pursuant to Section 8.3
hereof.


                                       54

<PAGE>




        8.5 Obligations of UK Parent and TW UK Upon Purchasers' Put. Prior to
the Warrant Purchase Date or the Share Purchase Date, as the case may be, in
connection with a Liquidity Event, UK Parent will, and UK Parent shall cause TW
UK, in good faith, to seek to obtain any required consent of the holders of the
Bank Indebtedness and/or the Mezzanine Indebtedness the terms of which prohibit
UK Parent from purchasing the Warrants or the Ordinary Shares, as the case may
be, so as to permit the making of the Warrant Put Offer or the Share Put Offer
and the purchasing of the Warrants and accompanying redemption of the
Subordinated Notes pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof and the Ordinary Shares
pursuant to Section 8.3 hereof, respectively, including repayment out of the
proceeds of such Liquidity Event of all Obligations under such Bank Indebtedness
and/or Mezzanine Indebtedness to the extent necessary to permit the making of
the Warrant Put Offer or the Share Put Offer and the purchase of Warrants and
accompanying redemption of the Subordinated Notes pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof
or the purchase of the Ordinary Shares pursuant to Section 8.3 hereof,
respectively.

        8.6 Warrant Put or Share Put Prohibited. Subject to compliance with
Section 8.5 hereof, if, at a Warrant Put Purchase Date or a Share Put Purchase
Date, as the case may be, UK Parent is prohibited under Applicable Laws or under
any other contractual or other arrangement, including, without limitation, the
Credit Agreements or the Intercreditor Agreement, or other legal restriction
whatsoever from purchasing all Warrants or Ordinary Shares for which purchase is
elected hereunder pursuant to the Purchasers' Warrant Put or the Purchasers'
Share Put, as the case may be, then UK Parent shall purchase such Warrants or
Ordinary Shares, as the case may be, to the extent permissible and shall
purchase the remaining Warrants or Ordinary Shares as the case may be, as soon
as UK Parent is not so prohibited. UK Parent shall use all reasonable endeavors
to take such action as shall be necessary or appropriate to review and promptly
remove any impediment to its ability to purchase the Warrants or the Ordinary
Shares under the circumstances contemplated by Section 8.1 hereof or 8.3 hereof,
respectively, other than the Credit Agreements and the Intercreditor Agreement;
provided, however, that this provision shall not require the repayment of
Designated Indebtedness other then upon the occurrence of a Liquidity Event. In
the event that UK Parent fails for any reason to purchase any Warrants or
Ordinary Shares for which purchase is required pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof or
Section 8.3 hereof, then (i) the Purchasers shall have the right to revoke their
exercises of the Purchasers' Warrant Put or the Purchasers' Share Put at any
time and (ii) if the Purchasers do not elect to so revoke such exercise, during
the period from the applicable Warrant Put Purchase Date through to the date on
which such Warrants are purchased or from the applicable Share Put Purchase Date
through to the date on which such Ordinary Shares are purchased, UK Parent shall
pay, in addition to such amounts due pursuant to exercise of the Purchasers'
Warrant Put or the Purchasers' Share Put, as the case may be, to the Purchasers
an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the Warrant Purchase Price for any of the
Warrants not purchased hereunder or the Share Purchase Price for any of the
Ordinary Shares not purchased hereunder, as the case may be. Nothing in this
Section 8.6 shall impair or be deemed to limit, modify or affect the rights of
the Purchasers (unless otherwise restricted, including, without limitation,
under the Intercreditor Agreement) to pursue any available remedy, at law or in
equity,


                                       55

<PAGE>




to enforce or seek to enforce, in any manner whatsoever, UK Parent's obligations
under this Article VIII, including without limitation filing any suit or
complaint or seeking to file a suit or complaint with any court of competent
jurisdiction to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief and/or damages
arising from a breach of UK Parent's obligation to purchase the Warrants or the
Ordinary Shares and enforcing any judgment obtained in any such suit in any
manner available under Applicable Law to judgment creditors in general.

        8.7 Failure of UK Parent and TW UK to Honor Purchasers' Warrant Put or
Share Put. In the event that UK Parent fails to perform in full its obligations
following the Purchasers' election to exercise the Purchasers' Warrant Put
pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof or the Purchasers' Share Put pursuant to Section
8.3 hereof, as the case may be, and TW UK fails to perform its obligations as a
guarantor of the obligations of UK Parent pursuant to Section 8.8 hereof, then a
Majority in Interest of the Purchasers shall have the right, at their option,
to: (i) exercise the Purchasers' Warrant Put or Purchasers' Share Put, as the
case may be, against TW UK to the same extent and with the same effect as such
exercise against UK Parent and TW UK hereby agrees that it shall be fully bound
by this Article VIII as if it were UK Parent, except that (A) to the extent that
any deductions and withholdings on account of Taxes are required under
Applicable Law or of any Taxes imposed on any Purchaser as a result of failure
of UK Parent to fulfill its obligations under Sections 8.1 or 8.3 hereof and TW
UK to fulfill its obligations under Section 8.8 below which would not have been
required had no such failure occurred (unless such failure was directly
attributable to a prohibition against such fulfillment by UK Parent or TW UK, as
the case may be, under Applicable Law), the Warrant Purchase Price and the Share
Purchase Price, as the case may be, shall be increased, as may be necessary, so
that after making all such deductions and withholdings and taking into account
all such Taxes (whether applicable to the original redemption price payable or
to additional sums payable under this Section 8.7 and taking into account all
Taxes on and arising by reason of the payment of additional sums payable under
this Section 8.7), the Purchasers receive an amount equal to the sum that it
would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made or Taxes
imposed, (B) the Companies shall make required deductions or withholdings, and
(C) the Companies shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant
taxing or other Governmental Entity; or (ii) exercise directly through
instructions to the Trustee under the Voting Trust Agreement the "drag-along
rights" set forth in the Charter Documents of TW UK without any requirement that
the Board of Directors of UK Parent or TW UK first take any action and, on such
election by a Majority in Interest of the Purchasers, all of the parties hereto
undertake to take all such action and give all such instructions as may be
necessary to effect in full such drag along rights.

        8.8 TW UK Guaranty.

               (a) TW UK hereby unconditionally, irrevocably and absolutely
guarantees payment in full of the obligations of UK Parent to the Purchasers
upon the election of the Purchasers to exercise (i) the Purchasers' Warrant Put
with respect to the Warrants and (ii) the Purchasers' Share Put with respect to
the Ordinary Shares. To the extent that UK Parent


                                       56

<PAGE>




defaults on such obligations, TW UK shall be absolutely and unconditionally
obligated to pay the Warrant Purchase Price and the accompanying Subordinated
Note Redemption Price or the Share Purchase Price, as the case may be, in
immediately available funds in full on the Warrant Put Purchase Date or the
Share Purchase Date, as the case may be, and shall not be entitled to set off
any claim of any kind which UK Parent or TW UK may have against anyone whether
arising under or by reason of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or
for any other reason of any kind. In the event that the Purchasers shall not for
any reason receive (i) on the Warrant Put Purchase Date the full payment of the
Warrant Purchase Price and the accompanying Subordinated Note Redemption Price
for the Warrants being purchased and the Subordinated Notes being redeemed, as
the case may be, or (ii) on the Share Put Purchase Date, the full payment of the
Share Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares being purchased, then in any
proceeding instituted by the Purchasers, no defense by TW UK to its obligation
to pay the Warrant Purchase Price, the Subordinated Note Redemption Price or the
Share Purchase Price, as the case may be, whether by counterclaim, affirmative
defense or new matter, that is not also available to UK Parent with respect to
the primary obligation to purchase or redeem the Purchasers' Securities pursuant
to the Purchasers' Warrants Put and the Purchasers' Share Put, shall be
interposed or shall be of any force or effect, said defenses being waived for
purposes of such proceeding.

               (b) Subject to compliance in full with this Article VIII by the
Purchasers, TW UK waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension
or accrual of any component of the Warrant Purchase Price or the Share Purchase
Price and notice of or proof of reliance by the Purchasers upon this Section 8.8
or acceptance of this Section 8.8; the obligation to pay the Warrant Purchase
Price and the accompanying Subordinated Note Redemption Price shall conclusively
be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred in reliance upon this
Section 8.8; the obligation to pay the Share Purchase Price conclusively shall
be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred in reliance upon this
Section 8.8; and all dealings between UK Parent or TW UK, on the one hand, and
the Purchasers, on the other, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have
been had or consummated in reliance upon this Section 8.8. TW UK waives
diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or
nonpayment to or upon TW UK with respect to the Warrant Purchase Price and the
accompanying Subordinated Note Redemption Price or the Share Purchase Price, as
the case may be. TW UK's obligations under this Section 8.8 shall be construed
as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment to pay the
Warrant Purchase Price and the accompanying Subordinated Note Redemption Price
or the Share Purchase Price, as the case may be, and shall not be diminished or
impaired by (i) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of
payment) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by UK Parent or TW
UK against the Purchasers, or (ii) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or
without notice to or knowledge of UK Parent or TW UK) which constitutes, or
might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of UK Parent
from the obligation to pay the entire Warrant Purchase Price and accompanying
Subordinated Note Redemption Price or the Share Purchase Price, or of TW UK
under this Section 8.8, upon the occurrence of any Insolvency Proceedings or in
any other instance.


                                       57

<PAGE>




               (c) This Section 8.8 shall continue to be effective, or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of
any of the Warrant Purchase Price and accompanying Subordinated Note Redemption
Price or the Share Purchase Price, as the case may be, is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored or returned by the Purchasers upon the occurrence of any
Insolvency Proceedings relating to UK Parent or upon or as a result of the
appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar
officer for, UK Parent or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise,
all as though such payments had not been made.

               (d) Any provision of this Section 8.8 which is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

               (e) No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the
part of the Purchasers, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as
a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Purchasers of any right
or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any
right or remedy which the Purchaser would otherwise have on any future occasion.
The rights and remedies provided in this Section 8.8 are cumulative, may be
exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by law.

        8.9 Further Action. Subject to the requirements of law, each of
Transworld and UK Parent (or their successors or assigns or any Person to whom
they transfer any of their shares in UK Parent or TW UK, respectively) shall
exercise or direct the exercise of their voting rights (whether at a general or
extraordinary meeting of shareholders or by consent in lieu of a meeting of
shareholders) and where appropriate to give effect to such matters, shall
convene any necessary shareholders meeting, for the purpose of passing (and,
unless pursuant to an amending resolution required for the purpose of
authorizing and giving effect to the Purchasers' Share Put against TW UK under
this Article VIII, not revoking) such resolutions as may be required by law to
approve or authorize any purchase of Securities pursuant to Articles VII and
VIII hereof, including, without limitation, any special resolutions required
under sections 165 and/or 171 of the Companies Act 1985 in connection with a
purchase by TW UK of its own shares (whether out of distributable profits or out
of the proceeds of a new issue of shares or otherwise).

        9.1 General Covenants of the Companies. As a material inducement for the
Purchasers to enter into this Agreement and subscribe for the Purchasers'
Securities, each of the Companies hereby makes the following covenants and
agreements for so long as the Purchasers hold any Ordinary Shares, Subordinated
Notes, PIK Notes or Warrants; provided, however, that all such covenants and
agreements shall lapse upon the earlier of (i) TW UK consummating a Qualified
Public Offering or (ii) the Ordinary Shares achieving a Qualified Public Value:

               (a) Payment of Securities. UK Parent and TW UK, respectively,
shall pay, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, when due all
principal of, interest on, and redemption price of the Subordinated Notes and
the PIK Notes, respectively, deliver Ordinary Shares upon the exercise of the
Warrants, and pay when due the redemption and purchase price of Warrants and
Ordinary Shares in the manner provided herein. Other than as provided in or
contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or the Credit Agreements as in
effect on the date hereof, the Companies shall not, or permit any of their
respective Subsidiaries to, enter into any agreement with any party which by its
express terms: (a) restricts payments due the Purchasers hereunder; or (b)
otherwise conflicts with or impairs any of the express rights or privileges
granted to the Purchasers hereunder or under any other Transaction Document.

               (b)    Accounting Methods; Organizational Existence.

                      (i) Unless consistent with Applicable Law and with
        accounting principles, standards and practices generally accepted at the
        relevant date in the United Kingdom consistently applied, the Companies
        will not, and they will not permit any Subsidiary to, change or
        introduce any new method of accounting which differs in any substantive
        respect from the accounting as reflected in the audited financial
        statements delivered to the Purchasers hereunder.

                      (ii) The Companies will do or cause to be done all things
        necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect their respective
        and their respective Subsidiaries' organizational existence as limited
        liability companies and the rights (charter and statutory), licenses and
        franchises of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries; provided,
        however, that the Companies shall not be required to preserve any such
        right, license or franchise, or the corporate, organizational or similar
        existence of any Subsidiary, if the Board of Directors of TW UK shall
        determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the
        conduct of the business of the Group Companies taken as a whole.

               (c) Indemnification of Directors; Payment of Directors' Expenses.
Each of the Companies shall (i) at all times maintain provisions in its Charter
Documents indemnifying any member of the Board of Directors of such Company
chosen by the Purchasers pursuant to the terms of the Charter Documents of such
Company against liability and limiting such liability, both to the maximum
extent permitted under the laws of England and (ii) promptly reimburse


                                       59

out-of-pocket expenses in accordances with the regular policies of the Companies
incurred in attending each meeting of the Board of Directors of such Company or
any committee thereof of which he or she is a member.

As a material inducement for the Purchasers to enter into this Agreement and
subscribe for the Purchasers' Securities, each of the Companies hereby makes the

        have taken or proposes to take with respect thereto), and (B) no event
        has occurred and remains in existence by reason of which payments on
        account of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on (or the

        under this Section 9.2(a), the Companies shall promptly advise the
        Purchasers of any event (including without limitation each suit or
        proceeding commenced or threatened against the Companies, assuming for
        purposes of this Section 9.2(a)(iii) that such action is or will be
        adversely determined) which, in the reasonable judgment of the
        Companies, has resulted in or, insofar as the Companies can reasonably
        foresee, may result or will result in: (i) a Material Adverse Effect or
        (ii) a material adverse effect on the ability of the Companies to
        perform their respective obligations under any of the Transaction
        Documents or in respect of the Purchasers' Securities or any document
        contemplated hereby or thereby.

                      (iv) The Companies shall deliver to the Purchasers, as
        soon as available but in no event more than one hundred and twenty (120)

        such annual financial statements relating to UK Parent and TW UK,
        stating whether anything in such certified public accountant's
        examination has revealed the occurrence of an event which constitutes a
        Breach or an Event of Breach, and, if so, stating the facts with respect
        thereto.

               (b) Restrictive Covenants. The Companies shall not, and shall

        respective Capital Shares, directly or indirectly, or otherwise, except
        for the redemption of Purchaser Securities pursuant to and as provided
        in Articles VI, VII and VIII of this Agreement or as may be necessary to
        provide UK Parent with sufficient funds to settle any applicable
        assessment of taxation or any professional fees and administration costs
        in the ordinary course of business (including any interest paid on the
        Subordinated Notes or the PIK Notes incurred by it pursuant to the terms
        of the Transaction Documents) and the



                                       61
<PAGE>

        parties shall exercise or direct the exercise of their voting rights for
        the purpose of passing or authorizing and giving effect to such
        redemption and any related dividend or distribution.

        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, TW UK may
grant options to employees of the Group Companies at an exercise price that is
equal to or greater than the Warrant Exercise Price (as defined in the Warrant
Instrument, currently (pounds sterling)1) of the Warrants as of the date hereof

such grants do not in the aggregate exceed 9,850,000 Ordinary Shares.

               (c) Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates.

                      (i) Neither UK Parent nor TW UK shall, nor shall the
        Companies permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, enter into any

        or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to or to
        purchase any property or assets from, or for the direct or indirect
        benefit of, any Purchaser (other than relating to this Agreement and the
        transactions contemplated hereby) or any Affiliate of any Purchaser,
        Transworld, UK Parent or TW UK, make any Investment in or enter into any
        contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or Guarantee with, or
        for the direct or indirect benefit of, any Purchasers (other than
        relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) or
        any Affiliate of any Purchaser, Transworld, UK Parent or of TW UK (each,
        including any series of transactions with one or more Purchasers or
        Affiliates, an "Affiliate Transaction"), unless:

                             (1) the Board of Directors of TW UK determines, as
               evidenced by a Board Resolution, that the terms of such Affiliate
               Transaction are fair and reasonable to the Group Companies, and
               no less favorable to the Group Companies than those that could
               have been obtained at that time in a comparable arms-length
               transaction by the applicable Group Company with an unrelated
               Person; and

                             (2) such transaction has been approved by a
               majority of members of the Board of Directors of TW UK who have
               no direct or indirect interest in the Affiliate Transaction
               itself or in the Affiliate that is a party to the Affiliate
               Transaction, or in any other party that is an Affiliate of any
               such Affiliate, and TW UK shall have delivered to the Purchasers
               and Transworld an Officers' Certificate certifying that the
               conditions of this clause (2) have been satisfied; and

                             (3) with respect to an Affiliate Transaction
               involving or having a potential aggregate value of more than
               (pounds sterling)1,000,000, the Board of Directors of TW UK shall
               first have received a written opinion from an Independent
               Financial Advisor for the benefit of Transworld, TW UK and the
               Purchasers, which firm is not receiving any contingent fee or
               other consideration directly or indirectly related



                                       62
<PAGE>



               to the successful completion of the Affiliate Transaction, to the
               effect that the proposed Affiliate Transaction is fair to the
               Group Companies from a financial point of view.

                      (ii) The provisions of this Section 9.2(c) shall not apply
        to (i) the reasonable and customary fees and compensation paid to or
        indemnity provided on behalf of, officers, directors, employees or
        consultants of the Group Companies, as determined by the Board of
        Directors of TW UK (with respect to officers and directors of TW UK) or
        the senior management of TW UK in good faith (with respect to other
        employees and consultants of the Group Companies), (ii) transactions
        exclusively between or among UK Parent and TW UK and any Wholly-Owned
        Subsidiary or exclusively between or among Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries,
        provided such transactions are not otherwise prohibited by this
        Agreement, (iii) any Affiliate Transaction in existence as of the date
        hereof, or (iv) any amendment, restructuring or modification of the
        terms of the Securities or the rights and obligations of the Purchasers
        under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents which is
        approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors other
        than the Purchaser Director.

                      (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
        herein, neither UK Parent nor TW UK shall enter into, or permit any of
        their respective Subsidiaries to enter into any transaction or series of
        transaction, whatever the form or consideration, with Transworld without
        the prior written consent of a Majority in Interest of the Purchasers.

               (d) Intentionally Omitted.

               (e) Intentionally Omitted.

               (f) Restrictions Against Limitations on Upstream Payments.
Neither UK Parent nor TW UK shall, nor shall it permit any Subsidiary to, create
or otherwise cause or to become effective any Payment Restriction, except for
such Payment Restrictions existing under or by reason of: (i) Applicable Law;
(ii) the terms of the Transaction Documents; (iii) the terms of the Credit
Agreements as in existence on the date hereof and any other document entered
into in connection therewith; (iv) any instrument governing Indebtedness or
Capital Shares of an Acquired Person as in effect at the time of such
acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness was Incurred in
contemplation of or in connection with such acquisition), provided, that such
restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the Property or assets of any
Person, other than the Acquired Person; (v) non-assignment provisions in leases
entered into in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practices; (vi) instruments governing purchase money Indebtedness for Property
acquired in the ordinary course of business that only impose restrictions on the
Property so acquired; or (vii) Refinancing Indebtedness approved by the Board of
Directors of TW UK, with respect to Indebtedness described in clauses (ii),
(iii) or (iv), provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements
governing such Refinancing Indebtedness are no more restrictive in the aggregate
than those contained in



                                       63
<PAGE>

the instrument governing the Indebtedness being refinanced immediately prior to
such refinancing.

               (g) Limitation on Sales of Assets. Other than as contemplated in
the Charter Documents of the Companies, the Companies shall not, and shall not
permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to undertake any Asset Disposition
unless (i) the Board of Directors of TW UK (evidenced by a certified copy of a
Board Resolution), approves such Asset Disposition and (ii) no Covenant Breach
or Event of Default exists at the time, or would occur as a consequence, of
(after giving effect, on a pro forma basis, to) such Asset Disposition.

        (i) Each of the Companies will not, and will not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, Incur, directly or indirectly, any Indebtedness; provided,

                      (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 9.2(h)(i), UK
               Parent may Incur Indebtedness with respect to the Subordinated
               Notes, the PIK Notes and Guarantees of Designated Indebtedness
               and other Indebtedness of any Group Company permitted hereby.

                      (iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
               9.2(h), the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Companies or
               any Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this Section 9.2(h) shall
               not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations
               in the exchange rates of currencies. For purposes of determining
               the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness
               Incurred pursuant to this covenant:

                             (1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the Credit
                      Agreements prior to or on the Closing Date shall be
                      treated as Incurred pursuant to Section 9.2(h)(ii)(1);

                             (2) Indebtedness permitted by this Section 9.2(h)
                      need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
                      permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part
                      by one such provision and in cart by one or more other
                      provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;
                      and

                             (3) in the event that Indebtedness meets the
                      criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
                      described in this Section 9.2(h), TW UK, in its sole
                      discretion, shall classify such Indebtedness and only be
                      required to include the amount of such Indebtedness in one
                      of such clauses.

                      (v) For purposes of determining compliance with any
               Sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
               Indebtedness the Sterling-equivalent principal amount of
               Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be
               calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect
               on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term
               debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt;
               provided that (1) the Sterling-equivalent principal amount of any
               such Indebtedness outstanding or committed on the Closing Date
               shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate
               in effect on the Closing Date, and (2) if such Indebtedness is
               Incurred to Refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign
               currency, and such Refinancing would cause the applicable
               Sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at
               the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such
               Refinancing, such Sterling-denominated restriction shall be
               deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount
               of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal
               amount of such Indebtedness being Refinanced. The principal
               amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to Refinance other
               Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
               Indebtedness being Refinanced, shall be calculated


                                       70
<PAGE>


               based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies
               in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in
               effect on the date of such Refinancing.

               Purchasers under this Section 9.2(j) to approve the particular
               form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be

        12.1 Drag Along Rights.

               (a) If Transworld, UK Parent, TW UK or any of the Purchasers
receives an offer from any Person, or themselves make an offer, which, if

Offer"), then such person receiving or so making the offer shall immediately
notify the Board of Directors of such offer.

               (b) In the event of:

                    (i) a Qualifying Offer being so received or made, and the
               Board of Directors so requesting in writing; or

                    (ii) a Qualifying Offer being so received or made and an
               Extraordinary Event (as defined in the Voting Trust Agreement)
               having occurred, and the Purchasers' Representative so requesting
               in writing; or

                      (iii) a Put Breach having occurred or being continuing and
               any of Transworld, TW UK, UK Parent or any of the Purchasers
               having received a bona fide offer from any Person who is not an
               Affiliate of TW UK or of the Purchasers' Representative, which if
               accepted in full would constitute a Liquidity Event, and the
               Purchasers' Representative so requesting in writing;

        each of Transworld, UK Parent, TW UK and each Purchaser, in the case of
        each of (i), (ii) and (iii) above, whichever is applicable, shall be
        obliged to and shall:

                             (1) sell, transfer and deliver, or cause to be
                      sold, transferred and delivered, to the purchaser or
                      acquirer (the "Buyer"), all Capital Shares of TW UK and
                      Subordinated Notes of UK Parent then held by each of them
                      on substantially identical terms (with appropriate
                      adjustments to reflect the conversion of convertible
                      securities, the redemption of redeemable securities and
                      the exercise of exercisable securities, as well as the
                      relative preferences and priorities of any preferred
                      securities then outstanding); and

                             (2) execute and deliver such instruments of
                      transfer, and take such other action, including voting
                      such Ordinary Shares or Voting Trust
                      Certificates, as the case may be, of TW UK held by such
                      party in favor of any such transaction and executing any
                      purchase agreements, merger agreements, indemnity
                      agreements, escrow agreements or related documents, as the
                      Board of Directors and/or the Buyer may reasonably require
                      in order to carry out the terms and provisions of this
                      Article 12,

                                       75
<PAGE>

provided that no party hereto shall be required to execute any indemnity or
similar agreement rendering such party personally liable for any amount in
excess of the proceeds to be received by such Person from such transaction.

        12.2 Notification. Not less than 20 Business Days prior to the date
proposed for the completion of any transaction described in Section 12.1 hereof,
the Board of Directors (or in the circumstances set forth in Section 12.1(b)(ii)
and (iii) above, the Purchasers' Representative) shall cause TW UK to give (and
TW UK shall give) written notice to Transworld, UK Parent and the Purchasers,
setting forth in reasonable detail the name or names of the Buyer, the terms and
conditions of the transaction and the proposed completion date.

        12.3 Appointment of Agent. Transworld, UK Parent and the Purchasers
(other than the Purchasers' Representative) hereby: (a) irrevocably appoint the
Chief Executive Officer of TW UK as his, her or its agent and attorney (the
"Agent") (with full power of substitution) to execute all agreements,
instruments and certificates and take all actions necessary or desirable to give
effect to the provisions of this Article 12; and (b) subject to the provisions
of the Voting Trust Agreement grant to the Agent a proxy (which shall be
irrevocable) to vote all voting Capital Shares of TW UK owned by such Person and
exercise any consent rights applicable thereto to give effect to the provisions
of this Article 12, provided that the Agent shall not exercise such power of
attorney or proxy with respect to any Person unless such Person is in breach of
its obligations under this Article XII.

        12.4 Termination. The drag along rights provided for in this Article XII
shall terminate automatically upon the effective date of an amendment to the
Articles of Association of TW UK that deletes, eliminates or otherwise
terminates such rights in the Articles of Association of TW UK.


                                  ARTICLE XIII
                                 CO-SALE RIGHTS

        13.1 Co-Sale Rights. Except for any transfer of Capital Shares expressly
authorized by the provisions of the Voting Trust Agreement, this Agreement, the
Warrant Instrument or the Charter Documents of TW UK (other than transfers
specifically authorized under Article 7 of the Articles of Association of TW UK
to which the provisions of this Article XIII shall apply), with respect to any
proposed transfer of Capital Shares or Subordinated Notes by any holder
thereof (the "Transferor") to any person ("Proposed Purchaser") prior to the
consummation of a Qualified Public Offering or achievement of a Qualified Public
Value, each of UK Parent, Transworld and the other Purchasers, or their
transferees and assigns (the "Other Shareholders"), shall have the right
("Co-Sale Rights") to require the Proposed Purchaser to purchase from it a
portion of its Capital Shares (including Ordinary Shares issued or issuable


                                       76
<PAGE>



upon exercise of Warrants) and Subordinated Notes (such Other Shareholder's "Pro
Rata Share") which is equal to the product obtained by multiplying:

          (i) the total number of Capital Shares that the Proposed Purchaser is
     prepared to purchase; by

          (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of Capital
     Shares (including Ordinary Shares issued or issuable upon exercise of
     Warrants) owned by such Other Shareholder, and the denominator of which is
     the total number of Capital Shares issued and outstanding immediately
     before the transfer (including Ordinary Shares issued or issuable upon
     exercise of Warrants);

or such greater number of Capital Shares which is determined in accordance with
the remainder of this Article XIII.

        The price per Ordinary Share and, subject to Section 13.4 hereof, the
terms and conditions, shall be the same as those of such proposed transfer by
the Transferor, with appropriate adjustments to reflect the conversion of
convertible securities, the redemption of redeemable securities and the exercise
of exercisable securities as well as the relative preferences and priorities of
any preferred securities then outstanding (it being understood that such terms
and conditions may include the execution and delivery of such instruments of
transfer as are executed and delivered by the Transferor to the Proposed
Purchaser, provided that the Other Shareholders shall not be required to execute
any indemnity or similar agreement rendering such Other Shareholder personally
liable for any amount in excess of the proceeds to be received by such Other
Shareholder from such transfer).

        13.2 Sale Notice. The Transferor shall notify, or cause to be notified,
each Other Shareholder in writing of each such proposed transfer. Such notice
(the "Sale Notice") shall set forth:

        (a) the number of Capital Shares and principal amount of Subordinated
Notes proposed to be transferred;

        (b) the maximum number of Capital Shares and principal amount of
Subordinated Notes that such Other Shareholder can sell to such Proposed
Purchaser;

        (c) the name and address of the Proposed Purchaser;


        (d) the proposed amount and form of consideration and terms and
conditions of payment offered by such Proposed Purchaser;

                                       77
<PAGE>

               (e) that the Proposed Purchaser has been informed of the Co-Sale
Rights provided for in this Article XIII and has agreed to purchase Capital
Shares and principal amount of Subordinated Notes in accordance with the terms
hereof; and

               (f) that, with respect to the Capital Shares and principal amount
of Subordinated Notes to be purchased by the Proposed Purchaser, the Proposed
Purchaser agrees to enter into a Deed of Adherence in accordance with this
Agreement.

        At the request of the Transferor, TW UK shall provide to the Transferor
any information available to TW UK, to the extent such information is required
for the delivery of a Sale Notice by the Transferor, and each Other Shareholder
shall provide to the Transferor information concerning such Other Shareholder's
name and address and the number of Capital Shares and principal amount of
Subordinated Notes held by such Other Shareholder (including Ordinary Shares
issuable upon exercise of the Warrants).

        13.3 Co-Sale Notice. The Co-Sale Rights may be exercised by any Other
Shareholder by delivery of a written notice to the Transferor giving a Sale
Notice (the "Co-Sale Notice") within 10 Business Days following their receipt of
the Sale Notice. The Co-Sale Notice shall constitute an agreement, binding on
the Other Shareholder delivering it, to sell up to the number of Capital Shares
and principal amount of Subordinated Notes specified in the Co-Sale Notice to
the Proposed Purchaser in the event the proposed sale to the Proposed Purchaser
can, as modified by the inclusion of such Other Shareholder(s), still be
consummated as originally proposed, and is so consummated. In such event, the
number of Capital Shares and principal amount of Subordinated Notes to be sold
by each Other Shareholder giving a Co-Sale Notice shall be determined as
follows:

               (a) each such Other Shareholder shall be entitled to sell at
least the lesser of the number of Capital Shares and principal amount of
Subordinated Notes specified in such Other Shareholder's Co-Sale Notice or such
Shareholder's Pro Rata Share. Such amount is referred to as such Other
Shareholder's "Basic Sale Amount" and, in the case of any Other Shareholder who
requested the sale of a number of Capital Shares and principal amount of
Subordinated Notes in excess of such Other Shareholders Pro Rata Share, the
amount of such excess is referred to as such Other Shareholder's "Excess Sale
Request." If not all Other Shareholders requested the sale of at least their Pro
Rata Share, the excess of the total of the Pro Rata Shares of all Other
Shareholders over the total of the Basic Sale Amount of the Other Shareholders
who gave Co-Sale Notices is referred to as the "Undersubscribed Amount."

               (b) If there is an Undersubscribed Amount, it shall be allocated
between the Other Shareholders who gave Co-Sale Notices, as a class, and the
Transferor pro rata as follows:

                      (i) an amount equal to the Undersubscribed Amount
        multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total of the
        Basic Sales Amounts of such Other


                                       78
<PAGE>


        Shareholders and the denominator of which is the total amount of
        Capital Shares and Subordinated Notes to be purchased by the Proposed
        Purchaser, shall be allocated to such Other Shareholders, as a class
        (such amount is referred to as the "Excess Allocable Amount") in
        accordance with Section 13.3(c); and

                      (ii) the remainder of the Undersubscribed Amount shall be
        allocated to the Transferor.

               (c) If there is an Excess Allocable Amount, each Other
Shareholder who had an Excess Sale Request shall also be entitled to sell an
amount equal to the lesser of such Other Shareholder's Excess Sale Request or
the Excess Allocable Amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
such Other Shareholder's Excess Sale Request and the denominator of which is the
total of the Excess Sale Requests of all Other Shareholders having Excess Sale
Requests.

        13.4 Procedures. In the event that the Proposed Purchaser does not
purchase all Capital Shares and Subordinated Notes to be sold by all Other
Shareholders giving Co-Sale Notices (as determined pursuant to Section 13.3(a),
(b) and (c) hereof), on the terms and conditions stated in the Sale Notice or on
terms and conditions no less favorable to the Transferor, then the Transferor
may not make the proposed sale to such Proposed Purchaser without renewed
compliance with this Article XIII. After expiration of the 10 Business Day
period referred to above, the Transferor shall have the right during the
following 120 calendar day period to transfer, or to enter into a binding
agreement to transfer, any of the Capital Shares and Subordinated Notes not
subject to a Co-Sale Notice to the Proposed Purchaser or subject to the
remainder of this Article XIII, to a different purchaser, on the terms and
conditions stated in the Sale Notice or on terms and conditions no more
favorable to the Transferor, so long as the Capital Shares subject to Co-Sale
Notices are also purchased or agreed to be purchased at the same time, provided
that the Transferor may not, without renewed compliance with this Article XIII:

               (a) make a sale pursuant to a previously executed agreement to
transfer Capital Shares or Subordinated Notes on a date which is more than 180
days after the date of the applicable Sale Notice; or

               (b) make a sale to a different purchaser on terms and conditions
(including the financial standing and creditworthiness of such different
purchaser) more favorable to the Transferor than those set forth in the
applicable Sale Notice.

        13.5 Adjustments. All numbers in this Article XIII which refer to
Capital Shares shall be subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any
share dividend, share split, reverse share split, consolidation or similar
transaction.


                                       79
<PAGE>

        13.6 Registration Rights. For the purpose of this Article XIII if: (a)
the Transferor has agreed to sell any Capital Shares or Subordinated Notes for
consideration which includes securities; (b) such non-cash consideration
includes securities (other than notes, debentures or similar instruments
evidencing indebtedness) which are not readily marketable on a public market
providing regularly maintained price quotations and a regular flow of
transactions; and (c) after giving effect to the proposed transfer of Capital
Shares or Subordinated Notes by the Transferor and any related transactions, the
Proposed Purchaser or the issuer of such securities would be an Affiliate of the
Transferor, then the Proposed Purchaser's offer to the Other Shareholders shall
include registration rights for the benefit of the Other Shareholders accepting
such offer and covering any such securities, upon terms and conditions no less
favorable to the Other Shareholders than those set forth in the Registration
Rights Agreement.

        13.7 Termination. The rights set forth in this Article XIII shall
terminate automatically upon the effective date of an amendment to the Articles
of Association of TW UK that deletes, eliminates or otherwise terminates such
rights in the Charter Documents of TW UK.

                                   ARTICLE XIV
                                   PRE-EMPTION

        14.1 Limitations. Until the earlier of (i) the consummation of a
Qualified Public Offering or (ii) the achievement of a Qualified Public Value,
except in the case of a Permitted Transfer (to which the provisions of this
Article XIV shall not apply), any Person who wishes to transfer Capital Shares
of TW UK or Securities (the "Seller") shall give notice in writing (the
"Transfer Notice") to TW UK of his, her or its wish specifying:

        (a)    the number and class(es) of Capital Shares of TW UK and the
               Securities which he, she or it wishes to transfer (the "Sale
               Securities");

        (b)    the name of any third party to whom he, she or it proposes to
               sell or transfer the Sale Securities;

        (c)    the price at which he, she or it wishes to transfer the Sale
               Securities (which shall be deemed to be the Fair Market Value if
               no price is specified) (the "Transfer Price"); and

        (d)    whether or not the Transfer Notice is conditional upon all, and
               not part only, of the Capital Shares of TW UK or Securities so
               specified being sold pursuant to the offer hereinafter mentioned
               and, in the absence of such stipulation, it shall be deemed not
               be so conditional.


                                       80
<PAGE>



        Where any Transfer Notice is deemed to have been given in accordance
with this Section 14.1, the deemed Transfer Notice shall be treated as having
specified: (i) that all the Sale Securities registered in the name of the Seller
shall be included for transfer; (ii) that the price for the Sale Securities
shall be as agreed between the Board of Directors and the Seller or, failing
agreement, shall be the Fair Market Value; and (iii) that no condition as
referred to in Section 14.1(d) shall apply.

        Unless otherwise agreed by Transworld, the Purchasers and TW UK in
writing, no Transfer Notice once given or deemed to have been given in
accordance with this Section 14 shall be withdrawn. The Transfer Notice shall
constitute TW UK the agent of the Seller (other than the Purchasers'
Representative) for the sale of the Sale Securities specified therein at the
Transfer Price.

        14.2 Notice. TW UK shall as soon as practicable following receipt of a
Transfer Notice or, where later, upon the determination of the Transfer Price
give notice in writing to each of the holders of Sale Securities (the "Members")
(for which purpose all of the Warrants shall be deemed to have been exercised
immediately prior to such notice and holders of Warrant shall be treated as
members in respect of all the Ordinary Shares which are the subject of the
Warrants) informing them that the Sale Securities are available and of the
Transfer Price. Such notice shall invite each of the Members to state, in
writing within 42 days from the date of such notice (which date shall be
specified therein), whether he, she or it is willing to purchase any and, if so,
how many of the Sale Securities.

        14.3 Offer.

        (a)    The Sale Securities shall be offered to each Member on terms
               that, in the event of competition, the Sale Securities offered
               shall be sold to the Members accepting the offer in proportion
               (as nearly as may be) to their existing holdings of Sale
               Securities to which the offer is made (the "Proportionate
               Entitlement"). It shall be open to each such Member to specify if
               he, she or it is willing to purchase Sale Securities in excess of
               his Proportionate Entitlement ("Excess Shares") and, if the
               Member does so specify, he shall state the number of Excess
               Shares.

        (b)    After the expiration of the offers to be made pursuant to Section
               14.3(a) (or sooner if all the Sale Securities offered shall have
               been accepted in the manner provided in Section 14.3(a)), the
               Board shall allocate the Sale Securities in the following manner:

               (i)  if the total number of Sale Securities applied for is equal
                    to or less than the available number of Sale Securities, TW
                    UK shall allocate the number applied for in accordance with
                    the applications; or


                                       81
<PAGE>


               (ii) if the total number of Sale Securities applied for is more
                    than the available number of Sale Securities, each of
                    Transworld and the Purchasers shall be allocated his, her or
                    its Proportionate Entitlement (or such lesser number of Sale
                    Securities for which he, she or it may have applied);
                    applications for Excess Shares shall be allocated in
                    accordance with such applications or, in the event of
                    competition, (as nearly as may be) to each Member applying
                    for Excess Shares in the proportion which shares of the
                    relevant class held by such Member bears to the total number
                    of shares of that class held by all such Members applying
                    for Excess Shares; provided, that, such Member shall not
                    be allocated more Excess Shares than he shall have stated
                    himself, herself or it willing to take,

               and in either case, TW UK shall forthwith give notice of each
               such allocation (an "Allocation Notice") to the Seller and each
               of the persons to whom Sale Securities have been allocated (a
               "Member Applicant") and shall specify in the Allocation Notice
               the place and time (being not later than 14 days after the date
               of the Allocation Notice) at which the sale of the Sale Shares
               shall be completed.

               (c)  Subject to Section 14.4 upon such allocations being made as
                    aforesaid, the Seller shall be bound, on payment of the
                    Transfer Price, to transfer the Sale Securities comprised in
                    the Allocation Notice to the Member Applicants named therein
                    at the time and place therein specified. If he, she or it
                    makes default in so doing the Chairman for the time being of
                    TW UK or, failing him, one of the Directors, or some other
                    person duly nominated by a resolution of the Board of
                    Directors for that purpose, shall forthwith be deemed to be
                    the duly appointed attorney of the Seller with full power to
                    execute, complete and deliver in the name and on behalf of
                    the Seller a transfer of the relevant Sale Securities to the
                    Member Applicant and any Director may receive and give a
                    good discharge for the purchase money on behalf of the
                    Seller and (subject to the transfer being duly stamped)
                    enter the name of the Member Applicant in the register of
                    members as the member or members by transfer of the Sale
                    Securities so purchased by him or them, The Board of
                    Directors shall forthwith pay the purchase money into a
                    separate bank account in TW UK's name and shall hold money
                    on trust (but without interest) for the Seller until he, she
                    or it shall deliver up his, her or its certificate or
                    certificates for the relevant shares (or an indemnity, in a
                    form reasonably satisfactory to the Board of Directors, in
                    respect of any lost certificate) to TW UK when he shall
                    thereupon be paid the purchase money.

        14.4 Additional Offer. If the Seller shall have included in the Transfer
Notice a provision that unless all the Sale Securities are sold, none shall be
sold and if the total number of Sale Securities applied for by Member Applicants
is less than the number of Sale Securities then the Allocation Notice shall
refer to such provision and shall contain a further invitation,



                                       82

allocated to apply for further Sale Securities and completion of the sales in
accordance with this Section 14.4 hereof shall be conditional upon such
provision as aforesaid being complied with in full.

        In the event all of the Sale Securities not being sold under the
preceding paragraph of this Section 14.4 the Seller may, at any time within six
calendar months after receiving confirmation from TW UK that the pre-emption
provisions herein contained have been exhausted, transfer any Sale Securities
(which have not been sold) to any Person or Persons at any price not less than
the Transfer Price, provided, that:

     (a)  if the Seller stipulated in the Transfer Notice that unless all the
          Sale Securities were sold none should be sold, the Seller shall not be
          entitled, save with the written consent of the Members holding Capital
          Shares (for which purpose all of the Warrants shall be deemed to have
          been exercised immediately prior to such Transfer Notice and the
          holders of Warrants shall be treated as members in respect of all
          Ordinary Shares which are the subject of the Warrants) carrying 80
          percent of voting rights which may for the time being be cast at a
          general meeting of TW UK, to sell hereunder only some of the Sale
          Securities comprised in the Transfer Notice to such Person or Persons;

     (b)  any such sale shall be a bona fide sale and the Board of Directors may
          require to be satisfied in such manner as it may reasonably require
          that the Sale Securities are being sold in pursuance of a bona fide
          sale for not less than the Transfer Price without any deduction,
          rebate or allowance whatsoever to the buyer and, if not so satisfied,
          may refuse to register the instrument of transfer.

        The costs of determining the Fair Market Value shall be borne by TW UK
unless, in the case of a determination required pursuant to the provisions of
Section 14.1, the Fair Market Value so determined is less than that suggested by
the Board of Directors, in which event the costs of determining the Fair Market
Value shall be borne by the Seller.

                      (iii) UK Parent may Transfer Ordinary Shares without the
               loss of its rights set out herein or in the Voting Trust
               Agreement so long as UK Parent continues to hold at least a
               majority of the Ordinary Shares held by it on the date hereof
               (for the avoidance of doubt, if after a Flotation UK Parent
               Transfers more than a majority of the Ordinary Shares held by it,
               such Transfer will have the same consequences as described in

satisfactory to the Board of Directors of TW UK agreeing to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement and any other applicable Transaction Documents

obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement to procure that the transferee
agrees to be bound by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

        Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the Purchaser's
Representative may transfer all of the Securities and the Special Share
registered in its name to its partners in connection with a winding up of its
affairs.

be made by an instrument of Transfer in the usual or common form or in any other
form which may be approved by the Board of Directors. Every instrument of
Transfer must be signed by the transferor or where the transferor is a
corporation given under its common seal or signed on its behalf by a duly
authorized officer or agent and the transferor shall remain the owner of the
Securities to be transferred until the name of the transferee is entered in the
Register in respect thereof. Every instrument of Transfer must be lodged for
registration at the place where the Register shall for the time being be kept
accompanied by the certificate for the Securities all or part of the nominal
amount of which is to be transferred and such other evidence as the Directors or
other officers of UK Parent or TW UK, as the case may be, authorized to deal
with transfers may require to prove the title of the transferor or his right to
Transfer the Securities and, if the instrument of Transfer is executed by some
other person on his behalf, the authority of the person signing the same. All
instruments of Transfer which shall be registered may be retained by UK Parent
or TW UK, as the case may be.

hereof.

               (b) Subject to Section 5.1(h), a Purchaser's rights set out in
(i) Articles IV, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV and XVI hereof and, in the
event the Purchasers' Representative is the transferring Purchaser, such
Purchasers' Representative's right to direct the voting of shares held under the
Voting Trust Agreement shall absolutely terminate forthwith upon any transfer of
any of his, her or its Purchaser's Securities held by such transferring
Purchaser in violation of Section 15.1 hereof and (ii) Articles IV, XII, XIII
and XVIII and, in the event the Purchasers' Representative is the transferring
Purchaser, such Purchasers' Representative's right to direct the voting of
shares held under the Voting Trust Agreement shall absolutely terminate
forthwith upon any Transfer of any Purchaser's Securities held by such
transferring Purchaser in compliance with Section 15.1(d) hereof.

               (c) Any transfer by the Purchasers' Representative of its
Securities, (i) in violation of Section 15.1 hereof or (ii) in accordance with
Section 15.1(d), also shall be deemed an automatic transfer of the Special Share
by the Purchasers' Representative to TW UK for no consideration.

Transworld's and UK Parent's rights set out in Articles X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV,
XV, XVI and XXI and Section 18.1(c) hereof and their right to direct the voting
of shares held under the Voting Trust Agreement shall absolutely terminate
forthwith upon such Transfer.

        15.4 Additional Transfer. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no Transfer of Subordinated Notes or of Warrants shall be effected
unless any Transfer of Subordinated Notes is accompanied by a Transfer (to the
same transferee) of Warrants having an aggregate Warrant Exercise Price (as
defined in the Warrant Instrument) equal to the aggregate principal amount of
the Subordinated Notes the subject of the Transfer, and vice versa.

                             (B) increases in the amount of Earnouts after the

                             contingencies or similar events.

                      For the avoidance of doubt, the parties' intent in respect

        17.2 Defaults on Insolvency. Each of the following constitutes an "Event
of Default":

               (a)    a default under any Designated Indebtedness if such
                      default results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness
                      prior to its express maturity or shall constitute a
                      default in the payment of such Indebtedness at final
                      maturity and such acceleration has not been cured or
                      waived within 30 days of such default; or

               (b) an Insolvency Event occurs with respect to either of the
Companies which is not discharged or discontinued within 14 days of the
commencement of the relevant proceedings save that such 14 day period shall not
apply or shall cease to apply forthwith in the event of any of the following
occurring in connection with either of the Companies:

                    (i)  an administrative receiver or liquidator being
                         appointed;

                    (ii) an order being made for the appointment of an
                         administrator;

                    (iii) an order being made for the liquidation, bankruptcy,

                         proceedings or analogous proceedings under the laws of
                         any jurisdiction; or

                    (iv) a corporate voluntary arrangement or scheme of
                         arrangement (other than a solvent members' scheme of

                         1985) being made by either of the Companies or any
                         other Person in relation to either of the Companies.

        17.3 Remedies.

               (a) If a Covenant Breach arising under Section 17.1 above occurs,
then beginning upon such occurrence and for so long as the Covenant Breach is
continuing:

               (i) the interest rate accruing on the Subordinated Notes, the PIK
        Notes, the Mirror Notes and the Mirror PIK Notes, commencing from (and
        including) the date of such Covenant Breach, shall be increased each
        quarter by 0.5% (for the avoidance of doubt, from 9.375% per annum to
        9.875% upon the occurrence of the Covenant Breach, to 10.375% one
        quarter after such date, to 10.875% two quarters after such date, etc.)
        (the "Breach Interest Rate") and interest shall continue to accrue at
        the Breach Interest Rate while such Covenant Breach is continuing;
        provided, that the Breach Interest Rate shall forthwith be reduced back
        to the interest rate set forth in the Subordinated Notes, the PIK Notes,
        the Mirror Notes and the Mirror PIK Notes if, and when, the original


                                       90
<PAGE>



        Covenant Breach and all other Covenant Breaches that may have arisen
        while such original Covenant Breach was continuing have been eliminated
        or waived in writing by a Majority in Interest of the Purchasers and are
        no longer continuing; and

               (ii) the number of directors of the Companies shall be increased
        as provided in Sections 6(a)(ii)(D) and 6(c) of the Voting Trust
        Agreement.

               (b) If an Event of Default under Section 17.2 above occurs, a
Majority in Interest of the Purchasers may declare an "Acceleration." Upon such
declaration of Acceleration, the respective Subordinated Note Redemption Price,
PIK Note Redemption Price, Mirror Note Redemption Price, Mirror PIK Note
Redemption Price, Warrant Purchase Price and/or Share Purchase Price (each
calculated to the date of actual payment) of all outstanding Subordinated Notes,
PIK Notes, Mirror Notes, Mirror PIK Notes, Warrants and Ordinary Shares issuable
upon exercise of the Warrants, respectively, in addition to all accrued unpaid
interest thereon (collectively the "Accelerated Claims"), shall be due and
payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of Acceleration under this
Agreement because an Event of Default set forth in Section 17.2(a) has occurred
and is continuing, such declaration of Acceleration shall be automatically
rescinded and annulled if either (i) the holders of the Designated Indebtedness
have waived such failure to pay at maturity or have rescinded the Acceleration
in respect of such Indebtedness, or (ii) such Indebtedness shall have been
discharged or the maturity thereof shall have been extended such that it is not
then due and payable, or the underlying default has been cured.

               (c) In the event of a breach of warranties under Article IV or a
Breach of Covenant that results in a judgment as determined by an appropriate
court or other administrative body in favor of the Purchasers in an amount equal
to or greater than (pounds sterling)5.0 million and such amount due to the
Purchasers is not permitted to be paid by the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, then in such event (i) interest on such entire amount due the
Purchasers shall accrue at a rate of 9.375% per annum and such rate of interest
shall be increased each quarter by 0.5% (same as described in Section 17.3(a)(i)
above) until such time as the full amount due to the Purchasers has been paid by
the Companies and (ii) the number of directors of the Companies shall be
increased as provided in Sections 6(a)(ii)(D) and 6(c) of the Voting Trust
Agreement.

        17.4 Rights and Remedies of the Purchaser, its Securities and Assigns.
The Purchases agree that any right to receive money damages or other monetary
compensation on account of breaches by the Companies of any of their respective
warranties, covenants, obligations or other agreements made or contained in this
Agreement ("Monetary Relief Claims") shall be subordinated in right of payment
to the Senior Liabilities and the Mezzanine Liabilities (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) to the same extent as the Subordinated Liabilities
under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, neither this Section 17.4 nor the Intercreditor Agreement shall
restrict the right and ability of the Purchasers to file any suit or complaint
or to seek to file any suit or complaint with any



                                       91
<PAGE>



court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise enforce or seek to enforce, in any
manner whatsoever, including by way of equitable remedies such as injunctive
relief, their rights on account of any breach by any Group Companies of any
covenants set forth in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or (b)
impair or be deemed to limit, modify or affect the rights of the Purchasers as
shareholders of TW UK.

        17.5 Waiver of Breach. To the extent permitted under Section 18.1(b), a
Majority in Interest of the Purchasers by notice to the Companies may on behalf
of all Purchasers waive any existing Covenant Breach or Event of Default and its
consequences under this Agreement and rescind any declaration of Acceleration
and its consequences. Upon any such waiver, such Covenant Breach shall cease to
exist be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Agreement; provided
that no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Covenant Breach or
Event of Default.

        17.6 Other Remedies. The Purchasers may pursue any available remedy to
collect the payments owing hereunder or under the Subordinated Notes or PIK
Notes, as each becomes due and payable, or to enforce the performance of any
provision of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents. A delay or
omission by any Purchasers in exercising any right or remedy shall not impair
such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the applicable
breach. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law. A Majority
in Interest of the Purchasers may direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Purchasers.

or waiver with respect to this Agreement until the Board of Directors of TW UK

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

        20.1 Indemnification; Expenses, Etc.

               (a) In addition to any and all obligations of the Companies to
indemnify the Purchasers hereunder or under the other Transaction Documents, the
Companies agree, without limitation as to time, to indemnify and hold harmless
the Purchasers, its Affiliates, and the employees, officers, directors, and
agents of the Purchasers and its Affiliates (individually, an "Indemnified
Party" and, collectively the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, reasonable expenses, charges and costs
(including the reasonable costs of preparation and attorneys' fees, including
without limitation, the Purchasers' Special Counsel) and expenses (including
reasonable expenses of investigation) (collectively, "Losses") incurred or
suffered by an Indemnified Party in connection with any proceeding against any
Group Company or any Indemnified Party brought by any third party arising out of
or in connection with this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken in connection
herewith or therewith (or any other document or instrument executed herewith or
pursuant hereto or thereto), whether or not the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated and whether or not any Indemnified Party is a
formal party to any proceeding; provided, however, that (i) this Section 20.1(a)
shall not apply to third party, claims or proceedings made or brought by
Affiliates of the Purchasers, or shareholders, partners, directors, employees,
or agents of the Purchasers or any of their Affiliates (it being understood and
agreed that under no circumstances will any Group Company be deemed an Affiliate
of the Purchasers for purposes of the foregoing sentence) and (ii) the Companies
shall not be liable for any Losses resulting from action on the part of any
Indemnified Party which is finally determined in such proceeding to be an act of
gross negligence or willful misconduct by such Indemnified Party. The Companies
agree promptly to reimburse any Indemnified Party for all such Losses as they
are incurred or suffered by such Indemnified Party. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the Companies agree (for the benefit of each Purchaser) to pay, and to
hold each Purchaser harmless from and against, all costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable documented attorneys' fees, expenses
and disbursements), if any, in connection with the enforcement against the
Companies of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the
Purchasers are parties in any action in which any Purchaser attempting to
enforce any of the foregoing shall prevail or in any action in which a Purchaser
shall successfully assert any provision of any of the foregoing as a defense.

               (b) If any Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
hereunder, such Indemnified Party shall give prompt notice to the Companies of
any claim or of the



                                       95
<PAGE>

commencement of any proceeding against the Companies or brought by any
Indemnified Party or third party with respect to which such Indemnified Party
seeks indemnification pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the failure so to
notify the Companies shall not relieve the Companies from any obligation or
liability except to the extent the Companies are prejudiced by such failure. The
Companies shall have the right, exercisable by giving written notice to an
Indemnified Party promptly after the receipt of written notice from such
Indemnified Party of such claim or proceeding, to assume, at the expense of the
Companies, the defense of any such claim or proceeding with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such Indemnified Party (except that if such Indemnified Party
has reasonable grounds for believing that counsel engaged by the Companies will
have a conflict of interest in representing the Companies and such Indemnified
Party, then such Indemnified Party, together with all similarly situated
Indemnified Parties, may engage, at the Companies' expense, one lead counsel and
not more than one local counsel in each relevant local jurisdiction). The
Indemnified Party or Parties will not be subject to any liability for any
settlement made without its or their consent (but such consent will not be
unreasonably withheld). The Companies shall not consent to entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party or Parties
of a release, in form and substance satisfactory to the Indemnified Party or
Parties, from all liability in respect of such claim, litigation or proceeding.

               (c) The Companies will pay or reimburse, and will hold and save
each Purchaser and each other holder of any of the Securities harmless from
liability for the payment of, all expenses arising in connection with any future
amendment, restructuring or modification of or proposed consent under any
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, whether or not
such proposed amendment, restructuring or modification is effected or such
proposed consent is granted, including the negotiation, preparation, execution
and delivery of any required agreements or documents to be executed and
delivered in connection therewith, including, without limitation: (i) all
document production and duplication charges and the reasonable documented fees,
charges and expenses of Purchaser' Special Counsel; and (ii) the cost of
delivering to such Purchaser's principal office, insured to its satisfaction,
the Securities delivered to such Purchaser hereunder and any Securities
delivered to such Purchaser upon any substitution, exchange or conversion of any
of the Securities pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents to which the Purchasers are parties and of such
Purchaser's delivering any certificates representing Securities, insured to its
satisfaction, upon any such substitution, exchange or conversion.

               (d) Any indemnification or reimbursement with respect to costs
and expenses shall include any value added tax payable with respect to such
costs and expenses.

this Warrant to be exercised for that number of Ordinary Shares which results
from multiplying the number of Warrants being exercised by such Holder by the
Warrant Exercise Price (as defined in this Section 3.1 hereof) in effect at the
time of exercise by surrender of this Warrant Certificate to TW UK (as provided
in Section 2.2 below), accompanied by a notice of subscription ("Subscription"),
in substantially the form of Exhibit A attached hereto, duly executed by such
Holder and by payment as set forth below ("Optional Exercise").

         2.2 Manner of Optional Exercise of Warrant. In order to exercise an
Optional Exercise, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant Certificate, duly
completed, to TW UK or shall deliver an agreement satisfactory to TW UK to
indemnify TW UK from any loss incurred by it in connection therewith (an
"Affidavit of Loss") with respect to such Warrant Certificate, at the registered
office of TW UK. Upon surrender to TW UK of (i) this Warrant Certificate, or
delivery of an Affidavit of Loss; (ii) a Subscription stating the number of
Warrants the Holder elects to exercise; and (iii) (a) cash in an amount equal to
the product of the number of Ordinary Shares for which the Investor desires to
exercise the Warrants, multiplied by the Warrant Exercise Price or (b) the
aggregate principal amount of Subordinated Notes equal to the product of the
number of Ordinary Shares for which the Investor desires to exercise the
Warrants, multiplied by the Warrant Exercise Price, TW UK shall (1) allot and
issue to the Holder, at the address designated by such Holder, share
certificates for such number of Ordinary Shares to which such Holder shall be
entitled upon exercise pursuant to this Section 2; (2) pay to the holder
exercising an Optional Exercise in cash all accrued unpaid interest on the
tendered Subordinated Notes; and (3) issue to the Holder thereof, at the address
designated by such holder, with respect to any Warrants not exercised, a new
Warrant Certificate authenticated by TW UK and equal in amount to the
unexercised portion of the Warrants that will remain outstanding, if any. The
issuance of share certificates for Ordinary Shares upon exercise of Warrants
will be made without charge to the Holders of such shares for any issuance tax
in respect thereof or other costs incurred by TW UK in connection with such
exercise.

         2.3 Automatic Exercise. The Warrants shall, subject to compliance in
full by the Holder with Section 2.4, automatically be exercised to subscribe for
Ordinary Shares ("Automatic Exercise" and together with an Optional Exercise, an
"Exercise") as of, and in all cases subject to, the consummation of a Qualified
Public Offering by TW UK (an "Automatic Exercise Event"), provided, that, if an
Automatic Exercise Event occurs, all outstanding Warrants shall be deemed to
have been exercised pursuant to this Section 2.3 to subscribe for Ordinary
Shares immediately prior to the occurrence of such Automatic Exercise Event. Any
such Automatic Exercise shall be at the Warrant Exercise Price in effect upon
the closing of such Qualified Public Offering.

                                        2

<PAGE>



         2.4 Manner of Automatic Exercise of Warrant. Subject to compliance in
full by the Holder with this Section 2.4, as of, and in all cases subject to,
the occurrence of an Automatic Exercise Event (the "Automatic Exercise Date"),
all outstanding Warrants shall be exercised automatically to subscribe for
Ordinary Shares at the Warrant Exercise Price provided that the Warrant
Certificate(s) or an Affidavit of Loss in respect of all outstanding Warrants is
surrendered to TW UK on or prior to the Automatic Exercise Date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, after an Automatic Exercise Date, each Holder shall retain the
right to receive the number of Ordinary Shares to which the Holder is entitled
upon such Automatic Exercise in respect of any Warrant Certificate or Affidavit
of Loss not surrendered by such Holder on or prior to such Automatic Exercise
Date, plus any accrued and unpaid Interest on any Subordinated Notes and PIK
Notes held by such Holder, but shall retain no other rights with respect to such
Warrants. As of, and in all cases subject to, the occurrence of an Automatic
Exercise Event, the Holder shall either (i) pay to TW UK in cash an amount equal
to the product of the number of Ordinary Shares for which the Warrants have been
exercised multiplied by the Warrant Exercise Price or (ii) tender to TW UK such
number of Subordinated Notes with an aggregate face value equal to the product
of the number of Ordinary Shares for which the Warrants have been exercised
multiplied by the Warrant Exercise Price. In the event that the Investor elects
to pay the Warrant Exercise Price by tendering the Subordinated Notes, TW UK
shall pay to the Holder, in cash, an amount equal to the sum of all accrued and
unpaid interest on the tendered Subordinated Notes plus the principal amount of
any issued PIK Notes, plus all accrued an unpaid interest on such PIK Notes. On
the Automatic Exercise Date all rights with respect to the Warrants so exercised
shall terminate, except any of the rights of the Holder thereof upon surrender
of this Warrant Certificate therefor or delivery of an Affidavit of Loss thereof
to receive share certificates for the number of Ordinary Shares subscribed for
pursuant to the exercise of such Warrants. If so required by TW UK, this Warrant
Certificate surrendered for exercise shall be endorsed or accompanied by written
instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to TW UK, duly
executed by the Holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in
writing. Upon surrender of this Warrant Certificate or Affidavit of Loss, TW UK
shall issue and deliver to the Holder, promptly (and in any event in such time
as is sufficient to enable such holder to participate in such Qualified Public
Offering) at such office and in its name as shown on such surrendered Warrant
Certificate, a share certificate for the number of Ordinary Shares for which the
Holder exercised the Warrants on the Automatic Exercise Date.

         2.5 Tender of Subordinated Notes and Mirror Notes. Simultaneous with
the issuance of Ordinary Shares to the Holder, TW UK shall tender any
Subordinated Notes and PIK Notes tendered to TW UK upon exercise of the Warrants
to UK Parent, and UK Parent immediately shall exchange such tendered
Subordinated Notes for such number of Mirror Notes and Mirror PIK Notes with an
aggregate face value equal to the aggregate face value of the Subordinated Notes
tendered to UK Parent by TW UK, plus all accrued and unpaid interest on such
Mirror Notes.

         2.6 Expiration Date. The Warrants shall lapse without further action
by TW UK on the earlier of (i) the redemption or repayment at Maturity of
all the Subordinated Notes and all

                                        3

<PAGE>



of the PIK Notes pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement; (ii) upon an
Automatic Exercise provided that if any Holder has not complied in full with
Section 2.4, by surrendering to TW UK the relative Warrant Certificates or
Affidavit of Loss and, if relevant, Subordinated Notes in respect of the
Warrants registered in his name on or prior to an Automatic Exercise Event,
provided that such Holder shall retain only the right to receive Ordinary
Shares, plus any accrued and unpaid Interest on any Subordinated Notes and PIK
Notes held by such Holder, as set forth in Section 2.4 above; (iii) a purchase
of all the outstanding Warrants pursuant to a Purchasers' Warrant Put; or (iv)
the date which is nine (9) years after the date of issuance of this Warrant
(such date hereinafter referred to as the "Expiration Date"), provided, however,
that the Expiration Date shall be no earlier than the date on which the
Subordination Notes and the PIK Notes have been paid in full.

         2.7 Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Exercise. TW UK shall at all
times reserve and keep available for issue out of its authorized but unissued
share capital free from pre-emptive rights such number of its Ordinary Shares as
shall from time to time be sufficient to allow the Holders to exercise all
outstanding Warrants pursuant to the terms thereof. If at any time the
authorized, or the authorized but unissued share capital shall not be sufficient
to allow the Exercise of all then outstanding Warrants, TW UK will take such
corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized share capital
and/or the number of shares available for issue (as the case may be) to such
number of Ordinary Shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose, as
applicable.

         2.8 Warrant Put. Subject to the terms of Section 8 of the Purchase
Agreement, the Warrants shall be purchased in whole or in part, at the election
of the Holder, upon the occurrence of a Warrant Put Event, as set forth in
Section 8 of the Purchase Agreement, at the Warrant Purchase Price determined
pursuant to and in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8 of the
Purchase Agreement.

         2.9 Any Warrants which have not been exercised prior to the Expiration
Date shall lapse immediately following the Expiration Date.

         2.10 Delivery of the items specified in Section 2.2 to TW UK shall be
an irrevocable election by the Holder to exercise the relevant Warrants.

         2.11 Where the Automatic Exercise Event in response to which any
automatic exercise of Warrants is made does not occur within 30 Business Days of
the proposed date of such Automatic Exercise Event:

                  (a) TW UK shall forthwith deliver to each relevant Holder the
         Subordinated Notes it had tendered to TW UK in respect of such exercise
         of Warrants; and

                  (b) the relevant Warrants shall remain exercisable by the
         relevant Holder in accordance with the provisions of this Warrant as if
         they had never been exercised.


                                        4

<PAGE>



         2.12 Special Redemption of Notes. In the case of an Optional Exercise,
if a Holder elects to effect such Exercise through delivery of cash pursuant to
Section 2.2(iii)(a) hereto, UK Parent shall have the right, at its option, to
redeem from such Holder the aggregate principal amount of Subordinated Notes
held by such Holder equal to the number of Warrants so exercised multiplied by
the Warrant Exercise Price, at the Subordinated Note Redemption Price.

3.       ADJUSTMENT OF ORDINARY SHARES ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE

         3.1 General; Number of Ordinary Shares; Warrant Exercise Price. The
number of Ordinary Shares which the Holder shall be entitled to receive upon the
exercise hereof shall be the number of Ordinary Shares originally issuable upon
the exercise of this Warrant as adjusted, from time to time, pursuant to this
Section 3. The aggregate exercise price shall be determined by multiplying such
number by the Warrant Exercise Price in effect on the date of such exercise. The
"Warrant Exercise Price," which shall initially be the Initial Ordinary Share
Exercise Price, shall be adjusted and readjusted from time to time as provided
in this Section 3 and, as so adjusted and readjusted, shall remain in effect
until a further adjustment or readjustment thereof is required by this Section
3.

         3.2 Adjustments for Dividends and Distributions. In case TW UK at any
time or from time to time after the date hereof shall declare, order, pay or
make a dividend or other distribution including without limitation any
distribution of cash, other or additional shares or other securities or property
or the right to purchase any such securities or property, by way of dividend or
spin-off, reclassification, recapitalization or similar corporate rearrangement
or otherwise on the Ordinary Shares of TW UK, other than a dividend permitted by
Section 9.2(b)(iv) of the Purchase Agreement, then:

                    (i)  in the case of a distribution in cash, the Warrant
                         Exercise Price shall be reduced (without duplication)
                         by an amount equal to the per share amount of the cash
                         dividend; and

                    (ii) in the case of any other distribution, TW UK shall
                         provide the Holder with ten (10) Business Days' prior
                         written notice of such distribution and make
                         appropriate provisions to ensure that the Holder shall
                         thereafter have the right to receive (without
                         duplication), upon exercise of the Warrants, in
                         addition to the Ordinary Shares immediately theretofore
                         issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, either, at the
                         option of the Holder, (a) such shares or other
                         securities, property or rights as would have been
                         receivable by the Holder had the Warrants been
                         exercised immediately prior to the time TW UK took a
                         record of holders of shares of TW UK for purposes of
                         entitling them to receive such dividend or
                         distribution, or (b) an amount of cash equal to the
                         Fair Market Value of the property described in clause
                         (a) as of

                                        5

<PAGE>



                    the date of such distribution, as determined in good faith
                    by the Board of Directors of TW UK.

         The adjustment provided for in this Section 3.2 shall under no
circumstances reduce the Warrant Exercise Price payable in connection with any
exercise of this Warrant below the par value per share issuable upon such
exercise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no adjustment pursuant
to this Section 3.2 for any increase in the amounts paid by TW UK due to a
change in Applicable Law as set forth in Sections 2.7, 7.6 and 8.7 of the
Purchase Agreement.

         3.3 Adjustments for Subdivision or Combination. If TW UK at any time or
from time to time subdivides (by any share split, share dividend,
recapitalization or otherwise) its outstanding Ordinary Shares into a greater
number of Ordinary Shares or consolidates its outstanding shares into a lesser
number of Ordinary Shares, immediately after the occurrence of such subdivision
or consolidation, the number of Ordinary Shares for which the Warrants are
exercisable shall be the number of Ordinary Shares which a record holder of the
same number of Ordinary Shares for which the Warrants are exercisable
immediately prior to such event would own or be entitled to receive in respect
of such shares upon the happening of such event. In the event an adjustment is
made to the number of Ordinary Shares for which the Warrants are exercisable,
the Warrant Exercise Price shall be adjusted by multiplying (i) the current
Warrant Exercise Price by (ii) a fraction where the numerator is (y) the number
of Ordinary Shares for which the Warrants were exercisable immediately prior to
such adjustment and the denominator is (z) the number of Ordinary Shares for
which the Warrants were exercisable immediately following such adjustment.

         3.4 Adjustments for Acquisition, Disposal, Sale of Assets, Etc. In case
TW UK after the date hereof (a) is acquired by any other Person or (b) acquires
any other Person and, in connection with such acquisition, the Ordinary Shares
of TW UK shall be exchanged for shares or other securities of any other Person
or cash or any other property, or (c) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties or assets to any other Person, or (d) shall effect a capital
reorganization or reclassification of the Ordinary Shares, then, and in the case
of each such transaction, proper provision shall be made so that, upon the basis
and the terms and in the manner provided in this Warrant, the Holder, upon the
exercise hereof at any time after the consummation of such transaction, shall be
entitled to receive (at the aggregate Warrant Exercise Price in effect at the
time of such consummation for all Ordinary Shares issuable upon such exercise
immediately prior to such consummation), in lieu of the Ordinary Shares issuable
upon the exercise prior to such consummation, the greatest amount of securities,
cash or other property to which the Holder would actually have been entitled as
a shareholder upon such consummation if the Holder had exercised the rights
represented by the Warrants immediately prior thereto, subject to adjustments
(subsequent to such consummation) as nearly equivalent as possible to the
adjustments provided for in this Section 3;

         3.5 Assumption of Obligations. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Warrant Certificate to the contrary, TW UK will not effect any of the
transactions described in clauses

                                        6

<PAGE>



(a) through (d) of Section 3.4 hereof unless, prior to the consummation thereof,
each Person (other than TW UK) which may be required to deliver any shares,
securities, cash or property upon the exercise of the Warrants as provided
herein shall by written instrument delivered to, and reasonably satisfactory to,
the Holder, assume (a) the obligations of TW UK under the Warrants, including
without limitation the Guarantees of TW UK as described in the Purchase
Agreement (and if TW UK shall survive the consummation of such transaction, such
assumption shall be in addition to, and shall not release TW UK from, any
continuing obligations of TW UK under this Warrant), (b) the obligations of TW
UK under the Registration Rights Agreement and (c) the obligation to deliver to
the Holder such shares, securities, cash or property as, in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.4, the Holder may be entitled to receive.

         3.6 Adjustments for Diluting Issues. In the event TW UK shall at any
time or from time to time issue, sell or exchange (i) any Ordinary Shares at a
price per share, or (ii) any rights, options, warrants or convertible or
exchangeable securities entitling the holders thereof to purchase Ordinary
Shares at an exercise price per share (when aggregated with any price payable
and actually paid for the grant of such right to purchase an Ordinary Share),
less than the Warrant Exercise Price, the Warrant Exercise Price shall be
adjusted immediately thereafter so that it shall equal the price determined by
multiplying the Warrant Exercise Price in effect immediately prior thereto by a
fraction, of which the numerator shall be the number of Ordinary Shares
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or exercise price, sale or
exchange plus the number of Ordinary Shares which the aggregate offering price
of the total number of Ordinary Shares so issued or issuable would purchase at
the Warrant Exercise Price per share (prior to adjustment), and of which the
denominator shall be the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior
to such issuance, sale or exchange plus the number of additional Ordinary Shares
so issued or issuable. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such
an issuance, sale or exchange is made. To the extent that any such rights,
options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities are not so issued or
expire unexercised, the Warrant Exercise Price then in effect shall be
readjusted to the Warrant Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such
unissued or unexercised rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable
securities had not been issuable.

         3.7 Expiration or Change in Price. If the consideration per share
provided for in any options or rights to subscribe for Ordinary Shares or any
securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into Ordinary Shares,
changes at any time, the Warrant Exercise Price in effect at the time of such
change shall be readjusted to the Warrant Exercise Price which would have been
in effect at such time had such options or convertible securities provided for
such changed consideration per share, at the time initially granted, issued or
sold. No adjustment of the Warrant Exercise Price shall be made under this
Section 3.7 upon the issuance of any additional Ordinary Shares which are issued
pursuant to the exercise of any warrants, options or other subscription or
purchase rights or pursuant to the exercise of any conversion or exchange rights
in any convertible securities if an adjustment shall previously have been made
upon the issuance of such warrants, options or other rights. Any adjustment of
the Warrant Exercise Price shall be disregarded if, as, and when the rights to
acquire

                                        7

<PAGE>



Ordinary Shares upon exercise or conversion of the warrants, options, rights or
convertible securities which gave rise to such adjustment expire or are
canceled, redeemed or repurchased without having been exercised, so that the
Warrant Exercise Price effective immediately upon such cancellation or
expiration shall be equal to the Warrant Exercise Price in effect at the time of
the issuance of the expired or canceled warrants, options, rights or convertible
securities, with such additional adjustments as would have been made to that
Warrant Exercise Price had the expired or canceled warrants, options, rights or
convertible securities not been issued.

         3.8 Certificate of Adjustment. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment
or readjustment pursuant to this Section 3, TW UK at its expense shall promptly
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to the Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or
readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. TW UK shall, upon written request at any time of the
Holder, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate
setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the applicable
Warrant Exercise Prices before and after such adjustment or readjustment, and
(iii) the number of Ordinary Shares and the amount, if any, of other property
which at the time would be received upon the exercise of such Holder's Warrant.

4. OTHER DILUTIVE EVENTS. In case any event shall occur as to which the
provisions of Section 3 hereof are not strictly applicable but the failure to
make any adjustment would not, in the opinion of the Holder, fairly protect the
subscription rights represented by each Warrant in accordance with the essential
intent and principles of such Section, then, in each such case, at the request
of the Holder, TW UK shall appoint a firm of independent investment bankers of
recognized national standing (which shall be completely independent of TW UK and
shall be satisfactory to the Holder), which shall give their opinion upon the
adjustment, if any, on a basis consistent with the essential intent and
principles established in Section 3 hereof, necessary to preserve, without
dilution, the purchase rights represented by this Warrant. Upon receipt of such
opinion, TW UK will promptly mail a copy thereof to the Holder and shall make
the adjustments described therein.

5. NO DILUTION OR IMPAIRMENT. TW UK (a) will not permit the par value of any
shares receivable upon the exercise of the Warrants to exceed the amount payable
therefor upon such exercise and (b) will take all such action as may be
necessary or appropriate in order that TW UK may validly and legally issue fully
paid shares on the exercise of each Warrant from time to time outstanding in
accordance with the provisions set forth herein.

6. ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT AS TO ADJUSTMENTS. In each case of any adjustment or
readjustment in the Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant,
TW UK will promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with
the terms of the Warrants. In the event of a dispute in connection with such
adjustment, TW UK will cause independent chartered accountants of recognized
international standing (which may be the regular auditors of TW UK) selected by
the Holder to verify such computation (other than any computation of the Fair
Market Value of property as determined in good faith by the

                                        8

<PAGE>



Board of Directors of TW UK) and prepare a report setting forth such adjustment
or readjustment and showing in reasonable detail the method of calculation
thereof and the facts upon which such adjustment or re-adjustment is based. TW
UK will promptly mail a copy of each such report to the Holder and will, upon
the written request at any time of the Holder, furnish to the Holder a like
report setting forth the Warrant Exercise Price at the time in effect and
showing in reasonable detail how it was calculated. TW UK will also keep copies
of all such reports at its registered office and will cause the same to be
available for inspection at such office during normal business hours by the
Holder.

7.       NOTICES OF CORPORATE ACTION.  In the event of

                  (a) any taking by TW UK of a record of the holders of any
         class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof
         who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution or any
         right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of any
         class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other
         right, or

                  (b) any capital reorganization of TW UK, any reclassification,
         consolidation or recapitalization (or other similar procedure) of the
         shares of TW UK or any acquisition, disposal or merger involving TW UK
         and any other Person or any transfer of all or substantially all the
         assets of TW UK to any other Person, or

                  (c) any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or
         winding-up of TW UK,

TW UK will mail to the Holder a notice specifying (i) the date or expected date
on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend,
distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend,
distribution or right and (ii) the date or the date on which any such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, recapitalization, acquisition,
disposal, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation, winding-up or other
similar event is to take place, the time, if any such time is to be fixed, as of
which the Holder shall be entitled to exchange its Ordinary Shares for the
securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization,
reclassification, consolidation, recapitalization, acquisition, disposal,
merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation, winding-up or other similar event
and a description in reasonable detail of the transaction. Such notice shall be
mailed at least thirty (30) days prior to the date therein specified.

8. REGISTRATION OF ORDINARY SHARES. The Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise
of this Warrant shall constitute Registrable Shares (as such term is defined in
the Registration Rights Agreement). The Holder shall be entitled to all of the
benefits afforded to a Holder of any such Registrable Shares under the
Registration Rights Agreement and the Holder, by its acceptance of this Warrant,
agrees to be bound by and agrees to the terms and conditions of the Registration
Rights Agreement applicable to the Holder as a Holder of such Registrable
Securities.

9.       OWNERSHIP, TRANSFER AND SUBSTITUTION OF WARRANTS.

         9.1 Ownership of Warrants. TW UK may treat the person in whose name the
Warrants are registered on the register kept at the registered office of TW UK
as the owner and Holder thereof for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to
the contrary. The Warrants may be exercised by a new Holder without a new
Warrant Certificate first having been issued.

         9.2 Transfer of Warrants. A Transfer of this Warrant shall only be made
if it is made in compliance with Article XV of the Purchase Agreement and in
compliance with this Section 9.

         9.3 Any Transfer of a Warrant permitted under the Purchase Agreement
shall be made by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or in any
other form which may be reasonably approved by the Board of Directors.

         9.4 The instrument of Transfer of a Warrant shall be executed by or on
behalf of the transferor and the transferee agreeing to comply with the terms of
the Warrant. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the Holder of the Warrant
until the name of the transferee is entered in the Register (as herein defined)
in respect of the Warrant being Transferred.

         9.5 The Board of Directors may decline to recognize any instrument of
Transfer of a Warrant otherwise permitted by clause 9 of this Warrant unless
such instrument is deposited at the registered office of TW UK accompanied by
the Warrant Certificate to which it relates, and such other evidence as the
Board of Directors may reasonably require to show, the right of the transferor
to make the Transfer. The Directors shall waive production of any Warrant
Certificate upon production to them of an Affidavit of Loss. The Board of
Directors shall be bound to register any transfer permitted under the Purchase
Agreement within 14 days after the lodging of the instrument of transfer with TW
UK and to enter the name of the transferee on the Register (as defined below).

         9.6 No fee shall be charged for any registration of a transfer of a
Warrant or for the registration of any other documents which in the opinion of
the Board of Directors require registration.

         9.7 The registration of a Transfer shall be conclusive evidence of the
approval by the Board of Directors of such a transfer.

         9.8 For the purposes of this instrument, "Transfer" means any sale,
transfer (whether voluntary or otherwise except for any transfer required by
operation of law) or other disposition of any Warrant or any interest (legal or
equitable) therein.

10.      REGISTER AND CERTIFICATES.

         10.1 Register. An accurate register of entitlement to the Warrants (the
"Register") will be kept by TW UK at its registered office in which TW UK shall
enter:

               (a) the names and addresses of the persons for the time being
          entitled to be registered as the Holders of the Warrants;

               (b) the number of Warrants held by every registered Holder, and

               (c) the date on which the name of every registered Holder is
          entered in the Register in respect of the Warrants in his name.

         10.2 Any Holder, and any person authorized by any Holder, may at all

not it shall have express or other notice of such a claim.

         10.4 Every Holder will be recognized by TW UK as entitled to its

destroyed TW UK will replace it provided that:

               (a) the Holder seeking the replacement provides TW UK with such
          evidence and indemnity in respect of the mutilation, defacement, loss,
          theft or destruction as TW UK may reasonably require;

               (b) the Holder seeking the replacement pays TW UK's reasonable
          costs in connection with the issue of the replacement; and

               (c) the mutilated or defaced certificates in respect of which
          replacements are being sought are surrendered.

ANY SALE, ASSIGNMENT, TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF THIS SECURITY IS

DECEMBER 17, 1999 A COMPLETE AND CORRECT COPY OF WHICH WILL BE FURNISHED BY THE

THIS SUBORDINATED NOTE IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE SUBORDINATION PROVISIONS
SET FORTH IN THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED HEREIN).

                       SENIOR SUBORDINATED PROMISSORY NOTE


(pounds sterling)[       ]                                     December 17, 1999
                                                                 London, England

         FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, Transworld Holdings (UK) Limited,
a company incorporated in England and Wales with registered number 3890177 ("UK
Parent"), hereby promises to pay to                or to its registered assigns
("Payee" or "Noteholder") the principal sum of                  Pounds Sterling
((pounds sterling)          ).

         This senior subordinated promissory note ("Subordinated Note") has been
created and authorized by UK Parent in accordance with its Memorandum and
Articles of Association and by a resolution of the board of directors of UK
Parent on December 17, 1999 and is issued pursuant to and is entitled to the
benefits of the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by
and among UK Parent, Transworld Healthcare (UK) Limited, a company incorporated
in England and Wales with registered number 3370146 ("TW UK"), and the
purchasers identified therein (the "Purchase Agreement"). Terms used herein and
not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Purchase
Agreement.

         1.       Maturity. This Subordinated Note shall mature and the
principal and all accrued but unpaid interest and any other payments due
hereunder shall be due and payable, without set-off, deduction or counterclaim,
on December 15, 2008 (the "Maturity Date").

         2.       Interest. UK Parent promises to pay interest on the principal
amount of this Subordinated Note at the rate and in the manner specified below.
Interest on the outstanding principal balance of this Subordinated Note will
accrue at 9.375% per annum, or such higher rate of Interest as set forth in
Article XVII of the Purchase Agreement in the event of a Covenant Breach or an
Event of Default compounded quarterly from the date hereof until maturity and
will be payable quarterly in cash, in arrears, on December 31, March 31, and
September 30 of each year beginning on March 30, 2000, or if any such day is not
a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (each an "Interest Payment
Date"), to Payee; provided, however, that interest payments hereunder shall be
paid in the manner and at the time provided in the Intercreditor Agreement,
dated as of the date hereof, by and among the Banks, the Purchasers, TW UK and
the other parties identified therein (the "Intercreditor Agreement"). If UK
Parent is unable to pay interest in cash on a given Interest Payment Date, UK
Parent shall pay interest on

                                        1

<PAGE>



this Subordinated Note in the form of a PIK Note in an amount equal to the
amount of interest due, but not paid in cash, on the Interest Payment Date. PIK
Notes shall be deemed to have been issued by UK Parent, and its obligations
thereunder shall commence, as of the applicable Interest Payment Date,
irrespective of the actual date of execution and delivery of the PIK Notes. All
PIK Notes issued pursuant to this Section 2 shall be due and payable upon
maturity of this Subordinated Note and shall bear interest at the same rate.
Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 365 day year and the actual days
elapsed. Interest on this Subordinated Note will accrue from the most recent
date on which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the
Closing Date. Interest shall be paid net of any withholding of any Taxes which
UK Parent shall be required to withhold by Applicable Law, provided that to the
extent the same would not have arisen but for a change in applicable tax
legislation after the date hereof, UK Parent shall pay such additional sums as
set forth in Section 2.7 of the Purchase Agreement.

         3.       Further Provisions Relating to Principal and Interest

         3.1      The "record date" shall mean the thirtieth day before the
                  relevant Interest Payment Date or, if such day is not a
                  Business Day, then the next following Business Day and every
                  Payee shall be deemed for the purposes of this Subordinated
                  Note to be the holder on such date of the Subordinated Notes
                  held by him on such preceding date, notwithstanding any
                  intermediate transfer or transmission of any such Subordinated
                  Notes.

         3.2      The amount of interest payable on a Subordinated Note shall be
                  rounded up to the nearest penny. The calculation of each
                  interest amount shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
                  final and binding.

         3.3      Interest on the Subordinated Notes becoming liable to
                  repayment shall cease to accrue as of the date of actual
                  repayment of such Subordinated Notes.

         3.4      Any interest which remains unclaimed after the period ending
                  on the later of (i) the Maturity Date or (ii) six years from
                  the date of first payment shall revert to UK Parent
                  notwithstanding that in the intervening period the obligation
                  to pay the same may have been provided for in the books,
                  accounts and the other records of UK Parent.

         4.       Method of Payment. UK Parent will pay interest on this
Subordinated Note to the Person who is the registered Holder of this
Subordinated Note at the close of business on the record date for the next
Interest Payment Date even if such Subordinated Note is canceled after such
record date and on or before such Interest Payment Date. Payee must surrender
this Subordinated Note to UK Parent to collect principal payments on such
Subordinated Note. Except for the payment of interest in PIK Notes as permitted
in certain circumstances by Section 2 above, UK Parent will pay principal,
premium, if any, and interest in pounds sterling. UK Parent may pay principal,
premium, if any, and interest by bank transfer of funds or other funds transfer,
or interest by check payable in such money, and any such check shall be
delivered to a Payee's registered address. Every such cheque, warrant or money
order shall be made payable to


                                        2

<PAGE>



the order of the person to whom it is sent (or to such person as the Payee or
joint Payee may in writing direct) and payment of the cheque, warrant or money
order shall be a satisfaction of the principal and interest represented thereby.
If payment is made by a bank or other funds transfer, UK Parent shall be
responsible for amounts lost or delayed in the course of the transfer.

         5.       Optional Redemption. Subject to the terms of Section 6 of the
Purchase Agreement, this Subordinated Note may be redeemed at the option of UK
Parent, in whole but not in part, upon the terms and in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 6 of the Purchase Agreement. This Subordinated
Note may also be redeemed at the option of UK Parent in certain circumstances as
set forth in Section 2.12 of the Warrant Instrument.

         6.       Noteholder's Put. Subject to the terms of Section 7 of the
Purchase Agreement, this Subordinated Note may be redeemed at the option of the
Payee, in whole or in part, upon the occurrence of a Put Event, upon the terms
and in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 7 of the Purchase
Agreement.

         7.       Surrender of Certificate and Prescription. Every Payee any of
whose Subordinated Notes are due to be repaid on the Maturity Date under any of
the provisions of this Subordinated Note shall, not later than the due date for
such repayment, deliver the relevant certificates for such Subordinated Notes or
an agreement satisfactory to UK Parent to indemnify UK Parent from any losses
incurred by it in connection therewith with respect to such Subordinated Note(s)
to the registered office of UK Parent or as it shall direct. Unless payment of
the amount due to be repaid has already been made in accordance with Section 4
above, upon such delivery, UK Parent shall pay to the Payee the amount payable
to him in respect of such repayment in accordance with condition 4. If part only
of any Subordinated Note(s) as evidenced by the relevant certificate so
delivered is then due to be repaid, UK Parent shall either endorse such
Subordinated Note with a memorandum of the date and amount paid to the holder of
such Subordinated Note and return it to the Payee or shall cancel such
Subordinated Note and without charge issue to such Payee a new Subordinated Note
for the balance of the principal amount due to him.

         8.       Subordination. This Subordinated Note shall be subordinated to
certain indebtedness of UK Parent and TW UK in accordance with and to the extent
provided in the Intercreditor Agreement.

         9.       Events of Default; Acceleration. Upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default, the principal amount of this Subordinated Note, together with
all accrued interest and all other payments due hereunder or under the PIK
Notes, if any, or the Purchase Agreement, may be declared to be immediately due
and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Purchase
Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, following the
occurrence of an Event of Default, the Payee may proceed to enforce and exercise
its rights by suit in equity, action at law and/or other appropriate means. UK
Parent agrees to pay on demand all reasonable costs of collection and all other
reasonable costs and expenses, including without limitation reasonable
attorneys' fees, incurred or paid by the Payee in enforcing or collecting this
Subordinated Note upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.


                                        3

<PAGE>



         10.      No Waivers; Amendments. No failure or delay on the part of UK
Parent or the Payee in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder or under
the Purchase Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
The remedies provided for herein and in the Purchase Agreement are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any remedies that may be available to UK Parent or the
Payee at law or in equity or otherwise. This Subordinated Note may be amended,
and the provisions hereof may be waived only with the express written consent of
Payee and UK Parent.

         11.      Successor Substituted. Subject to and in accordance with the
Agreement, upon the acquisition of, or any merger, consolidation or other
business combination involving, UK Parent or upon the sale, assignment,
transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of
UK Parent's properties and assets (each a "Disposition"), the Surviving Person
(if other than UK Parent) resulting from such Disposition shall, if the Holder
so elects, succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, UK Parent under the Agreement with the same effect as if such
surviving person had been named as UK Parent in the Agreement.

         12.      Register of Subordinated Notes

         12.1     The Company shall cause a register to be maintained at the
                  registered office of UK Parent (the "Register") showing the

                  Subordinated Notes shall forthwith be notified by the holder
                  to UK Parent and UK Parent shall alter the Register

                  Noteholders.

         15.      Service of Notices

                  Any notice or document served by post shall be deemed to have
                  been served on the day after it is posted or, if such day is
                  not a Business Day, then on the next following Business Day
                  and in proving such service it shall be sufficient to prove
                  that the letter containing the notice was properly addressed,
                  stamped or posted.

         16.      Recognition of Payee as Absolute Owner

         16.1     Except as required by law, UK Parent will recognize the
                  registered holder of any Subordinated Notes as the absolute
                  owner thereof and shall not (except as ordered by a court of
                  competent jurisdiction) be bound to take notice or see to the
                  execution of any trust, whether express, implied or
                  constructive, to which any Subordinated Notes may be subject
                  and UK Parent may accept the receipt of the registered holder
                  for the time being of any Subordinated Notes, or in the case
                  of joint registered holders the receipt of any of them, for
                  the principal monies payable in respect thereof or for the
                  interest from time to time accruing due in respect thereof or
                  for any other monies payable in respect thereof as a good
                  discharge to UK Parent notwithstanding any notice it may have
                  whether express or otherwise of the right, title, interest or
                  claim of any other person to or in such Subordinated Notes,
                  interests or monies.

         16.2     No notice of any trust, express, implied or constructive,
                  shall (except as by statute provided or as required by order
                  of a court of competent jurisdiction) be entered in the
                  Register in respect of any Subordinated Notes.

         17. Exclusion of Equities. UK Parent will recognize every holder of
Subordinated Notes as entitled to his Subordinated Notes free from any equity,
set-off or cross-claim on the part of UK Parent against the original or any
intermediate holder of the Subordinated Notes.

                                        5

         18.1     This Subordinated Note may only be Transferred by a Transfer
                  made in accordance with Article XV of the Purchase Agreement
                  and in compliance with this Section 18.

         18.2     Every transfer of a Subordinated Note permitted under the
                  Purchase Agreement shall be made by an instrument of transfer
                  in the usual or common form or in any other form which may be
                  reasonably approved by the Board of Directors.

         18.3     Every instrument of Transfer must be signed by the transferor
                  or where the transferor is a corporation given under its
                  common seal or signed on its behalf by a duly authorized
                  officer or agent and the transferor shall remain the owner of
                  the Subordinated Notes to be transferred until the name of the
                  transferee is entered in the Register in respect thereof. The
                  Board of Directors shall be bound to register any transfer
                  permitted under the Purchase Agreement within 14 days after
                  the lodging as the instrument of transfer with TW UK and to
                  enter the name of the transferee on the register of TW UK.

         18.4     Every instrument of Transfer must be lodged for registration
                  at the place where the Register shall for the time being be
                  kept accompanied by the certificate for the Subordinated Notes
                  all or part of the nominal amount of which is to be
                  transferred and such other evidence as the Directors or other
                  officers of UK Parent authorized to deal with transfers may
                  reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor or his
                  right to transfer the Subordinated Notes and, if the
                  instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on his
                  behalf, the authority of the person signing the same.

         18.5     No Transfer shall be registered of Subordinated Notes in
                  respect of which a notice requiring repayment has been given.

         18.6     All instruments of Transfer which shall be registered may be
                  retained by UK Parent.

         18.7     UK Parent hereby acknowledges and covenants that the benefit
                  of the covenants, obligations and conditions on the part of it
                  or binding on it contained in this Subordinated Note hereto
                  shall enure to the benefit of each and every holder of the
                  Subordinated Notes.

                  Each holder of Subordinated Notes shall be entitled to enforce
                  the said covenants, obligations and conditions against UK
                  Parent insofar as each of his Subordinated Notes is concerned,
                  without the need to join the allottee of any such Subordinated
                  Note or any intervening or other holder of Subordinated Notes
                  in the proceedings for such enforcement.

         19. Receipt of Joint Holders. If several Persons are entered in the
Register as joint registered holders of any Subordinated Notes then, without
prejudice to paragraph 16 above, the


                                        6

<PAGE>



receipt of any one of such Persons for any interest or principal or other monies
in respect of such Subordinated Notes shall be as effective a discharge to UK
Parent as if the person signing such receipt were the sole registered holder of
such Subordinated Notes.

         20. Replacement of Certificates. If the certificate for any
Subordinated Notes is lost, defaced or destroyed, it may be renewed, on such
terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity as the board of directors may
require, but so that in the case of defacement the defaced certificate shall be
surrendered before the new certificate is issued.

         21. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Subordinated Note (and any
dispute, controversy, proceedings or claim of whatever nature arising out of or
in any way relating to this Subordinated Note or its formation) shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with English law. Each of the parties to
this Subordinated Note irrevocably agrees that the courts of England shall have
exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide any suit, action or proceedings and/or
settle any disputes, which may arise out of or in connection with this
Subordinated Note and, for these purposes, each party irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of the courts of England. Each of the parties to this Subordinated
Note irrevocably waives any objection which it might at any time have to the
courts of England being nominated as the forum to hear and decide and/or settle
any such matter and agrees not to claim that the courts of England are not a
convenient or appropriate forum for any such matter and further irrevocably
agrees that a judgment in any such matter brought in any court referred to in
this Section 21 shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties and may be
enforced in the courts of any other jurisdiction.

         22. Successors. Any person who becomes entitled to any Subordinated
Note (whether by operation of law, transfer or otherwise) shall be bound by
every notice given in respect of that Subordinated Note before its name and
address is entered on the Register.

         23. Entire Agreement. This Subordinated Note and all other documents
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement embody the entire agreement and understanding between the Holder and
UK Parent and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to the
subject matter hereof.

ANY SALE, ASSIGNMENT, TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF THIS SECURITY IS
RESTRICTED BY, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE HOLDER OF SUCH SECURITY ARE SUBJECT TO THE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN, A SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT DATED AS OF
DECEMBER 17, 1999 A COMPLETE AND CORRECT COPY OF WHICH WILL BE FURNISHED BY THE
ISSUER TO THE HOLDER HEREOF UPON WRITTEN REQUEST AND WITHOUT CHARGE.

THIS MIRROR NOTE IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE SUBORDINATION PROVISIONS SET
FORTH IN THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED HEREIN).

                       MIRROR SUBORDINATED PROMISSORY NOTE

(pounds sterling)[       ]                                     December 17, 1999
                                                                 London, England

         FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, Transworld Healthcare (UK)
Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales with registered number
3370146 ("TW UK"), hereby promises to pay to Transworld Holdings (UK) Limited, a
company incorporated in England and Wales with registered number 3890177 or to
its registered assigns ("Payee" or "Noteholder") the principal sum of
            Pounds Sterling ((pounds sterling)       ).

         This mirror senior subordinated promissory note ("Mirror Note") has
been created and authorized by TW UK in accordance with its Memorandum and
Articles of Association and by a resolution of the board of directors of TW UK
on December   , 1999 and is issued pursuant to and is entitled to the benefits
of the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and among
TW UK, Payee, and the parties identified therein (the "Purchase Agreement").
Terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in
the Purchase Agreement.

         1.       Maturity. This Mirror Note shall mature and the principal and
all accrued but unpaid interest and any other payments due hereunder shall be
due and payable, without set-off, deduction or counterclaim, on December 15,
2008 (the "Maturity Date").

         2.       Interest. TW UK promises to pay interest on the principal
amount of this Mirror Note at the rate and in the manner specified below.
Interest on the outstanding principal balance of this Mirror Note will accrue at
9.376% per annum, or such higher rate of Interest as set forth in Section    of
the Purchase Agreement in the event of a Covenant Breach or an Event of Default
compounded quarterly from the date hereof until maturity and will be payable
quarterly in cash, in arrears, on December 31, March 31, June 30, and September
30 of each year beginning on March 30, 2000, or if any such day is not a
Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (each an "Interest Payment
Date"), to Payee; provided, however, that interest payments hereunder shall be
paid in the manner and at the time provided in the Intercreditor Agreement,
dated as of the date hereof, by and among the Banks, the Purchasers, TW UK and
certain of its Subsidiaries (the "Intercreditor Agreement"). If TW UK is unable
to pay interest in cash on a given Interest Payment Date because TW UK is unable
to satisfy such test, TW UK shall pay interest on this

<PAGE>



Mirror Note in the form of a Mirror PIK Note in an amount equal to the amount of
interest due, but not paid in cash, on the Interest Payment Date. Mirror PIK
Notes shall be deemed to have been issued by TW UK, and its obligations
thereunder shall commence, as of the applicable Interest Payment Date,
irrespective of the actual date of execution and delivery of the Mirror PIK
Notes. All Mirror PIK Notes issued pursuant to this Section 2 shall be due and
payable upon maturity of this Mirror Note and shall bear interest at the same
rate. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 365 day year and the actual
days elapsed. Interest on this Mirror Note will accrue from the most recent date
on which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the
Closing Date. If, due to a change in applicable tax legislation, UK Parent shall
be required to pay such additional sums ("Additional Tax Payment") as set forth
in Section 2.7 of the Purchase Agreement, TW UK shall, prior to the date on
which UK Parent shall be required to pay the Additional Tax Payment, pay to UK
Parent a sum equal to the Additional Tax Payment.

         3.       Further Provisions Relating to Principal and Interest

         3.1      The "record date" shall mean the thirtieth day before the
                  relevant Interest Payment Date or, if such day is not a
                  Business Day, then the next following Business Day and every
                  Payee shall be deemed for the purposes of this Mirror Note to
                  be the holder on such date of the Mirror Notes held by him on
                  such preceding date, notwithstanding any intermediate transfer
                  or transmission of any such Mirror Notes.

         3.2      The amount of interest payable on a Mirror Note shall be
                  rounded up to the nearest penny. The calculation of each
                  interest amount shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
                  final and binding.

         3.3      Interest on the Mirror Notes becoming liable to repayment
                  shall cease to accrue as of the date of actual repayment of
                  such Mirror Notes.

         3.4      Any interest which remains unclaimed after the period ending
                  on the later of (i) the Maturity Date or (ii) six years from
                  the date of first payment shall revert to TW UK
                  notwithstanding that in the intervening period the obligation
                  to pay the same may have been provided for in the books,
                  accounts and the other records of TW UK.

         4.       Method of Payment. TW UK will pay interest on this Mirror Note
to the Person who is the registered Holder of this Mirror Note at the close of
business on the record date for the next Interest Payment Date even if such
Mirror Note is canceled after such record date and on or before such Interest
Payment Date. Payee must surrender this Mirror Note to TW UK to collect
principal payments on such Mirror Note. Except for the payment of interest in
Mirror PIK Notes as permitted in certain circumstances by Section 2 above, TW UK
will pay principal, premium, if any, and interest in pounds sterling. TW UK may
pay principal, premium, if any, and interest by bank transfer of funds or other
funds transfer, or interest by check payable in such money, and any such check
shall be delivered to a Payee's registered address. Every such cheque, warrant
or money order shall be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is
sent (or to such


                                       2


<PAGE>



person as the Payee or joint Payee may in writing direct) and payment of
the cheque, warrant or money order shall be a satisfaction of the principal and
interest represented thereby. If payment is made by a bank or other funds
transfer, TW UK shall be responsible for amounts lost or delayed in the course
of the transfer.

         5.       Optional Redemption. This Mirror Note shall be redeemed by TW
UK immediately prior to any redemption by TW UK as set forth in Section 6.2(c)
of the Purchase Agreement.

         6.       Surrender of Certificate and Prescription. Every Payee any of
whose Mirror Notes are due to be repaid on the Maturity Date under any of the
provisions of this Mirror Note shall, not later than the due date for such
repayment, deliver the relevant certificates for such Mirror Notes or an
agreement satisfactory to TW UK to indemnify TW UK from any losses incurred by
it in connection therewith with respect to such Mirror Note(s) to the registered
office of TW UK or as it shall direct. Unless payment of the amount due to be
repaid has already been made in accordance with Section 4 above, upon such
delivery, TW UK shall pay to the Payee the amount payable to him in respect of
such repayment in accordance with condition 4. If part only of any Mirror
Note(s) as evidenced by the relevant certificate so delivered is then due to be
repaid, TW UK shall either endorse such Mirror Note with a memorandum of the
date and amount paid to the holder of such Mirror Note and return it to the
Payee or shall cancel such Mirror Note and without charge issue to such Payee a
new Mirror Note for the balance of the principal amount due to him.

         7.       Subordination. This Mirror Note shall be subordinated to
certain indebtedness of TW UK and TW UK in accordance with and to the extent
provided in the Intercreditor Agreement.

         8.       Events of Default; Acceleration. Upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default, the principal amount of this Mirror Note, together with all
accrued interest and all other payments due hereunder or under the Mirror PIK
Notes, if any, or the Purchase Agreement, may be declared to be immediately due
and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Purchase
Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, following the
occurrence of an Event of Default, the Payee may proceed to enforce and exercise
its rights by suit in equity, action at law and/or other appropriate means. TW
UK agrees to pay on demand all reasonable costs of collection and all other
reasonable costs and expenses, including without limitation reasonable
attorneys' fees, incurred or paid by the Payee in enforcing or collecting this
Mirror Note upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.

         9.       No Waivers; Amendments. No failure or delay on the part of TW
UK or the Payee in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder or under the
Purchase Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
The remedies provided for herein and in the Purchase Agreement are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any remedies that may be available to TW UK or the
Payee at law or in


                                        3

<PAGE>



equity or otherwise. This Mirror Note may be amended, and the provisions hereof
may be waived only with the express written consent of Payee and TW UK.

         10.      Successor Substituted. Subject to and in accordance with the
Agreement, upon the acquisition of, or any merger, consolidation or other
business combination involving, TW UK or upon the sale, assignment, transfer,
lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of TW UK's
properties and assets (each a "Disposition"), the Surviving Person (if other
than TW UK) resulting from such Disposition shall, if the Holder so elects,
succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
TW UK under the Agreement with the same effect as if such surviving person had
been named as TW UK in the Agreement.

         11.      Register of Mirror Notes

         11.1     The Company shall cause a register to be maintained at the
                  registered office of TW UK (the "Register") showing the amount
                  of the Mirror Notes for the time being issued, the date of
                  issue and the amount of Mirror Notes for the time being

         11.2     Any change of name or address on the part of any holder of
                  Mirror Notes shall forthwith be notified by the holder to TW
                  UK and TW UK shall alter the Register accordingly.

         12.      Notice to Noteholders

                  Mirror Notes) may be served on a Payee by sending the same by

                  bankruptcy of any Payee by sending the same by post, in a
                  prepaid letter addressed to him by name or by the title of the
                  representative or trustee of such Payee, at the address
                  supplied for the purpose by such persons or (until such
                  address is supplied) by giving notice in the manner in which
                  it would have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not
                  occurred.

         13.      Notices to TW UK

         14.      Service of Notices

                  Any notice or document served by post shall be deemed to have
                  been served on the day after it is posted or, if such day is
                  not a Business Day, then on the next following Business Day
                  and in proving such service it shall be sufficient to prove
                  that the letter containing the notice was properly addressed,
                  stamped or posted.

         15.      Recognition of Payee as Absolute Owner

         15.1     Except as required by law, TW UK will recognize the registered
                  holder of any Mirror Notes as the absolute owner thereof and
                  shall not (except as ordered by a court of competent
                  jurisdiction) be bound to take notice or see to the execution

                  usual or common form or in any other form which may be

                  bound to register any transfer permitted under the Purchase
                  Agreement within 14 days after the lodging as the instrument
                  of transfer with TW UK and to enter the name of the transferee
                  on the register of TW UK.

         17.4     Every instrument of Transfer must be lodged for registration
                  at the place where the Register shall for the time being be
                  kept accompanied by the certificate for the Mirror Notes all
                  or part of the nominal amount of which is to be transferred
                  and such other evidence as the Directors or other officers of
                  TW UK authorized to deal with transfers may reasonably require
                  to prove the title of the transferor or his right to transfer
                  the Mirror Notes and, if the instrument of transfer is
                  executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority of
                  the person signing the same.

         17.5     No Transfer shall be registered of Mirror Notes in respect of
                  which a notice requiring repayment has been given.

         17.6     All instruments of Transfer which shall be registered may be
                  retained by TW UK.

         17.7     TW UK hereby acknowledges and covenants that the benefit of
                  the covenants, obligations and conditions on the part of it or
                  binding on it contained in this Mirror Note hereto shall enure
                  to the benefit of each and every holder of the Mirror Notes.

                  Each holder of Mirror Notes shall be entitled to enforce the
                  said covenants, obligations and conditions against TW UK
                  insofar as each of his Mirror Notes is concerned, without the
                  need to join the allottee of any such Mirror Note or any
                  intervening or other holder of Mirror Notes in the proceedings
                  for such enforcement.

         18.      Receipt of Joint Holders. If several Persons are entered in
the Register as joint registered holders of any Mirror Notes then, without
prejudice to paragraph 16 above, the receipt of any one of such Persons for any
interest or principal or other monies in respect of such Mirror Notes shall be
as effective a discharge to TW UK as if the person signing such receipt were the
sole registered holder of such Mirror Notes.

         19.      Replacement of Certificates. If the certificate for any Mirror
Notes is lost, defaced or destroyed, it may be renewed, on such terms (if any)
as to evidence and indemnity as the board of directors may require, but so that
in the case of defacement the defaced certificate shall be surrendered before
the new certificate is issued.

         20.      Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Mirror Note (and any
dispute, controversy, proceedings or claim of whatever nature arising out of or
in any way relating to this Mirror Note or its formation) shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with English law. Each of the parties to this Mirror
Note irrevocably agrees that the courts of England shall have exclusive
jurisdiction to hear and decide any suit, action or proceedings and/or settle
any disputes, which


                                       6

<PAGE>



may arise out of or in connection with this Mirror Note and, for these purposes,
each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of England.
Each of the parties to this Mirror Note irrevocably waives any objection which
it might at any time have to the courts of England being nominated as the forum
to hear and decide and/or settle any such matter and agrees not to claim that
the courts of England are not a convenient or appropriate forum for any such
matter and further irrevocably agrees that a judgment in any such matter brought
in any court referred to in this Section 21 shall be conclusive and binding upon
the parties and may be enforced in the courts of any other jurisdiction.

         21. Successors. Any person who becomes entitled to any Mirror Note
(whether by operation of law, transfer or otherwise) shall be bound by every
notice given in respect of that Mirror Note before its name and address is
entered on the Register.

         22. Entire Agreement. This Mirror Note and all other documents
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement embody the entire agreement and understanding between the Holder and
TW UK and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to the
subject matter hereof.

9.     ACCESSION AND UNDERTAKINGS OF HEDGE COUNTERPARTIES

9.1    ACCESSION OF HEDGE COUNTERPARTIES
       If there are no Hedge Counterparties specified in Schedule 2 (The Hedge
       Counterparties) then the provisions of this Deed relating to Hedge
       Counterparties will not come into effect until such time as a Senior
       Lender or Approved Affiliate Senior Lender enters into a Treasury
       Transaction with any member of the Group and executes and delivers to the
       Security Agent a Deed of Accession undertaking to be bound as a Hedge
       Counterparty by all the provisions of this Deed. No Senior Lender or
       Approved Affiliate Senior Lender will be entitled to share in any of the
       security constituted by the Security Documents in respect of the Hedging
       Liabilities unless and until it has executed and delivered to the
       Security Agent a Deed of Accession. Forthwith upon delivery of a Deed of
       Accession to the Security Agent a Hedge Counterparty will acquire all its
       rights and assume all its obligations under this Deed.

                                      -16-
<PAGE>

       Notwithstanding the foregoing, no person may become a Hedge Counterparty
       unless it is a Senior Lender or Approved Affiliate Senior Lender.

9.2    UNDERTAKINGS OF HEDGE COUNTERPARTIES
       Until the Senior Discharge Date, except as the Majority Senior Lenders
       have previously consented in writing, no Hedge Counterparty will:

       9.2.1  demand (other than as may be necessary in order to exercise any
              right to terminate or close out any Treasury Transaction as
              provided in and permitted under sub-clause 9.2.2) or receive
              payment, prepayment or repayment of, or any distribution in
              respect of or on account of, any of the Hedging Liabilities in
              cash or in kind or apply any money or property in or towards the
              discharge of any Hedging Liabilities except:

              (a)    for scheduled payments arising under the original terms of
                     the Hedging Documents (without regard to any amendment made
                     after the date of those Hedging Documents other than those
                     permitted by the terms of this Deed); and/or

              (b)    for the proceeds of enforcement of the Security Documents
                     received and applied in the order permitted by Clause 24
                     (Appropriation);

       9.2.2  exercise any right it might otherwise have pursuant to any Hedging
              Agreement to terminate any hedging transactions under such Hedging
              Agreement or to refuse to make any payment due from it thereunder
              until service of a notice by the Senior Agent under clause 27.21
              (Acceleration and Cancellation) of the Senior Facility Agreement;

       9.2.3  discharge all or any part of the Hedging Liabilities by set-off,
              any right of combination of accounts or otherwise except if and to
              the extent that those Hedging Liabilities are permitted to be paid
              under sub-clause 9.2.1(a);

       9.2.4  take, accept or receive the benefit of any Encumbrance or
              guarantee in respect of the Hedging Liabilities other than under
              the Security Documents or any other Encumbrance or guarantee
              granted for the full benefit of the Senior Lenders and the Hedge
              Counterparties in accordance with the ranking specified in this
              Deed.

9.3    TWO WAY PAYMENTS
       Each Borrower and each Hedge Counterparty agrees that:

       9.3.1  any Hedging Agreement to which it is at any time party governing
              the terms of a hedging transaction will provide for "two-way
              payments" in the event of a termination of that hedging
              transaction whether upon a Termination Event or an Event of
              Default (each as defined therein), meaning that the defaulting
              party under that Hedging Agreement will be entitled to receive
              payment under the relevant termination provisions if the net
              replacement value of all terminated transactions affected under
              the Hedging Agreement is in its favour;


                                      -17-
<PAGE>

       9.3.2  if on termination of any hedging transaction under any Hedging
              Agreement to which it is a party a settlement amount or other
              amount falls due from the Hedge Counterparty to any Borrower then,
              if the security constituted by the Security Documents has become
              enforceable, that amount shall be paid by such Hedge Counterparty
              to the Security Agent and treated as proceeds of enforcement of
              the security conferred by the Security Documents for application
              in the order prescribed in this Deed;

       9.3.3  the Hedge Counterparty will promptly (and in any event within 5
              business days of the relevant event) exercise any rights it may
              have to terminate the hedging transactions under the Hedging
              Documents, unless the Majority Senior Lenders otherwise agree or
              require, on the date on which the Senior Agent has served a notice
              on the occurrence of a Senior Event of Default declaring that all
              of the Senior Liabilities have become prematurely due and payable
              under the Senior Documents; and

       9.3.4  if the Senior Discharge Date has occurred or would have occurred
              but for the fact that Hedging Liabilities only remain outstanding,
              the Mezzanine Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority
              Mezzanine Lenders) may by notice to any Obligor which is party to
              any Hedging Agreement require such Obligor to terminate or procure
              the termination of all outstanding hedging transactions under the
              Hedging Documents in relation to any Hedge Counterparty if that
              Hedge Counterparty is requiring any Mezzanine Lender to refrain
              from taking any step which, but for the provisions of this Deed it
              would not have been prevented from taking or requiring it to do
              anything but for this Deed it would not have to do.

9.4    HEDGING DOCUMENTS

       9.4.1  The Borrower and each Hedge Counterparty shall ensure that each
              Hedging Agreement to which it is a party shall include as an Event
              of Default (as therein defined) a Senior Event of Default and a
              Mezzanine Event of Default;

       9.4.2  each Hedge Counterparty will provide to the Security Agent copies
              of all documents constituting the Hedging Documents as soon as
              reasonably practicable.

9.5    CHANGES TO HEDGING DOCUMENTS
       Except as the Majority Senior Lenders have previously consented in
       writing, no Borrower or Hedge Counterparty will amend, vary, supplement
       (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, entering into any transactions
       pursuant thereto) or allow to be superseded any provision of the Hedging
       Documents which would result in:

       9.5.1  any provision in the Hedging Documents being amended unless the
              Hedge Counterparty concerned acting reasonably and in good faith
              certifies that it considers such amendment does not impose
              restrictions or obligations or conditions on any Borrower which
              are more onerous than those originally provided for in the Hedging
              Documents;


                                      -18-
<PAGE>

       9.5.2    any payment under the Hedging Documents being required to be
                made by a Borrower earlier than the date originally provided for
                in the Hedging Documents; or

       9.5.3    any Borrower becoming liable to make an additional payment (or
                increase an existing payment) under any of the Hedging Documents
                which liability does not arise from the original provisions of
                the Hedging Documents.

9.6    OTHER HEDGING DOCUMENTS
       In the event that any Borrower wishes to enter into a Hedging Agreement
       with a bank or financial institution (a "TREASURY BANK") which is not a
       Hedge Counterparty or an Approved Affiliate Senior Lender, such Borrower:

       9.6.1    confirms and acknowledges that a Treasury Bank will not have the
                benefit of this Deed or any of the Security Documents; and

       9.6.2    undertakes to ensure that any Hedging Agreement entered into
                with a Treasury Bank complies with the requirements of
                sub-clause 9.3.1 of Clause 9.3 (Two Way Payments).

10.    UNDERTAKINGS IN RESPECT OF THE SENIOR LIABILITIES

10.1   MATERIAL VARIATIONS
       Subject to Clause 10.2 (Postponed Senior Liabilities) each of the Senior
       Agent and the Senior Lenders agrees with the Mezzanine Agent and the
       Mezzanine Lenders that, unless the Majority Mezzanine Lenders otherwise
       consent in writing:

       10.1.1   neither the Senior Agent nor the Senior Lenders nor any of them
                will agree to any variation to the Senior Facility Agreement
                falling within paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of the definition of
                "MATERIAL VARIATION"; and

       10.1.2   neither the Senior Agent nor the Senior Lenders nor any of them
                will agree to any deferral of any scheduled or mandatory
                repayment or prepayment or extend the Final Maturity Date for

10.2    POSTPONED SENIOR LIABILITIES
       It is hereby understood that any breach of the provisions of Clause 10.1
       (Material Variations) shall result in any increased principal amount of
       the Senior Liabilities being ranked, for all purposes of this Deed and
       the Security Documents, behind the Mezzanine Liabilities. The Senior
       Agent and the Senior Lenders shall be permitted at any time (and still
       preserve their priority over the Mezzanine Liabilities in respect
       thereof):

       (a)      to increase the principal amount (in excess of the Commitments
                originally stated of the Senior Banks) under the Senior Facility
                Agreement by, in aggregate an amount of, up to (pounds sterling)
                6,500,000 (less the aggregate principal amount

                                      -19-
<PAGE>

                of any scheduled or mandatory repayment or prepayment which has
                been deferred for more than 12 months);

       (b)      to extend the date on which any principal amount is to be paid
                provided the date of such extension is not beyond the Final
                Maturity Date for the Mezzanine Liabilities, or to bring such
                date forward;

       (c)      to be paid additional fees in respect of any amendments, waivers
                or consents to the Senior Documents; and

       (d)      to provide additional amounts to fund any acquisition of assets
                or share in any business and/or companies (which are similar in
                nature and scope to the business of the Group at the time of
                such acquisition) by any member of the Group.

       Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 10.1 (Material Variations) or
       this Clause 10.2, on or after the occurrence of a Senior Event of
       Default, the Senior Agent and/or the Senior Lenders shall be entitled to
       agree to any amendment, supplement or novation to the Senior Documents
       without prejudicing the priority created thereby.

10.3   UNDERTAKINGS OF SENIOR LENDERS
       Each of the Senior Agent and the Senior Lenders agrees with the Mezzanine
       Agent and the Mezzanine Lenders that it will not prior to the Mezzanine
       Discharge Date, unless the Majority Mezzanine Lenders otherwise consent
       in writing:

       10.3.1   permit or require any Obligor or any other member of the Group
                to pay, repay, prepay, redeem, purchase, defease or otherwise
                acquire or satisfy in any manner the whole or any part of the
                principal and any of the Postponed Senior Liabilities save to
                the extent permitted or contemplated by Clause 12 (Payments) or
                otherwise take or receive from any member of the Group any
                payment (whether in cash, by way of set off or otherwise) in
                respect thereof save to the extent permitted or contemplated by
                Clause 12 (Payments);

       10.3.2   (other than under the Security Documents executed in favour of
                the Security Agent and/or the Common Representative) take,
                accept or receive the benefit of any Encumbrance or guarantee in
                respect of the Postponed Senior Liabilities unless (a) first or
                at the same time there is conferred on the Mezzanine Lenders the
                benefit (ranking first in point of security) of such Encumbrance
                or guarantee in such manner and such form as the Mezzanine Agent
                may require or (b) the Mezzanine Agent shall have declined to
                take the benefit of such Encumbrance or guarantee and shall have
                notified such decision to the Senior Agent in writing and in any
                event (c) the Mezzanine Agent shall have received a legal
                opinion in form and substance satisfactory to the Mezzanine
                Agent stating that the Encumbrances constituted by the Security
                Documents and the ranking created hereby will not thereby be
                prejudiced;

       10.3.3   discharge or seek to discharge all or any part of the Postponed
                Senior Liabilities by set-off, any right of combination of
                accounts or otherwise; or

                                      -20-

                contemplated of the Postponed Senior Liabilities by this Deed
                may be impaired,

       PROVIDED THAT nothing in this Clause 10.3 shall prevent any enforcement
       of the Security Documents by or on behalf of the Senior Agent and/or the
       Senior Lenders in respect of the Senior Liabilities.

19.    PERMITTED ENFORCEMENT

19.1   MEZZANINE ENFORCEMENT NOTICE
       If any Mezzanine Event of Default occurs (otherwise than as a direct
       result of a breach by any Mezzanine Lender of its obligations under the
       Mezzanine Documents) and being a Mezzanine Event of Default which the
       Mezzanine Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Mezzanine
       Lenders) certifies to the Senior Lenders as being material in the opinion
       of the Majority Mezzanine Lenders, the Mezzanine Agent may by written
       notice to the Senior Agent specifying the Mezzanine Event of Default (a
       "MEZZANINE ENFORCEMENT NOTICE") request the Senior Agent to inform the
       Mezzanine Agent whether it is proposed to enforce the security conferred
       by the Security Documents.

19.2   MEZZANINE ENFORCEMENT
       If the Senior Agent within 60 days of such notice informs the Mezzanine
       Agent that it is proposed to enforce the Security Documents or if the
       Senior Agent does not respond within such 60 days, and if in either case
       the Senior Lenders are entitled to procure enforcement of the Security at
       that time and subject to Clause 21.3 (Manner of Mezzanine Enforcement),
       then promptly thereafter the Senior Lenders will instruct the Security
       Agent to enforce the Security and the Security Agent will enforce the
       Security Documents by the taking of such steps as it deems appropriate in
       accordance with its powers and duties including taking action in its own
       name failing which the Mezzanine Agent may so instruct the Security Agent
       and the Security Agent shall so enforce.

19.3   ENFORCEMENT BY MEZZANINE LENDERS
       If the Senior Agent informs the Mezzanine Agent within such 60 days that
       it is not proposed to enforce the Security Documents, then, not earlier
       than 90 days, in the case of a Mezzanine Event of Default relating to
       failure to pay an amount (whether of principal, interest, fees or
       otherwise) due under the Mezzanine Documents, or 120 days, in the case of
       a Mezzanine Event of Default relating to a breach of the financial
       covenants contained in Clause 17 (Financial Condition) of the Mezzanine
       Facility Agreement or 150 days, in the case of any other Mezzanine Event
       of Default, after the service of the Enforcement Notice (each such period
       being a "MEZZANINE STANDSTILL PERIOD") and PROVIDED THAT the same
       Mezzanine Event of Default (by reference to the same event or
       circumstance) referred to in such Enforcement Notice is continuing at the
       expiry of the Mezzanine Standstill Period and subject to Clause 21.3
       (Manner of Enforcement), the Mezzanine Agent may declare the Mezzanine
       Liabilities due and payable and require the Secured Beneficiaries to
       instruct the Security Agent to enforce and the Security Agent will
       enforce the Security Documents by the taking of such steps

                                      -34-

       as the Security Agent deems appropriate in accordance with its powers and
       duties including, by taking action in its own name.

19.4   DEMANDS AGAINST MEZZANINE GUARANTORS
       The Mezzanine Lenders (or the Mezzanine Agent) may not make any demand on
       or take any other action against any Obligor in relation to the Mezzanine
       Liabilities in circumstances which would otherwise be permitted by this
       Clause 19 (Permitted Enforcement) where the Security Agent (or any
       receiver appointed pursuant to any of the Security Documents), acting on
       the instructions of the Majority Senior Lenders and in accordance with
       the terms hereof, confirms to the Mezzanine Lenders in writing that it is
       enforcing or taking steps to enforce security or has enforced security
       conferred by any of the Security Documents over the shares of such
       Obligor or over the shares of any holding company of such Obligor by
       selling or procuring the sale of all such shares (or rights relating
       thereto) which are subject to such security, and has not subsequently
       notified the Mezzanine Lenders (or the Mezzanine Agent) to the contrary
       in writing (and, if applicable, the Security Agent undertakes to notify
       or procure that any such receiver (or similar officer in any
       jurisdiction) notifies the Mezzanine Lenders (or the Mezzanine Agent)
       promptly upon such enforcement being discontinued).

19.5   INSOLVENCY OF A MEZZANINE OBLIGOR
       If an insolvency proceeding, winding-up, liquidation or dissolution is
       begun and not discharged within the remedy period specified in the
       Mezzanine Facility Agreement in relation to the Mezzanine Borrower or any
       Mezzanine Guarantor, the Mezzanine Agent may at any time thereafter
       notify the Senior Agent thereof and then (subject to Clause 21 (Manner of
       Enforcement)) the Senior Agent shall require the Secured Beneficiaries to
       instruct the Security Agent to enforce, the Mezzanine Agent may declare
       the Mezzanine Liabilities due and payable and the Security Agent will,
       acting pursuant to its Powers of Attorney, enforce the Security
       Documents, whereupon the Secured Beneficiaries shall promptly instruct
       the Security Agent to enforce and the Security Agent will, acting
       pursuant to its Powers of Attorney, enforce the Security Documents (if
       entitled to do so) by the taking of such steps as the Senior Agent may
       instruct.

19.6   MEZZANINE ENFORCEMENT FOLLOWING ACCELERATION OF SENIOR DEBT
       Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Clause 19, on an
       acceleration of the Senior Liabilities pursuant to Clause 24.23

       Mezzanine Agent and Mezzanine Lenders may immediately accelerate the
       Mezzanine Liabilities.

                ENFORCEMENT NOTICE"), inform the Security Agent that one or more
                Subordinated Noteholders wishes to exercise their rights under
                Article VII or, as the case may be, Article VIII of the
                Securities Purchase Agreement. Following the receipt of the
                Subordinated Enforcement Notice by the Security

                on their behalf) may take action against the Subordinated Note
                Issuer (including the commencement of legal proceedings) seeking
                specific performance or, as the case may, an injunction in order
                to ensure compliance with the Subordinated Note Documents but
                shall not seek any damages or other monetary amounts. Without
                prejudice to the foregoing, if any amount of damages or other
                monetary amount is declared or awarded such amount shall not be
                paid and shall be treated as a Subordinated Liability.

                       Postponed Senior Liabilities) in priority to the
                       Mezzanine Liabilities, regardless of the date upon which
                       the Senior Liabilities arise, regardless of whether a
                       Senior Lender is obliged to advance monies included in
                       the Senior Liabilities, and regardless of any
                       fluctuations in the amount of Senior Liabilities
                       outstanding or any intermediate discharge of the Senior
                       Liabilities in whole or in part.

       23.1.2   The Security conferred by the Security Documents on the Secured
                Beneficiaries will, to the extent that it secures the Mezzanine
                Liabilities:

                (a)    rank in all respects prior to any existing and future
                       security conferred by the Security Documents on the
                       Senior Lenders but only to the extent that such security
                       only secures Postponed Senior Liabilities; and

                (b)    secure all the Mezzanine Liabilities in priority to the
                       Postponed Senior Liabilities, regardless of the date upon
                       which the Mezzanine Liabilities arise, regardless of
                       whether a Mezzanine Lender is obliged to advance monies
                       included in the Mezzanine Liabilities, and regardless of
                       any fluctuations in the amount of the Mezzanine
                       Liabilities outstanding or any intermediate discharge of
                       the Mezzanine Liabilities in whole or in part.

23.2   LENDERS TO CO-OPERATE
       The Mezzanine Agent and each Lender will take such action as the Senior
       Agent may reasonably request with a view to reflecting the priority of
       the security conferred by the Security Documents in any register or with
       any filing or registration authority and in giving notice to insurers,
       debtors liable for receivables covered by the security conferred by the
       Security Documents and other persons.

       by this Deed) irrevocably authorises prior to the Senior Discharge Date,
       the Senior Agent and thereafter, the Mezzanine Agent to agree, on its
       behalf with any other person intended

                                      -46-
<PAGE>

       to become a party hereto as a Lender to the execution of a Deed of
       Accession so as to make such person a party to this Deed as a Lender. The
       parties hereto agree that this authorisation is given to secure the
       interests of the parties under this Deed and is accordingly irrevocable.

35.2   DEED OF ACCESSION
       The parties hereto agree that none of the Senior Lenders, the Mezzanine
       Lenders, the Subordinated Noteholders, the Mirror Noteholder or, as the
       case may be, the Intra-Group Lenders will assign or transfer to any
       person the whole or any part of their rights or obligations in respect of
       the Senior Liabilities or the Mezzanine Liabilities, the Subordinated
       Liabilities, the Mirror Note Liabilities or, as the case may be, the
       Intra-Group Liabilities unless the assignee or transferee previously or
       simultaneously agrees with the other parties hereto to be bound by the
       provisions of this Deed as if it was named herein and subject to the same
       rights and obligations (mutatis mutandis) as the Senior Lenders, the
       Mezzanine Lenders, the Subordinated Noteholders, the Mirror Noteholder
       or, as the case may be, the Intra-Group Lenders and executes and
       delivers, prior to the Senior Discharge Date, to the Security Agent and
       thereafter, the Mezzanine Agent, a Deed of Accession. In the event that
       any person not already a party hereto acquires by way of subrogation or
       otherwise any right or interest in the Mezzanine Liabilities, the
       Subordinated Liabilities, the Mirror Note Liabilities or, as the case may
       be, the Intra-Group Liabilities, the Lender previously entitled to such
       rights or interest shall procure that such person shall enter into a Deed
       of Accession so as to become party hereto as a Mezzanine Lender,
       Subordinated Noteholder, Mirror Noteholder or, as the case may be,
       Intra-Group Lender.

35.3   NO TRANSFER OF MIRROR LIABILITIES
       The Mirror Noteholder undertakes not to assign, transfer or otherwise
       create any rights or interest in any of the Mirror Liabilities (otherwise
       than under the Security Documents).

35.4   ACCESSION AS AN OBLIGOR
       If any person becomes liable for (except as a provider) any of the
       Liabilities, the Parent will procure that such person will become a party
       hereto as an Obligor by the execution of a Deed of Accession. The Parent
       shall not permit any person to become a guarantor or otherwise liable for
       (except as a provider) any of the Mezzanine Liabilities, the Subordinated
       Liabilities, the Mirror Note Liabilities or the Intra-Group Liabilities
       unless the prior written consent of the Senior Agent shall first have
       been obtained.

35.5   NO DETACHMENT OF WARRANTS
       Each of the Subordinated Noteholders undertakes that it will not assign,
       transfer or otherwise create any rights or interest in any of the
       Subordinated Notes in favour of any person unless it assigns, transfers
       or otherwise creates rights with respect to an equivalent number of
       Warrants in favour of the same person.

36.    THE SECURITY AGENT

36.1   APPOINTMENT OF SECURITY AGENT
       Each of the Beneficiaries hereby appoints the Security Agent to act as
       its trustee in connection herewith and authorises the Security Agent to
       exercise such rights, powers and discretions as are specifically
       delegated to the Security Agent by the terms hereof together with all
       rights, powers and discretions as are reasonably incidental thereto or
       necessary to give effect to the trusts hereby created and each of the
       Secured Beneficiaries irrevocably authorises the Security Agent on its
       behalf to enter into any and each Security Document.

36.2   TRUST PROPERTY
       The Security Agent shall stand possessed of any Secured Property (or any
       proceeds thereof) received by it upon trust for the benefit of the
       Secured Beneficiaries on the terms and subject to the conditions set out
       in this Deed. It is hereby agreed that, in relation to any jurisdiction
       the courts of which would not recognise or give effect to the trust
       expressed to be created by this Deed, the relationship of the Secured
       Beneficiaries to the Security Agent shall be construed as one of
       principal and agent but, to the extent permissible under the laws of such
       jurisdiction, all the other provisions of this Deed shall have full force
       and effect between the parties hereto.

36.3   DIRECTIONS
       The Secured Beneficiaries shall not exercise any independent power which
       they may have to enforce the Security Documents or to exercise any
       rights, discretions or powers or to grant any consents or releases under
       or pursuant to the Security Documents or otherwise exercise direct
       recourse to the security constituted by the Security Documents except
       through the Security Agent either acting on its own behalf or acting
       pursuant to its Powers of Attorney. Subject to Clause 36.9 (Provision of
       Directions and Information) (and subject to its being indemnified to its
       satisfaction), the Security Agent shall take such action (including,
       without limitation, the exercise of all rights, discretions or powers and
       the granting of consents or releases) or, as the case may be, refrain
       from taking such action under or pursuant to this Deed and the Security
       Documents as the Senior Agent or, subject to the terms hereof, the
       Mezzanine Agent shall specifically direct the Security Agent in writing
       (and so that only the Senior Agent or, subject to the terms hereof, the
       Mezzanine Agent shall be entitled to give any such directions to the
       Security Agent. Unless and until the Security Agent shall have received
       such directions, the Security Agent shall not take any action under this
       Deed or the Security Documents. The provisions of the preceding two
       sentences of this Clause shall not apply where the terms of the Security
       Documents entitle the Security Agent to take, or refrain from taking, any
       action and in any such case the Security Agent shall be entitled to take
       or, as the case may be, refrain from taking such action without reference
       to (and notwithstanding any contrary direction from) the Senior Agent or
       the Mezzanine Agent.

36.4   EXERCISE OF POWERS OF ENFORCEMENT
       Subject to Clause 36.3 (Directions), at any time after the Security
       Documents have become so enforceable in accordance with their respective
       terms, the Security Agent

                                      -48-
<PAGE>

       shall, acting on the written directions of the Senior Agent or, subject
       to the terms hereof, the Mezzanine Agent (but not otherwise), either
       acting on its own behalf pursuant to its Powers of Attorney, exercise all
       powers of enforcement of the security conferred by or pursuant to the
       Security Documents in accordance with such directions but not otherwise.

36.5   NO OTHER ACTION
       The Security Agent shall not be required to take any action or exercise
       any rights, remedies, powers or discretions under or in connection with
       this Deed beyond those which the Senior Agent or, subject to the terms
       hereof, the Mezzanine Agent shall specifically instruct the Security
       Agent in writing to take or exercise and then only to the extent stated
       in the Senior Agent's or, as the case may be, the Mezzanine Agent's
       specific instructions in writing.

36.6   SECURITY AGENT'S ASSUMPTIONS
       The Security Agent shall be entitled to assume that any instructions or
       certificates received by it from the Senior Agent or the Mezzanine Agent
       under or pursuant to this Deed are (a) given in accordance with the
       provisions of this Deed and (b) given, where appropriate, in accordance
       with directions of persons or the provisions of agreements by which the
       Senior Agent or the Mezzanine Agent (as the case may be) is bound and the
       Security Agent shall not be liable to any other person for any action
       taken or omitted under or in connection with this Deed in accordance with
       any such instructions or certificates unless caused by its gross
       negligence or wilful misconduct.

36.7   IDENTITY OF AGENTS
       The Security Agent shall be entitled (and bound) to assume that the
       identity of the Senior Agent and the Mezzanine Agent is as notified to it
       at the date of this Deed, unless and until it is notified otherwise by
       both the retiring such Senior Agent or Mezzanine Agent and the successor
       agent in writing together with the date from which the change becomes
       effective. The Security Agent shall be entitled to rely upon and assume
       that any such notification is authentic and shall not be liable for any
       loss occasioned by so assuming or relying.

36.8   MODIFICATION TO SECURITY DOCUMENTS
       On the instructions of the Senior Agent or, after the Senior Discharge
       Date, the Mezzanine Agent, the Security Agent shall concur with the
       Parent in making any modification to the Security Documents which:

       36.8.1   in the opinion of the Senior Agent or, after the Senior
                Discharge Date, the Mezzanine Agent, it may be expedient to make
                and such modification will not be prejudicial to the interests
                of any of the Secured Beneficiaries; or

       36.8.2   is necessary to correct a manifest error.

       Any such modification shall be promptly notified to the Secured
       Beneficiaries by the Senior Agent or the Mezzanine Agent (as the case may
       be) and shall be binding on all the Secured Beneficiaries. For the
       purposes of this Clause (a) the execution of a

                                      -49-
<PAGE>

       Security Document by a Borrower and (b) the release from the security
       constituted by the Security Documents of any property which may be so
       released shall be deemed not to constitute a modification.

36.9   PROVISION OF DIRECTIONS AND INFORMATION
       The parties hereto (other than the Security Agent) (whether direct or
       through the Senior Agent) shall provide the Security Agent with all
       necessary directions and information as it may reasonably require for the
       purposes of carrying out its duties and obligations under this Deed.

36.10  NO DUTY OR RESPONSIBILITY
       The Security Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility, either
       initially or on a continuing basis:

       36.10.1  to provide any Beneficiaries with any information with respect
                to any Borrower whenever coming into its possession or to
                provide any other person with any communication received by it
                under or in connection with this Deed; or

       36.10.2  to investigate the application of sums distributed pursuant to
                Clause 24 (Appropriation).

36.11  FURTHER ACTS
       On the instructions of the Senior Agent or, after the Senior Discharge
       Date, the Mezzanine Agent, the Security Agent shall be entitled to agree
       to and execute and perform any documents and do such other acts or things
       as may in the opinion of the Senior Agent or, after the Senior Discharge
       Date, the Mezzanine Agent be necessary or expedient to give effect to the
       provisions of Clauses 30 (Amendments), 32 (New Intra-Group Lenders and
       Borrowers), 34.9 (Agent Resignation) and 35 (Assignments and Transfers).

36.12  FORMAL NOTICES
       The Security Agent shall, as soon as practicable upon receipt, send to
       the Senior Agent and the Mezzanine Agent copies of each formal notice
       received by it as Security Agent from the Parent or any Borrower.

36.13  NO DELEGATION
       The Security Agent may not delegate any power, trust, authority or
       discretion vested in it by this Deed and/or the Security Documents to any
       other person without the prior written consent of the Senior Agent or,
       after the Senior Discharge Date, the Mezzanine Agent.

36.14   SECURITY AGENT'S DISCRETIONS
       It is expressly declared (which in so far as relates to the discretions
       of the Security Agent shall operate by way of supplement to the Trustee
       Act 1925) as follows:

       36.14.1  the Security Agent may in relation to any of the provisions of
                this Deed act or rely upon the opinion or advice of or any
                information obtained from any

                other expert commissioned by the Security Agent and the Security
                Agent shall not be responsible for any loss occasioned by so
                acting or relying;

       36.14.2  any opinion, advice or information obtained pursuant to
                sub-clause 36.14.1 may be sent or obtained by letter, telex
                message, facsimile transmission, telephone or any other means
                and the Security Agent shall not be liable for acting on any
                opinion, advice or information purporting to be so conveyed
                although the same shall contain some error or shall not be
                authentic;

       36.14.3  the Security Agent shall be at liberty to accept as sufficient
                evidence a certificate signed or purported to be signed on
                behalf of the Senior Agent or, subject to the terms hereof, the
                Mezzanine Agent (on behalf of the Mezzanine Lenders) to the
                effect that any particular dealing, transaction, step or thing
                is, in the opinion of the Senior Agent or, subject to the terms
                hereof, the Mezzanine Agent (on behalf of the Mezzanine
                Lenders), suitable or expedient or as to any other fact or
                matter upon which the Security Agent may require to be satisfied
                and the Security Agent shall not be in any way bound to call for
                further evidence or to be responsible for any loss that may be
                occasioned by acting on any such certificate;

       36.14.4  the Security Agent may refrain from doing anything which would
                or might in its opinion be contrary to any law of any
                jurisdiction or any directive or regulation of any agency of any
                state or which would or might otherwise render it liable to any

                to comply with any such law, directive or regulation;

       36.14.5  the Security Agent shall not be liable for any failure, omission

                wilful misconduct;

       36.14.6  the Security Agent and every attorney, agent or other person
                appointed by it under or in connection with this Deed shall be
                entitled to be indemnified out of amounts received by the
                Security Agent under this Deed against all liabilities and
                expenses properly incurred in the execution of any power, trust,
                authority or discretion in connection with this Deed and against
                all actions, proceedings, costs, claims and demands in respect

       36.14.8  the Security Agent shall have full power to determine all
                questions and doubts arising in relation to the interpretation
                or application of any of the provisions of this Deed as it

                good faith (whether made upon a question actually raised or
                implied in the acts or proceedings of the Security Agent) shall
                be conclusive and shall bind the other parties hereto;

       36.14.9  the Security Agent (in the conduct of the trusts hereof
                (otherwise than in relation to its right to make any
                declaration, determination or decision)) may instead of acting
                personally employ and pay an agent (whether being a lawyer or

                Agent or the Senior Agent or the Mezzanine Agent or any of the
                Secured Beneficiaries) or company whose business includes
                undertaking the safe custody of documents or solicitors or firm
                of solicitors and may on the instructions of the Senior Agent
                or, subject to the terms hereof, the Mezzanine Agent make any

                Borrower or its lawyers or auditors access to or possession of
                such title deeds and other documents when necessary or
                convenient and the Security Agent shall not be responsible for

36.15  PARTIES PERFORMING OBLIGATIONS
       The Security Agent may assume without enquiry (in the absence of
       knowledge by or an express notice to it to the contrary acquired or
       received by it in its capacity as Security Agent hereunder) that each of
       the parties hereto is duly performing and observing all its obligations
       contained in this Deed.

36.16  OTHER CAPACITY AND BUSINESS
       The Security Agent may, from time to time, be a Secured Beneficiary or
       act in any other capacity and shall in such event be entitled,
       notwithstanding that it is also Security Agent, to take, or refrain from
       taking, any action which it would be entitled so to take if it was not
       the Security Agent and shall not be precluded, by virtue of its position
       as a Secured Beneficiary or acting in any other capacity, from exercising
       any of its discretions, powers and duties as Security Agent. The Security
       Agent may enter into any financial or business contracts or any other
       transaction or arrangement with any Obligor or any other person and the
       Security Agent shall not be in any way accountable to such Obligor or any
       other person for any profits or benefits arising from any such contract
       or transaction.

36.17  POWERS CONFERRED BY GENERAL LAW
       The powers, trusts, authorities and discretions conferred upon the
       Security Agent by this Deed shall be in addition to any which may from
       time to time be vested in the Security Agent by the general law or
       otherwise.

36.18   ADDITIONAL TRUSTEES

       36.18.1  The statutory power to appoint new or additional trustees hereof
                shall be vested in the Security Agent. A trust corporation may
                be appointed as sole trustee hereof.

       36.18.2  The Security Agent hereof may retire at any time and without
                being responsible for the costs occasioned by such retirement.
                Prior to confirmation by the Senior Agent that the Senior
                Liabilities have been irrevocably discharged in full and the
                Mezzanine Agent that the Mezzanine Liabilities have been
                irrevocably discharged in full, the retirement of a Security
                Agent shall not take effect until the appointment of a new
                Security Agent has been made and accepted by the Senior Agent
                and the Mezzanine Agent (in each case acting reasonably) and the
                Security Agent and the new Security Agent shall have executed
                all deeds and documents as are necessary to effect such
                appointment and the transfer of the Security Agent's rights and
                obligations in respect hereof in a legal, valid and binding
                manner.

       36.18.3  The Senior Agent or, after the Senior Discharge Date, the
                Mezzanine Agent may require the Security Agent to retire at any
                time, upon 60 days prior written notice. The Security Agent

        unissued shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors and they may
        allot, grant options over or otherwise dispose of them to such persons,
        at such times, and on such terms as they think proper and Section 89 of
        the Act shall not apply.

                                     SHARES

6.1     Except for Permitted Transfers, the Directors may, in their absolute
        discretion and without giving any reason, decline to register the

        to be accompanied by the relevant share certificates. The Directors
        shall be bound to register any Permitted Transfer within 14 days after

                business entity may transfer for any consideration whatsoever
                all of the shares registered in its name to any other company
                (in these Articles called an "ASSOCIATED COMPANY") which is an
                Affiliate of that member, a holding company of that member or
                which is a subsidiary of that member or which is another
                subsidiary of such a holding company (the expressions
                "SUBSIDIARY" and "HOLDING COMPANY" having the meanings given to
                them respectively in section 736 of the Act) provided that if at
                any time the transferor and transferee cease to be so associated
                for any reason other than a change in general partner, manager
                or advisor, the transferee shall forthwith transfer to the
                transferor the shares then registered in its name;

        (b)     which is a company, a limited or general partnership or other
                business entity may transfer for any consideration whatsoever
                any of the shares registered in its name to any limited partner

        partners in connection with a winding-up of its affairs.

                name; and

        (b)     the Lead Investors and Transworld Holdings (UK) Limited may
                transfer shares registered in their respective names so long as
                after giving effect to such transfer they continue to hold (i)
                in the case of the Lead Investors, at least a majority of the
                Institutional Investment and (ii) in the case of Transworld
                Holdings (UK) Limited, at least 24,000,001 shares.

                                   PRE-EMPTION


7.1     Except in the case of a Permitted Transfer (to which the provisions of
        this Article 7 shall not apply), any member who wishes to transfer
        shares (the "SELLER") shall give notice in writing (the "TRANSFER
        NOTICE") to the Company of his wish specifying:

        (a)     the number and class(es) of shares which he wishes to transfer
                (the "SALE SHARES");

        (b)     the name of any third party to whom he proposes to sell or
                transfer the shares;

        (c)     the price at which he wishes to transfer the shares (which shall
                be deemed to be the Fair Market Value if no price is specified)
                (the "TRANSFER PRICE"); and

        (d)     whether or not the Transfer Notice is conditional upon all, and
                not part only, of the shares so specified being sold pursuant to
                the offer hereinafter mentioned and, in the absence of such
                stipulation, it shall be deemed not be so conditional.

7.2     Where any Transfer Notice is deemed to have been given in accordance
        with these Articles, the deemed Transfer Notice shall be treated as
        having specified:

        (a)     that all the shares registered in the name of the Seller shall
                be included for transfer;

        (b)     that the price for the shares shall be as agreed between the
                Board and the Seller or, failing agreement, shall be the Fair
                Market Value; and

        (c)     that no condition as referred to in Article 7.1(d) shall apply.

7.3     Unless otherwise agreed by the members and the Company in writing, no
        Transfer Notice once given or deemed to have been given in accordance
        with these Articles shall be withdrawn.

7.4     The Transfer Notice shall constitute the Company the agent of the Seller
        for the sale of the Sale Shares specified therein at the Transfer Price.

7.5     The Company shall as soon as practicable following receipt of a Transfer
        Notice or, where later, upon the determination of the Transfer Price
        give notice in writing to each of the members of the Company (for which
        purpose all of the Warrants shall be deemed to have been exercised
        immediately prior to such notice and the Warrantholders shall be treated
        as members in respect of all the shares which are the subject of the
        Warrants) informing them that the Sale Shares are available and of the
        Transfer Price. Such notice shall invite each member to state, in
        writing within 42 days from the date of such notice (which date shall be
        specified therein), whether he is willing to purchase any and, if so,
        how many of the Sale Shares.

        (a)     The Sale Shares shall be offered to each class of member on
                terms that, in the event of competition, the Sale Shares offered
                shall be sold to the members accepting the offer in proportion
                (as nearly as may be) to their existing holdings of shares of
                the class or classes to which the offer is made (the
                "PROPORTIONATE ENTITLEMENT"). It shall be open to each such
                member to specify if he is willing to purchase shares in excess
                of his Proportionate Entitlement ("EXCESS SHARES") and, if the
                member does so specify, he shall state the number of Excess
                Shares.

        (b)     After the expiry of the offers to be made pursuant to Article
                7.5(a) (or sooner if all the Sale Shares offered shall have been
                accepted in the manner provided in Article 7.5(a)), the Board
                shall allocate the Sale Shares in the following manner:

                (i)    if the total number of shares applied for is equal to or
                       less than the available number of Sale Shares the Company
                       shall allocate the number applied for in accordance with
                       the applications; or

                (ii)   if the total number of shares applied for is more than
                       the available number of Sale Shares, each member shall be
                       allocated his Proportionate Entitlement (or such lesser
                       number of Sale Shares for which he may have applied);
                       applications for Excess Shares shall be allocated in
                       accordance with such applications or, in the event of
                       competition, (as nearly as may be) to each member
                       applying for Excess Shares in the proportion which shares
                       of the relevant class held by such member bears to the
                       total number of shares of that class held by all such
                       members applying for Excess Shares PROVIDED THAT such
                       member shall not be allocated more Excess Shares than he
                       shall have stated himself willing to take,

                and in either case, the Company shall forthwith give notice of
                each such allocation (an "ALLOCATION NOTICE") to the Seller and
                each of the persons to whom Sale Shares have been allocated (a
                "MEMBER APPLICANT") and shall specify in the Allocation Notice
                the place and time (being not later than 14 days after the date
                of the Allocation Notice) at which the sale of the Sale Shares
                shall be completed.

7.6     Subject to Article 7.7, upon such allocations being made as aforesaid,
        the Seller shall be bound, on payment of the Transfer Price, to transfer
        the Sale Shares comprised in the Allocation Notice to the Member
        Applicants named therein at the time and place therein specified. If he
        makes default in so doing the Chairman for the time being of the Company
        or, failing him, one of the Directors, or some other person duly
        nominated by a resolution of


                                      -7-
<PAGE>

        the Board for that purpose, shall forthwith be deemed to be the duly
        appointed attorney of the Seller with full power to execute, complete
        and deliver in the name and on behalf of the Seller a transfer of the
        relevant Sale Shares to the Member Applicant and any Director may
        receive and give a good discharge for the purchase money on behalf of
        the Seller and (subject to the transfer being duly stamped) enter the
        name of the Member Applicant in the register of members as the member or
        members by transfer of the shares so purchased by him or them. The Board
        shall forthwith pay the purchase money into a separate bank account in
        the Company's name and shall hold money on trust (but without interest)
        for the Seller until he shall deliver up his certificate or certificates
        for the relevant shares (or an indemnity, in a form reasonably
        satisfactory to the Board, in respect of any lost certificate) to the
        Company when he shall thereupon be paid the purchase money.

7.7     If the Seller shall have included in the Transfer Notice a provision
        that unless all the Sale Shares are sold none shall be sold and if the
        total number of shares applied for by Member Applicants is less than the
        number of Sale Shares then the Allocation Notice shall refer to such
        provision and shall contain a further invitation, open for 28 days, to
        those persons to whom the Sale Shares have been allocated to apply for
        further Sale Shares and completion of the sales in accordance with the
        preceding paragraphs of this Article 7 shall be conditional upon such
        provision as aforesaid being complied with in full.

7.8     In the event of all the Sale Shares not being sold under the preceding
        paragraphs of this Article 7 the Seller may, at any time within six
        calendar months after receiving confirmation from the Company that the
        pre-emption provisions herein contained have been exhausted, transfer
        any Sale Shares (which have not been sold) to any person or persons at
        any price not less than the Transfer Price PROVIDED THAT:-

        (a)     if the Seller stipulated in the Transfer Notice that unless all
                the Sale Shares were sold none should be sold, the Seller shall
                not be entitled, save with the written consent of members of the
                Company holding shares carrying 80 per cent of voting rights
                which may for the time being be cast at a general meeting of the
                Company, to sell hereunder only some of the Sale Shares
                comprised in the Transfer Notice to such person or persons;

        (b)     any such sale shall be a bona fide sale and the Board may
                require to be satisfied in such manner as it may reasonably
                require that the Sale Shares are being sold in pursuance of a
                bona fide sale for not less than the Transfer Price without any
                deduction, rebate or allowance whatsoever to the buyer and, if
                not so satisfied, may refuse to register the instrument of
                transfer; and

7.9     The costs of determining the Fair Market Value shall be borne by the
        Company unless, in the case of a determination required pursuant to the
        provisions of Article 7.2, the Fair Market Value so determined is less
        than that suggested by the Board, in which event the costs of
        determining the Fair Market Value shall be borne by the Seller.

        shall apply), with respect to any proposed transfer of Capital Shares by
        any member (the "TRANSFEROR") to any person (the "PROPOSED PURCHASER")
        prior to the completion of a Qualified Public Offering or achievement of
        a Qualified Public Value, each of the other members (the "OTHER
        SHAREHOLDERS"), shall have the right (the "CO-SALE RIGHTS") to require
        the Proposed Purchaser to purchase from it a portion of its Capital
        Shares (including shares issued or issuable upon exercise of Warrants)
        (such Other Shareholder's "PRO RATA SHARE") which is equal to or less
        than the product obtained by multiplying:

        (a)     the total number of Capital Shares that the Proposed Purchaser
                is prepared to purchase; by

        (b)     a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of
                Capital Shares (including shares issued or issuable upon
                exercise of Warrants) owned by such Other Shareholder, and the
                denominator of which is the total number of Capital Shares
                issued and outstanding immediately before the transfer
                (including shares issued or issuable upon exercise of Warrants),

        or such greater number of Capital Shares which is determined in
        accordance with the remainder of this Article 9.

9.2     The price per Capital Share and, subject to Article 9.8 hereof, the
        terms and conditions shall be the same as those of such proposed
        transfer by the Transferor, with appropriate adjustments to reflect the
        conversion of convertible securities, the redemption of redeemable
        securities and the exercise of exercisable securities as well as the
        relative preferences and

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

        priorities of any preferred securities then outstanding (it being
        understood that such terms and conditions may include the execution and
        delivery of such instruments of transfer as are executed and delivered
        by the Transferor to the Proposed Purchaser, provided that the Other
        Shareholders shall not be required to execute any indemnity or similar
        agreement rendering any such Other Shareholder personally liable for any
        amount in excess of the proceeds to be received by such Other
        Shareholder from such transfer).

9.3     Any holder of Warrants shall be permitted to sell to the Proposed
        Purchaser, in connection with any exercise of the rights set forth in
        this Article 9, Warrants and Subordinated Notes with the same effect as
        if shares were being conveyed (subject to appropriate adjustments to the
        net sale price to deduct the exercise price of such Warrants).

9.4     The Transferor shall notify, or cause to be notified, each Other
        Shareholder in writing of each such proposed transfer. Such notice (the
        "SALE NOTICE") shall set forth:

        (a)     the number of Capital Shares proposed to be transferred;

        (b)     the maximum number of Capital Shares that such Other Shareholder
                can sell to such Proposed Purchaser;

        (c)     the name and address of the Proposed Purchaser;

        (d)     the proposed amount and form of consideration and terms and
                conditions of payment offered by such Proposed Purchaser;

        (e)     that the Proposed Purchaser has been informed of the Co-Sale
                Rights provided for in this Article 9 and has agreed to purchase
                Capital Shares in accordance with the terms hereof; and

        (f)     that, with respect to the Capital Shares to be purchased by the
                Proposed Purchaser, the Proposed Purchaser agrees to enter into
                a deed of adherence in accordance with the Purchase Agreement.

9.5     At the request of the Transferor, the Company shall provide to the
        Transferor any information available to the Company, to the extent that
        such information is required for the delivery of a Sale Notice by the
        Transferor, and each Other Shareholder shall provide to the Transferor
        information concerning such Other Shareholder's name and address and the
        number of Capital Shares held by such Other Shareholder.

9.6     The Co-Sale Rights may be exercised by any Other Shareholder by delivery
        of a written notice to the Transferor giving a Sale Notice (the "Co-Sale
        Notice") within 10 Business Days following their receipt of the Sale
        Notice. The Co-Sale Notice shall constitute an agreement, binding on the
        Other Shareholder delivering it, to sell up to the number of Capital
        Shares and Subordinated Notes specified in the Co-Sale Notice to the
        Proposed Purchaser in the event the proposed sale to the Proposed
        Purchaser can, as modified by the inclusion of such Other
        Shareholder(s), still be consummated as originally proposed, and is so
        consummated. In such event, the number of Capital Shares to be sold by
        each Other Shareholder giving a Co-Sale Notice shall be determined as
        follows:


                                      -11-
<PAGE>

        (a)     each such Other Shareholder shall be entitled to sell at least
                the lesser of the number of Capital Shares specified in such
                Other Shareholder's Co-Sale Notice or such Other Shareholder's
                Pro Rata Share. Such amount is referred to as such Other
                Shareholder's "BASIC SALE AMOUNT" and, in the case of any Other
                Shareholder who requested the sale of a number of Capital Shares
                in excess of such Other Shareholder's Pro Rata Share, the amount
                of such excess is referred to as such Other Shareholder's
                "EXCESS SALE REQUEST". If not all Other Shareholders requested
                the sale of at least their Pro Rata Share, the excess of the
                total of the Pro Rata Shares of all Other Shareholders over the
                total of the Basic Sale Amount of the Other Shareholders who
                gave Tag-Along Notices is referred to as the "Undersubscribed
                Amount".

        (b)     If there is an Undersubscribed Amount, it shall be allocated
                between the Other Shareholders who gave Co-Sale Notices, as a
                class, and the Transferor pro rata as follows:

                (i)    an amount equal to the Undersubscribed Amount multiplied
                       by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total of the
                       Basic Sales Amounts of such Other Shareholders and the
                       denominator of which is the total amount of Capital
                       Shares to be purchased by the Proposed Purchaser, shall
                       be allocated to such Other Shareholders, as a class (such
                       amount is referred to as the "EXCESS ALLOCABLE AMOUNT")
                       in accordance with Article 9.6(iii); and

                (ii)   the remainder of the Undersubscribed Amount shall be
                       allocated to the Transferor.

        (c)     If there is an Excess Allocable Amount, each Other Shareholder
                who had an Excess Sale Request shall also be entitled to sell an
                amount equal to the lesser of such Other Shareholder's Excess
                Sale Request or the Excess Allocable Amount multiplied by a
                fraction, the numerator of which is such Other Shareholder's
                Excess Sale Request and the denominator of which is the total of
                the Excess Sale Requests of all Other Shareholders having Excess
                Sale Requests.

9.7     In the event that the Proposed Purchaser does not purchase all Capital
        Shares to be sold by all Other Shareholders giving Co-Sale Notices (as
        determined pursuant to Articles 9.6(a), (b) and (c) hereof), on the
        terms and conditions stated in the Sale Notice or on terms and
        conditions no less favourable to the Transferor, then the Transferor may
        not make the proposed sale to such Proposed Purchaser without renewed
        compliance with this Article 9. After expiration of the 10 Business Day
        period referred to above, the Transferor shall have the right during the
        following 120 day period to transfer, or to enter into a binding
        agreement to transfer, any of the Capital Shares not subject to a
        Co-Sale Notice to the Proposed Purchaser or subject to the remainder of
        this Article 9, to a different purchaser, on the terms and conditions
        stated in the Sale Notice or on terms and conditions no more favourable
        to the Transferor, so long as the shares subject to Co-Sale Notices are
        also purchased or agreed to be purchased at the same time, provided that
        the Transferor may not, without renewed compliance with this Article 9:


                                      -12-
<PAGE>

        (a)     make a sale pursuant to a previously executed agreement to
                transfer Capital Shares on a date which is more than 180 days
                after the date of the applicable Sale Notice; or

        (b)     make a sale to a different purchaser on terms and conditions
                (including the financial standing and creditworthiness of such
                different purchaser) more favourable to the Transferor than
                those set forth in the applicable Sale Notice.

9.8     All numbers in this Article 9 which refer to Capital Shares shall be
        subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend,
        stock split, consolidation, or similar transaction.

9.9     For the purpose of this Article 9 if:

        (a)     the Transferor has agreed to sell any Capital Shares for
                consideration which includes securities;

        (b)     such non-cash consideration includes securities (other than
                notes, debentures or similar instruments evidencing
                indebtedness) which are not readily marketable on a public
                market providing regularly maintained price quotations and a
                regular flow of transactions; and

        (c)     after giving effect to the proposed transfer of Capital Shares
                by the Transferor and any related transactions, the Proposed
                Purchaser or the issuer of such securities would be an Affiliate
                of the Transferor,

        then the Proposed Purchaser's offer to the Other Shareholders shall
        include registration rights for the benefit of the Other Shareholders
        accepting such offer and covering any such securities, upon terms and
        conditions no less favourable to the Other Shareholders than those set
        forth in the Registration Rights Agreement.

                        GENERAL MEETINGS AND RESOLUTIONS

10.1    Every notice convening a general meeting shall comply with the
        provisions of section 372(3) of the Act as to the giving of information
        to members in respect of their right to appoint proxies; and notices of
        and other communications relating to any general meeting which any
        member is entitled to receive shall be sent to the Directors and to the
        auditors for the time being of the Company.

10.2    A member whose registered address is not within the United Kingdom shall
        be entitled to have notices sent to him at his registered address
        outside the United Kingdom and the last sentence of Regulation 112 and
        the whole of Regulations 39 and 115 shall not apply.

10.3    No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum
        is present. Subject to Article 10.4 the Special Shareholder (or a proxy
        for the Special Shareholder) and one or more persons (or their proxies)
        holding shares carrying at least 50% of the votes normally exerciseable
        in general meeting entitled to vote upon the business to be transacted,
        each being a member or a proxy for a member or a duly authorised
        representative of a corporation, shall be a quorum.


                                      -13-
<PAGE>


10.4    If and for so long as the Company has only one member, that member
        present in person or by proxy or if that member is a corporation by a
        duly authorised representative shall be a quorum.

10.5    If at any meeting such a quorum is not present within half an hour from
        the time appointed for a general meeting (or such longer interval as the
        chairman of the meeting may think fit to allow) the general meeting
        shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week at the same time
        and place or to such other day and at such other time and place as the
        Directors may determine and of which at least 7 clear days notice shall
        have been given to the members; and if at the adjourned general meeting
        a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed
        therefor any two members present in person or by proxy shall constitute
        a quorum.

10.6    An instrument appointing a proxy (and, where it is signed on behalf of
        the appointor by an attorney, the letter of power of attorney or a duly
        certified copy thereof) must either:

        (a)     be delivered at such place or one of such places (if any) as may
                be specified for that purpose in or by way of note to the notice
                convening the meeting (or, if no place is so specified, at the
                registered office) at least one hour before the time appointed
                for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting or (in the case of
                a poll taken otherwise than at or on the same day as the meeting
                or adjourned meeting) for the taking of the poll at which it is
                to be used; or

        (b)     be delivered to the Secretary (or the chairman of the meeting)
                on the day and at the place of, but in any event before the time
                appointed for holding, the meeting or adjourned meeting or poll.
                The instrument shall, unless the contrary is stated thereon, be
                valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the
                meeting to which it relates. An instrument of proxy relating to
                more than one meeting (including any adjournment thereof) having
                once been so delivered for the purposes of any meeting shall not
                require again to be delivered for the purposes of any subsequent
                meeting to which it relates. Regulation 62 shall not apply to
                the Company.

10.7    Regulations 40, 41 and 50 shall not apply to the Company.

                               WRITTEN RESOLUTIONS

11.1    If and for so long as the Company has only one member and that member
        takes any decision which is required to be taken in general meeting or
        by means of a written resolution, that decision shall be as valid and
        effectual as if agreed by the Company in general meeting save that this
        paragraph shall not apply to resolutions passed pursuant to sections 303
        and 391 of the Act.

11.2    Any decision taken by a sole member pursuant to Article 11.1 shall be
        recorded in writing and delivered by that member to the Company for
        entry in the Company's Minute Book.

        extended accordingly. Regulation 53 (as so extended) shall apply mutatis
        mutandis to resolutions in writing of any class of members of the
        Company.

                with his creditors generally;

        (e)     if in England or elsewhere an order shall be made by any court
                claiming jurisdiction in that behalf on the ground (however
                formulated) of mental disorder for his detention or for the
                appointment of a guardian or receiver or other person (by
                whatever name called) to exercise powers with respect to his
                property or affairs;

        (f)     if he is admitted to hospital in pursuance of an application for

        and regulation 81 shall be modified accordingly.

12.5    The Company may by ordinary resolution appoint a person who is willing

13.     Subject to Article 20.2, the Directors may exercise all the powers of

        to section 80 of the Act to grant any mortgage, charge or other security
        over its undertaking, property and uncalled capital, or any part
        thereof, and to issue debentures, debenture stock and other securities
        whether outright or as security for any debt, liability or obligation of

14.1    An alternate director shall not be entitled as such to receive any
        remuneration from the Company, save that he may be paid by the Company
        such part (if any) of the remuneration otherwise payable to his
        appointor as such appointor may by notice in writing to the Company from
        time to time direct, and the first sentence of Regulation 66 shall be
        modified accordingly.

14.2    A Director, or any such other person as is mentioned in Regulation 65,
        may act as an alternate director to represent more than one director,
        and an alternate director shall be entitled at any meeting of the
        directors or of any committee of the directors to one vote for every
        director whom he represents in addition to his own vote (if any) as a
        director, but he shall count as only one for the purpose of determining
        whether a quorum is present.

14.3    The appointment of an alternate director shall determine on the
        happening of any event which, if he were a Director, would cause him to
        vacate such office or if the Director for whom he is an alternate ceases

        by way of salary, commission or otherwise or may receive such other
        benefits as the Directors may determine. Regulation 82 shall be extended

                      MEETINGS AND PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS

16.1    Unless otherwise agreed by all of the Directors in any particular case,
        at least 10 clear days' written notice shall be given to each Director
        of every meeting of the Directors. Regulations 88 and 111 shall be
        modified accordingly.

16.2    Each such notice shall (i) be sent to the address notified from time to
        time by each Director to the Company Secretary as his address for the
        service of such notices (or if no address has been so supplied, to his
        last known address); (ii) contain an agenda specifying in reasonable
        detail the matters to be discussed at the relevant meeting; (iii) be
        accompanied by any relevant papers for discussion at such meeting; and
        (iv) if sent to an address outside the United Kingdom, be sent by
        courier or facsimile transmission.

16.3    The quorum at a meeting of Directors or at a meeting of any committee of
        the Directors shall be three. If within half an hour of the time
        appointed for the holding of any meeting of the Directors (or a
        committee of the Directors) at least three Directors shall not be
        present, the Director(s) present shall resolve to adjourn that meeting
        to the same place and a specified time (which shall not be earlier than
        three nor later than seven days after the date originally fixed for the
        meeting). If at such adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within
        half an hour from the time appointed therefor such adjourned meeting
        shall be dissolved. An alternate Director shall be counted in the quorum

        (c)     the creation, allotment or issue of any Capital Shares or
                securities or the grant of any right that would require the
                allotment or issue of any such shares or securities (other

                meanings given to them respectively in section 736 of the Act)
                provided that if at any time the transferor and transferee cease
                to be so associated, the transferee shall forthwith transfer to
                the transferor the shares then registered in its name and in
                default of so doing within a period of 14 days after being
                required to do so by notice in writing given by any other

        provisions of section 372(3) of the Act as to the giving of information
        to members in respect of their right to appoint proxies; and notices of
        and other communications relating to any general meeting which any
        member is entitled to receive shall be sent to the Directors and to the
        auditors for the time being of the Company.

6.2     A member whose registered address is not within the United Kingdom shall
        be entitled to have notices sent to him at his registered address
        outside the United Kingdom and the last sentence of Regulation 112 and
        the whole of Regulations 39 and 115 shall not apply.

6.3     No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum
        is present. Any two persons each being a member or a proxy for a member
        or a duly authorised representative of a corporation, shall be a quorum.

6.4     If and for so long as the Company has only one member, that member
        present in person or by proxy or if that member is a corporation by a
        duly authorised representative shall be a quorum.

6.5     If at any meeting such a quorum is not present within half an hour from
        the time appointed for a general meeting (or such longer interval as the
        chairman of the meeting may think fit to allow) the general meeting
        shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week at the same time
        and place or to such other day and at such other time and place as the
        Directors may determine and of which at least 7 clear days notice shall
        have been given to the members; and if at the adjourned general meeting
        a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed
        therefor any two members present in person or by proxy shall constitute
        a quorum.

6.6     An instrument appointing a proxy (and, where it is signed on behalf of
        the appointor by an attorney, the letter of power of attorney or a duly
        certified copy thereof) must either:

        (a)     be delivered at such place or one of such places (if any) as may
                be specified for that purpose in or by way of note to the notice
                convening the meeting (or, if no place is so specified, at the
                registered office) at least one hour before the time appointed
                for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting or (in the case of
                a poll taken otherwise than at or on the same day as the meeting
                or adjourned meeting) for the taking of the poll at which it is
                to be used; or

        (b)     be delivered to the Secretary (or the chairman of the meeting)
                on the day and at the place of, but in any event before the time
                appointed for holding, the meeting or adjourned meeting or poll.
                The instrument shall, unless the contrary is stated thereon, be
                valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the
                meeting to which it relates. An instrument of proxy relating to
                more than one meeting (including any adjournment thereof) having
                once been so delivered for the purposes of any meeting shall not
                require again to be delivered for the purposes of any subsequent
                meeting to which it relates. Regulation 62 shall not apply to
                the Company.

6.7     Regulations 40, 41 and 50 shall not apply to the Company.

        of the Directors, on any resolution, notwithstanding that it in any way
        concerns or relates to a matter in which he has, directly or indirectly,
        any kind of interest whatsoever, and if he shall vote on any such
        resolution as aforesaid his vote shall be counted; and in relation to

        persons participating in the meeting can hear each other and
        participation in a meeting in this manner shall be deemed to constitute
        presence in person at such meeting. Such a meeting shall be deemed to
        take place where the largest group of those participating is assembled
        or, if there is no such group, where the Chairman of the meeting is.

                        is a Business Day falling within the Term B Availability
                        Period;

                (f)     on and as of the proposed Utilisation Date (a) no Event
                        of Default or Potential Event of Default is continuing
                        or would occur as a result of the making of such Term B
                        Advance and (b) the Repeated Representations are true
                        (before and immediately after the making of such Term

                        then existing and (c) the Agent has confirmed to the
                        Parent and the Banks that it has received all of the

                        a drawdown to be made under this sub-clause 3.2.1 for
                        the purpose of financing the Warehouse Acquisition

                Agent shall receive the materials set out in sub-clause 3.2.3 as
                it would have received had such Permitted Acquisition be funded
                up to fifty per cent. from a Term B Advance. If the utilisation
                conditions in sub-clause 3.2.1 are fulfilled, a Notice of
                Drawdown may be delivered to the Agent in respect of a Term B

                                cent. of the Total Consideration payable in
                                relation to a Permitted Acquisition, that the
                                balance of such Permitted Acquisitions has been
                                funded out of the Available Cash;

                        (ii)    no Event of Default, and no breach of a repeated
                                representation is likely to arise on and
                                following the purchase date as a result of the
                                completion of the relevant Permitted Acquisition
                                part of which is to be paid out of the proceeds
                                of the relevant Term B Advance;

                        to finance the Warehouse Acquisition Cost.

3.3     EACH BANK'S PARTICIPATION IN TERM ADVANCES

        Each Bank will participate through its Facility Office in each Term
        Advance made in the proportion borne by its relevant Available Term
        Commitment to the relevant Available Term Facility immediately prior to
        the making of that Term Advance.

3.4     REDUCTION OF AVAILABLE TERM COMMITMENT

        If a Bank's relevant Available Term Commitment is reduced in accordance
        with the terms hereof after the Agent has received the Notice of
        Drawdown for a Term Advance pursuant to this Clause 3 and such reduction
        was not taken into account in calculating the relevant Available Term
        Facility, then both the Original Sterling Amount and the amount of that
        Term Advance shall be reduced accordingly.

4.      INTEREST PERIODS FOR TERM ADVANCES

4.1     INTEREST PERIODS

        The period for which a Term Advance is outstanding shall be divided into
        successive periods each of which (other than the first, which shall
        begin on the day such Term Advance is made) shall start on the last day
        of the preceding such period.

4.2     DURATION

        Until the earlier of six months after the date hereof and the
        Syndication Date, the duration of each Interest Period shall be one
        month. Thereafter, the duration of each Interest Period shall, save as
        otherwise provided herein, be one, three or six months (or such other
        period as may be agreed between the Parent and the Banks), in each case
        as the Borrower to which such Term Advance is made (or the Parent) may
        by no later than 10.00 a.m. three Business Days' prior notice to the
        Agent select, or such other period as the Banks agree PROVIDED THAT:

        4.2.1   if such Borrower fails to give such notice of its selection in
                relation to an Interest Period, the duration of that Interest
                Period shall, subject to sub-clauses 4.2.2, 4.2.3 and 4.2.3, be
                three months;

        4.2.2   any Interest Period which begins during or at the same time as
                any other Interest Period and made under the same Term Facility
                shall end at the same time as that other Interest Period;

        4.2.3   to the extent necessary to ensure at any time Advances (in an
                aggregate amount not less than the amount of the next scheduled
                repayment of principal hereunder) have Interest Periods expiring
                on the relevant scheduled Term Repayment Date or Final Maturity
                Date, any Interest Period which would otherwise end during the
                month preceding, or extend beyond, a Term



                                      -35-
<PAGE>

                Repayment Date or Final Maturity Date shall be of such duration
                that it shall end on that Term Repayment Date or Final Maturity
                Date.

4.3     CONSOLIDATION OF TERM ADVANCES

        If two or more Interest Periods relating to Term Advances denominated in
        the same currency end at the same time, then, on the last day of those
        Interest Periods, the Term Advances to which they relate shall be
        consolidated into and treated as a single Term Advance.

4.4     DIVISION OF TERM ADVANCES

        The Borrower to which a Term Advance is made may, by no later than 10.00
        a.m. three Business Days' prior notice to the Agent direct that such
        Term Advance shall, at the beginning of any Interest Period relating
        thereto, be divided into (and thereafter, save as otherwise provided
        herein, treated in all respects as) two or more Term Advances having
        such Original Sterling Amounts (in aggregate, equalling the Sterling
        Amount of the Term Advance being so divided) as shall be specified by
        such Borrower in such notice, PROVIDED THAT such Borrower shall not be
        entitled to make such a direction if:

        4.4.1   as a result of so doing, there would be more than six
                outstanding Term Advances; or

        4.4.2   any Term Advance thereby coming into existence would have a
                Sterling Amount of less than (pounds sterling)10,000,000.

5.      PAYMENT AND CALCULATION OF INTEREST ON TERM ADVANCES

5.1     PAYMENT OF INTEREST

        On the last day of each Interest Period relating to a Term Advance (and,
        if the Interest Period of such Term Advance exceeds six months, on the
        expiry of each period of six months during that Interest Period) the
        Borrower to which such Term Advance has been made shall pay accrued
        interest on the Term Advance to which such Interest Period relates.

5.2     CALCULATION OF INTEREST

        The rate of interest applicable to a Term Advance from time to time
        during an Interest Period relating thereto shall be the rate per annum
        which is the sum of the Margin at such time, the Associated Costs Rate
        (if any) in respect thereof at such time and LIBOR on the Quotation Date
        therefor. In relation to the first Interest Period of any Term Advance
        made on the date hereof, LIBOR for such Term Advance for such Interest
        Period shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of the
        definition of LIBOR.

5.3     TERM MARGIN RATCHET

        5.3.1   Subject to sub-clause 5.3.3, if the ratio of Total Debt to

                for in sub-clause 5.3.1 shall take effect only in relation to
                any Advance made or Interest Period commencing at least 15
                Business Days after receipt by the Agent for the Relevant Period

                A Margin shall be 3.00% per annum.

        5.3.4   The change to the Applicable A Margin set out in sub-clause

                continuing. The Agent shall give such certification promptly on
                reasonably determining that an Event of Default has occurred or
                exists and promptly upon it becoming reasonably apparent that
                such Event of Default is no longer continuing.

                of the events mentioned in sub-clauses 8.1.1 and 8.1.2 of Clause
                8.1 (Market Disruption) shall have occurred;

        6.1.7   there would not, immediately after the making of such Revolving
                Advance, be more than nine Revolving Advances outstanding; and

        6.1.8   on and as of the proposed Utilisation Date:

                (a)     no Event of Default or (save in relation to a Rollover
                        Advance) Potential Event of Default is continuing
                        PROVIDED THAT in the case of a Potential Event of
                        Default:

                        (i)     such Potential Event of Default shall not be
                                capable of continuing for more than thirty days
                                from the date of the Notice of Drawdown with
                                respect to a particular event or circumstance;
                                and

                        (ii)    the Borrower may not deliver a further Notice of
                                Drawdown until the earlier of (a) the expiry of
                                such thirty day period and (b) the date on which
                                the Potential event of Default ceases to be
                                continuing.

                        If a further Potential Event of Default has occurred and
                        is continuing at the time of delivery of a further
                        Notice of Drawdown, the Banks may rely upon such further
                        Potential Event of Default for the purposes of this
                        Clause 6.1.8 and the provisions of sub-paragraphs (i)
                        and (ii) above shall apply to such further Potential
                        Event of Default;

                (b)     the Repeated Representations are true (before and
                        immediately after the making of such Revolving Advance)
                        by reference to the facts and circumstances then
                        subsisting; and

                (c)     (in the case of an Advance proposed to be made on the
                        date hereof) the Agent has confirmed to the Parent and
                        the Banks that it has received all of the documents and
                        other evidence listed in Schedule 3 Part I (Conditions
                        Precedent) and that each is, in form and substance,
                        satisfactory to the Agent,

                        then, save as otherwise provided herein, such Revolving
                        Advance will be made.

6.2     REDUCTION OF AVAILABLE REVOLVING COMMITMENT

        If a Bank's Revolving Commitment is reduced in accordance with the terms
        hereof after the Agent has received the Notice of Drawdown for a
        Revolving Advance then both the Original Sterling Amount and the amount
        of that Revolving Advance be reduced accordingly.

7.      PAYMENT AND CALCULATION OF INTEREST ON REVOLVING ADVANCES

7.1     PAYMENT OF INTEREST

        On the Repayment Date relating to each Revolving Advance (and, if the
        Term of such Revolving Advance exceeds six months, on the expiry of each
        period of six months during such Term) the Borrower shall pay accrued
        interest on that Revolving Advance.

7.2     CALCULATION OF INTEREST

        The rate of interest applicable to a Revolving Advance from time to time
        during its Term shall be the rate per annum which is the sum of the
        Margin at such time, the Associated Costs Rate in respect thereof at
        such time and LIBOR on the Quotation Date therefor. In relation to the
        Term of any Revolving Advance made on the date hereof, LIBOR for such
        Revolving Advance for such Term shall be determined in accordance with
        paragraph (b) of the definition of LIBOR.

7.3     REVOLVING MARGIN RATCHET

        7.3.1   Subject to sub-clause 7.3.3, if the ratio of Total Debt to
                EBITDA in respect of the most recent Relevant Period is within
                the range set out in column 1 of the margin grid table set out
                below, then the Applicable Revolving Margin shall be the
                percentage per annum set out opposite such range PROVIDED THAT
                from the date hereof until the date falling twelve months after
                the date thereafter, the Applicable Revolving Margin shall be
                not less than 2.00 % per annum.

                                    MARGIN GRID TABLE

                 COLUMN 1                          COLUMN 2

                 TOTAL NET DEBT TO EBITDA          APPLICABLE REVOLVING MARGIN %

                 Less  than 3.0.:1 but greater     1.75%
                 than or equal to 2.01:1

                 Less than 2.0:1 but greater       1.50
                 than or equal to 1.5:1

                 Less than 1.5:1                   1.25

<PAGE>

        7.3.2   Any reduction or increase to the Revolving Margin provided for
                in sub-clause 7.3.1 shall take effect only in relation to any
                Revolving Advance made at least 15 Business Days after receipt
                by the Agent for the Relevant Period of both (a) (in the case of
                a Relevant Period ending on the last day of the Parent's
                financial year) the annual audited financial statements of the
                Group in accordance with Clause 20.1 (Annual Statements) or (in
                the case of the Relevant Period ending on the last day of any
                other Financial Quarter of the Parent) quarterly financial
                statements of the Group in accordance with Clause 20.2
                (Quarterly Statements) for such Relevant Period and (b), in each
                case, a Compliance Certificate for such Relevant Period pursuant
                to Clause 20.7 (Compliance Certificates).

        7.3.3   If at any time an Event of Default is continuing the Applicable
                Revolving Margin shall be 3.00% per annum.

        7.3.4   The change to the Applicable Revolving Margin set out in
                sub-clause 7.3.3 shall apply from the date certified by the
                Agent (in writing) as the date on which an Event of Default has
                occurred or come into existence until the date certified by the
                Agent (in writing) as the date by which such Event of Default is
                no longer continuing. The Agent shall give such certification
                promptly upon reasonably determining that an Event of Default
                has occurred or exists and promptly upon becoming aware it
                becoming reasonably apparent that such Event of Default is no
                longer continuing.

8.      MARKET DISRUPTION AND ALTERNATIVE INTEREST RATES

8.1     MARKET DISRUPTION

        If, in relation to any Advance or Unpaid Sum:

        8.1.1   LIBOR is to be determined by reference to Reference Banks and at
                or about 11.00 a.m. on the Quotation Date for the relevant
                Interest Period or Term none or only one of the Reference Banks
                supplies a rate for the purpose of determining LIBOR, for the
                relevant Interest Period or Term; or

        8.1.2   before the close of business in London on the Quotation Date for
                such Advance or Unpaid Sum the Agent has been notified by a Bank
                or each of a group of Banks to whom in aggregate thirty-five per
                cent. or more of such Advance or Unpaid Sum is owed (or, in the
                case of an undrawn Advance, if made, would be owed) that the
                LIBOR rate does not accurately reflect the cost of funding its
                participation in such Advance or Unpaid Sum,

        then, the Agent shall notify the Parent, the relevant Borrower and the
        Banks of such event and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
        this Agreement, Clause 8.2 (Substitute Interest Period and Interest
        Rate) shall apply to such Advance (if it is a Term Advance which is
        already outstanding or a Rollover Advance) or Unpaid Sum. If sub-clause
        8.1.1 or 8.1.2 of Clause 8.1 (Market Disruption) applies to a proposed
        Advance (other than a Rollover Advance), such Advance shall not be made.



                                      -40-
<PAGE>

8.2     SUBSTITUTE INTEREST PERIOD AND INTEREST RATE

        If sub-clause 8.1.1 of Clause 8.1 (Market Disruption) applies to an
        Advance, the duration of the relevant Interest Period or Term shall be
        one month, or less, such that it shall end on the next succeeding
        Repayment Date (in the case of a Term Advance) or the Revolving
        Termination Date (in the case of a Rollover Advance). If either
        sub-clause 8.1.1 or 8.1.2 of Clause 8.1 (Market Disruption) applies to
        an Advance or Unpaid Sum, the rate of interest applicable to such
        Advance or Unpaid Sum during the relevant Interest Period or Term shall
        (subject to any agreement reached pursuant to Clause 8.3 (Alternative
        Rate)) be the rate per annum which is the sum of:

        8.2.1   the Margin at such time;

        8.2.2   the Associated Costs Rate in respect thereof at such time; and

        8.2.3   the rate per annum notified to the Agent by each Bank before the
                last day of such Interest Period or Term to be that which
                expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to such Bank
                of funding from sources it reasonably selects its portion of
                such Advance or Unpaid Sum during such Interest Period or Term.

8.3     ALTERNATIVE RATE

        If:

        8.3.1   either of those events mentioned in sub-clauses 8.1.1 and 8.1.2
                of Clause 8.1 (Market Disruption) occurs in relation to an
                Advance or Unpaid Sum; or

        8.3.2   by reason of circumstances affecting the London Interbank Market
                during any period of three consecutive Business Days LIBOR is
                not available for Sterling to prime banks in the London
                Interbank Market,

        then, in any such case, if the Agent or the Parent so requires, the
        Agent and the Parent shall enter into negotiations in good faith with a
        view to agreeing an alternative basis:

        (a)     for determining the rates of interest from time to time
                applicable to the Advances and Unpaid Sums; and/or

        (b)     upon which the Advances and Unpaid Sums may be maintained
                thereafter,

        and any such alternative basis that is agreed shall take effect in
        accordance with its terms and be binding on each party hereto, PROVIDED
        THAT the Agent may not agree any such alternative basis without the
        prior consent of each Bank.

9.      NOTIFICATION

        Not later than 11.00 a.m. three Business Days before the first day of an
        Interest Period or Term (or, in the case of any utilisation being made
        on the date hereof, not later than 11.30 a.m. on the date hereof), the
        Agent shall notify each Bank of the Facility that is to be utilised, the

        and Alternative Interest Rates).

        If, in relation to a Term Repayment Date, the aggregate amount of the
        relevant Term Advances exceeds the amount of the relevant Term
        Outstandings to be repaid, the Parent may, by not less than five
        Business Days' prior notice to the Agent, select which of those Term
        Advances will be wholly or partially repaid, PROVIDED THAT:

        10.2.1  the Parent may not make any such selection if, as a result, more
                than one such Term Advance would fall to be partially repaid;
                and

        10.2.2  if the Parent fails to give such notice, the Agent shall select
                the relevant Term Advances to be wholly or partially repaid.

11.     REPAYMENT OF THE REVOLVING FACILITY

11.1    The Borrower shall repay each Revolving Advance made to it in full on

        fourteen (14) consecutive days in each twelve (12) month period falling

        Facilities in accordance with Clause 12.5 (Application of Prepayments)
        promptly upon receipt of the same by any Group member.

        The Parent will procure that any amounts which are retained for
        reinvestments as envisaged by paragraph (b) of the definition of
        Excluded Proceeds and paragraph (f) of the definition of Permitted

12.2    AMCARE DISPOSAL

        The Group may, on approval by the Agent (acting on the instructions of
        the Instructing Group), dispose of Amcare Limited (the "AMCARE

        months of the date hereof, the Parent shall ensure that the application
        of an amount equal to the Net Disposal Proceeds of such disposal (the
        "AMCARE DISPOSAL PROCEEDS") shall be credited to the Holding Account
        and, within six (6) months of such Amcare Disposal, the Amcare Disposal
        Proceeds may be withdrawn from the Holding Account by the Original
        Borrower from time to time to fund the whole of the Total Consideration
        for one or more Permitted Acquisitions subject to clause 23.22 (Total

                        Term B Outstandings; and

                (b)     second, to the extent the Term A Outstandings and the

        12.5.2  Any prepayment of Term Outstandings in respect of a Term
                Facility shall be applied so that the Borrower effects a

                Term Outstandings in respect of a Term Facility shall be applied
                across the Term Advances then outstanding under such Term
                Facility in the manner notified by the Original Borrower to the
                Agent at the time of prepayment (or, if no such notice is given,
                pro rata but in any event so that any such prepayment is applied
                so that each Borrower effects a prepayment pro rata to its share
                of the Term A Outstandings or, as the case may be, the Term B
                Outstandings).

                would require the Original Borrower to procure the prepayment of
                any Advance hereunder otherwise than at the end of an Interest
                Period or on the maturity of a Revolving Advance, the Original
                Borrower can elect (by written notice to the Agent to be
                received not later than 11 a.m. three Business Days prior to the
                date on which the prepayment obligation would, but for this
                Clause 12.6 (Prepayment Accounts) arise) to credit the amount to
                be repaid to the Mandatory Prepayment Account on the date on
                which the prepayment obligation would, but for this Clause 12.6
                (Prepayment Accounts), arise and to prepay the relevant Term
                Advance and/or Revolving Advance at the first occurring end of
                an Interest Period relative to the Term Advance to be repaid or
                date on which a Revolving Advance matures (where such Term
                Advance or, as the case may be, Revolving Advance is at least
                equal to the amount to be repaid unless the Term Outstandings
                under which such Term Advance was made or the Revolving
                Outstandings is less than the amount to be repaid). Following
                any such election and provided the required payment is made to
                the Mandatory

                Advance and/or Revolving Advance will not arise until the first
                occurring end of an Interest Period relative to such Term
                Advance to be repaid or date on which such a Revolving Advance
                matures.

        12.6.2  The Original Borrower hereby irrevocably authorises the Agent to
                withdraw monies from the Mandatory Prepayment Account and apply
                such monies against prepayments which are due to be made
                hereunder or, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default which
                is continuing, against any amounts due and payable under the
                Finance Documents.

        12.6.3  Any Bank with which such account is held acknowledges and agrees
                that interest shall accrue at normal commercial rates on amounts
                credited to the Mandatory Prepayment Account and the Holding
                Account and that the account holder shall be entitled to receive
                such interest (which shall be paid in accordance with the
                mandate relating to such account) provided that the account
                holder shall not be entitled to receive such interest while an
                Event of Default is continuing.

        All payments to be made by an Obligor to any Finance Party hereunder
        shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for or on account
        of tax unless such Obligor is required to make such a payment subject to

        such Obligor (in respect of which such deduction or withholding is
        required to be made) shall be increased to the extent necessary to
        ensure that such Finance Party receives a sum net of any withholding or
        deduction equal to the sum which it would have received had no such
        deduction or withholding been made or required to be made.

14.2    TAX INDEMNITY

        Without prejudice to Clause 14.1 (Tax Gross-up), if any Finance Party is
        required to make any payment of or on account of tax on or in relation
        to any sum received or receivable hereunder (including any sum deemed

                the avoidance of doubt, not including any sum deemed for
                purposes of tax to be received or receivable by such Finance
                Party but not actually receivable) by the jurisdiction in which
                such Finance Party is incorporated or resident for tax purposes;
                or

        14.2.2  any tax imposed on and calculated by reference to the net income

        becomes effective) that either:

        14.3.1  it is a bank as defined for the purposes of Section 349 of the

                payable to it hereunder and is beneficially entitled to its
                share of the Outstandings and the interest thereon; or

        14.3.2  it is not resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom and is

        Office has become aware of such event or circumstance, whereupon the
        Agent shall notify the Parent thereof.

14.5    EXCLUDED CLAIMS

        If any Bank is not or ceases to be a Qualifying Bank, no Obligor shall
        be liable to pay to that Bank under Clause 14.1 (Tax Gross-Up) any
        amount in respect of taxes levied or imposed in excess of the amount it
        would have been obliged to pay if that Bank had been or had not ceased
        to be a Qualifying Bank PROVIDED THAT this Clause 14.5 (Excluded Claims)
        shall not apply (and each Obligor shall be obliged to comply with its
        obligations under Clause 14.1 (Tax Gross-Up)) if:

        14.5.1  after the date hereof and after the date when such Bank first
                becomes a Bank for the purposes of this Agreement, there shall
                have been any introduction of, change in, or change in the
                interpretation, administration or application of, any law or
                regulation or order or governmental rule or treaty or any
                practice or concession of any applicable tax authority and as a
                result thereof such Bank ceased to be a Qualifying Bank; or

        14.5.2  such Bank is not or ceases to be a Qualifying Bank as a result
                of the actions of or omission to act by any Obligor.

14.6    DOUBLE TAXATION RELIEF

        Clause 14.2 (Tax Indemnity) can be mitigated by virtue of the provisions
        of any Applicable Treaty



                                      -49-
<PAGE>

        (whether by a claim to repayment of any taxes referred to in Clause 14.1
        (Tax Gross-Up) or Clause 14.2 (Tax Indemnity) or otherwise) each Bank
        agrees to co-operate with the relevant Obligor with a view to submitting
        any forms required for the purpose of ensuring the application of such
        double tax convention so far as relevant, PROVIDED THAT no Bank shall be
        required pursuant to this Clause 14.6 (Double Taxation Relief) to
        complete or co-operate in completing any form which is not substantially
        similar to any form in use at the date of this Agreement for the purpose
        of claiming exemption or relief from or repayment of taxes envisaged
        hereunder pursuant to an Applicable Treaty between England and such
        Bank's jurisdiction of residence.

15.     TAX RECEIPTS

15.1    NOTIFICATION OF REQUIREMENT TO DEDUCT TAX

        If, at any time, an Obligor is required by law to make any deduction or
        withholding from any sum payable by it hereunder (or if thereafter there
        is any change in the rates at which or the manner in which such
        deductions or withholdings are calculated), such Obligor shall promptly
        notify the Agent.

15.2    EVIDENCE OF PAYMENT OF TAX

        If an Obligor makes any payment hereunder in respect of which it is
        required to make any deduction or withholding, it shall pay the full
        amount required to be deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation or
        other authority within the time allowed for such payment under
        applicable law and shall deliver to the Agent for such Finance Party,
        within thirty days after it has made such payment to the applicable
        authority, an original receipt (or a certified copy thereof) issued by
        such authority evidencing the payment to such authority of all amounts
        so required to be deducted or withheld in respect of that Finance
        Party's share of such payment.

15.3    TAX CREDIT PAYMENT

        If an additional payment is made under Clause 14 (Taxes) by an Obligor
        for the benefit of any Finance Party and such Finance Party, in its sole
        discretion, determines that it has obtained (and has derived full use
        and benefit from) a credit against, a relief or remission for, or
        repayment of, any tax, then, if and to the extent that such Finance
        Party, in its sole opinion, determines that:

        15.3.1  such credit, relief, remission or repayment is in respect of or
                calculated with reference to the additional payment made
                pursuant to Clause 14 (Taxes); and

                credit, relief, remission or repayment was obtained have been
                finally settled,

        such Finance Party shall, to the extent that it can do so without
        prejudice to the retention of the amount of such credit, relief,
        remission or repayment, pay to such Obligor such amount as such Finance
        Party shall, in its sole opinion, determine to be the amount which will
        leave such Finance Party (after such payment) in no worse after-tax
        position than it would have been in had the additional payment in
        question not been required to be made by such Obligor.

15.4    TAX CREDIT CLAWBACK

        If any Finance Party makes any payment to an Obligor pursuant to Clause
        15.3 (Tax Credit Payment) and such Finance Party subsequently
        determines, in its sole opinion, that the credit, relief, remission or
        repayment in respect of which such payment was made was not available or
        has been withdrawn or that it was unable to use such credit, relief,
        remission or repayment in full, such Obligor shall reimburse such
        Finance Party such amount as such Finance Party determines, in its sole
        opinion, is necessary to place it in the same after-tax position as it
        would have been in if such credit, relief, remission or repayment had
        been obtained and fully used and retained by such Finance Party.

15.5    TAX AND OTHER AFFAIRS

        it thinks fit, oblige any Finance Party to claim any credit, relief,
        remission or repayment in respect of any payment under Clause 14.1 (Tax
        Gross-up) in priority to any other credit, relief, remission or

        requirement of any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other

        16.1.1  a Bank or any holding company of such Bank is unable to obtain
                the rate of return on its capital which it would have been able

                maintaining a commitment, issuing or performing its obligations
                under the Finance Documents;

        16.1.2  a Bank any holding company of such Bank incurs a cost as a
                result of such Bank's entering into or assuming or maintaining a
                commitment, issuing or performing its obligations under the
                Finance Documents; or

        16.1.3  there is any increase in the cost to a Bank or any holding
                company of such Bank of funding or maintaining such Bank's share
                of the Advances or any Unpaid Sum,

        (including, without limitation, any such circumstance (other than any

        to such Bank or any holding company of such Bank on the date hereof)
        which results from the introduction or changeover to the Sterling in any

        of that Bank amounts sufficient to indemnify that Bank or to enable that
        Bank to indemnify its holding company from and against, as the case may
        be, (a) such reduction in the rate of return of capital, (b) such cost
        or (c) such increased cost.

                the Associated Costs Rate; or

        16.3.2  any cost, increased cost or liability compensated by Clause 14
                (Taxes) or which would have been compensated by Clause 14
                (Taxes) if the provisions of Clause 14.5 (Excluded Claims) or
                sub-clauses 14.2.1 or 14.2.2 of Clause 14.2 (Tax Indemnity) had
                not applied; or

        16.3.3  any cost, increased cost or liability arising by reason of a
                breach by a Bank or their holding company of any law or
                regulatory request.

17.     ILLEGALITY

        If, at any time, it is or will become unlawful for a Bank to make, fund,
        issue, participate in or allow to remain outstanding all or part of its
        share of the Advances, then that Bank shall, promptly after becoming
        aware of the same, deliver to the Parent through the Agent a notice to
        that effect and:

        17.1.1  such Bank shall not thereafter be obliged to participate in any
                Advance and the amount of its Available Term Commitment and
                Available Revolving Commitment shall be immediately reduced to
                zero; and

        17.1.2  if the Agent on behalf of such Bank so requires, the Parent
                shall procure that each Borrower shall either (a) as soon as
                practicable and in any event within 5 days of such notice or (b)
                on the date specified by such Banks through the Agent as being,
                in its bona fide opinion, the last day of any applicable grace
                period permitted by law repay such Bank's share of any
                outstanding Advances together with accrued interest thereon and
                all other amounts owing to such Bank under the Finance Documents
                and any repayment of any Term Advance so made shall reduce
                rateably the remaining obligations under Clause 10.1 (Term
                Repayment Instalments) in respect of the outstandings under the
                Term Facility under which such Term Advance was made.

18.     MITIGATION

        If, in respect of any Bank, circumstances arise which would or would
        upon the giving of notice result in:

        18.1.1  an increase in any sum payable to it or for its account pursuant
                to Clause 14.1 (Tax Gross-up);

        18.1.2  a claim for indemnification pursuant to Clause 14.2 (Tax

        rights of such Bank or the obligations of the Obligors under any of the
        Clauses referred to in sub-clauses 18.1.1, 18.1.2, 18.1.3 and 18.1.3,
        such Bank shall, upon request by the Parent or relevant Borrower and, in
        consultation with the Agent and the Parent and to the extent that it can
        do so lawfully and without prejudice to its own position, take such
        steps as may be reasonable and practical in all the circumstances
        (including a change of location of such Facility Office or the transfer
        of its rights, benefits and obligations hereunder to another financial
        institution acceptable to the Parent and willing to participate in the
        Facilities) to mitigate the effects of such circumstances, PROVIDED THAT
        such Bank shall be under no obligation to take any such action if, in
        the opinion of such Bank, to do so might have any adverse effect upon
        its business, operations or financial condition (other than any minor
        costs and expenses of an administrative nature).

        unable to recognise and perform properly date-sensitive functions

                comply with any or all of its obligations under any Finance
                Document to which it is a party or any of the obligations of an

        periods, each of which (other than the first) shall start on the last
        day of the preceding such period and the duration of each of which shall

28.2    DEFAULT INTEREST

        An Unpaid Sum shall bear interest during each Interest Period in respect
        thereof at the rate per annum which is two per cent. per annum above the

        payable on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period or Term
        relating thereto:

        28.2.1  the first Interest Period applicable to such Unpaid Sum shall be
                of a duration equal to the unexpired portion of the current

        28.2.2  the percentage rate of interest applicable thereto from time to
                time during such period shall be that which exceeds by one per
                cent. the rate which would have been applicable to it had it not
                so fallen due, save that the Margin shall be, or be deemed to
                be, the highest rate specified in the definition thereof.

                Where an Unpaid Sum does not relate to an Advance, interest
                shall be calculated by reference to the Applicable B Margin.

        Interest Period in respect thereof or on such other dates as the Agent
        may specify by notice to such Obligor.

28.4    BREAK COSTS

        If any Bank or the Agent on its behalf receives or recovers all or any
        part of an Advance or Unpaid Sum otherwise than on the last day of an
        Interest Period or Term relating thereto, the Agent shall calculate (a)
        the additional interest which would have been payable on the amount so
        received or recovered had it been received or recovered on the last day
        of that Interest Period or Term and (b) the amount of interest which in
        the opinion of the Agent (acting reasonably) would have been payable to
        the Agent on the last day of that Interest Period or Term in respect of
        a deposit in the currency of the amount so received or recovered equal
        to the amount so received or recovered placed by it with a prime bank in
        London for a period starting on the third Business Day following the
        date of such receipt or recovery and ending on the last day of that
        Interest Period or Term. If (a) exceeds (b), then the Parent shall pay

                Indemnified Party or any other person, except to the extent that

        establish to its satisfaction that it has actually received such sum,
        but if it does so and it proves to be the case that it had not actually
        received such sum, then the person to whom such sum or the proceeds of
        such exchange contract was so made available shall on request refund the
        same to the Agent together with an amount sufficient to indemnify the

        satisfaction of any sum due and payable from such Obligor



                                      -99-
<PAGE>

        to such Bank under any Finance Document but unpaid. For this purpose,
        each Bank is authorised to purchase with the moneys standing to the
        credit of any such account such other currencies as may be necessary to
        effect such application.

32.2    SET-OFF NOT MANDATORY

        No Bank shall be obliged to exercise any right given to it by Clause
        32.1 (Contractual Set-off).

33.     SHARING

33.1    PAYMENTS TO BANKS

        If a Bank (a "RECOVERING BANK") applies any receipt or recovery from an
        Obligor to a payment due under this Agreement and such amount is
        received or recovered other than in accordance with Clause 31
        (Payments), then such Recovering Bank shall:

        33.1.1  notify the Agent of such receipt or recovery;

        33.1.2  at the request of the Agent, promptly pay to the Agent an amount
                (the "SHARING PAYMENT") equal to such receipt or recovery less
                any amount which the Agent determines may be retained by such
                Recovering Bank as its share of any payment to be made in
                accordance with Clause 31.5 (Partial Payments).

33.2    REDISTRIBUTION OF PAYMENTS

        The Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by the
        relevant Obligor and distribute it between the Finance Parties (other
        than the Recovering Bank) in accordance with Clause 31.5 (Partial
        Payments).

33.3    RECOVERING BANK'S RIGHTS

        The Recovering Bank will be subrogated to the rights of the parties
        which have shared in a redistribution pursuant to Clause 33.2
        (Redistribution of Payments) in respect of the Sharing Payment (and the
        relevant Obligor shall be liable to the Recovering Bank in an amount
        equal to the Sharing Payment).

33.4    REPAYABLE RECOVERIES

        If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a Recovering
        Bank becomes repayable and is repaid by such Recovering Bank, then:

        33.4.1  each party which has received a share of such Sharing Payment
                pursuant to Clause 33.2 (Redistribution of Payments) shall, upon
                request of the Agent, pay to the Agent for account of such
                Recovering Bank an amount equal to its share of such Sharing
                Payment; and

        33.4.2  such Recovering Bank's rights of subrogation in respect of any
                reimbursement shall be cancelled and the relevant Obligor will
                be liable to the reimbursing party for the amount so reimbursed.



                                     -100-
<PAGE>

33.5    EXCEPTION

        This Clause 33 (Sharing) shall not apply if the Recovering Bank would
        not, after making any payment pursuant hereto, have a valid and
        enforceable claim against the relevant Obligor.

33.6    RECOVERIES THROUGH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

        If any Bank intends to commence any action in any court or arbitral
        proceedings it shall give prior notice to the Agent, the Security Agent
        and the other Banks. If any Bank shall commence any action in any court
        or arbitral proceedings to enforce its rights hereunder and, as a result
        thereof or in connection therewith, receives any amount, then such Bank
        shall not be required to share any portion of such amount with any Bank
        which has the legal right to, but does not, join in such action or
        commence and diligently prosecute a separate action to enforce its
        rights in another court or arbitral proceedings.

34.     THE AGENT, THE ARRANGER, THE UNDERWRITERS AND THE BANKS

34.1    APPOINTMENT OF THE AGENT

        Each of the Arranger and the Banks hereby appoints the Agent to act as
        its agent in connection with the Finance Documents and authorises the

34.2    AGENT'S DISCRETIONS

        The Agent may:

        34.2.1  assume, unless it has, in its capacity as agent for the Banks,
                received notice to the contrary from any other party hereto,
                that (a) any representation made or deemed to be made by an
                Obligor in connection with any Finance Document is true, (b) no
                Event of Default or Potential Event of Default has occurred, (c)
                no Obligor is in breach of or default under its obligations
                under any Finance Document and (d) any right, power, authority
                or discretion vested herein upon an Instructing Group, the Banks
                or any other person or group of persons has not been exercised;

        34.2.2  assume that each Facility Office of each Bank is that notified
                to it by such Bank in writing prior to the date hereof (or, in
                the case of a Transferee, at the end of the Transfer Certificate
                to which it is a party as Transferee) until it has received from
                such Bank a notice designating some other office of such Bank to
                replace such Facility Office and act upon any such notice until
                the same is superseded by a further such notice;

        34.2.3  engage and pay for the advice or services of any lawyers,
                accountants, surveyors or other experts whose advice or services
                may to it seem necessary, expedient or desirable and rely upon
                any advice so obtained;



                                     -101-
<PAGE>

        34.2.4  rely as to any matters of fact which might reasonably be
                expected to be within the knowledge of an Obligor upon a
                certificate signed by or on behalf of such Obligor;

        34.2.5  rely upon any communication or document believed by it to be
                genuine;

        34.2.6  refrain from exercising any right, power or discretion vested in
                it as agent under any Finance Document unless and until
                instructed by an Instructing Group as to whether or not such
                right, power or discretion is to be exercised and, if it is to
                be exercised, as to the manner in which it should be exercised;

        34.2.7  refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions of an
                Instructing Group to begin any legal action or proceeding
                arising out of or in connection with any Finance Document until
                it shall have received such security as it may require (whether
                by way of payment in advance or otherwise) for all costs,
                claims, losses, expenses (including legal fees) and liabilities
                together with any VAT thereon which it will or may expend or
                incur in complying with such instructions; and

        34.2.8  assume (unless it has specific notice to the contrary) that any
                notice or request made by the Parent is made on behalf of all
                the Obligors.

34.3    AGENT'S OBLIGATIONS

        The Agent shall:

        34.3.1  promptly inform each Bank of the contents of any notice or
                document received by it in its capacity as Agent from an Obligor
                under any Finance Document;

        34.3.2  promptly notify each Bank of the occurrence of any Event of
                Default or any default by an Obligor in the due performance of
                or compliance with its obligations under any Finance Document of
                which the Agent has notice from any other party hereto;

        34.3.3  save as otherwise provided herein, act as agent under any
                Finance Document in accordance with any instructions given to it
                by an Instructing Group, which instructions shall be binding on
                the Arranger and the Banks; and

        34.3.4  if so instructed by an Instructing Group, refrain from
                exercising any right, power or discretion vested in it as agent
                under any Finance Document.

        The Agent's duties under the Finance Documents are solely mechanical and
        administrative in nature.

34.4    EXCLUDED OBLIGATIONS

        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary expressed or implied herein,
        neither the Agent, any Underwriter nor the Arranger shall:

        34.4.1  be bound to enquire as to (a) whether or not any representation
                made or deemed to be made by an Obligor in connection with any
                Finance Document



                                     -102-

                is true, (b) the occurrence or otherwise of any Event of Default
                or Potential Event of Default, (c) the performance by an Obligor
                of its obligations under any Finance Document or (d) any breach
                of or default by an Obligor of or under its obligations under
                any Finance Document;

        34.4.2  be bound to account to any Bank for any sum or the profit
                element of any sum received by it for its own account;

        34.4.3  be bound to disclose to any other person any information
                relating to any member of the Group if (a) such person, on
                providing such information, expressly stated to the Agent or, as
                the case may be, the Arranger, that such information was
                confidential or (b) such disclosure would or might in its
                opinion constitute a breach of any law or be otherwise
                actionable at the suit of any person;

        34.4.4  be under any obligations other than those for which express
                provision is made in any Finance Document; or

        34.4.5  be or be deemed to be a fiduciary for any other party to any
                Finance Document.

34.5    INDEMNIFICATION

        Each Bank shall, in its Proportion, from time to time on demand by the
        Agent, indemnify the Agent against any and all costs, claims, losses,
        expenses (including legal fees) and liabilities together with any VAT
        thereon which the Agent may incur, otherwise than by reason of its own
        gross negligence or wilful misconduct, in acting in its capacity as
        agent under any Finance Document (other than any which have been
        reimbursed by the Parent pursuant to Clause 29.1 (Parent's Indemnity)).

34.6    EXCLUSION OF LIABILITIES

        Except in the case of negligence or wilful default, none of the Agent,
        the Underwriters and the Arranger accepts any responsibility:

        34.6.1  for the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the
                Information Memorandum or any other information supplied by the
                Agent or the Arranger, by an Obligor or by any other person in
                connection with any Finance Document or any other agreement,
                arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in
                anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with any Finance
                Document;

        34.6.2  for the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or
                enforceability of any Finance Document or any other agreement,
                arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in
                anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with any Finance
                Document; or

        34.6.3  for the exercise of, or the failure to exercise, any judgement,
                discretion or power given to any of them by or in connection
                with any Finance Document or any other agreement, arrangement or
                document entered into, made or



                                     -103-
<PAGE>

                executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with
                any Finance Document.

        Accordingly, none of the Agent, the Underwriters and the Arranger shall
        be under any liability (whether in negligence or otherwise) in respect
        of such matters, save in the case of negligence or wilful misconduct.

34.7    NO ACTIONS

        Each of the Banks agree that it will not assert or seek to assert
        against any director, officer or employee of the Agent, the Underwriters
        or the Arranger any claim it might have against any of them in respect
        of the matters referred to in Clause 34.6 (Exclusion of Liabilities).

34.8    BUSINESS WITH THE GROUP

        The Agent and the Arranger may accept deposits from, lend money to and
        generally engage in any kind of banking or other business with any
        member of the Group.

34.9    RESIGNATION

        The Agent, the Underwriters may resign its appointment hereunder at any
        time without assigning any reason therefor by giving not less than
        thirty days' prior notice to that effect to each of the other parties
        hereto, provided that no such resignation shall be effective until a
        successor for the Agent is appointed in accordance with the succeeding
        provisions of this Clause 34 (The Agent, the Arrangers, the Underwriters
        and the Banks).

34.10   SUCCESSOR AGENT

        If the Agent gives notice of its resignation pursuant to Clause 34.9
        (Resignation), then any reputable and experienced bank or other
        financial institution in the United Kingdom may be appointed as a
        successor to the Agent by an Instructing Group (who shall consult with
        the Parent) during the period of such notice but, if no such successor
        is so appointed, the Agent may appoint such a successor itself.

34.11   RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

        If a successor to the Agent is appointed under the provisions of Clause
        34.10 (Successor Agent), then:

        34.11.1 the retiring Agent shall be discharged from any further
                obligation under any Finance Document but shall remain entitled
                to the benefit of the provisions of this Clause 34 (The Agent,
                the Arranger, the Underwriters and the Banks); and

        34.11.2 its successor and each of the other parties to any Finance
                Document shall have the same rights and obligations amongst
                themselves as they would have had if such successor had been a
                party to the Finance Documents.

34.12   OWN RESPONSIBILITY

        It is understood and agreed by each Bank that at all times it has itself
        been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making its own
        independent appraisal of and



                                     -104-
<PAGE>

        investigation into all risks arising under or in connection with the
        Finance Documents including, but not limited to:

        34.12.1 the financial condition, creditworthiness, condition, affairs,
                status and nature of each member of the Group;

        34.12.2 the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy and
                enforceability of any Finance Documents and any other agreement,
                arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in
                anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with any Finance
                Document;

        34.12.3 whether such Bank has recourse, and the nature and extent of
                that recourse, against an Obligor or any other person or any of
                their respective assets under or in connection with any Finance
                Document, the transactions therein contemplated or any other
                agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or
                executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with
                any Finance Document; and

        34.12.4 the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the Information
                Memorandum and any other information provided by the Agent, an
                Underwriter or the Arranger, an Obligor, or by any other person
                in connection with any Finance Document, the transactions
                contemplated therein or any other agreement, arrangement or
                document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of,
                pursuant to or in connection with any Finance Document.

        Accordingly, each Bank acknowledges to the Agent, the Underwriters and
        the Arranger that it has not relied on and will not hereafter rely on
        the Agent, the Underwriters and the Arranger or any of them in respect
        of any of these matters.

34.13   AGENCY DIVISION SEPARATE

        In acting as agent under the Finance Documents for the Banks, the Agent
        shall be regarded as acting through its agency division which shall be
        treated as a separate entity from any other of its divisions or
        departments and, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Clause
        34 (The Agent, the Arranger, the Underwriters and the Banks), any
        information received by some other division or department of the Agent
        may be treated as confidential and shall not be regarded as having been
        given to the Agent's agency division.

34.14   RELIANCE AND ENGAGEMENT LETTERS

        Each Finance Party confirms each of the Arranger and the Agent has
        authority to accept on its behalf the terms of any Reliance Letter or
        engagement letters relating to the Reports or any reports or letters
        provided by accountants in connection with the Finance Documents or the
        transactions contemplated therein (including any net asset letter in
        connection with financial assistance procedures) and to bind it in
        respect of such Reports, reports or letters and to sign such letters on
        its behalf and further confirms that it accepts the terms and

        party hereto and its or any subsequent successors and Transferees.

35.2    NO ASSIGNMENTS AND TRANSFERS BY THE OBLIGORS

        No Obligor shall be entitled to assign or transfer all or any of its
        rights, benefits and obligations under the Finance Documents.

35.3    ASSIGNMENTS AND TRANSFERS BY BANKS

        Any Bank may, at any time, assign all or any of its rights and benefits

        under the Finance Documents to a bank or financial institution, PROVIDED
        THAT no such assignment or transfer may be made without prior
        consultation with the Parent, except in the case of any such assignment
        or transfer:

        35.3.1  to any subsidiary or holding company, or to any subsidiary of
                any holding company, of such Bank; or

        35.3.2  to any other Bank or any subsidiary or holding company, or to
                any subsidiary of any holding company, of any other Bank; or

        35.3.3  when an Event of Default has occurred which is continuing.

35.4    ASSIGNMENTS BY BANKS

        If any Bank assigns all or any of its rights and benefits under the
        Finance Documents in accordance with Clause 35.3 (Assignments and

        notice to the Agent confirming in favour of the Agent, the Arranger, the
        Security Agent, the other Banks that it shall be under the same
        obligations towards each of them as it would have been under if it had
        been an original party to the Finance Documents as a Bank (whereupon
        such assignee shall become a party to the Finance Documents as a
        "Bank"), the Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent, the other Banks
        shall not be obliged to recognise such assignee as having the rights
        against each of them which it would have had if it had been such a party
        to the Finance Documents.

35.5    TRANSFERS BY BANKS

        If any Bank wishes to transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and/or
        obligations under the Finance Documents as contemplated in Clause 35.3
        (Assignments and Transfers by Banks), then such transfer may be effected
        by the delivery to the Agent of a duly completed Transfer Certificate
        executed by such Bank and the relevant Transferee in which event, on the
        later of the Transfer Date specified in such Transfer Certificate and
        the fifth Business Day after (or such earlier Business Day endorsed by
        the Agent on such Transfer Certificate falling on or after) the date of
        delivery of such Transfer Certificate to the Agent:

<PAGE>

        35.5.1  to the extent that in such Transfer Certificate the Bank party
                thereto seeks to transfer its rights, benefits and obligations
                under the Finance Documents, each of the Obligors and such Bank
                shall be released from further obligations towards one another
                under the Finance Documents and their respective rights against
                one another shall be cancelled (such rights and obligations
                being referred to in this Clause 35.5 (Transfers by Banks) as
                "DISCHARGED RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS");

        35.5.2  each of the Obligors and the Transferee party thereto shall
                assume obligations towards one another and/or acquire rights
                against one another which differ from such discharged rights and
                obligations only insofar as each such Obligor and such

43.     GOVERNING LAW

        This Agreement is governed by English law.

44.     JURISDICTION

44.1    ENGLISH COURTS

        The courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute
        (a "DISPUTE") arising out of or in connection with the Finance Documents
        (including a dispute regarding the existence, validity or termination of
        this Agreement or the consequences of its nullity).

44.2    CONVENIENT FORUM

        The parties agree that the courts of England are the most appropriate
        and convenient courts to settle Disputes between them and, accordingly,
        that they will not argue to the contrary.

44.3    NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION

        This Clause 44 (Jurisdiction) is for the benefit of the Finance Parties
        only. As a result and notwithstanding Clause 44.1 (English Courts), it

        Dispute ("PROCEEDINGS") in any other courts with jurisdiction. To the
        extent allowed by law, the Finance Parties may take concurrent
        Proceedings in any number of jurisdictions.

3.2    EACH BANK'S PARTICIPATION IN ADVANCES
       Each Bank will participate through its Facility Office in the Advance
       made in the proportion borne by its Available Commitment the Available
       Facility immediately prior to the making of that Advance.

3.3    REDUCTION OF AVAILABLE TERM COMMITMENT
       If a Bank's relevant Available Commitment is reduced in accordance with
       the terms hereof after the Agent has received the Notice of Drawdown for
       an Advance pursuant to this Clause 3 and such reduction was not taken
       into account in calculating the Available Facility, then both the
       Original Sterling Amount and the amount of that Advance shall be reduced
       accordingly.

4.     INTEREST PERIODS
4.1    INTEREST PERIODS
       The period for which an Advance is outstanding shall be divided into
       successive periods each of which (other than the first, which shall begin
       on the day such Term Advance is made) shall start on the last day of the
       preceding such period.

4.2    DURATION
       Until the earlier of six months after the date hereof and the Syndication
       Date, the duration of each Interest Period shall be one month.
       Thereafter, the duration of each Interest Period shall, save as otherwise
       provided herein, be one, three or six months (or such other period as may
       be agreed between the Parent and the Banks), in each case as the Borrower
       to which such Advance is made (or the Parent) may by no later than 10.00
       a.m. three Business Days' prior notice to the Agent select, or such other
       period as the Banks agree PROVIDED THAT:

       4.2.1   if such Borrower fails to give such notice of its selection in
               relation to an Interest Period, the duration of that Interest
               Period shall, subject to sub-clauses 4.2.2, 4.2.3 and 4.2.3, be
               three months;

       4.2.2   any Interest Period which begins during or at the same time as
               any other Interest Period and made under the same Facility shall
               end at the same time as that other Interest Period;

       4.2.3   to the extent necessary to ensure at any time Advances have
               Interest Periods expiring on the Repayment Date or Final Maturity
               Date, any Interest Period which would otherwise end during the
               month preceding, or extend beyond, the Repayment Date or Final
               Maturity Date shall be of such duration that it shall end on the
               Repayment Date or Final Maturity Date.

       into and treated as a single Advance.

       three Business Days' prior notice to the Agent direct that such Advance

       divided into (and thereafter, save as otherwise provided herein, treated
       in all respects as) two or more Advances having such Original Sterling

       so divided) as shall be specified by such Borrower in such notice,
       PROVIDED THAT such Borrower shall not be entitled to make such a
       direction if:

       4.4.1   as a result of so doing, there would be more than six outstanding
               Advances; or

       4.4.2   any Advance thereby coming into existence would have a Sterling
               Amount of less than (pounds sterling)10,000,000.

5.     PAYMENT AND CALCULATION OF INTEREST

5.1    PAYMENT OF INTEREST
       On the last day of each Interest Period relating to an Advance (and, if
       the Interest Period of such Advance exceeds six months, on the expiry of
       each period of six months during that Interest Period) the Borrower to
       which such Advance has been made shall pay accrued interest on the
       Advance to which such Interest Period relates.

5.2    CALCULATION OF INTEREST
       The rate of interest applicable to an Advance from time to time during an
       Interest Period relating thereto shall be the rate per annum determined
       by the Agent to be the aggregate of:

       5.2.1   the Cash Paid Margin;

       5.2.2   the Rolled-Up Margin;

       5.2.3   LIBOR relative to such Advance for such Interest Period; and

       5.2.4   the Associated Costs Rate, if any, relative to such Advance and
               each Bank's participation therein from time to time during such
               Interest Period.

5.3    CASH PAID INTEREST
       Except as otherwise provided in Clause 5.4 (Rolled-Up Interest) or
       elsewhere in this Agreement, an amount of interest accrued on each
       Advance for each Interest Period pursuant to Clause 5.2 (Calculation of
       Interest) shall be paid by the Borrower in cash on the Interest Date
       relating to such Interest Period and also, in the case of an Interest
       Period of longer than six months, on the last day of each consecutive
       period of six months from the first day of such Interest Period. The
       amount of interest paid in cash on each Interest Date shall equal the
       amount of interest accrued at the rate per annum determined by the Agent
       to be the aggregate of the Cash Paid Margin plus LIBOR plus the
       Associated Costs Rate (if any) on such Advance during such Interest
       Period.



                                     - 27 -
<PAGE>

5.4    ROLLED-UP INTEREST
       An amount of interest accrued pursuant to Clause 5.2 (Calculation of
       Interest) on the Advance for each Interest Period relating thereto in an
       amount equal to the amount of interest accrued at the Rolled-Up Margin
       during such Interest Period shall, at the end of each such Interest
       Period, be capitalised with, added, to and shall be deemed to be part of,
       such Advance and the principal amount of such Advance shall thereafter be
       treated as having been increased by the amounts of Rolled-Up Interest
       capitalised in accordance with this Clause 5.4 (Rolled-Up Interest).

6.     MARKET DISRUPTION AND ALTERNATIVE INTEREST RATES

6.1    MARKET DISRUPTION
       If, in relation to any Advance or Unpaid Sum:

       6.1.1   LIBOR is to be determined by reference to Reference Banks and at
               or about 11.00 a.m. on the Quotation Date for the relevant
               Interest Period or Term none or only one of the Reference Banks
               supplies a rate for the purpose of determining LIBOR, for the
               relevant Interest Period or Term; or

       6.1.2   before the close of business in London on the Quotation Date for
               such Advance or Unpaid Sum the Agent has been notified by a Bank
               or each of a group of Banks to whom in aggregate thirty-five per
               cent. or more of such Advance or Unpaid Sum is owed (or, in the
               case of an undrawn Advance, if made, would be owed) that the
               LIBOR rate does not accurately reflect the cost of funding its
               participation in such Advance or Unpaid Sum,

       then, the Agent shall notify the Parent, the relevant Borrower and the
       Banks of such event and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
       Agreement, Clause 6.2 (Substitute Interest Period and Interest Rate)
       shall apply to such Advance (if it is a Term Advance which is already

               thereafter,

       and any such alternative basis that is agreed shall take effect in

       or otherwise) each Bank agrees to co-operate with the relevant Obligor

       respect of that Finance Party's share of such payment.

12.3   TAX CREDIT PAYMENT
       If an additional payment is made under Clause 11 (Taxes) by an Obligor
       for the benefit of any Finance Party and such Finance Party, in its sole
       discretion, determines that it has obtained (and has derived full use and
       benefit from) a credit against, a relief or remission for, or repayment
       of, any tax, then, if and to the extent that such Finance Party, in its
       sole opinion, determines that:

       12.3.1  such credit, relief, remission or repayment is in respect of or
               calculated with reference to the additional payment made pursuant
               to Clause 11 (Taxes); and

       12.3.2  its tax affairs for its tax year in respect of which such credit,
               relief, remission or repayment was obtained have been finally
               settled,

       such Finance Party shall, to the extent that it can do so without
       prejudice to the retention of the amount of such credit, relief,
       remission or repayment, pay to such Obligor such amount as such Finance
       Party shall, in its sole opinion, determine to be the amount which will
       leave such Finance Party (after such payment) in no worse after-tax
       position than it would have been in had the additional payment in
       question not been required to be made by such Obligor.

12.4   TAX CREDIT CLAWBACK
       If any Finance Party makes any payment to an Obligor pursuant to Clause
       12.3 (Tax Credit Payment) and such Finance Party subsequently determines,
       in its sole opinion, that the credit, relief, remission or repayment in
       respect of which such payment was made was not available or has been
       withdrawn or that it was unable to use such credit, relief, remission or
       repayment in full, such Obligor shall reimburse such Finance Party such
       amount as such Finance Party determines, in its sole opinion, is
       necessary to place it in the same after-tax position as it would have
       been in if such credit, relief, remission or repayment had been obtained
       and fully used and retained by such Finance Party.

12.5   TAX AND OTHER AFFAIRS
       No provision of this Agreement shall interfere with the right of any
       Finance Party to arrange its tax or any other affairs in whatever manner
       it thinks fit, oblige any Finance Party to claim any credit, relief,
       remission or repayment in respect of any payment under Clause 11.1 (Tax
       Gross-up) in priority to any other credit, relief, remission or repayment
       available to it nor oblige any Finance Party to disclose any information
       relating to its tax or other affairs or any computations in respect
       thereof.

               under the Finance Documents;

       13.1.2  a Bank any holding company of such Bank incurs a cost as a result
               of such Bank's entering into or assuming or maintaining a
               commitment, issuing or performing its obligations under the
               Finance Documents; or

               company of such Bank of funding or maintaining such Bank's share
               of the Advances or any Unpaid Sum,

       (including, without limitation, any such circumstance (other than any

       to such Bank or any holding company of such Bank on the date hereof)
       which results from the introduction or changeover to the Sterling in any
       Participating Member State) then the Parent shall, from time to time on
       demand of the Agent, promptly pay to the Agent for the account of that
       Bank amounts sufficient to indemnify that Bank or to enable that Bank to
       indemnify its holding company from and against, as the case may be, (a)
       such reduction in the rate of return of capital, (b) such cost or (c)

       Agent shall notify the Parent thereof.

13.3   EXCLUSIONS
       Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Clause 13 (Increased
       Costs), no Bank shall be entitled to make any claim in respect of:

       13.3.1  any cost, increased cost or liability as referred to in Clause
               13.1 (Increased Costs) to the extent the same is compensated by

               (Taxes) or which would have been compensated by Clause 11 (Taxes)

               11.2.1 or 11.2.2 of Clause 11.2 (Tax Indemnity) had not applied;
               or



                                     - 37 -

       If, at any time, it is or will become unlawful for a Bank to make, fund,
       issue, participate in or allow to remain outstanding all or part of its
       share of the Advances, then that Bank shall, promptly after becoming
       aware of the same, deliver to the Parent through the Agent a notice to
       that effect and:

       14.1.1  such Bank shall not thereafter be obliged to participate in any
               Advance and the amount of its Available Commitment shall be
               immediately reduced to zero; and

       14.1.2  if the Agent on behalf of such Bank so requires, the Parent shall
               procure that each Borrower shall either (a) as soon as
               practicable and in any event within 5 days of such notice or (b)
               on the date specified by such Banks through the Agent as being,
               in its bona fide opinion, the last day of any applicable grace
               period permitted by law repay such Bank's share of any
               outstanding Advances together with accrued interest thereon and
               all other amounts owing to such Bank under the Finance Documents
               and any repayment of any Advance so made shall reduce rateably
               the remaining obligations under Clause 8 (Repayment) in respect
               of the outstandings under the Facility under which such Advance
               was made.

15.    MITIGATION
       If, in respect of any Bank, circumstances arise which would or would upon
       the giving of notice result in:

       15.1.1  an increase in any sum payable to it or for its account pursuant
               to Clause 11.1 (Tax Gross-up);

       15.1.2  a claim for indemnification pursuant to Clause 11.2 (Tax
               Indemnity) or Clause 13.1 (Increased Costs);

       15.1.3  the reduction of its Available Commitment to zero or any
               repayment to be made pursuant to Clause 14 (Illegality),

       then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying the
       rights of such Bank or the obligations of the Obligors under any of the
       Clauses referred to in sub-clauses 15.1.1, 15.1.2, 15.1.3 and 15.1.3,
       such Bank shall, upon request by the Parent or relevant Borrower and, in
       consultation with the Agent and the Parent and to the extent that it can
       do so lawfully and without prejudice to its own position, take such steps
       as may be reasonable and practical in all the circumstances (including a
       change of location of such Facility Office or the transfer of its rights,
       benefits and obligations hereunder to another financial institution
       acceptable to the Parent and willing to participate in the Facilities) to
       mitigate the effects of such circumstances, PROVIDED THAT such Bank shall
       be under no obligation to take any such action if, in the opinion of



                                     - 38 -
<PAGE>

       such Bank, to do so might have any adverse effect upon its business,

       expenses of an administrative nature).

               in good faith by the relevant Group member and adequate reserves
               are being maintained for those taxes and where payment thereof

16.25  SECURITY INTEREST
       Subject to the Legal Reservations, each Security Document to which it is
       a party creates the security interest which that Security Document
       purports to create or, if that Security Document purports to evidence a

       respect of the Parent and the Original Borrower any necessary
       registrations in the books of the entity whose shares are being charged
       or any other legal formalities referred to in the Legal Opinions which

       unindemnified liabilities in respect of such schemes which could
       reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

16.32  YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE
       The Parent believes (having made all reasonable enquiries) that the Year
       2000 problem (that is, the risk that any computer hardware or software or
       any equipment operated by electronic means used by the Group may be
       unable to recognise and perform properly date-sensitive functions
       involving a date before, on or after 31 December 1999) could not
       reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

               is rolled over), and on each date on which a company becomes (or
               it is proposed that a company becomes) an Additional Obligor and
               at the end of each Financial Quarter of the Group.

       16.35.2 Clause 16.16 (Information Memorandum) shall be deemed to be made

       policies,



                                     - 48 -
<PAGE>

       17.9.1  a description of the changes and the adjustments which would be
               required to be made to those financial statements if they have
               been prepared using the Reference Accounting Policies; and

       17.9.2  sufficient information, in such detail and format as may be
               reasonably required by the Agent, to enable the Banks to make an
               accurate comparison between the financial position indicated by
               those financial statements and the Business Plan or, as the case

               (Annual Statements) 17.2 (Quarterly Statements) and 17.3 (Monthly
               Management Statements).

       connection with such change and any amendments have been agreed pursuant
       to Clause 17.10 (Change in Accounting Policy) in connection with such
       change, then such change shall become part of the normal accounting
       policies, practices, procedures and reference period as if it were used
       in the preparation of the Reference Accounting Policies.

17.10  CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
       If there has been one or more such changes in any accounting policies,
       practices or procedures or reference period:

       17.10.1 the Agent and the Parent shall, at the Agent's or the Parent's
               request, negotiate in good faith with a view to agreeing such
               amendments to the financial covenants in Clause 19 (Financial
               Condition) and the definitions used therein as may be necessary
               to grant to the Banks protection comparable to that granted on
               the date hereof, and any amendments as agreed will have effect on
               the date agreed between the Agent and the Parent; and

       17.10.2 if no such agreement is reached within 30 days of the Agent's
               request, the Agent shall (if so requested by an Instructing
               Group) instruct the auditors of the Parent or independent
               accountants (approved by the Parent or, in the absence of such
               approval within 5 days of request by the Agent therefor, a firm
               with internationally recognised expertise) to determine any
               amendment to Clause 19 (Financial Condition) which those auditors
               or, as the case may be, accountants (acting as experts and not
               arbitrators) consider appropriate to grant to the Banks
               protection comparable to that granted on the date hereof, which
               amendments shall take effect when so determined by those
               auditors, or as the case may be, accountants. Where such auditors
               or accountants are instructed hereunder, the cost and expense of
               those auditors or accountants shall be for the account of the
               Parent.

25.    DEFAULT INTEREST AND BREAK COSTS
25.1   DEFAULT INTEREST PERIODS
       If any sum due and payable by an Obligor hereunder is not paid on the due
       date therefor in accordance with Clause 28 (Payments) or if any sum due
       and payable by an Obligor under any judgment of any court in connection
       herewith is not paid on the date of such judgment, the period beginning
       on such due date or, as the case may be, the date of such judgment and
       ending on the date upon which the obligation of such Obligor to pay such
       sum is discharged shall be divided into successive periods, each of which
       (other than the first) shall start on the last day of the preceding such
       period and the duration of each of which shall (except as otherwise
       provided in this Clause 25 (Default Interest and Break Costs)) be
       selected by the Agent.

25.2   DEFAULT INTEREST
       An Unpaid Sum shall bear interest during each Interest Period in respect
       thereof at the rate per annum which is two per cent. per annum above the
       percentage rate which would apply to an Advance in the amount and
       currency of such Unpaid Sum and for the same Interest Period, PROVIDED
       THAT if such Unpaid Sum relates to an Advance which became due and
       payable on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period or Term
       relating thereto:

       25.2.1  the first Interest Period applicable to such Unpaid Sum shall be
               of a duration equal to the unexpired portion of the current
               Interest Period or Term relating to that Advance; and

       25.2.2  the percentage rate of interest applicable thereto from time to
               time during such period shall be that which exceeds by one per
               cent. the rate which would have been applicable to it had it not
               so fallen due, save that the Margin shall be, or be deemed to be,
               the highest rate specified in the definition thereof.

               Where an Unpaid Sum does not relate to an Advance, interest shall
               be calculated by reference to the Applicable B Margin.

25.3   PAYMENT OF DEFAULT INTEREST
       Any interest which shall have accrued under Clause 25.2 (Default
       Interest) in respect of an Unpaid Sum shall be due and payable and shall

       Interest Period in respect thereof or on such other dates as the Agent
       may specify by notice to such Obligor.

25.4   BREAK COSTS
       If any Bank or the Agent on its behalf receives or recovers all or any
       part of an Advance or Unpaid Sum otherwise than on the last day of an
       Interest Period or Term relating thereto, the Agent shall calculate (a)
       the additional interest which would have been payable on the amount so
       received or recovered had it been received or recovered on the last day
       of that Interest Period or Term and (b) the amount of interest which in
       the opinion of the Agent (acting reasonably) would have been payable to
       the Agent on the last day of that Interest Period or Term in respect of a
       deposit in the currency of the amount so received or recovered equal to
       the amount so received or recovered placed by it with a prime bank in
       London for a period starting on the third Business Day following the date
       of such receipt or recovery and ending on the last day of that Interest
       Period or Term. If (a) exceeds (b), then the Parent shall pay to the
       Agent on demand for account of such Bank an amount equal to such excess.

               sustain or incur as a consequence of the occurrence of any Event
               of Default or any default by any Obligor in the performance of
               any of the obligations expressed to be assumed by it in any
               Finance Document save to the extent that such cost, claim, loss,

               wilful default or wilful breach of obligation of such Finance
               Party;

       26.1.2  the Agent against any cost or loss it may suffer or incur as a

               contract for the purposes of Clause 28 (Payments);

       26.1.3  each Bank against any cost or loss it may suffer under Clause
               24.5 (Banks' Liabilities for Costs) or Clause 31.5
               (Indemnification) save to the extent that such cost or loss has
               arisen as a result of the negligence or wilful default or wilful
               breach of obligation of such Bank;

       26.1.4  each Bank against any cost or loss it may suffer or incur as a
               result of its funding or making arrangements to fund its portion
               of an Advance requested by any Borrower but not made by reason of
               the operation of any one or more of the provisions hereof;

       26.1.5  each Finance Party and in each case each of their affiliates and
               each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,

               reasonably incurred by or asserted or awarded against any
               Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection
               with or relating to any official investigation, litigation or
               proceeding or the preparation of any defence with respect
               thereto, arising out of or in connection with or relating to the
               Finance Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
               thereby or any use made or proposed to be made with the proceeds
               of the Facilities, whether or not such official investigation,
               litigation or proceeding is brought by a member of the Group, any
               shareholder or creditors of any member of the Group, an
               Indemnified Party or any other person, except to the extent that
               such claim, damage, loss, liability, cost or expense is found in
               a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
               jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's
               negligence or wilful misconduct or wilful breach of obligation;
               and

       26.1.6  each Bank against any cost or loss it may suffer or any reduction
               in its return on capital that it would have been able to obtain
               but for entering into or performing its obligations under this
               Agreement as a result of any minimum reserve requirements imposed
               on it by the European Central Bank in relation to an Advance or
               any funding of an Advance.

26.2   CURRENCY INDEMNITY
       If any sum (a "SUM") due from an Obligor under the Finance Documents or
       any order, judgment, award or decision given or made in relation thereto
       has to be converted from the currency (the "FIRST CURRENCY") in which
       such Sum is payable into another currency (the "SECOND CURRENCY") for the
       purpose of:

       26.2.1  making or filing a claim or proof against such Obligor;

       26.2.2  obtaining an order, judgment, award or decision in any court,
               arbitral proceedings or other tribunal; or

       26.2.3  enforcing any order, judgment, award or decision given or made in
               relation thereto,

       the Parent shall indemnify each person to whom such Sum is due from and
       against any loss suffered or incurred as a result of any discrepancy
       between (a) the rate of exchange used for such purpose to convert such
       Sum from the First Currency into the Second Currency and (b) the rate or
       rates of exchange available to such person at the time of receipt of such
       Sum.

26.3   PARENT'S INDEMNITY FROM BORROWERS
       If the Parent is required to make any payment under Clause 26.1 (Parent's

       in respect of any such payment.

27.1   CURRENCY OF ACCOUNT

       any time due from an Obligor hereunder, PROVIDED THAT:

       27.1.1  each payment in respect of costs and expenses shall be made in
               the currency in which the same were incurred; and

       27.1.2  each payment pursuant to Clause 11.2 (Tax Indemnity) or Clause

28.    PAYMENTS

28.1   PAYMENTS TO THE AGENT
       On each date on which this Agreement requires an amount to be paid by an
       Obligor or a Bank, such Obligor or, as the case may be, such Bank shall
       make the same available to the Agent for value on the due date at such
       time and in such funds and to such account with such bank as the Agent
       shall specify from time to time.

28.2   PAYMENTS BY THE AGENT
       Save as otherwise provided herein, each payment received by the Agent for
       the account of another person pursuant to Clause 28.1 (Payments to the
       Agent) shall:

       28.2.1  in the case of a payment received for the account of a Borrower,
               be made available by the Agent to such Borrower by application:

               (a)  first, in or towards payment (on the date, and in the
                    currency and funds, of receipt) of any amount then due from
                    such Borrower hereunder to the person from whom the amount
                    was so received or in or towards the purchase of any amount
                    of any currency to be so applied; and

               (b)  secondly, in or towards payment (on the date, and in the
                    currency and funds, of receipt) to such account with such
                    bank in the principal financial centre of the country of the

                    shall have previously notified to the Agent for this
                    purpose; and

       28.2.2  in the case of any other payment, be made available by the Agent
               to the person for whose account such payment was received (in the
               case of a Bank, for the account of the relevant Facility Office)
               for value as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by the
               Agent by transfer to such account of such person with such bank
               in the principal financial centre of the country of the currency
               of such payment as such person shall have previously notified to
               the Agent.

28.3   NO SET-OFF
       All payments required to be made by an Obligor under any Finance Document
       shall be calculated without reference to any set-off or counterclaim and
       shall be made free and clear of and without any deduction for or on
       account of any set-off or counterclaim.

28.4   CLAWBACK
       Where a sum is to be paid under a Finance Document to the Agent for
       account of another person, the Agent shall not be obliged to make the
       same available to that other person or to enter into or perform any
       exchange contract in connection therewith until it has been able to
       establish to its satisfaction that it has actually received such sum, but
       if it does so and it proves to be the case that it had not actually
       received such sum, then the person to whom such sum or the proceeds of
       such exchange contract was so made available shall on request refund the
       same to the Agent together with an amount sufficient to indemnify the
       Agent against any cost or loss it may have suffered or incurred by reason
       of its having paid out such sum or the proceeds of such exchange contract
       prior to its having received such sum.

28.5   PARTIAL PAYMENTS
       If and whenever a payment is made by an Obligor hereunder and the Agent
       receives an amount less than the due amount of such payment the Agent may
       apply the amount received towards the obligations of the Obligors under
       this Agreement in the following order:

       28.5.1  FIRST, in or towards payment of any unpaid costs, fees and
               expenses of each of the Agent, the Security Agent and the
               Arranger;

       28.5.2  SECOND, in or towards payment pro rata of any accrued interest,
               commitment commission, payable to any Bank hereunder due but
               unpaid;

       28.5.3  THIRD, in or towards payment pro rata of any Outstandings due but
               unpaid; and

       28.5.4  FOURTH, in or towards payment pro rata of any other sum due but
               unpaid.

28.6   VARIATION OF PARTIAL PAYMENTS
       The order of partial payments set out in Clause 28.5 (Partial Payments)
       shall override any appropriation made by the Obligor to which the partial
       payment relates but the order set out in sub-clauses 28.5.2, 28.5.3 and
       28.5.4 of Clause 28.5 (Partial Payments) may be varied if agreed by all
       the Banks.

29.    SET-OFF

29.1   CONTRACTUAL SET-OFF
       Following an Event of Default which is continuing each Obligor authorises
       each Bank to apply any credit balance to which such Obligor is entitled
       on any account of such Obligor with such Bank in satisfaction of any sum
       due and payable from such Obligor to such Bank under any Finance Document
       but unpaid. For this purpose, each Bank is



                                     - 83 -
<PAGE>

       authorised to purchase with the moneys standing to the credit of any such
       account such other currencies as may be necessary to effect such
       application.

29.2   SET-OFF NOT MANDATORY
       No Bank shall be obliged to exercise any right given to it by Clause 29.1
       (Contractual Set-off).

30.    SHARING

30.1   PAYMENTS TO BANKS
       If a Bank (a "RECOVERING BANK") applies any receipt or recovery from an
       Obligor to a payment due under this Agreement and such amount is received
       or recovered other than in accordance with Clause 28 (Payments), then
       such Recovering Bank shall:

       30.1.1  notify the Agent of such receipt or recovery;

       30.1.2  at the request of the Agent, promptly pay to the Agent an amount
               (the "SHARING PAYMENT") equal to such receipt or recovery less
               any amount which the Agent determines may be retained by such
               Recovering Bank as its share of any payment to be made in
               accordance with Clause 28.5 (Partial Payments).

30.2   REDISTRIBUTION OF PAYMENTS
       The Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by the
       relevant Obligor and distribute it between the Finance Parties (other
       than the Recovering Bank) in accordance with Clause 28.5 (Partial
       Payments).

30.3   RECOVERING BANK'S RIGHTS
       The Recovering Bank will be subrogated to the rights of the parties which
       have shared in a redistribution pursuant to Clause 30.2 (Redistribution
       of Payments) in respect of the Sharing Payment (and the relevant Obligor
       shall be liable to the Recovering Bank in an amount equal to the Sharing
       Payment).

30.4   REPAYABLE RECOVERIES
       If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a Recovering
       Bank becomes repayable and is repaid by such Recovering Bank, then:

       30.4.1  each party which has received a share of such Sharing Payment
               pursuant to Clause 30.2 (Redistribution of Payments) shall, upon
               request of the Agent, pay to the Agent for account of such
               Recovering Bank an amount equal to its share of such Sharing
               Payment; and

       30.4.2  such Recovering Bank's rights of subrogation in respect of any
               reimbursement shall be cancelled and the relevant Obligor will be
               liable to the reimbursing party for the amount so reimbursed.

30.5   EXCEPTION
       This Clause 30 (Sharing) shall not apply if the Recovering Bank would
       not, after making any payment pursuant hereto, have a valid and
       enforceable claim against the relevant Obligor.

30.6   RECOVERIES THROUGH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
       If any Bank intends to commence any action in any court or arbitral
       proceedings it shall give prior notice to the Agent, the Security Agent
       and the other Banks. If any Bank shall commence any action in any court
       or arbitral proceedings to enforce its rights hereunder and, as a result
       thereof or in connection therewith, receives any amount, then such Bank
       shall not be required to share any portion of such amount with any Bank
       which has the legal right to, but does not, join in such action or
       commence and diligently prosecute a separate action to enforce its rights
       in another court or arbitral proceedings.

31.    THE AGENT, THE ARRANGER, THE UNDERWRITERS AND THE BANKS

31.1   APPOINTMENT OF THE AGENT
       Each of the Arranger and the Banks hereby appoints the Agent to act as

               (a) any representation made or deemed to be made by an Obligor in
               connection with any Finance Document is true, (b) no Event of
               Default or Potential Event of Default has occurred, (c) no
               Obligor is in breach of or default under its obligations under
               any Finance Document and (d) any right, power, authority or
               discretion vested herein upon an Instructing Group, the Banks or
               any other person or group of persons has not been exercised;

       31.2.2  assume that each Facility Office of each Bank is that notified to
               it by such Bank in writing prior to the date hereof (or, in the
               case of a Transferee, at the end of the Transfer Certificate to
               which it is a party as Transferee) until it has received from
               such Bank a notice designating some other office of such Bank to
               replace such Facility Office and act upon any such notice until
               the same is superseded by a further such notice;

       31.2.3  engage and pay for the advice or services of any lawyers,

               may to it seem necessary, expedient or desirable and rely upon
               any advice so obtained;

       31.2.4  rely as to any matters of fact which might reasonably be expected
               to be within the knowledge of an Obligor upon a certificate
               signed by or on behalf of such Obligor;

       31.2.5  rely upon any communication or document believed by it to be
               genuine;



                                     - 85 -
<PAGE>

       31.2.6  refrain from exercising any right, power or discretion vested in
               it as agent under any Finance Document unless and until
               instructed by an Instructing Group as to whether or not such
               right, power or discretion is to be exercised and, if it is to be
               exercised, as to the manner in which it should be exercised;

       31.2.7  refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions of an
               Instructing Group to begin any legal action or proceeding arising
               out of or in connection with any Finance Document until it shall
               have received such security as it may require (whether by way of
               payment in advance or otherwise) for all costs, claims, losses,
               expenses (including legal fees) and liabilities together with any
               VAT thereon which it will or may expend or incur in complying
               with such instructions; and

       31.2.8  assume (unless it has specific notice to the contrary) that any
               notice or request made by the Parent is made on behalf of all the
               Obligors.

31.3   AGENT'S OBLIGATIONS
       The Agent shall:

       31.3.1  promptly inform each Bank of the contents of any notice or
               document received by it in its capacity as Agent from an Obligor
               under any Finance Document;

       31.3.2  promptly notify each Bank of the occurrence of any Event of
               Default or any default by an Obligor in the due performance of or
               compliance with its obligations under any Finance Document of
               which the Agent has notice from any other party hereto;

       31.3.3  save as otherwise provided herein, act as agent under any Finance
               Document in accordance with any instructions given to it by an

               Arranger and the Banks; and

       31.3.4  if so instructed by an Instructing Group, refrain from exercising
               any right, power or discretion vested in it as agent under any
               Finance Document.

       The Agent's duties under the Finance Documents are solely mechanical and
       administrative in nature.

31.4   EXCLUDED OBLIGATIONS
       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary expressed or implied herein,
       neither the Agent, any Underwriter nor the Arranger shall:

       31.4.1  be bound to enquire as to (a) whether or not any representation
               made or deemed to be made by an Obligor in connection with any
               Finance Document is true, (b) the occurrence or otherwise of any
               Event of Default or Potential Event of Default, (c) the
               performance by an Obligor of its obligations under any Finance
               Document or (d) any breach of or default by an Obligor of or
               under its obligations under any Finance Document;

       31.4.3  be bound to disclose to any other person any information relating
               to any member of the Group if (a) such person, on providing such
               information, expressly stated to the Agent or, as the case may
               be, the Arranger, that such information was confidential or (b)
               such disclosure would or might in its opinion constitute a breach
               of any law or be otherwise actionable at the suit of any person;

       31.4.4  be under any obligations other than those for which express
               provision is made in any Finance Document; or

               Finance Document.

31.5   INDEMNIFICATION
       Each Bank shall, in its Proportion, from time to time on demand by the
       Agent, indemnify the Agent against any and all costs, claims, losses,
       expenses (including legal fees) and liabilities together with any VAT
       thereon which the Agent may incur, otherwise than by reason of its own
       gross negligence or wilful misconduct, in acting in its capacity as agent
       under any Finance Document (other than any which have been reimbursed by
       the Parent pursuant to Clause 26.1 (Parent's Indemnity)).

31.6   EXCLUSION OF LIABILITIES
       Except in the case of negligence or wilful default, none of the Agent,
       the Underwriters and the Arranger accepts any responsibility:

       31.6.1  for the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the Information
               Memorandum or any other information supplied by the Agent or the
               Arranger, by an Obligor or by any other person in connection with
               any Finance Document or any other agreement, arrangement or
               document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of,
               pursuant to or in connection with any Finance Document;

       31.6.2  for the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or
               enforceability of any Finance Document or any other agreement,

               anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with any Finance
               Document; or

       31.6.3  for the exercise of, or the failure to exercise, any judgement,
               discretion or power given to any of them by or in connection with

               document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of,

               Document, the transactions therein contemplated or any other
               agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed

40.    GOVERNING LAW
       This Agreement is governed by English law.

41.    JURISDICTION
41.1   ENGLISH COURTS
       The courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute
       (a "DISPUTE") arising out of or in connection with the Finance Documents
       (including a dispute regarding the existence, validity or termination of
       this Agreement or the consequences of its nullity).

41.2   CONVENIENT FORUM
       The parties agree that the courts of England are the most appropriate and
       convenient courts to settle Disputes between them and, accordingly, that
       they will not argue to the contrary.

41.3   NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION
       This Clause 41 (Jurisdiction) is for the benefit of the Finance Parties
       only. As a result and notwithstanding Clause 41.1 (English Courts), it
       does not prevent any Finance Party from taking proceedings relating to a
       Dispute ("PROCEEDINGS") in any other courts with jurisdiction. To the
       extent allowed by law, the Finance Parties may take concurrent
       Proceedings in any number of jurisdictions.

41.4   SERVICE OF PROCESS
       Each Original Obligor agrees that the documents which start any
       Proceedings and any other documents required to be served in relation to
       those Proceedings may be served



                                     - 98 -
<PAGE>

       on it on the Parent at its registered office. If any Obligor ceases to
       have a place of business in Great Britain or, as the case may be, the
       appointment of the person mentioned in this Clause 41.4 (Service of
       Process) (or, as the case may be, the relevant Accession Memorandum)
       ceases to be effective, the relevant Obligor shall immediately appoint
       another person in England to accept service of process on its behalf in
       England. If an Obligor fails to do so (and such failure continues for a
       period of not less than fourteen days), the Agent shall be entitled to
       appoint such a person by notice to such Obligor. Nothing contained herein
       shall restrict the right to serve process in any other manner allowed by
       law. This Clause 41.4 (Service of Process) applies to Proceedings in
       England and to Proceedings elsewhere.

AS WITNESS the hands of the duly authorised representatives of the parties
hereto the date and year first above written.

         (a)      On the date of the Exercise Event pursuant to which any

                  (i)      allot and issue to the person(s) identified in the
                           relevant exercise notice (the "ALLOTTEE(S)") the
                           Ordinary Shares to which the Warrantholder is
                           entitled; and

                  (ii)     enter the Allottee(s) name in the register of members
                           of the Company as the holder of the Ordinary Shares
                           issued to the Allottee(s).

         (b)      Within five Business Days of the date of the Exercise Event
                  pursuant to which any Subscription Rights have been exercised
                  (or in the case of a valid exercise of Subscription Rights not

         If the number of Ordinary Shares falling to be allotted to a
         Warrantholder (or at its direction) on an exercise of Subscription

         allotted, the number of Ordinary Shares to be so allotted will be
         rounded down to the nearest whole number of Ordinary Shares.

         (a)      it will keep available for issue sufficient authorised but
                  unissued share capital to satisfy in full the exercise of all
                  outstanding warrants;

         (b)      it will not reduce any of its share capital or its share
                  premium account or capital redemption reserve (other than by

                  expressly permitted by and is in accordance with the terms of
                  Schedule 3 (other than for a purchase of shares in accordance
                  with the Subscription Agreement));

         (c)      it will not make a distribution of profits or of reserves
                  unless each Warrantholder receives at the same time a payment
                  attributable to the number of Ordinary Shares which the
                  relevant Warrantholder would be entitled to receive if the
                  Warrantholder had exercised his respective Subscription Rights
                  in full on the record date for the distribution other than
                  as may be necessary to provide UK Parent with sufficient funds
                  to settle any applicable assessment of taxation or any
                  professional fees and administration costs in the ordinary
                  course of business (including any interest paid on the
                  Subordinated Notes or the PIK Notes incurred by it pursuant to
                  the terms of the Transaction Documents);

         (d)      it will not do anything which would, or could be reasonably
                  expected to, result in Ordinary Shares being issued to the
                  Warrantholders at a discount to their nominal value;

         (e)      it will not conclude terms for a Listing unless the Listing

                  subject of the Warrants;

         (f)      it will not alter its Memorandum of Association or Articles of
                  Association in force on the date of this Instrument in any way
                  which could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect
                  on the rights of the Warrantholders vis a vis the ordinary
                  shareholders.

7.4      NOTIFICATIONS

         (a)      The Company will notify each Warrantholder in writing as soon
                  as reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten
                  Business Days) after the relevant board or general meeting of
                  shareholders (whichever is the earlier) has resolved to
                  implement an Exercise Event or Adjustment Event (or, if no
                  such resolution is required, after the Company became aware of
                  such Exercise Event or Adjustment Event) specifying the
                  proposed date of the event and the nature of the event;

         (b)      Where the Exercise Event or Adjustment Event referred to in a
                  notice made by the Company pursuant to clause 7.3 (a) does not
                  occur within 30 Business Days of the proposed date of the
                  event specified in such notice, an additional notice by the
                  Company pursuant to clause 7.3(a) shall be required if the

                                   SCHEDULE 2

                           THE REGISTER AND TRANSFERS


1.       REGISTER

1.1      An accurate register of entitlement to the Warrants (the "REGISTER")
         will be kept by the Company at its registered office in which the
         Company shall enter:-

         (a)      the names and addresses of the persons for the time being
                  entitled to be registered as the holders of the Warrants;

         (b)      the number of Warrants held by every registered holder; and

         (c)      the date on which the name of every registered holder is
                  entered in the Register in respect of the Warrants in his
                  name.

1.2      Any Warrantholder and any person authorised by any Warrantholder may at
         all reasonable times during office hours inspect the Register and take
         copies of or extracts from it or any part of it.

1.3      The Company may treat the registered Warrantholder as the absolute
         owner of a Warrant and accordingly shall not, except as ordered by a
         court of competent jurisdiction or as required by law, be bound to
         recognise any equitable or other claim to or interest in a Warrant on
         the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or
         other notice of such a claim.

1.4      Every Warrantholder will be recognised by the Company as entitled to
         its Warrants free from any equity, set-off or cross-claim on the part
         of the Company against the original or any intermediate holder of
         Warrants.

2.       TRANSFERS

2.1      Every transfer of a Warrant shall be made in accordance with clause 8
         of the Warrant Instrument by an instrument of transfer in the usual or
         common form or in any other form which may be approved by the
         Directors.

2.2      The instrument of transfer of a Warrant shall be executed by or on
         behalf of the transferor but need not be executed by or on behalf of
         the transferee. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of
         the Warrant until the name of the transferee is entered in the Register
         in respect of the Warrant being transferred.

2.3      The Directors may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer of a
         Warrant otherwise permitted by clause 8 of this deed unless the
         instrument is deposited at the registered office of the Company
         accompanied by the Certificate for the Warrant to which it relates, and
         such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show the
         right of the transferor to make the transfer. The Directors may waive
         production of any Certificate upon production

                                      -15-
<PAGE>

         to them of satisfactory evidence of the loss or destruction of the
         Certificate together with such indemnity as they may require.


2.4      No fee shall be charged for any registration of a transfer of a Warrant
         or for the registration of any other documents which in the opinion of
         the Directors require registration.

2.5      The registration of a transfer shall be conclusive evidence of the
         approval by the Directors of such a transfer.
