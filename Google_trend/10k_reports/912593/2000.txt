                                     PART I
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

         Sun Communities, Inc. (the "Company") owns, operates and finances
manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern and southeastern
United States. The Company is a fully integrated real estate company which,
together with its affiliates and predecessors, has been in the business of
acquiring, operating and expanding manufactured housing communities since 1975.
At December 31, 1999, the Company owned and operated or financed a portfolio of
111 developed properties located in sixteen states (the "Properties"), including
94 manufactured housing communities, 5 recreational vehicle communities, and 12
properties containing both manufactured housing and recreational vehicle sites.
At December 31, 1999, the Properties contained an aggregate of 33,950 developed
manufactured home sites, approximately 7,350 manufactured home sites suitable
for development and approximately 4,650 recreational vehicle sites. In order to
enhance property performance and cash flow, the Company, through Sun Home
Services, Inc., a Michigan corporation ("Home Services" or "SHS"), actively
markets and sells new and used manufactured homes for placement in the
Properties.

         The Company made an election to be taxed as a REIT for federal income
tax purposes commencing with the calendar year beginning January 1, 1994, and is
self-administered and self-managed.

         The Company's executive and principal property management office is
located at 31700 Middlebelt Road, Suite 145, Farmington Hills, Michigan 48334
and its telephone number is (248) 932-3100. The Company has regional property
management offices located in Elkhart, Indiana, and Tampa, Florida. The Company,
which is a Maryland corporation, employed 639 people as of December 31, 1999.

STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY

         The operations of the Company are carried on through certain
subsidiaries (the "Subsidiaries"), including Sun Communities Operating Limited
Partnership, a Michigan limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership") which,
among other things, enables the Company to comply with certain complex
requirements under the Federal tax rules and regulations applicable to REITs.
The Company established the Operating Partnership to allow the Company to
acquire manufactured housing communities in transactions that defer some or all
of the sellers' tax consequences. Substantially all of the Company's assets are
held by or through the Operating Partnership, of which the Company is the sole
general partner, and wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. In addition to
the Operating Partnership, the Subsidiaries include Home Services, which
provides manufactured home sales and other services to current and prospective
tenants of the Properties. The Operating Partnership owns 100% of the non-voting
preferred stock of Home Services, which entitles the Operating Partnership to
95% of the cash flow from operating activities of Home Services. The voting
common stock of Home Services is currently owned by Gary A. Shiffman and Jeffrey
P. Jorissen, executive officers of the Company, and the Estate of Milton M.
Shiffman, a former executive officer of the Company, entitling them to the
remaining 5% of such cash flow from operating activities. Sun Water Oak Golf,
Inc. ("Sun Golf") is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Home Services. Sun Golf was
organized to own and operate the golf course, restaurant and related facilities
located on the Water Oak Property that were acquired in November 1994.

THE MANUFACTURED HOUSING COMMUNITY INDUSTRY

         A manufactured housing community is a residential subdivision designed
and improved with sites for the placement of manufactured homes and related
improvements and amenities. Manufactured homes are detached, single-family homes
which are produced off-site by manufacturers and installed on sites within the
community. Manufactured homes are available in a wide array of designs,
providing owners with a level of customization generally unavailable in other
forms of multi-family housing.

         Modern manufactured housing communities, such as the Properties,
contain improvements similar to other garden-style residential developments,
including centralized entrances, paved streets, curbs and gutters, and parkways.
In addition, these communities also often provide a number of amenities, such as
a clubhouse, a swimming pool, shuffleboard courts, tennis courts, laundry
facilities and cable television service.

         The owner of each home in the Company's communities leases the site on
which the home is located. The Company owns the underlying land, utility
connections, streets, lighting, driveways, common area amenities and other
capital improvements and is responsible for enforcement of community guidelines
and maintenance. Some communities provide water and sewer service through public
or private utilities, while others provide these services to residents from
on-site facilities. Each owner within the Company's communities is responsible
for the maintenance of his home and leased site. As a result, capital
expenditure needs tend to be less significant, relative to multi-family rental
apartment complexes.

PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

         The Company's property management strategy emphasizes intensive,
hands-on management by dedicated, on-site community managers. The Company
believes that this on-site focus enables it to continually monitor and address
tenant concerns, the performance of competitive properties and local market
conditions. Of the Company's 639 employees, 577 are located on-site as property
managers, support staff, or maintenance personnel.

         The Company's community managers are overseen by Brian W. Fannon,
Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, who has 30 years of property
management experience, two Senior Vice Presidents, four Regional Vice Presidents
and fourteen Regional Property Managers. In addition, the Regional Property
Managers are responsible for semi-annual market surveys of competitive
communities, interaction with local manufactured home dealers and regular
property inspections.

         Each community manager performs regular inspections in order to
continually monitor the property's physical condition and provides managers with
the opportunity to understand and effectively address tenant concerns. In
addition to a community manager, each property has an on-site maintenance person
and management support staff. The Company holds periodic training sessions for
all property management personnel to ensure that management policies are
implemented effectively and professionally.

HOME SALES

         Home Services offers manufactured home sales services to tenants and
prospective tenants in the Company's communities. Since tenants often purchase a
home already on-site within a community, such services enhance occupancy and
property performance. Additionally, because many of the homes in the Properties
are sold through Home Services, better control of home quality in the Company's
communities can be maintained than if sales services were conducted solely
through third-party brokers.

COMPETITION

         All of the Properties are located in developed areas that include other
manufactured housing community properties. The number of competitive
manufactured housing community properties in a particular area could have a
material effect on the Company's ability to lease sites and on rents charged at
the Properties or at any newly acquired properties. The Company may be competing
with others that have greater resources than the Company and whose officers and
directors have more experience than the Company's officers and directors. In
addition, other forms of multi-family residential properties, such as private
and federally funded or assisted multi-family housing and single-family housing,
provide housing alternatives to potential tenants of manufactured housing
communities.

REGULATIONS AND INSURANCE

         General. Manufactured housing community properties are subject to
various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to
recreational facilities such as swimming pools, clubhouses and other common
areas. The Company believes that each Property has the necessary operating
permits and approvals.

         Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). The Properties and any newly
acquired manufactured housing communities must comply with the ADA. The ADA has
separate compliance requirements for "public accommodations" and "commercial
facilities," but generally requires that public facilities such as clubhouses,
pools and recreation areas be made accessible to people with disabilities.
Compliance with ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and
other capital improvements at the Company's properties. Noncompliance could
result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The
Company does not believe the ADA will have a material adverse impact on the
Company's results of operations. If required property improvements involve a
greater expenditure than the Company currently anticipates, or if the
improvements must be made on a more accelerated basis than it anticipates, the
Company's ability to make expected distributions could be adversely affected.
The Company believes that its competitors face similar costs to comply with the
requirements of the ADA.

         Rent Control Legislation. State and local rent control laws in certain
jurisdictions limit the Company's ability to increase rents and to recover
increases in operating expenses and the costs of capital improvements. Enactment
of such laws has been considered from time to time in other jurisdictions. The
Company presently expects to continue to operate manufactured housing community
properties, and may purchase additional properties, in markets that are either
subject to rent control or in which rent-limiting legislation exists or may be
enacted. For example, 25 of the Properties are located in Florida, which has
enacted a law which provides that a majority of tenants in a manufactured
housing community may require that a proposed increase in site rental rates,
reduction in services or utilities or change in the community's rules and
regulations be submitted for formal mediation or arbitration if they believe
that the proposal is unreasonable.

         Insurance. Management believes that the Properties are covered by
adequate fire, flood, property and business interruption insurance provided by
reputable companies and with commercially reasonable deductibles and limits. The
Company maintains a blanket policy that covers all of the Properties. The
Company has obtained title insurance insuring fee title to the Properties in an
aggregate amount which the Company believes to be adequate.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

         General. At December 31, 1999, the Properties consisted of 94
manufactured housing communities, 5 recreational vehicle communities, and 12
properties containing both manufactured



                                      -4-



<PAGE>   5

housing and recreational vehicle sites located in sixteen states concentrated in
the midwestern and southeastern United States. At December 31, 1999, the
Properties contained 33,950 developed manufactured home sites, approximately
7,350 manufactured home sites suitable for development and approximately 4,650
recreational vehicle sites. In addition, at December 31, 1999, the Company owned
seven undeveloped properties on which the Company plans to develop approximately
3,400 manufactured home sites. Most of the Properties include amenities oriented
towards family and retirement living. Of the 111 Properties, 51 have more than
300 developed manufactured home sites, with the largest having 913 developed
manufactured home sites.

         The Properties had an aggregate occupancy rate of 94.0% as of December
31, 1999, excluding recreational vehicle sites. Since January 1, 1999, the
Properties have averaged an aggregate annual turnover of homes (where the home
is moved out of the community) of approximately 3.1% and an average annual
turnover of residents (where the home is sold and remains within the community,
typically without interruption of rental income) of approximately 8.5%.

         The Company believes that its Properties' high amenity levels
contribute to low turnover and generally high occupancy rates. All of the
Properties provide residents with attractive amenities with most offering a
clubhouse, a swimming pool, laundry facilities and cable television service.
Many Properties offer additional amenities such as sauna/whirlpool spas, tennis,
shuffleboard and basketball courts and/or exercise rooms.

         The Company has sought to concentrate its communities within certain
geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management and
operation. The Properties are principally concentrated in the midwestern and
southeastern United States. The Company has identified Florida as a key market
in which to expand its existing operations in the southeast because of Florida's
stable tenant base, relatively low cost of living and attractive acquisition
opportunities. Additionally, the Company's midwestern operations serve as a
source of prospective tenants for the Florida Properties, which are generally
oriented towards retirement living. Nevertheless, because the Company believes
that geographic diversification will help insulate the portfolio from regional
economic influences, the Company is also interested in expanding its operations
in the western United States.

ITEM 7.       MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
              CONDITION & RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


OVERVIEW
         The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the
Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Comparison of year ended December 31, 1999 to year ended December 31, 1998

         For the year ended December 31, 1999, income before other, net and
minority interests increased by $5.2 million from $31.4 million to $36.6
million, when compared to the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase was due
to increased revenues of $14.4 million while expenses increased by $9.2 million.

         Income from property increased by $11.1 million from $114.3 million to
$125.4 million, or 9.7 percent, due to acquisitions ($4.0 million), rent
increases ($4.1 million), lease up of manufactured home sites ($1.7 million) and
other community revenues ($1.3 million).

         Income from affiliate decreased $0.5 million from $2.2 million to $1.7
million due to the Company no longer providing floorplan financing of the model
home inventories of Sun Home Services ("SHS").

         Other income increased by $3.7 million from $3.6 million to $7.3
million due primarily to a $2.7 million increase in interest income.

         Property operating and maintenance expenses increased by $1.7 million
from $25.6 million to $27.3 million, or 6.4 percent, due primarily to
acquisitions ($1.0 million).

         Real estate taxes increased by $0.2 million from $8.7 million to $8.9
million, or 1.8 percent, due primarily to the acquired communities.

         Property management expenses increased by $0.3 million from $2.3
million to $2.6 million, or 16.3 percent, representing 2.1 percent and 2.0
percent of income from property in 1999 and 1998, respectively.

         General and administrative expenses increased by $0.4 million from $3.3
million to $3.7 million, or 10.3 percent, due primarily to increased staffing to
manage the growth of the Company. General and administrative expenses as a
percentage of income from property remained constant at 2.9 percent in both
periods.

         Interest expense increased by $3.1 million from $23.7 million to $26.8
million due primarily to investments in rental property and notes receivable.
Included in interest is amortization of deferred finance costs of $0.9 million
and $0.7 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively.

         Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
("EBITDA") increased by $11.8 million from $80.1 million to $91.9 million.
EBITDA as a percent of revenues increased to 68.4 percent in 1999 compared to
66.7 percent in 1998.

         Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $3.6 million from
$25.0 million to $28.6 million due primarily to the acquisition and development
of communities in 1999 and 1998.

minority interests increased by $3.5 million from $27.9 million to $31.4
million, when compared to the year ended December 31, 1997. The increase was due
to increased revenues of $23.9 million while expenses increased by $20.4
million.

         Income from property increased by $21.1 million from $93.2 million to
$114.3 million due primarily to the acquisition of 10 communities comprising

approximately 5,200 developed sites during 1997.

         Income from affiliate increased $1.0 million from $1.2 million to $2.2
million due primarily to increased sales of homes by SHS.

million primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in interest income.

         Property operating and maintenance expenses increased by $4.5 million
from $21.1 million to $25.6 million, or 21.5 percent, due primarily to the
acquired communities.

</TABLE>

         (1) Occupancy % and weighted average rent relates to manufactured
             housing sites, excluding recreational vehicle sites.

         (2) Includes two communities and 390 developed sites owned through a
             joint venture.

         (3) Includes 1,138 and 717 sites available for development in 1999 and
             1998, respectively, and 322 sites planned for development owned
             through a joint venture.

         On a same property basis, property revenues increased by $5.2 million
from $81.9 million to $87.1 million, or 6.3 percent, due primarily to increases
in rents and occupancy related charges including water and property tax pass
through. Also contributing to revenue growth was the increase of 546 leased
sites at December 31, 1999 compared to December 31, 1998.

         Property operating expenses increased by $0.4 million from $22.4
million to $22.8 million, or 1.7 percent, due to increased occupancies and
costs. Property EBITDA increased by $4.8 million from $59.5 million to $64.3
million, or 8.1 percent.





LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

        Cash and cash equivalents increased by $1.7 million to $11.4 million at
December 31, 1999 compared to $9.7 million at December 31, 1998 because cash
provided by operating and financing activities exceeded cash used in investing
activities.


                                       15
<PAGE>   16



        Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $8.2 million to
$61.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to $53.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 1998. This increase was primarily due to income
before minority interests, depreciation and amortization and other, net
increasing by $6.7 million and other assets decreasing by $6.4 million, offset
by accounts payable and other liabilities decreasing by $5.0 million.

        Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $16.1 million to
$90.3 million from $106.4 million due to a $29.2 million decrease in rental
property acquisition activities and an increase of $15.9 in proceeds related to
asset sales, offset by an increase of $29.1 million used to finance notes
receivable.

        Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $30.1 million to
$30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to $60.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 1998. This decrease was primarily because $65.0
million of notes payable were issued in 1998 and none issued in 1999 and
distributions increasing by $3.5 million offset by $26.1 million of additional
proceeds from common stock and operating partnership units and increased
borrowings on the line of credit of $12.0 million.

        The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements
generally through its working capital provided by operating activities. The
Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as
scheduled debt maturities and property acquisitions through the issuance of
equity or debt securities, or interests in the Operating Partnership. The
Company considers these sources to be adequate and anticipates they will
continue to be adequate to meet operating requirements, capital improvements,
investment in development, and payment of distributions by the Company in
accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long term. The Company
may also meet these short-term and long-term requirements by utilizing its $125
million line of credit which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.0 percent and is due
January 1, 2003. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."

        On September 29, 1999, through the Operating Partnership, the Company
completed a private placement of 2 million Series A Perpetual Preferred Units to
institutional investors in exchange for a capital contribution of $50 million.
Series A Preferred Units, which may be called by the Company at par on or after
September 29, 2004, have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption and pay a
cumulative, quarterly dividend at an annualized rate of 8.875 percent. The
Series A Preferred Units are convertible into preferred stock under certain
circumstances. The Company used the proceeds from such private placement to
reduce outstanding indebtedness under its revolving credit facility.

        At December 31, 1999, the Company's debt to total market capitalization
approximated 34.7 percent (assuming conversion of all Common and Preferred OP
Units to shares of common stock), with a weighted average maturity of
approximately 5.3 years and a weighted average interest rate of 7.12 percent.

        Capital expenditures for 1999 included recurring capital expenditures of
$5.9 million including $0.4 million for additional space and related costs at
corporate headquarters and revenue producing capital expenditures of $1.1
million which principally consisted of water metering programs.

RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES

        The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997 was 1.96:1, 2.04:1, and 2.40:1 respectively.

    INFLATION

          Most of the leases allow for periodic rent increases which provide the
   Company with the opportunity to achieve increases in rental income as each
   lease expires. Such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation
   to the Company.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT

         This Form 10-K contains various "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
and the Company intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the
safe harbors created thereby. The words "may", "will", "expect", "believe",
"anticipate", "should", "estimate", and similar expressions identify
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the
Company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance,
but are based upon current assumptions regarding the Company's operations,
future results and prospects, and are subject to many uncertainties and factors
relating to the Company's operations and business environment which may cause
the actual results of the Company to be materially different from any future
results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Please see the
section entitled "Risk Factors" of the Company's Registration Statement on Form
S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 15, 2000 for a
list of uncertainties and factors.

         Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: (i)
changes in the general economic climate; (ii) increased competition in the
geographic areas in which the Company owns and operates manufactured housing
communities; (iii) changes in government laws and regulations affecting
manufactured housing communities; and (iv) the ability of the Company to
continue to identify, negotiate and acquire manufactured housing communities
and/or vacant land which may be developed into manufactured housing communities
on terms favorable to the Company. The Company undertakes no obligation to
publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of
new information, future events, or otherwise.


YEAR 2000 UPDATE

         The Year 2000 ("Y2K") issue concerns the inability of computerized
information systems to accurately calculate, store and process data using a date
after 1999.

         The Company's Y2K compliance program consisted of three phases, (i)
inventory and assessment, (ii) upgrade, replacement and testing, and (iii)
assurance from material third-party service providers and vendors, all of which
were successfully completed prior to December 31, 1999. In February 2000, the
Company officially concluded its Y2K compliance program as no events had
occurred that significantly affected either the Company's operations or its
financial statements.

         The Company believes that its expenditures for assessing Y2K issues,
though difficult to quantify, have not been material as the Company's Y2K
evaluation has been conducted primarily by its own personnel or by its vendors
in connection with their servicing agreements.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

        In June 1998, FASB issued SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). This Statement establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, (collectively referred to as
derivatives) and for hedging activities. This statement will be adopted
effective January 1, 2001. There is no effect from the application of SFAS 133
on the earnings and financial position of the Company as the Company has no
derivative instruments at December 31, 1999.


OTHER

         Industry analysts consider funds from operations ("FFO") to be an
appropriate measure of the performance of an equity REIT. It is defined as
income before minority interests plus non-cash items such as depreciation and
amortization. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an
indication of the Company's performance or to cash flows as a measure of
liquidity.

         The following table presents FFO for each of the quarters during 1999,
1998 and 1997:

ITEM 7A.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

         The Company's principle market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The
Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to refinancing long-term fixed rate obligations, the opportunity cost
of fixed rate obligations in a falling interest rate environment and its
variable rate line of credit. The Company primarily enters into debt obligations
to support general corporate purposes including acquisitions, capital
improvements and working capital needs.

The table below presents principal, interest and related weighted average
interest rates by year of maturity (in thousands):

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Sun Communities, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sun
Communities, Inc. (the "Company") at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item
14(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

SUN COMMUNITIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1999, 1998 AND 1997

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
     POLICIES:
     A.  BUSINESS: Sun Communities, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") is
         a real estate investment trust ("REIT") which owns and operates or
         finances 111 manufactured housing communities located in 16 states
         concentrated principally in the Midwest and Southeast comprising
         approximately 38,600 developed sites and approximately 7,350 sites
         suitable for development. The Company, which has elected to be taxed
         under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, generally
         will not be subject to federal or state income taxes to the extent it
         distributes its REIT taxable income to its stockholders.

         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
         accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
         and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
         liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
         dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
         and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ
         from those estimates.

     B.  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The accompanying financial statements
         include the accounts of the Company and all majority-owned and
         controlled subsidiaries. The minority interests include Common
         Operating Partnership Units ("OP Units") which are convertible into an
         equivalent number of shares of the Company's common stock. Such
         conversion would have no effect on earnings per share since the
         allocation of earnings to an OP Unit is equivalent to earnings
         allocated to a share of common stock. Of the 20.2 million OP Units
         outstanding, the Company owns 17.5 million or 86.6 percent. The
         minority interests are adjusted to their relative ownership interest
         whenever OP Units or common stock are issued, converted or retired by
         reclassification to/from paid-in capital.

         Included in minority interests at December 31, 1999 are 2 million
         Series A Perpetual Preferred OP Units ("PPOP Units") issued at $25 per
         unit in September 1999 bearing an annual coupon rate of 8.875 percent.
         The PPOP Units may be called by the Company at par on or after
         September 29, 2004, have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption and
         are convertible into preferred stock under certain circumstances.

         Also included in minority interests are 1.3 million Preferred OP Units
         ("POP Units") issued at $27 per unit bearing an annual cumulative
         dividend of $1.89 and redeemable at par or convertible in June, 2002.
         The POP Units are convertible one-for-one into OP Units at prices up to
         $31.50 per share. At prices above $31.50 per share, the POP Units are
         convertible into OP Units based on a formula the numerator of which is
         $31.50 plus 25 percent of stock price appreciation above $36 per share.
         The denominator is the then stock price. Had conversion occurred at the
         December 31, 1999 stock price of $32.188, the 1.325 million POP Units
         would have converted into 1.297 million OP Units.

     C.  RENTAL PROPERTY: Rental property is recorded at the lower of cost, less
         accumulated depreciation or fair value. Management evaluates the
         recoverability of its investment in rental property whenever events or
         changes in circumstances such as recent operating results, expected net
         operating cash flow and plans for future operations indicate that full
         asset recoverability is questionable.

         Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated
         useful lives of the assets. Useful lives are 30 years for land
         improvements and buildings and 7 to 15 years for furniture, fixtures
         and equipment.

         Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to
         operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements,
         which improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset, are
         capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.

DECEMBER 31, 1999, 1998 AND 1997


1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
     POLICIES, CONTINUED:

     D.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: The Company considers all highly liquid
         investments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash
         and cash equivalents.

     E.  INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO AFFILIATES: Sun Home Services ("SHS")
         provides home sales and other services to current and prospective
         tenants. The Company owns 100 percent of the outstanding preferred
         stock of SHS, is entitled to 95 percent of the operating cash flow, and
         accounts for its investment utilizing the equity method of accounting.
         The common stock is owned by three officers of the Company who are
         entitled to receive 5 percent of the operating cash flow. Included in
         other assets at December 31, 1999 and 1998 is $6.4 million and $11.3
         million, respectively, related to the Company's investment in SHS.

         On December 31, 1999, "SunChamp", a 50 percent controlled joint venture
         of the Company and Champion Enterprises, Inc., acquired three
         communities under initial development. The Company intends to account
         for its investment utilizing the equity method of accounting.

     F.  REVENUE RECOGNITION: Rental income attributable to leases is recorded
         on a straight-line basis when earned from tenants. Leases entered into
         by tenants generally range from month-to-month to one year and are
         renewable by mutual agreement of the Company and resident or, in some
         cases, as provided by statute.

     G.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The carrying value of financial
         instruments which includes cash and cash investments, mortgages and
         notes receivable and debt approximates fair value.

     H.  TAX STATUS OF DIVIDENDS: Approximately 19.4, 19.8, and 31.2 percent of
         the distributions paid in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively, represent
         a return of capital. The distributions paid included a 16.6 and 14.6
         percent capital gain in 1999 and 1998, respectively.

     I.  CASH FLOW HEDGES: The company has periodically entered into hedge
         transactions to lock-in the basic interest cost of financing
         acquisitions. The gain or loss on such hedges is amortized as an
         adjustment to interest expense over the term of the related financing.

     J.  RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain 1998 and 1997 amounts have been reclassified
         to conform with the 1999 financial statement presentation. Such
         reclassifications have no effect on results of operations as originally
         presented.

     options. In addition, the Company established a Long-Term Incentive Plan
     for certain employees granting up to 240,000 options in 1997, which become
     exercisable in equal installments in 2002-2004 based on corporate profit
     performance.

     The Company has opted to measure compensation cost utilizing the intrinsic
     value method. The fair value of each option grant was estimated as of the
     date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
     following assumptions for options granted

     Estimated fair value per share of options granted during year.................$  2.43       $   2.43      $   2.82

     Assumptions:
     Annualized dividend yield.....................................................    7.1%           7.0%          7.1%
     Common stock price volatility.................................................   15.3%          15.9%         15.6%
     Risk-free rate of return......................................................    6.4%           5.4%          6.7%
     Expected option term (in years)...............................................      6              4             7
</TABLE>

     If compensation cost for stock option grants had been recognized based on
     the fair value at the grant date, this would have resulted in net income of
     $28.8 million, $25.8 million and $21.9 million and basic net income per
     share of $1.68, $1.53 and $1.36 in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

6.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:

    In April 1998, the Company declared a dividend of one Preferred Stock
    Purchase Right (Right) for each outstanding share of common stock. The
    Rights are not presently exercisable. Each Right entitles the holder, upon
    the occurrence of certain specified events, including a material change in
    the ownership of the Company, to purchase preferred stock and common stock,
    from the Company and/or from another person into which the Company is merged
    or which acquires control of the Company. The Rights may be generally
    redeemed by the Company at a price of $0.01 per Right. The Rights expire on
    June 8, 2008.

    In December 1999, and June 1998, the Company issued stock awards of 24,000
    and 165,000 restricted shares, respectively, to officers and certain
    employees which are being amortized over their five to ten year vesting
    period.

    In December 1998, the Company issued common stock and OP units aggregating
    $25.5 million to directors, employees and consultants. The purchase was
    financed by personal bank loans guaranteed by the Company until January
    2004.

     Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that would occur
     if dilutive securities were exercised or converted into common stock.
     Convertible POP Units are excluded from the computations as their inclusion
     would have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share in 1999, 1998 and
     1997.

     (a) Operating income is defined as total revenues less property operating
         and maintenance expense, real estate tax expense, property management,
         and general and administrative expenses. Operating income is a measure
         of the performance of the operations of the properties before the
         effects of depreciation, amortization and interest expense. Operating
         income is not necessarily an indication of the performance of the
         Company or a measure of liquidity.

     (b) Other, net consists principally of net gains (losses) on the
         sale/dispositions of depreciated properties.

                                  EXHIBIT 12.1

                COMPUTATION OF RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES
     AND RATIO OF EARNINGS TO COMBINED FIXED CHARGES AND PREFERRED DIVIDENDS

         The ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the Company (including its
subsidiaries and majority-owned partnerships) presents the relationship of the
Company's earnings to its fixed charges. "Earnings" as used in the computation,
is based on the Company's net income (loss) from continuing operations (which
includes a charge to income for depreciation and amortization expense) before
income taxes, plus fixed charges. "Fixed charges" is comprised of (i) interest
charges, whether expensed or capitalized, and (ii) amortization of loan costs
and discounts or premiums relating to indebtedness of the Company and its
subsidiaries and majority-owned partnerships, excluding in all cases items which
would be or are eliminated in consolidation.

         The Company's ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges presents the
relationship of the Company's earnings (as defined above) to fixed charges (as
defined above).
