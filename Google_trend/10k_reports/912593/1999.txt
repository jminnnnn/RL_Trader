                                     PART I
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

         Sun Communities, Inc. (the "Company") owns, operates and finances
manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern and southeastern
United States. The Company is a fully integrated real estate company which,
together with its affiliates and predecessors, has been in the business of
acquiring, operating and expanding manufactured housing communities since 1975.
At December 31, 1998, the Company owned and managed a portfolio of 102 developed
properties located in fourteen states (the "Properties"), including 91
manufactured housing communities, 5 recreational vehicle communities, and 6
properties containing both manufactured housing and recreational vehicle sites.
At December 31, 1998, the Properties contained an aggregate of 31,512 developed
manufactured home sites, approximately 2,500 manufactured home sites suitable
for development and approximately 5,100 recreational vehicle sites. In order to
enhance property performance and cash flow, the Company, through Sun Home
Services, Inc., a Michigan corporation ("Home Services" or "SHS"), actively
markets and sells new and used manufactured homes for placement in the
Properties.

         The Company made an election to be taxed as a REIT for federal income
tax purposes commencing with the calendar year beginning January 1, 1994, and is
self-administered and self-managed.

         The Company's executive and principal property management office is
located at 31700 Middlebelt Road, Suite 145, Farmington Hills, Michigan 48334
and its telephone number is (248) 932-3100. The Company has regional property
management offices located in Indianapolis, Indiana, Orlando, Florida and
Austin, Texas. The Company, which is a Maryland corporation, employed 552 people
as of December 31, 1998.

HISTORY OF THE COMPANY

         The immediate predecessor to Sun Communities, Inc. was incorporated in
January 1985 to continue and expand the business of acquiring, owning and
operating manufactured housing communities that was originally started in 1975.
Since its inception, the Company's strategy has been to acquire and in many
cases expand or renovate existing manufactured housing communities. The Company
has maintained this strategy because it believes attractive investment returns
can be obtained by purchasing existing properties with expansion potential.

STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY

         The operations of the Company are carried on through certain
subsidiaries (the "Subsidiaries"), including Sun Communities Operating Limited
Partnership, a Michigan limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership") and
Sun Communities Finance Limited Partnership, a Michigan limited partnership (the
"Financing Partnership"), which, among other things, enables the Company to
comply with certain complex requirements under the Federal tax rules and
regulations applicable to REITs. The Company established the Operating
Partnership to allow the Company to acquire manufactured housing communities in
transactions that defer some or all of the sellers' tax consequences.
Substantially all of the Company's assets are held by or through the Operating
Partnership, of which the Company is the sole general partner, and wholly-owned
subsidiaries of the Company. In addition to the Operating Partnership and the
Financing Partnership, the Subsidiaries include Home Services, which provides
manufactured home sales and other services to current and prospective tenants of
the Properties. The Operating Partnership owns 100% of the non-voting preferred
stock of Home Services, which entitles the Operating Partnership to 95% of the
cash flow from operating activities of Home Services. The voting common stock of
Home Services is owned





                                       -2-
<PAGE>   3



by Milton M. Shiffman, Gary A. Shiffman and Jeffrey P. Jorissen, executive
officers of the Company, entitling them to the remaining 5% of such cash flow
from operating activities. Sun Water Oak Golf, Inc. ("Sun Golf") is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Home Services. Sun Golf was organized to own and
operate the golf course, restaurant and related facilities located on the Water
Oak Property that were acquired in November 1994.

THE MANUFACTURED HOUSING COMMUNITY INDUSTRY

         A manufactured housing community is a residential subdivision designed
and improved with sites for the placement of manufactured homes and related
improvements and amenities. Manufactured homes are detached, single-family homes
which are produced off-site by manufacturers and installed on sites within the
community. Manufactured homes are available in a wide array of designs,
providing owners with a level of customization generally unavailable in other
forms of multi-family housing.

         Modern manufactured housing communities, such as the Properties,
contain improvements similar to other garden-style residential developments,
including centralized entrances, paved streets, curbs and gutters, and parkways.
In addition, these communities also often provide a number of amenities, such as
a clubhouse, a swimming pool, shuffleboard courts, tennis courts, laundry
facilities and cable television service.

         The owner of each home in the Company's communities leases the site on
which the home is located. The Company owns the underlying land, utility
connections, streets, lighting, driveways, common area amenities and other
capital improvements and is responsible for enforcement of community guidelines
and maintenance. Some communities provide water and sewer service through public
or private utilities, while others provide these services to residents from
on-site facilities. Each owner within the Company's communities is responsible
for the maintenance of his home and leased site. As a result, capital
expenditure needs tend to be less significant, relative to multi-family rental
apartment complexes.

PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

         The Company's property management strategy emphasizes intensive,
hands-on management by dedicated, on-site community managers. The Company
believes that this on-site focus enables it to continually monitor and address
tenant concerns, the performance of competitive properties and local market
conditions. Of the Company's 552 employees, 492 are located on-site as property
managers, support staff, or maintenance personnel.

         The Company's community managers are overseen by Brian W. Fannon,
Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, who has 29 years of property
management experience, two Senior Vice Presidents, four Regional Vice Presidents
and twelve Regional Property Managers. In addition, the Regional Property
Managers are responsible for semi-annual market surveys of competitive
communities, interaction with local manufactured home dealers and regular
property inspections.

         Each community manager performs regular inspections in order to
continually monitor the property's physical condition and provides managers with
the opportunity to understand and effectively address tenant concerns. In
addition to a community manager, each property has an on-site maintenance person
and management support staff. The Company holds periodic training sessions for
all property management personnel to ensure that management policies are
implemented effectively and professionally.

HOME SALES

         Home Services offers manufactured home sales services to tenants and
prospective tenants in the Company's communities. Since tenants often purchase a
home already on-site within a community, such services enhance occupancy and
property performance. Additionally, since many of the homes in the Properties
are sold through Home Services, better control of home quality in the Company's
communities can be maintained than if sales services were conducted solely
through third-party brokers.

COMPETITION

         All of the Properties are located in developed areas that include other
manufactured housing community properties. The number of competitive
manufactured housing community properties in a particular area could have a
material effect on the Company's ability to lease sites and on rents charged at
the Properties or at any newly acquired properties. The Company may be competing
with others that have greater resources than the Company and whose officers and
directors have more experience than the Company's officers and directors. In
addition, other forms of multi-family residential properties, such as private
and federally funded or assisted multi-family housing and single-family housing,
provide housing alternatives to potential tenants of manufactured housing
communities.

REGULATIONS AND INSURANCE

         General. Manufactured housing community properties are subject to
various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to
recreational facilities such as swimming pools, clubhouses and other common
areas. The Company believes that each Property has the necessary operating
permits and approvals.

         Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). The Properties and any newly
acquired manufactured housing communities must comply with the ADA. The ADA has
separate compliance requirements for "public accommodations" and "commercial
facilities," but generally requires that public facilities such as clubhouses,
pools and recreation areas be made accessible to people with disabilities.
Compliance with ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and
other capital improvements at the Company's properties. Noncompliance could
result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The
Company does not believe the ADA will have a material adverse impact on the
Company's results of operations. If required property improvements involve a
greater expenditure than the Company currently anticipates, or if the
improvements must be made on a more accelerated basis than it anticipates, the
Company's ability to make expected distributions could be adversely affected.
The Company believes that its competitors face similar costs to comply with the
requirements of the ADA.

         Rent Control Legislation. State and local rent control laws in certain
jurisdictions limit the Company's ability to increase rents and to recover
increases in operating expenses and the costs of capital improvements. Enactment
of such laws has been considered from time to time in other jurisdictions. The
Company presently expects to continue to operate manufactured housing community
properties, and may purchase additional properties, in markets that are either
subject to rent control or in which rent-limiting legislation exists or may be
enacted. For example, 27 of the Properties are located in Florida, which has
enacted a law which provides that a majority of tenants in a manufactured
housing community may require that a proposed increase in site rental rates,
reduction in services or utilities or change in the community's rules and
regulations be submitted for formal mediation or arbitration if they believe
that the proposal is unreasonable.

         Insurance. Management believes that the Properties are covered by
adequate fire, flood, property and business interruption insurance provided by
reputable companies and with








                                       -4-
<PAGE>   5


commercially reasonable deductibles and limits. The Company maintains a blanket
policy that covers all of the Properties. The Company has obtained title
insurance insuring fee title to the Properties in an aggregate amount which the
Company believes to be adequate.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

         General. At December 31, 1998, the Properties consisted of 91
manufactured housing communities, 5 recreational vehicle communities, and 6
properties containing both manufactured housing and recreational vehicle sites
concentrated in fourteen states in the midwestern and southeastern United
States. At December 31, 1998, the Properties contained 31,512 developed
manufactured home sites, approximately 2,500 manufactured home sites suitable
for development and approximately 5,100 recreational vehicle sites. In addition,
at December 31, 1998, the Company owned nine undeveloped properties on which the
Company plans to develop approximately 4,400 manufactured home sites. Most of
the Properties include amenities oriented towards family and retirement living.
Of the 102 Properties, 47 have more than 300 developed manufactured home sites,
with the largest having 913 developed manufactured home sites.

         The Properties had an aggregate occupancy rate of 94.2% as of December
31, 1998, excluding recreational vehicle sites. Since January 1, 1998, the
Properties have averaged an aggregate annual turnover of homes (where the home
is moved out of the community) of approximately 3% and an average annual
turnover of residents (where the home is sold and remains within the community,
typically without interruption of rental income) of approximately 8%.

         The Company believes that its Properties' high amenity levels
contribute to low turnover and generally high occupancy rates. All of the
Properties provide residents with attractive amenities with most offering a
clubhouse, a swimming pool, laundry facilities and cable television service.
Many Properties offer additional amenities such as sauna/whirlpool spas, tennis,
shuffleboard and basketball courts and/or exercise rooms.

         The Company has sought to concentrate its communities within certain
geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management and
operation. Except for five Properties located in Texas, and one property located
in each of Colorado, Oregon, and Nevada, the Properties are located in the
midwestern and southeastern United States. The Company has identified Florida as
a key market in which to expand its existing operations in the southeast because
of Florida's stable tenant base, relatively low cost of living and attractive
acquisition opportunities. Additionally, the Company's midwestern operations
serve as a source of prospective tenants for the Florida Properties, which are
generally oriented towards retirement living. Because the Company believes that
geographic diversification will help insulate the portfolio from regional
economic influences, the Company is also interested in acquiring properties in
the western United States.

     (1) Occupancy % and weighted average rent relates to manufactured housing
         sites, excluding recreational vehicle sites.

         On a same property basis, property revenues increased by $5.4 million
from $70.6 million to $76.0 million, or 7.6 percent, due primarily to increases
in rents and occupancy related charges including water and property tax pass
throughs. Also contributing to revenue growth was the increase of 575 leased
sites at December 31, 1998 compared to December 31, 1997.

         Property operating expenses increased by $.9 million from $19.9 million
to $20.8 million, or 4.4 percent, due to increased occupancies and costs and
increases in assessments and millage by local taxing authorities. Property
EBITDA increased by $4.5 million from $50.7 million to $55.2 million, or 8.9
percent.

LIQUIDITY SOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS

         Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $12.4 million
from $40.2 million to $52.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 1997. This increase was due primarily to
a $7.8 million increase in income before depreciation and amortization, minority
interests and other, net and a $6.3 million increase in accounts payable and
other liabilities offset by a $2.1 million increase in other assets.

         Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $2.0 million from
$107.7 million to $105.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 1997. This was due to a $7.9 million
reduction of cash used for notes receivable and investment in and advances to
affiliates offset by a $5.9 million increase in investment in rental properties,
net of proceeds from asset sales.

         Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $.1 million from
$60.5 million to $60.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared
to the year ended December 31, 1997. This increase was due to a $12.8 million
increase in proceeds from net borrowings including payments for deferred
financing costs, offset by an increase of $3.4 million in distributions and a
$9.3 million reduction in proceeds from sales of common stock and OP units.

         The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements
generally through its working capital provided by operating activities. The
Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as
scheduled debt maturities and property acquisitions through the issuance of
equity or debt securities, or interests in the Operating Partnership. The
Company considers these sources to be adequate and anticipates they will
continue to be adequate to meet operating requirements, capital improvements,
investment in development, and payment of distributions by the Company in
accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long term. The Company
can also meet these short-term and long-term requirements by utilizing its $100
million line of credit which bears interest at LIBOR plus .90% and is due
November 1, 1999.

         At December 31, 1998, the Company's debt to total market capitalization
approximated 32.4% (assuming conversion of all Common and Preferred OP Units to
shares of common stock), with a weighted average maturity of approximately 6.1
years and a weighted average interest rate of 7.07%.

         Capital expenditures for 1998 included recurring capital expenditures
of $5.3 million including $.4 million for additional space and related costs at
corporate headquarters and revenue producing capital expenditures of $.9 million
which principally consisted of water metering programs.

RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES

         The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996 was 2.04:1, 2.40:1, and 2.49:1 respectively.

INFLATION

         Most of the leases allow for periodic rent increases which provide the
Company with the opportunity to achieve increases in rental income as each lease
expires. Such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the
Company.

YEAR 2000 UPDATE

         The Year 2000 ("Y2K") issue concerns the inability of computerized
information systems and non-information systems to accurately calculate, store
or use a date after 1999. This could result in computer system failures or
miscalculations causing disruptions of operations.

         In 1997, the Company implemented a corporate-wide Y2K program to
minimize any such disruption caused by the failures of its own internal systems
or those of its business supply chain. In the first phase of the project, the
Company reviewed its inventory of computer hardware and software, and other
devices with embedded microprocessors. The Company also discussed its software
applications and internal operational programs with its current information
systems' vendors. Finally, in this assessment phase, key members of the business
supply chain were contacted and interviewed regarding their awareness of the Y2K
problem and the status of their own Y2K project. The first phase was completed
on schedule during 1998 and all key members of the Company's business supply
chain reported that they were aware of the Y2K problem and were in the process
of readying for the Y2K issue.

         In the second phase of the project, all systems found to be Y2K
non-compliant were upgraded, fixed, replaced and tested. The second phase was
also completed on schedule in December 1998. The Company believes that as a
result of this Implementation/Testing phase, its applications and programs will
properly recognize calendar dates beginning in the year 2000. The Company plans
to continue monitoring Y2K communications from its software vendors and
anticipates that some vendors will recommend further patches/upgrades and
testing.

         In the third and final phase of the Y2K program, the Company is
surveying its material third-party service providers, such as its banks, payroll
processor, stock transfer agent and telecommunications provider. The purpose of
the survey is to follow-up on the status of their Y2K compliance efforts and
assess what effect their possible non-compliance might have on the Company. In
addition, the Company is discussing with its material vendors the possibility of
any interface difficulties and/or electrical or mechanical problems relating to
Y2K which may affect properties owned or operated by the Company. The Company
plans to complete its assessment of Y2K compliance by such parties by April 30,
1999. Until such time, the Company cannot estimate any potential adverse impact
resulting from the failure of vendors or third-party service providers to
address their Y2K issues; however, to date, no significant Y2K related
conditions have been identified.

         Expenditures for assessing the Company's Y2K issues have not been
material because the evaluation has been conducted by its own personnel or by
its vendors in connection with their servicing operations. The Company has
contracted a consultant for $25,000 to assess the methodology of its Y2K
program. The Company plans to remedy any exceptions found during this review
process and deemed as material by the Company by June 30, 1999.

         Based on its current information, the Company believes that the risk
posed by any foreseeable Y2K related problem with its internal systems and the
systems at its properties (including both information and non-information
systems) or with its vendors is minimal. Y2K related problems with the Company's
software applications and internal operational programs or with the electrical
or mechanical systems at its properties are unlikely to cause more than minor
disruptions in the Company's operations. The Company believes that the risk
posed by Y2K related problems for certain third-party service providers is
marginally greater, though, based on its current information, the Company does
not believe any such problems would have a material effect on its operations.
Any Y2K related problems at these third-party service providers could delay the
processing of financial transactions or payroll and could disrupt the Company's
internal and external communications.

         While the Company believes that it will be Y2K capable by December 31,
1999, there can be no assurance that the Company has been or will be successful
in identifying and assessing Y2K issues, or that, to the extent identified, the
Company's efforts to resolve such issues will be effective such that Y2K issues
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial
condition, or results of operation.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

         In June 1998, FASB issued SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). This Statement establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as
derivatives), and for hedging activities. This statement will be adopted
effective January 1, 2000. The Company has not yet determined the impact of SFAS
133 on the earnings and financial position of the Company.

OTHER

         Industry analysts consider funds from operations ("FFO") to be an
appropriate measure of the performance of an equity REIT. It is defined as
income before minority interests plus non-cash items such as depreciation and
amortization. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an
indication of the Company's performance or to cash flows as a measure of
liquidity.

      The following table presents FFO for each of the quarters during 1998,
1997 and 1996:

ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

         The Company's principle market risk exposure is interest rate risk.
The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to refinancing long-term fixed rate obligations, the opportunity cost
of fixed rate obligations in a falling interest rate environment and its
variable rate line of credit. The Company primarily enters into debt obligations
to support general corporate purposes including acquisitions, capital
improvements and working capital needs. The Company has used interest rate hedge
agreements to hedge against rising interest rates in anticipation of refinancing
or new debt issuance. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative
disclosure about market risk as it relates to hedging transactions is described
in Note 4 "Debt" to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and is
incorporated herein by reference.

         The table below presents principal, interest and related weighted
average interest rates by year of maturity (in thousands):

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Sun Communities, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sun
Communities, Inc. (the "Company") at December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 14(a)(1) presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

SUN COMMUNITIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
     POLICIES:

     A.  BUSINESS: Sun Communities, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") is
         a real estate investment trust ("REIT") which owns and operates or
         finances 104 manufactured housing communities located in 15 states
         concentrated principally in the Midwest and Southeast comprising
         approximately 37,500 developed sites and approximately 6,900 sites
         suitable for development. The Company generally will not be subject to
         federal or state income taxes to the extent it distributes its REIT
         taxable income to its stockholders.

         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
         accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
         and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
         liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
         dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
         and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ
         from those estimates.

     B.  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The accompanying financial statements
         include the accounts of the Company and all majority-owned
         subsidiaries. The minority interests include Common Operating
         Partnership Units ("OP Units") which are convertible into an equivalent
         number of shares of the Company's common stock. Such conversion would
         have no effect on earnings per share since the allocation of earnings
         to an OP Unit is equivalent to earnings allocated to a share of common
         stock. Of the 20.1 million OP Units outstanding, the Company owns 17.3
         million or 86.0 percent. The minority interests are adjusted to their
         relative ownership interest whenever OP Units or common stock are
         issued, converted or retired by reclassification to/from paid-in
         capital.

         Also included in minority interest are 1.3 million Preferred OP Units
         ("POP Units") issued at $27 per unit bearing an annual cumulative
         dividend of $1.89 and redeemable at par or convertible in June, 2002.
         The POP Units are convertible one-for-one into OP Units at prices up to
         $31.50 per share. At prices above $31.50 per share, the POP Units are
         convertible into OP Units based on a formula the numerator of which is
         $31.50 plus 25 percent of stock price appreciation above $36 per share.
         The denominator is the then stock price. Had conversion occurred at the
         December 31, 1998 stock price of $34.81, the 1.325 million POP Units
         would have converted into 1.2 million OP Units.

     C.  RENTAL PROPERTY: Rental property is recorded at the lower of cost, less
         accumulated depreciation or fair value. Management evaluates the
         recoverability of its investment in rental property whenever events or
         changes in circumstances such as recent operating results, expected net
         operating cash flow and plans for future operations indicate that full
         asset recoverability is questionable.

         Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated
         useful lives of the assets. Useful lives are 30 years for land
         improvements and buildings and 7 to 15 years for furniture, fixtures
         and equipment. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are
         charged to operations as incurred and significant renovations and
         improvements, which improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset,
         are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.

     D.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:  The Company considers all highly liquid
         investments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash
         and cash equivalents.

DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996


1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
     POLICIES, CONTINUED:

     E.  INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO AFFILIATES: Sun Home Services ("SHS")
         provides home sales and other services to current and prospective
         tenants. The Company owns 100 percent of the outstanding preferred
         stock of SHS, is entitled to 95 percent of the operating cash flow, and
         accounts for its investment utilizing the equity method of accounting.
         The common stock is owned by three officers of the Company who are
         entitled to receive 5 percent of the operating cash flow.

         Bingham Financial Services, Corp. ("BFSC") is a specialty finance
         company whose primary business activities include the financing of
         manufactured homes and all aspects of commercial real estate mortgage
         banking, including originating, underwriting, placing, securitizing and
         servicing commercial real estate loans. The Company owns 25,000 shares
         of common stock in BFSC (less than 2% of the issued and outstanding
         shares of common stock of BFSC) and the Company owns warrants to
         purchase 680,000 shares of BFSC common stock exercisable at prices
         ranging from $10 to $14 per share from 2001 through 2018. The market
         price of BFSC stock at December 31, 1998 was $14.50. Interest earned on
         advances to BFSC is included in income from affiliates.

     F.  REVENUE RECOGNITION: Rental income attributable to leases is recorded
         on a straight-line basis when earned from tenants. Leases entered into
         by tenants range from month-to-month to twelve years and are renewable
         by mutual agreement of the Company and resident or, in some cases, as
         provided by statute.

     G.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The carrying value of financial
         instruments which includes cash and cash investments, mortgages and
         notes receivable and debt approximates fair value.

     H.  TAX STATUS OF DIVIDENDS: Approximately 19.8, 31.2, and 56.6 percent of
         the distributions paid in 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively, represent
         a return of capital. The distributions paid during 1998 included a
         14.6 percent capital gain.

     I.  CASH FLOW HEDGES: The company periodically enters into hedge
         transactions to lock-in the basic interest cost of financing
         acquisitions. The gain or loss on such hedges is amortized as an
         adjustment to interest expense over the term of the related financing.

     J.  RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain 1996 and 1997 amounts have been reclassified
         to conform with the 1998 financial statement presentation. Such
         reclassifications have no effect on results of operations as originally
         presented.

     Land improvements and buildings consist primarily of infrastructure, roads,
     landscaping, clubhouses, maintenance buildings and amenities. Included in
     rental property at December 31, 1998 and 1997 are net carrying amounts
     related to capitalized leases of $29.8 million and 18.4 million,
     respectively.

     During 1998, the Company acquired 10 manufactured housing communities

     as purchases, and the statements of income include the operations of the
     acquired communities from the dates of their respective acquisitions. In
     conjunction with a prior year acquisition, the Company is obligated to
     issue $11.1 million of OP Units over the expected lease-up of the community
     through 2009 based on the per unit price of the OP Units on each annual

</TABLE>


     The Company has a $100 million unsecured line of credit at LIBOR plus .90%
     maturing in November 1999, of which $74 million was available at December
     31, 1998. The average interest rate of outstanding borrowings at December
     31, 1998 was 6.30%.

     The term loan is collateralized by 7 communities comprising approximately
     3,400 sites. Annual payments under capitalized lease obligations range from
     $1.3 million to $1.4 million during their terms. The extraordinary item of
     $6.9 million in 1996 results from the early extinguishment of debt and
     includes prepayment penalties and related deferred financing costs.

     At December 31, 1998, the Company has outstanding rate lock instruments for
     a total notional amount of $52.8 million and an unrealized loss of $1.5
     million for the purpose of hedging against the potential for increased
     interest expense on anticipated future fixed rate financings. At the
     present time, the Company anticipates issuing fixed rate securities in 1999
     with a maturity of five to ten years. Should medium term interest rates
     increase, the value of the rate locks will increase offsetting a portion of
     the additional interest expense incurred. Alternatively, should medium term
     interest rates decrease, the Company will incur costs which would be offset
     by lower interest expense.

     At December 31, 1998, the maturities of debt, excluding the line of credit,
     during the next five years were approximately as follows: 1999 - $1.7
     million; 2000 - $1.8 million; 2001 - $76.2 million; 2002 - $17.1 million;
     and 2003 - $86.0 million.

</TABLE>


     (a) There are 278,900 and 274,066 options outstanding and exercisable,
         respectively, which range from $20.00 - $27.99 with a weighted average
         life of 6.0 years related to the outstanding options. The weighted
         average exercise price for these outstanding and exercisable options is
         $22.82 and $22.74, respectively. There are 776,700 and 327,344 options
         outstanding and exercisable, respectively, which range from $28.00 -
         $35.99 with a weighted average life of 6.3 years related to the
         outstanding options. The weighted average exercise price for these
         outstanding and exercisable options is $30.93 and $29.38, respectively.


     At December 31, 1998, 171,000 shares of common stock were available for the
     granting of options. Options are granted at fair value and generally vest
     over a two-year period and may be exercised for 10 years after date of
     grant. The stock option plans provide for the grant of up to 1,653,000
     options. In addition, the Company established a Long-Term Incentive Plan
     for certain employees granting up to 240,000 options in 1997, which become
     exercisable in equal installments in 2002-2004 based on corporate profit
     performance.

     The Company has opted to measure compensation cost utilizing the intrinsic
     value method. The fair value of each option grant was estimated as of the
     date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
     following assumptions for options granted


<TABLE>

                                                                                     1998          1997          1996

     Estimated fair value per share of options granted during year............      $  2.43       $   2.82      $   1.94

     Assumptions:
     Annualized dividend yield................................................          7.0%           7.1%          6.9%
     Common stock price volatility............................................         15.9%          15.6%         15.1%
           Risk-free rate of return...........................................          5.4%           6.7%          6.2%
     Expected option term (in years)..........................................            4              7             8
</TABLE>


     If compensation cost for stock option grants had been recognized based on
     the fair value at the grant date, this would have resulted in net income of
     $25.8 million, $21.9 million and $11.5 million and basic net income per
     share of $1.53, $1.36 and $.84 in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

6.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:
    In April 1998, the Company declared a dividend of one Preferred Stock
    Purchase Right (Right) for each outstanding share of common stock. The
    Rights are not presently exercisable. Each Right entitles the holder, upon
    the occurrence of certain specified events, including a material change in
    the ownership of the Company, to purchase preferred stock and common stock,
    from the Company and/or from another person into which the Company is merged
    or which acquires control of the Company. The Rights may be generally
    redeemed by the Company at a price of $0.01 per Right. The Rights expire on
    June 8, 2008.

    In June 1998, the Company issued stock awards of 165,000 restricted shares
    to executive officers which are being amortized over their 10 year vesting
    period.

    In December 1998, the Company issued common stock and OP units aggregating
    $25.5 million to directors, employees and consultants. The purchase was
    financed by personal bank loans guaranteed by the Company.

    Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that would occur
    if dilutive securities were exercised or converted into common stock.
    Convertible POP Units are excluded from the computations as their inclusion
    would have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share in 1998, 1997 and
    1996.

           measure of the performance of the operations of the properties before
           the effects of depreciation, amortization and interest expense.
           Operating income is not necessarily an indication of the performance
           of the Company or a measure of liquidity.

    (b)    Other, net consists of gains on asset sales in the first and third
           quarters of 1998, and fourth quarter write-offs relating to a pending
           asset sale and an unsuccessful portfolio acquisition.

                                                                   EXHIBIT 10.30

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

         THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of
December   , 1998, but effective as of January 1, 1999, by and between SUN
COMMUNITIES, INC., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), and JEFFREY P.
JORISSEN (the "Executive").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, the Company desires to continue the employment of the
Executive, and the Executive desires to continue to be employed by the Company,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth below.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained in
this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

         1.   Employment.

              (a)  The Company agrees to employ the Executive and the Executive
accepts the employment, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
below. During the term of employment hereunder, the Executive shall serve as
Senior Vice President, Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the
Company, and shall do and perform diligently all such services, acts and things
as are customarily done and performed by such officers of companies in similar
business and in size to the Company, together with such other duties as may
reasonably be requested from time to time by the Board of Directors of the
Company (the "Board"), which duties shall be consistent with the Executive's
positions as set forth above.

              (b)  For service as an officer and employee of the Company, the
Executive shall be entitled to the full protection of the applicable
indemnification provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Company, as they may be amended from time to time.

         2.   Term of Employment.

              Subject to the provisions for termination provided below, the term
of the Executive's employment under this Agreement shall commence on January 1,
1999 and shall continue thereafter for a period of five (5) years ending on
December 31, 2003; provided, however, that the term of this Agreement shall be
automatically extended for successive terms of one (1) year each thereafter,
unless either party notifies the other party in writing of its desire to
terminate this Agreement at least thirty (30) days before the end of the term
then in effect.

         3.   Devotion to the Company's Business.

              The Executive shall devote his best efforts, knowledge, skill, and
his entire productive time, ability and attention to the business of the Company
during the term of this Agreement.

         4.   Compensation.

              (a)  During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall pay or
provide, as the case may be, to the Executive the compensation and other
benefits and rights set forth in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of this Agreement.

              (b)  Base Compensation. As compensation for the services to be
performed hereunder, the Company shall pay to the Executive, during his
employment hereunder, an annual base salary (the "Base Salary") of Two Hundred
Forty Thousand Dollars ($240,000.00) per year, 



<PAGE>   2

payable in accordance with the Company's usual pay practices (and in any event
no less frequently than monthly).

              (c)  COLA Adjustment. At the beginning of each calendar year of
this Agreement, commencing with January 1, 2000, and on such date each year
thereafter (the "Adjustment Date"), the Base Salary shall be increased in
accordance with the increase, if any, in the cost of living during the preceding
one year as determined by the percentage increase in the Consumers Price
Index-All Urban Consumers (U.S. City Average/all items) published by the Bureau
of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor (the "Index"). The average
Index for calendar years 1998 and 1999 shall be considered the "Base." The Base
Salary for the calendar year following each Adjustment Date shall be the Base
Salary specified in Paragraph 4(b) increased by the percentage increase, if any,
in the Index for the calendar year immediately preceding the Adjustment Date
over the Base. In the event the Index shall cease to be published or the formula
underlying the Index shall change materially from the formula used for the Index
as of the date hereof, then there shall be substituted for the Index such other
index of similar nature as is then generally recognized and accepted. In no
event shall the Base Salary during each adjusted calendar year be less than that
charged during the preceding year of this Agreement.

              (d)  Incentive Compensation. The Company shall pay to the 
Executive incentive compensation ("Incentive Compensation") for each calendar
year that the Executive is employed under this Agreement ("Bonus Year") or
prorated on a per diem basis for partial Bonus Years, which Incentive
Compensation shall be determined and calculated as follows:

         If the Company's Funds from Operations (as defined below) per share of
         the Company's common stock, $.01 par value ("Common Stock"), for the
         Bonus Year increased by more than five percent (5%) over the Company's
         Funds from Operations per share of Common Stock for the previous
         calendar year, then the Executive shall be entitled to Incentive
         Compensation equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Base Salary for
         the Bonus Year in which the increase occurred. If the Company's Funds
         from Operations per share of Common Stock for the Bonus Year increased
         by more than eight and one half percent (8.5%) over the Company's Funds
         from Operations per share of Common Stock for the previous calendar
         year, then the Executive shall be entitled, in lieu of the Incentive
         Compensation described in the immediately preceding sentence, to
         Incentive Compensation equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Base Salary
         for the Bonus Year in which the increase occurred. For purposes hereof,
         "Funds from Operations" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term by
         the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT")
         and Funds from Operations shall be calculated in accordance with
         NAREIT's definition of such term.

         Such Incentive Compensation shall be paid entirely in cash. Unless
otherwise specified by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, one-twelfth of
such Incentive Compensation shall be paid monthly during the year following such
Bonus Year; provided, however, in the event that the Executive voluntarily
terminates his employment under this Agreement pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(i)
hereof or the Executive's employment under this Agreement is terminated with
"cause" pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(ii) hereof or the Executive is in default of
that certain Reimbursement Agreement by and between the Executive and Sun
Communities Operating Limited Partnership (the "Reimbursement Agreement"), the
Executive shall not be entitled to any unpaid Incentive Compensation.

         The determination of the Incentive Compensation shall be made no later
than February 15 of each calendar year of this Agreement by the Company, who
shall provide a copy of its calculations to the Executive. The Executive shall
have the right to dispute any such calculation by delivering written notice of
the dispute to the Company. If the Company and the Executive are 


                                       2
<PAGE>   3

unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after written notice of
the dispute is delivered by the Executive to the Company, the dispute shall be
submitted to the independent public accountants regularly retained by the
Company (the "Accountants") and the determination of the Accountants shall be
final and binding on the parties. Notwithstanding a dispute of the calculation
of the Incentive Compensation, the Company shall pay the Executive the Incentive
Compensation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Executive's
receipt of such Incentive Compensation shall not be deemed a waiver of his right
to dispute the calculation of the Incentive Compensation.

              (e)  Disability. During any period that the Executive fails to
perform his duties hereunder as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental
illness (the "Disability Period"), the Executive shall continue to receive his
full Base Salary, Incentive Compensation and other benefits at the rate in
effect for such period until his employment is terminated by the Company
pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(iii) hereof; provided, however, that payments so made
to the Executive during the Disability Period shall be reduced by the sum of the
amounts, if any, which were paid to the Executive at or prior to the time of any
such payment under disability benefit plans of the Company.

         5.   Benefits.

              (a)  Insurance. The Company shall provide to the Executive life,
medical and hospitalization insurance for himself, his spouse and eligible
family members as may be determined by the Board to be consistent with the
Company's standard policies.

              (b)  Benefit Plans. The Executive, at his election, may
participate, during his employment hereunder, in all retirement plans, 401(K)
plans and other benefit plans of the Company generally available from time to
time to other executive employees of the Company and for which the Executive
qualifies under the terms of the plans (and nothing in this Agreement shall or
shall be deemed to in any way affect the Executive's right and benefits under
any such plan except as expressly provided herein). The Executive shall also be
entitled to participate in any equity, stock option or other employee benefit
plan that is generally available to senior executives of the Company. The
Executive's participation in and benefits under any such plan shall be on the
terms and subject to the conditions specified in the governing document of the
particular plan.

              (c)  Annual Vacation. The Executive shall be entitled to four (4)
weeks vacation time each year, without loss of compensation. The Executive shall
not take more than fourteen (14) consecutive calendar days of vacation without
the prior approval of the Company's Chief Executive Officer. In the event that
the Executive is unable for any reason to take the total amount of vacation time
authorized herein during any year, he may accrue such unused time and add it to
the vacation time for any following year; provided, however, that no more than
ten (10) business days of accrued vacation time may be carried over at any time
(the "Carry-Over Limit"). In the event that the Executive has accrued and unused
vacation time in excess of the Carry-Over Limit (the "Excess Vacation Time"),
the Excess Vacation Time shall be paid to the Executive within ten (10) days of
the end of the year in which the Excess Vacation Time was earned based on the
Base Salary then in effect. Upon any termination of this Agreement for any
reason whatsoever, accrued and unused vacation time (not to exceed thirty (30)
business days) shall be paid to the Executive within ten (10) days of such
termination based on the Base Salary in effect on the date of such termination.
For purposes of this Agreement, one-twelfth (1/12) of the applicable annual
vacation time shall accrue on the last day of each calendar month that the
Executive is employed under this Agreement.

         6.   Reimbursement of Business Expenses.

              The Company shall reimburse the Executive or provide him with an
 



                                       3
<PAGE>   4


expense allowance during the term of this Agreement for travel, entertainment
and other expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred by the Executive in
connection with the Company's business. The Executive shall furnish such
documentation with respect to reimbursement to be paid hereunder as the Company
shall reasonably request.

         7.   Termination of Employment.

              (a)  The Executive's employment under this Agreement may be
         terminated:

                   (i)   by either the Executive or the Company at any time for 
         any reason whatsoever or for no reason upon not less than sixty (60) 
         days written notice;

                   (ii)  by the Company at any time for "cause" as defined 
         below, without prior notice;

                   (iii) by the Company upon the Executive's "permanent
         disability" (as defined below) upon not less than thirty (30) days
         written notice; and

                   (iv)  upon the Executive's death.

              (b)  For purposes hereof, for "cause" shall mean the material
breach of any provision of this Agreement by the Executive which breach, if
curable, continues uncured for a period of twenty (20) days after the
Executive's receipt of written notice of such breach from the Company, or any
action of the Executive (or the Executive's failure to act), which, in the
reasonable determination of the Board, involves malfeasance, fraud, or moral
turpitude, or which, if generally known, would or might have a material adverse
effect on the Company and/or its reputation.

              (c)  For purposes hereof, the Executive's "permanent disability"
shall be deemed to have occurred after one hundred twenty (120) consecutive days
during which the Executive, by reason of his physical or mental disability or
illness, shall have been unable to discharge his duties under this Agreement.
The date of permanent disability shall be such one hundred twenty-first (121st)
day. In the event either the Company or the Executive, after receipt of notice
of the Executive's permanent disability from the other, disputes that the
Executive's permanent disability shall have occurred, the Executive shall
promptly submit to a physical examination by the chief of medicine of any major
accredited hospital in Michigan and, unless such physician shall issue his
written statement to the effect that in his opinion, based on his diagnosis, the
Executive is capable of resuming his employment and devoting his full time and
energy to discharging his duties within thirty (30) days after the date of such
statement, such permanent disability shall be deemed to have occurred.

         8.   Compensation Upon Termination or Disability.

              (a)  In the event that the Company terminates the Executive's
employment under this Agreement without "cause" pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(i)
hereof, the Executive shall be entitled to any unpaid Base Salary, Incentive
Compensation and benefits accrued and earned by him hereunder up to and
including the effective date of such termination, which shall be paid by the
Company to the Executive within thirty (30) days of the effective date of such
termination, and the Company shall pay the Executive monthly an amount equal to
one-twelfth (1/12) of the Base Salary (at the rate that would otherwise have
been payable under this Agreement) for a period of up to eighteen (18) months if
the Executive fully complies with paragraph 12 of this Agreement (the "Severance
Payment"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, in its sole discretion,
may elect to make the Severance Payment to the Executive in one lump sum due



                                       4
<PAGE>   5

within thirty (30) days of the Executive's termination of employment.

              (b)  In the event of termination of the Executive's employment
under this Agreement for "cause" or if the Executive voluntarily terminates his
employment hereunder, the Executive shall be entitled to no further compensation
or other benefits under this Agreement, except only as to any unpaid Base Salary
and benefits accrued and earned by him hereunder up to and including the
effective date of such termination.

              (c)  In the event of termination of the Executive's employment
under this Agreement due to the Executive's permanent disability or death, the
Executive (or his successors and assigns in the event of his death) shall be
entitled to any unpaid Base Salary, Incentive Compensation and benefits accrued
and earned by him hereunder up to and including the effective date of such
termination, which shall be paid by the Company to the Executive or his
successors and assigns, as appropriate, within thirty (30) days of the effective
date of such termination, and the Company shall pay the Executive monthly an
amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the Base Salary (at the rate that would
otherwise have been payable under this Agreement) for a period of up to twenty
four (24) months if the Executive fully complies with paragraph 12 of this
Agreement (the "Disability Payment"); provided, however, that payments so made
to the Executive shall be reduced by the sum of the amounts, if any, which: (i)
were paid to the Executive at or prior to the time of any such payment under
disability benefit plans of the Company, and (ii) did not previously reduce the
Base Salary, Incentive Compensation and other benefits due the Executive under
paragraph 4(e) of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, in
its sole discretion, may elect to make the Disability Payment to the Executive
in one lump sum due within thirty (30) days of the Executive's termination of
employment.

              (d)  Regardless of the reason for termination of the Executive's
employment hereunder, Incentive Compensation and benefits shall be prorated for
any period of employment not covering an entire year of employment.

              (e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph 8,
the Company's obligation to pay, and the Executive's right to receive, any
compensation under this paragraph 8, including, without limitation, the
Severance Payment and the Disability Payment, shall terminate upon the
Executive's breach of any provision of paragraph 12 hereof or the Executive's
breach of any provision of the Reimbursement Agreement. In addition, the
Executive shall promptly forfeit any compensation received from the Company
under this paragraph 8, including, without limitation, the Severance Payment and
the Disability Payment, upon the Executive's breach of any provision of
paragraph 12 hereof.

         9.   Resignation of Executive. Upon any termination of the Executive's
employment under this Agreement, the Executive shall be deemed to have resigned
from any and all offices held by the Executive in the Company and/or any of the
Affiliates (as defined below). In addition, upon any termination of the
Executive's employment under this Agreement, the Executive shall promptly
transfer one-half (1/2) of his stock in Sun Home Services, Inc., a Michigan
corporation, to each of Milton M. Shiffman and Gary A. Shiffman for and in
consideration of $1.00.

         10.  Effect of Change in Control.

              (a)  The Company or its successor shall pay the Executive the
Change in Control Benefits (as defined below) if there has been a Change in
Control (as defined below) and any of the following events has occurred: (i) the
Executive's employment under this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
paragraph 7(a)(i), (ii) upon a Change in Control under paragraph 10(f)(ii), the
Company or its successor does not expressly assume all of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, or (iii) there are less than thirty (30) months
remaining under the term of this


                                       5
<PAGE>   6

Agreement (without regard to the last clause of paragraph 2 hereof).

              (b)  For purposes of this Agreement, the "Change in Control
Benefits" shall mean the following benefits:

                   (i)   A cash payment equal to two and 99/100 (2.99) times the
         Base Salary in effect on the date of such Change in Control, payable
         within sixty (60) days of the Change in Control; and

                   (ii)  Continued receipt of all compensation and benefits set
         forth in paragraphs 5(a) and 5(b) of this Agreement, until the earlier
         of (i) one year following the Change in Control (subject to the
         Executive's COBRA rights) or (ii) the commencement of comparable
         coverage from another employer. The provision of any one benefit by
         another employer shall not preclude the Executive from continuing
         participation in Company benefit programs provided under this paragraph
         10(b)(ii) that are not provided by the subsequent employer. The
         Executive shall promptly notify the Company upon receipt of benefits
         from a new employer comparable to any benefit provided under this
         paragraph 10(b)(ii).

              (c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) in the
event that the Executive's employment under this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with paragraph 7(a)(i) within sixty (60) days prior to a Change in
Control, such termination shall be deemed to have been made in connection with
the Change in Control and the Executive shall be entitled to the Change in
Control Benefits; and (ii) in the event that the Executive's employment under
this Agreement is terminated by the Company or its successor in accordance with
paragraph 7(a)(i) after a Change in Control and the Executive was not already
entitled to the Change in Control Benefits under paragraph 10(a)(iii), the
Company or its successor shall pay the Executive an amount equal to the
difference between the Change in Control Benefits and the amounts actually paid
to the Executive under this Agreement after the Change in Control but prior to
his termination.

              (d)  The Change in Control Benefits are in addition to any and all
other Company benefits to which the Executive may be entitled, including,
without limitation, Base Salary, Incentive Compensation, Severance Payment,
Disability Payment and the exercise or surrender of stock options as a result of
the Change in Control.

              (e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, 
the Change in Control Benefits shall be reduced by all other payments to the
Executive which constitute "excess parachute payments" under Section 280(G) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

              (f)  For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall 
be deemed to have occurred:

                   (i)   if any person or group of persons acting together 
         (other than (a) the Company or any person (I) who on December 1, 1998
         was a director or officer of the Company, or (II) whose shares of
         Common Stock of the Company are treated as "beneficially owned" by any
         such director or officer, or (b) any institutional investor (filing
         reports under Section 13(g) rather than 13(d) of the Securities
         Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including any employee benefit plan
         or employee benefit trust sponsored by the Company)), becomes a
         beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company
         representing ten percent (10%) or more of either the then-outstanding
         Common Stock of the Company or the combined voting power of the
         Company's then-outstanding voting securities;



                                       6
<PAGE>   7

                   (ii)  if the directors or stockholders of the Company approve
         an agreement to merge into or consolidate with, or to sell all or
         substantially all of the Company's assets to, any person (other than a
         wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company formed for the purpose of
         changing the Company's corporate domicile); or

                   (iii) if the new directors appointed to the Board during any
         twelve-month period constitute a majority of the members of the Board,
         unless (I) the directors who were in office for at least twelve (12)
         months prior to such twelve-month period (the "Incumbent Directors")
         plus (II) the new directors who were recommended or appointed by a
         majority of the Incumbent Directors constitutes a majority of the
         members of the Board.

         For purposes of this paragraph 10(f), a "person" includes an
individual, a partnership, a corporation, an association, an unincorporated
organization, a trust or any other entity.

         11.  Stock Options. In the event of termination of the Executive's
employment under this Agreement for "cause", all stock options or other stock
based compensation awarded to the Executive shall lapse and be of no further
force or effect whatsoever in accordance with the Company's Amended and Restated
1993 Stock Option Plan. In the event that the Company terminates the Executive's
employment under this Agreement without "cause" or upon the death or permanent
disability of the Executive, all stock options and other stock based
compensation awarded to the Executive shall become fully vested and immediately
exercisable; provided, however, such options and other stock based compensation
cannot be exercised until the expiration of the eighteen month periods
referenced in paragraph 12 hereof and such stock options or other stock based
compensation shall be automatically forfeited upon the Executive's breach of any
of the provisions of paragraph 12 hereof. Any Stock Option Agreements between
the Company and the Executive shall be amended to conform to the provisions of
this paragraph 11.

         12.  Covenant Not To Compete and Confidentiality.

              (a)  The Executive acknowledges the Company's reliance and
expectation of the Executive's continued commitment to performance of his duties
and responsibilities during the term of this Agreement. In light of such
reliance and expectation on the part of the Company, the Executive agrees that:

                   (i)   for a period  commencing on the date of this Agreement 
and ending upon the expiration of eighteen (18) months following the termination
of the Executive's employment under this Agreement for any reason, the Executive
shall not, either directly or indirectly, engage in, or have an interest in or
be associated with (whether as an officer, director, stockholder, partner,
associate, employee, consultant, owner or otherwise) any corporation, firm or
enterprise which is engaged in (A) the real estate business (the "Real Estate
Business"), including, without limitation, the development, ownership, leasing,
sales, management or financing of single family or multi-family housing,
condominiums, townhome communities or other form of housing, or (B) any business
which is competitive with the business then or at any time during the term of
this Agreement conducted or proposed to be conducted by the Company, or any
corporation owned or controlled by the Company or under common control with the
Company (an "Affiliate"), anywhere within the continental United States or
Canada; provided, however, that the Executive may invest in any publicly held
entity engaged in the Real Estate Business, if his investment in such entity
does not exceed one percent (1%) in value of the issued and outstanding equity
securities of such entity;

                   (ii)  the Executive  will not at any time,  for so long as
any Confidential Information (as defined below) shall remain confidential or
otherwise remain wholly or partially 




                                       7
<PAGE>   8

protectable, either during the term of this Agreement or thereafter, use or
disclose, directly or indirectly, to any person outside of the Company or any
Affiliate any Confidential Information;

                   (iii) promptly upon the termination of this Agreement for any
reason, the Executive (or in the event of the Executive's death, his personal
representative) shall return to the Company any and all copies (whether prepared
by or at the direction of the Company or Executive) of all records, drawings,
materials, memoranda and other data constituting or pertaining to Confidential
Information;

                   (iv)  for a period commencing on the date of this Agreement 
and ending upon the expiration of eighteen (18) months from the termination of
this Agreement for any reason, the Executive shall not, either directly or
indirectly, divert, or by aid to others, do anything which would tend to divert,
from the Company or any Affiliate any trade or business with any customer or
supplier with whom the Executive had any contact or association during the term
of the Executive's employment with the Company or with any party whose identity
or potential as a customer or supplier was confidential or learned by the
Executive during his employment by the Company; and

                   (v)   for a period commencing on the date of this Agreement
and ending upon the expiration of eighteen (18) months from the termination of
this Agreement for any reason, the Executive shall not, either directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment any person with whom the Executive was
acquainted while in the Company's employ.

         As used in this Agreement, the term "Confidential Information" shall
mean all business information of any nature and in any form which at the time or
times concerned is not generally known to those persons engaged in business
similar to that conducted or contemplated by the Company or any Affiliate (other
than by the act or acts of an employee not authorized by the Company to disclose
such information) and which relates to any one or more of the aspects of the
present or past business of the Company or any of the Affiliates or any of their
respective predecessors, including, without limitation, patents and patent
applications, inventions and improvements (whether or not patentable),
development projects, policies, processes, formulas, techniques, know-how, and
other facts relating to sales, advertising, promotions, financial matters,
customers, customer lists, customer purchases or requirements, and other trade
secrets.

              (b)  The Executive agrees and understands that the remedy at law
for any breach by him of this paragraph 12 will be inadequate and that the
damages flowing from such breach are not readily susceptible to being measured
in monetary terms. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that, upon adequate proof of
the Executive's violation of any legally enforceable provision of this paragraph
12, the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain
a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach. Nothing in this
paragraph 12 shall be deemed to limit the Company's remedies at law or in equity
for any breach by the Executive of any of the provisions of this paragraph 12
which may be pursued or availed of by the Company.

         13.  Arbitration. Any dispute or controversy arising out of or relating
to this Agreement shall be settled finally and exclusively by arbitration in the
State of Michigan in accordance with the expedited procedures of the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Such
arbitration shall be conducted by an arbitrator(s) appointed by the American
Arbitration Association in accordance with its rules and any finding by such
arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon the parties. Judgment upon any
award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof, and the parties consent to the jurisdiction of the courts
of the State of Michigan for this purpose. Nothing contained in this paragraph
13 shall be construed to preclude the Company from obtaining injunctive or other
equitable relief to secure specific performance or to otherwise prevent a breach
or contemplated 


                                       8
<PAGE>   9

breach of this Agreement by the Executive as provided in paragraph 12 hereof.

         14.  Notice. Any notice, request, consent or other communication given
or made hereunder shall be given or made only in writing and (a) delivered
personally to the party to whom it is directed; (b) sent by first class mail or
overnight express mail, postage and charges prepaid, addressed to the party to

<PAGE>   10

assign his obligations under this Agreement in any manner whatsoever.

              (c)  The failure of either party to enforce any provision or

any such provision or provisions as to any future violations thereof, nor
prevent that party thereafter from enforcing each and every other provision of
this Agreement. The rights granted the parties herein are cumulative and the
waiver of any single remedy shall not constitute a waiver of such party's right
to assert all other legal remedies available to it under the circumstances.

              (d)  This Agreement supersedes all agreements and understandings
between the parties and may not be modified or terminated orally. No
modification, termination or waiver shall be valid unless in writing and signed

construing it.

              (g)  This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

              (h)  Each party shall pay his or its own fees and expenses,
including, without limitation, legal fees, incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, any
fees incurred in connection with any arbitration arising out of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

                              SUN COMMUNITIES, INC.
                   AMENDED AND RESTATED 1993 STOCK OPTION PLAN
                        RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT


         Sun Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), upon the
recommendation of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") and pursuant to
that certain Amended and Restated 1993 Stock Option Plan adopted by the
Company's Board of Directors (the "Plan") and approved by its shareholders, and
in consideration of the services to be rendered to the Company or its
subsidiaries by GARY A. SHIFFMAN ("Employee"), hereby grants, as of June 5, 1998
(the "Date of Grant"), to Employee seventy-five thousand (75,000) shares of the
Company's Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), subject to the
terms and conditions contained in this Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the
"Agreement") and subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan, which are
incorporated by reference herein. All capitalized terms used but not otherwise
defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the
Plan.

                        I. RECEIPT AND DELIVERY OF SHARES

         Until such time as the Shares vest in accordance with Section II below,
the stock certificate or certificates evidencing the Shares shall be registered
in the name of Employee but held in escrow by the Company. As soon as
practicable after the date upon which any Shares vest, the Company shall deliver
to Employee a certificate or certificates representing such vested Shares,
registered in the name of Employee.

                              II. VESTING SCHEDULE

         (a) Subject to the restrictions and conditions set forth in the Plan,
the Shares shall vest as follows:

             (i)   7,500 Shares vest on January 31, 2002;  
             (ii)  7,500 Shares vest on January 31, 2003; 
             (iii) 7,500 Shares vest on January 31, 2004;
             (iv)  7,500 Shares vest on January 31, 2005; 
             (v)   7,500 Shares vest on January 31, 2006; 
             (vi)  7,500 Shares vest on January 31, 2007; and 
             (vii) 30,000 Shares vest on January  31, 2008.

         (b) In the event of Employee's Termination of Employment at any time
for any reason other than the death or Disability (as defined below) of
Employee, all unvested Shares shall be automatically forfeited to the Company
and, accordingly, Employee shall forfeit all right, title and interest in and to
such forfeited Shares. For purposes hereof, "Disability" shall mean physical or
mental incapacity for an aggregate period of at least 90 days within any period
of 365 consecutive days.

         (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon the death or
Disability of Employee or the occurrence of a Change of Control Event, all
unvested Shares shall immediately become fully vested.

                           III. RESTRICTIONS ON SHARES

         Until a Share vests pursuant to Section II above, it shall not be
liable for the debts, contracts or obligations of Employee nor be subject to
disposition by assignment, transfer, sale, alienation, pledge, encumbrance or
any other means, whether such disposition is voluntary or involuntary or by
operation of 

<PAGE>   2

law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment or other legal or equitable
proceeding (including bankruptcy), and any attempted disposition thereof shall
be null and void and of no force or effect; provided, however, that this Section
III does not prevent transfers by will or by the applicable laws of descent and
distribution, or pursuant to the terms of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.

                           IV. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER

         Notwithstanding Section 9.06 of the Plan to the contrary, Employee
shall be entitled to all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the
Shares, including the right to vote such Shares and to receive dividends and
other distributions payable with respect to such Shares from and after the Date
of Grant; provided that any securities or other property (but not cash) received
in any such distribution with respect to any Shares that are still subject to
the restrictions of Section II and III of this Agreement shall be subject to all
of the restrictions in this Agreement with respect to such Shares.

                                 V. REGISTRATION

         Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Shares
may be offered and sold by Employee only if such stock is registered for resale
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or if an
exemption from registration under the Securities Act is available. Employee
acknowledges and agrees: (a) that the Company has no obligation to effect such
registration; (b) not to offer or sell the Shares unless and until such stock is
registered for resale under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration
is available; and (c) that the Shares were acquired for his own account for
investment and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, the
distribution of any part thereof.

                      VI. NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT CONFERRED

         Nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall confer upon Employee any
right to continue in employment with the Company or a subsidiary or interfere in
any way with the right of the Company or any subsidiary to terminate such
person's employment at any time.

                               VII. MISCELLANEOUS

         (a) In accordance with the terms of the Plan, the Company is entitled
to withhold (or secure payment from Employee in lieu of withholding) the amount
of any withholding or other tax required by law to be withheld or paid by the
Company with respect to the award or issuance of the Shares. Employee
understands that the taxable income recognized by Employee as a result of the
award of the Shares would be affected by a decision by Employee to make an
election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "83(b) Election"), with respect to the Shares within thirty (30) days after
the Date of Grant. Employee acknowledges and agrees that he will have the sole
responsibility for determining whether to make an 83(b) Election with respect to
the Shares and for properly making such election and filing such election with
the relevant taxing authorities on a timely basis.

         (b) If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue to be in full force and
effect to the maximum extent permitted by law. If the implementation or presence
of any provision of this Agreement would or will cause the Plan and thereby the
Shares purchased thereunder to not be in compliance with Rule 16b-3 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other statutory provision,
such Agreement provision shall not be implemented or, at the Company's option
following notice, such provision shall be severed from the Agreement as is
appropriate or necessary to achieve statutory compliance; provided, however,
that the parties hereby agree to negotiate in good faith as may be necessary to
modify this Agreement to achieve statutory compliance or otherwise effectuate
the intent of the parties following a severance permitted by this Section
VII(b).


                                      -2-
<PAGE>   3

         (c) Any notice required to be given hereunder to the Company shall be
addressed to the Chief Financial Officer, Sun Communities, Inc., 31700
Middlebelt Road, Suite 145, Farmington Hills, Michigan 48334, and any notice
required to be given to Employee shall be sent to Employee's address as shown on
the records of the Company.

         (d) This instrument contains the entire Agreement of the parties and
may only be amended by written agreement executed by the parties hereto.

         (e) This Agreement is made and entered into in, and shall be construed
and enforced in accordance with the laws of, the State of Michigan.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Restricted Stock Award Agreement is hereby
executed as of June 5, 1998.

Shares, including the right to vote such Shares and to receive dividends and
other distributions payable with respect to such Shares from and after the Date

to withhold (or secure payment from Employee in lieu of withholding) the amount
of any withholding or other tax required by law to be withheld or paid by the
Company with respect to the award or issuance of the Shares. Employee

election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "83(b) Election"), with respect to the Shares within thirty (30) days after
the Date of Grant. Employee acknowledges and agrees that he will have the sole

such Agreement provision shall not be implemented or, at the Company's option
following notice, such provision shall be severed from the Agreement as is
appropriate or necessary to achieve statutory compliance; provided, however,
that the parties hereby agree to negotiate in good faith as may be necessary to
modify this Agreement to achieve statutory compliance or otherwise effectuate
the intent of the parties following a severance permitted by this Section
VII(b).

                              SUN COMMUNITIES, INC.
                            1998 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN


         1. PURPOSE. The 1998 Stock Purchase Plan (the "Plan") of Sun
Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), is adopted to
facilitate the immediate purchase of shares of the Company's Common Stock, $.01
par value per share ("Common Stock"), and limited partnership interests (the
"Common OP Units") in Sun Communities Operating Limited Partnership, a Michigan
limited partnership, by certain employees, consultants, officers and directors
of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates. The purpose of the Plan is to
increase the ownership of Common Stock and Common OP Units among key employees,
consultants, officers and directors of the Company, its subsidiaries and
affiliates in order to more closely align their financial rewards with the
financial rewards realized by all other holders of Common Stock.

         2. ELIGIBILITY. Only Eligible Participants (as defined below) are
eligible to purchase shares of Common Stock under this Plan and only Eligible
Participants who are also "Accredited Investors" (as that term is defined in
Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) are
eligible to purchase Common OP Units under this Plan. For purposes of this Plan,
"Eligible Participants" means all employees, consultants, officers and directors
of the Company, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates whose annual gross income is
at least $50,000.00 and such other employees and consultants of the Company, its
subsidiaries and affiliates selected by the Company in its sole and absolute
discretion.

         3. PARTICIPATION. No Eligible Participant is required to participate in
the Plan and, subject to the eligibility requirements of Section 2 above and the
limitations of Section 4 below, an Eligible Participant may purchase any number
of shares of Common Stock and/or Common OP Units under this Plan. To become a
Plan participant ("Active Participant"), an Eligible Participant must satisfy
the following requirements on or before the Issuance Date (as defined below):

         (a)      submit a completed, signed and irrevocable subscription
                  agreement to purchase, on or before November 30, 1998 or such
                  other date designated by the Board of Directors of the Company
                  (the "Issuance Date"), a specified number of shares of Common
                  Stock and/or Common OP Units (the "Purchased Shares") at
                  $31.75 per Purchased Share;

         (b)      submit payment to the Company of $0.25 per Purchased Share to
                  cover a portion of the fees and expenses incurred by the
                  Company in connection with implementing and administering this
                  Plan (the "Fees") (see Section 8 regarding payment of the
                  remaining portion of the Fees);

         (c)      complete and sign all necessary agreements and other documents
                  relating to the loan described in Section 6 below if the
                  Active Participant elects to participate in the loan program;
                  and

         (d)      pay for the Purchased Shares (with the Active Participant's
                  own funds or those funds received pursuant to the loan
                  program) pursuant to Section 5 below.

         4. LIMITATIONS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, (a) no Active Participant may purchase (i) less than 2,500 shares of
Common Stock and/or Common OP Units, or (ii) shares of Common Stock and/or
Common OP Units having a value of more than three (3) times such Active
Participant's annual gross income, unless the Company, in its sole and absolute
discretion, is satisfied with the financial condition of such Active
Participant; (b) no Active Participant may purchase more than 170,000 shares of
Common Stock and/or Common OP Units under this Plan; and (c) the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock and Common OP Units issuable under this Plan
shall not exceed 850,000. If the Company receives subscription agreements for
more than 850,000 shares of Common Stock and Common OP Units in the
<PAGE>   2

aggregate from Eligible Participants, the Company will issue Common Stock and
Common OP Units on a pro rata basis among the Eligible Participants satisfying
the requirements set forth in Section 3 based on the number of shares of Common
Stock and/or Common OP Units desired to be acquired by each Eligible Participant
in accordance with Section 3.

         5. PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE. On or before the Issuance Date, each
Active Participant must deliver to the Company (at such place and in such manner
as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company) an amount equal
to the product of such Active Participant's Purchased Shares and $31.75 (the
"Purchase Price") ; provided, however that if the Company reasonably determines
that the Purchase Price when compared to the fair market value of the Common
Stock on the Issuance Date produces (taking into account Section 9 of this Plan)
a price discount to the Active Participants greater than five (5%) percent, the
Company may increase the Purchase Price or modify the Sharing Ratio (as defined
in Section 9) to reduce such discount to no more than five (5%) percent.

         6. LOAN. The Company has arranged for each Active Participant to have
the opportunity to obtain a loan (a "Loan") to fund the purchase of the
Purchased Shares through a syndicate of banks (the "Banks") for which The First
National Bank of Chicago is serving as agent. Each Active Participant must sign
a letter of direction which directs all loan proceeds to be paid directly to the
Company in payment for the Purchased Shares and each Active Participant is
responsible for satisfying all of the lending requirements specified by the
Banks to qualify for the Loan. Each Active Participant is fully obligated to
repay to the Banks all principal, interest and fees on the Loan when due and
payable. The Company has arranged for each Active Participant to have an
opportunity to obtain a Loan, but the Company is not advising any Active
Participant as to whether or not it is in the best interest of such Active
Participant to obtain a Loan, as such Active Participant must make such decision
on his or her own behalf with the advice of any representatives or advisors such
Active Participant may elect to consult. This Section 6 is only a brief summary
of the Loan program, and is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
each document prepared by the Banks that an Active Participant may sign in
connection with a Loan.

         7. REGISTRATION OF SHARES. On the Issuance Date, the Purchased Shares
shall be registered in the name of the Active Participant and certificated. Each
certificate shall bear a legend referring to this Plan and the agreements
between the Active Participant and the Company relating to the Purchased Shares.
No certificate will be issued to evidence Common OP Units as each Active
Participant purchasing Common OP Units will receive an amendment to the
partnership agreement of Sun Communities Operating Limited Partnership
indicating the number of Common OP Units held by such Active Participant.

         8. DIVIDENDS; SALE OF PURCHASED SHARES. To the extent required by the
loan agreements and documents identified in Section 3(c) above, the Company
shall be irrevocably directed to deliver all dividends and distributions earned
on each Active Participant's Purchased Shares directly to The First National
Bank of Chicago for payment of interest accrued on such Active Participant's
Loan. Any dividends or distributions in excess of required interest payments
will be deposited to such Active Participant's account at The First National
Bank of Chicago. Upon the sale of the Purchased Shares, the Active Participant
shall pay to the Company (or, if appropriate, the Company shall withhold from
the Active Participant) any remaining Fees associated with such Purchased
Shares, which remaining Fees shall be calculated by the Company, but are
presently estimated at $0.60 per Purchased Share.

         9. GAIN ON SALES. Subject to Section 5 above, an Active Participant who
sells Purchased Shares prior to November 30, 2001 shall, after payment of
broker's fees, contemporaneously remit to the Company fifty percent (50%) of any
profit recognized upon such sale (the "Sharing Ratio"); provided, however, that
no profit shall be remitted to the Company pursuant to this Section 9 in the
event of the death or permanent disability of the Active Participant.

                                      -2-
<PAGE>   3


         10. LOAN GUARANTY. As a condition to the loan arrangement that the
Company has made with The First National Bank of Chicago, the Company will
guarantee repayment to The First National Bank of Chicago of all principal,
interest, early payment fees and other obligations of each Active Participant
under such Active Participant's Loan (the "Guaranty"). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, each Active Participant is fully obligated to
repay to The First National Bank of Chicago, in a timely manner, all principal,
interest, and other amounts due on such Active Participant's Loan. By
participating in the Plan, each Active Participant acknowledges and agrees that
the Company may take any and all lawful actions relating to an Active
Participant and his or her assets, which the Board of Directors of the Company
deems reasonable and necessary, to obtain full reimbursement for amounts the
Company pays to The First National Bank of Chicago under the Guaranty as a
result of such Active Participant's Loan.

         11. SECURITY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, neither the Loan nor the Guaranty shall be secured or "indirectly
secured" (as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System) by shares of Common Stock issued under the Plan. Each Active
Participant purchasing Common OP Units under this Plan must enter into a
security agreement (in form and substance satisfactory to the Company) with the
Company whereby: (a) all Common OP Units purchased by such Active Participant
under this Plan are pledged to the Company as security for the Company's
obligations under the Guaranty with respect to such Active Participant's Loan;
and (b) such Active Participant agrees that the Common OP Units issued under
this Plan are not convertible into shares of Common Stock unless and until such
Active Participant's Loan is repaid in full.

         12. REGISTRATION RIGHTS. The limited partnership agreement of Sun
Communities Operating Limited Partnership presently provides that each Common OP
Unit may be converted into one share of Common Stock (such conversion ratio is
subject to change as set forth in the partnership agreement). Each share of
Common Stock issued under the Plan and each share of Common Stock that may be
received upon conversion of a Common OP Unit has not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 or any state securities law, and will be characterized as
"restricted stock". By virtue of being classified as restricted stock, the
Common Stock (whether originally issued or received upon conversion of a Common
OP Unit) cannot be sold unless such stock is registered under the Securities Act
of 1933 or an exemption is available. The Company will offer, on or before
November 30, 2001, to each Active Participant the right to register for sale all
Purchased Shares pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. The Company will use
reasonable efforts to register the Purchased Shares for sale by filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement covering the sale of
the Purchased Shares held by those Active Participants that wish to participate
in the registration. As a condition to such registration, each Active
Participant electing to register his or her Purchased Shares will be required to
enter into a registration rights agreement with the Company.

         13. NOTICES. Any notice to the Company from an Active Participant shall
be addressed as follows:

                       Sun Communities, Inc.
                       31700 Middlebelt Road, Suite 145
                       Farmington Hills, Michigan  48334
                       Attn:  Chief Financial Officer

All notices to the Company will be deemed effective upon receipt.

         14. COMPLIANCE WITH REIT RULES. In order to comply with certain tax
rules applicable to the Company by virtue of its status as a real estate
investment trust, the Company reserves the right to modify the Purchase Price
and/or Sharing Ratio, to ensure compliance with such rules.

         15.      MISCELLANEOUS.

                  (a) Neither this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be
         construed as giving any Eligible Participant any right to be retained
         in the employ of the Company, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates.

                  (b) This Plan shall be governed by, and construed in
         accordance with, the laws of the State of Michigan.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

         THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
on this 31st day of December, 1998, but shall be effective as of January 1,
1999, by and between SUN HOME SERVICES, INC., a Michigan corporation (the
"Company"), and BRIAN W. FANNON (the "Executive").

                                PRELIMINARY NOTE:

         This Agreement is entered into contemporaneously with that certain
Employment Agreement (the "Sun Agreement") by and between the Executive and Sun
Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Sun Communities"), and, in the event
of any contradiction between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the
Sun Agreement, the Sun Agreement shall control.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained in
this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

         1.   Employment.

              The Company agrees to employ the Executive and the Executive
accepts the employment, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
below. During the term of employment hereunder, the Executive shall serve as the
Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and shall do and perform diligently all
such services, acts and things as are customarily done and performed by such
officers of companies in similar business and in size to the Company, together
with such other duties as may reasonably be requested from time to time by the
Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), which duties shall be
consistent with the Executive's position as set forth above.

         2.   Term of Employment.

              Subject to the provisions for termination provided below, the term
of the Executive's employment under this Agreement shall commence on January 1,
1999 and shall continue thereafter for a period of three (3) years ending on
December 31, 2001.

         3.   Devotion to the Company's Business.

              The Executive shall devote his best efforts, knowledge, skill, and
his entire productive time, ability and attention to the business of the Company
and its Affiliates (as defined in paragraph 12 of the Sun Agreement) during the
term of this Agreement.

         4.   Compensation.

              (a)  During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall pay or
provide, as the case may be, to the Executive the compensation and other
benefits and rights set forth in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of this Agreement.

              (b)  Base Compensation. As compensation for the services to be
performed hereunder, the Company shall pay to the Executive, during his
employment hereunder, an annual base salary (the "Base Salary") of Two Hundred
Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($225,000.00) per year, payable in accordance with
the Company's usual pay practices (and in any event no less frequently than
monthly).

              (c)  Annual Salary Increase. On January 1 of each year, commencing
January 1, 2000, the Base Salary shall be increased by five percent (5%) of the
Base Salary for the immediately prior year or such greater increase as may be
deemed appropriate by the Board, in



<PAGE>   2

its sole and absolute discretion.

              (d)  Bonus. The Board shall prepare and adopt an executive bonus
plan (the "Bonus Plan") which shall be established for the payment of an
incentive bonus to the Executive based on the Company achieving certain
performance criteria to be established by the Company and the Executive. Upon
adoption, a copy of the Bonus Plan shall be attached to this Agreement and
incorporated herein, and the Executive shall be eligible to receive an award
under the Bonus Plan on the terms and conditions set forth in that document;
provided, however, that such bonus shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
Executive's then current Base Salary.

         5.   Benefits.

              (a)  Insurance. The Company shall provide to the Executive life,
medical and hospitalization insurance for himself, his spouse and eligible
family members as may be determined by the Board to be consistent with the
Company's standard policies.

              (b)  Benefit Plans. The Executive, at his election, may
participate, during his employment hereunder, in all retirement plans, 401(K)
plans and other benefit plans of the Company generally available from time to
time to other executive employees of the Company and for which the Executive
qualifies under the terms of the plans (and nothing in this Agreement shall or
shall be deemed to in any way affect the Executive's right and benefits under
any such plan except as expressly provided herein). The Executive shall also be
entitled to participate in any equity, stock option or other employee benefit
plan that is generally available to senior executives, as distinguished from
general management, of the Company. The Executive's participation in and
benefits under any such plan shall be on the terms and subject to the conditions
specified in the governing document of the particular plan.

              (c)  Annual Vacation. The Executive shall be entitled to the
vacation time specified in the Sun Agreement.

         6.   Reimbursement of Business Expenses.

              The Company shall reimburse the Executive or provide him with an
expense allowance during the term of this Agreement for travel, car telephone,
and other expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred by the Executive in
connection with the Company's business. The Executive shall furnish such
documentation with respect to reimbursement to be paid hereunder as the Company
shall reasonably request.

         7.   Termination of Employment.

              This Agreement, and the Executive's employment hereunder, shall
automatically be terminated upon termination of the Sun Agreement.

         8.   Severance Compensation.

              (a)  In the event that Sun Communities terminates the Executive's
employment under the Sun Agreement without "cause" pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(i)
thereof, the Executive shall be entitled to any unpaid salary, bonus and
benefits accrued and earned by him hereunder up to and including the effective
date of such termination and the Company shall pay the Executive monthly an
amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the Base Salary in effect on the date of
such termination for a period of up to twelve (12) months if the Executive fully
complies with paragraph 12 of the Sun Agreement (the "Severance Payment").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect to
make the Severance Payment to the Executive in one lump sum due within thirty
(30) days of the Executive's termination of employment.


                                      -2-

<PAGE>   3

              (b)  In the event of termination of the Executive's employment
under the Sun Agreement for "cause" or if the Executive voluntarily terminates
his employment under the Sun Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled to no
further compensation or other benefits under this Agreement, except only as to
any unpaid salary, bonus and benefits accrued and earned by him hereunder up to
and including the effective date of such termination.

              (c)  Regardless of the reason for termination of the Executive's
employment hereunder, bonuses and benefits shall be prorated for any period of
employment not covering an entire year of employment.

              (d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph 8,
the Company's obligation to pay, and the Executive's right to receive, any
compensation under this paragraph 8, including, without limitation, the
Severance Payment, shall terminate upon the Executive's breach of any provision
of paragraph 12 of the Sun Agreement or the Executive's breach of any provision
of that certain Reimbursement Agreement by and between the Executive and Sun
Communities Operating Limited Partnership. In addition, the Executive shall
promptly forfeit any compensation received from the Company under this paragraph
8, including, without limitation, the Severance Payment, upon the Executive's
breach of any provision of paragraph 12 of the Sun Agreement.

         9.   Affiliates. Upon any termination of the Executive's employment 
under this Agreement, the Executive shall be deemed to have resigned from any
and all offices or directorships held by the Executive in the Company and/or the
Affiliates.

         10.  Effect of Change of Control.

              (a)  In the event that Sun Communities is required to pay the
Executive Change in Control Benefits (as defined in the Sun Agreement), the
Company shall pay the Executive the following (the "SHS Change in Control
Benefits"):

                   (i)   A cash payment equal to two and 99/100 (2.99) times 
         the Base Salary in effect on the date of such Change in Control (as
         defined in the Sun Agreement), payable within sixty (60) days of the
         Change in Control; and

                   (ii)  Continued receipt of all compensation and benefits set
         forth in paragraphs 5(a) and 5(b) of this Agreement, until the earlier
         of (i) one year following the Change in Control (subject to the
         Executive's COBRA rights) or (ii) the commencement of comparable
         coverage from another employer. The provision of any one benefit by
         another employer shall not preclude the Executive from continuing
         participation in Company benefit programs provided under this paragraph
         10(a)(ii) that are not provided by the subsequent employer. The
         Executive shall promptly notify the Company upon receipt of benefits
         from a new employer comparable to any benefit provided under this
         paragraph 10(a)(ii).

              (b)  The benefits set forth in paragraph 10(a) above are in
addition to any and all other Company benefits to which the Executive may be
entitled, including, without limitation, the Base Salary and Severance Payment.

              (c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the SHS
Change in Control Benefits shall be reduced by all payments to the Executive
which constitute "excess parachute payments" under Section 280(G) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

         11.  Arbitration. Any dispute or controversy arising out of or relating
to this Agreement shall be settled finally and exclusively by arbitration in the
State of Michigan in accordance with the expedited procedures of the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American 


                                      -3-

<PAGE>   4

Arbitration Association then in effect. Such arbitration shall be conducted by
an arbitrator(s) appointed by the American Arbitration Association in accordance
with its rules and any finding by such arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding
upon the parties. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, and the parties consent to the
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Michigan for this purpose.

                         FACILITY AND GUARANTY AGREEMENT


         THIS FACILITY AND GUARANTY AGREEMENT, dated as of December 10, 1998, is
by and among SUN COMMUNITIES OPERATING LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Michigan limited
partnership (the "Company"), SUN COMMUNITIES, INC., a Maryland corporation (the
"REIT"), the SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS (as defined herein), the financial
institutions named herein (the "Lenders") and THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF
CHICAGO, individually and as the Agent for the Lenders hereunder.

                                R E C I T A L S:

         A. The Company has requested the Lenders to make advances to certain
senior employees, officers and directors of the Company and certain of its
Affiliates in the aggregate principal amount of up to $25,500,000, the proceeds
of which will be used by such senior employees, officers and directors to
purchase Common Stock and/or Common OP Units pursuant to a stock purchase plan
adopted by the Board of Directors of the REIT and the general partner of the
Company.

         B. By virtue of the Program Participants' services to the Company and
the Other Guarantors, the Company and the Other Guarantors have derived and will
continue to derive substantial benefits. The Company and the Other Guarantors
believe that the ownership of the Common Stock or Common OP Units by the Program
Participants which will be facilitated by the Loans will provide incentive to
the Program Participants in performing their jobs so as to more closely align
the interests of the Program Participants with those of the stockholders of the
REIT and the general partner of the Company, and thus confer significant
benefits upon the Company and the Other Guarantors.

         C. It is a condition precedent to the obligation of the Lenders to make
advances to the Program Participants that the Company, the REIT and the
Subsidiary Guarantors shall have executed and delivered this Agreement.

         D. The Company, the REIT and the Subsidiary Guarantors desire to
execute this Agreement to satisfy the condition described in the preceding
paragraph and to induce the Lenders to make the Loans contemplated hereby, and
the Lenders desire to make the Loans to the Program Participants only on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in the other Loan
Documents.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
undertakings herein contained, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

         time, two days prior to the Break Date) on the basis of the quotation
         First Chicago would provide as a fixed rate payor to another swap
         dealer (or if First Chicago declines to provide such quotation for
         whatever reason, then on the basis of what a leading interest rate swap
         dealer selected by First Chicago in good faith is willing to bid as a

applicable Lender (without duplication of amounts otherwise paid) upon demand as
additional consideration for entering into this Agreement and funding the Loans.

                                     ARTICLE IV

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

        4.01      Representations and Warranties.  The Company and the REIT
represent and warrant to the Agent and to each Lender as follows:

                 (a) Corporate/Partnership Status. Each of the Company and each
Other Guarantor (i) is a duly organized and validly existing corporation or
partnership, as the case may be, in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, (ii) has all requisite corporate
or partnership power and authority, as the case may be, to own its property and
assets (including the Real Property Assets) and to transact the business in
which it is engaged or presently proposes to engage (including the Guaranty
hereunder) and (iii) has duly qualified and is authorized to do business and is
in good standing as a foreign corporation or foreign partnership, as the case
may be, in every jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real property
(including the Real Property Assets) or in which the nature of its business
requires it to be so qualified.

                  (b) Corporate/Partnership Power and Authority. Each of the
Company, the REIT, and each Subsidiary Guarantor has the corporate or
partnership power and authority, as the case may be, to execute, deliver and
carry out the terms and provisions of each of the Loan Documents to which it is
a party and has taken all necessary corporate or partnership action, as the case
may be, to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of such Loan
Documents. Each of the Company, the REIT and each Subsidiary Guarantor has duly
executed and delivered each such Loan Document, and each such Loan Document
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable in accordance
with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable insolvency,
bankruptcy or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally, or general
principles of equity whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or
at law.

                  (c) No Violation. To the best of the Company's and the REIT's
knowledge, neither the execution, delivery or performance by the Company or any
Other Guarantor of the Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the compliance
by such Person with the terms and provisions thereof nor the consummation of the
Loans, (i) will contravene any applicable provision of any law, statute, rule,
regulation, order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental
instrumentality, or (ii) will conflict with or result in any material breach of,
any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a
default under, or result in the creation or imposition of (or the obligation to
create or impose) any Lien upon any of the Assets (including the Real Property
Assets) of the Company or any Other Guarantor (or of any partnership of which
such 

                                      -25-
<PAGE>   31

Person is a partner) pursuant to the terms of any indenture, mortgage, deed
of trust, agreement or other instrument to which the Company or any Other
Guarantor (or of any partnership of which such Person is a partner) is a party
or by which it or any of its Assets (including the Real Property Assets) is
bound or to which it may be subject, or (iii) will, with respect to the Company
or any Other Guarantor which is a partnership, violate any provisions of the
partnership agreement of such Person (or the partnership agreement of any
partnership of which such Person is a partner), or (iv) will, with respect to
any Other Guarantor which is a corporation, violate any provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of such Person.

                  (d) Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 5, there are
no actions, suits or proceedings, judicial, administrative or otherwise, pending
or, to the best of the Company's or the REIT's knowledge, threatened with
respect to any of the Loans or any of the Loan Documents, the Company, the REIT,
or any Subsidiary Guarantor, or with respect to the Real Property Assets, that
could, in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect. All matters set
forth on Schedule 5 do not, in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (e) Financial Statements; Financial Condition, etc. The
financial statements of the Company and the Other Guarantors delivered
heretofore or hereafter delivered to the First Chicago were prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied and fairly present the financial
condition and the results of operations of the Company, the REIT and their
Consolidated Subsidiaries and the Real Property Assets covered thereby on the
dates and for the periods covered thereby, except as disclosed in the notes
thereto and, with respect to interim financial statements, subject to usual
year-end adjustments. Neither the Company nor the REIT nor any of their
Consolidated Subsidiaries has any material liability (contingent or otherwise)
not reflected in such financial statements or in the notes thereto. There has
been no adverse change in any condition, fact, circumstance or event that would
make any such information materially inaccurate, incomplete or otherwise
misleading or would affect the Company's, any Subsidiary Guarantors' or the
REIT's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

                  (f)  Solvency.  On the Closing Date and after and giving 
effect to the Loans, the Company and the Other Guarantors will be Solvent.

                  (g)   Material Adverse Change.  Since June 30, 1998, there has
occurred no event, act or condition, and to the best of the Company's or the
REIT's knowledge, there is no prospective event or condition which has had, or
could have, a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (h) Regulation T, U and X. No part of the proceeds of any Loan
will be used in a manner which would violate, or result in a violation of,
Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation X. Neither the making of any Loan, the
providing of the Guaranty by the Guarantors, the use of the proceeds of the
Loans, nor any other aspect of the transactions contemplated hereby will violate
or be inconsistent with the provisions of Regulation T, Regulation U or
Regulation X. No Margin Stock has been or will be pledged by any Borrower or by
any other Person to secure the Reimbursement Obligations of such Borrower. No
Reimbursement Obligations of any Borrower are or will be "indirectly secured"
(as defined in Regulation U) by any Margin Stock.

                                      -26-

<PAGE>   32


                  (i) No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and
delivery by the Company or any Other Guarantor of any Loan Document, nor the
consummation of the transactions therein contemplated (including the incurrence
by each Borrower of its Reimbursement Obligations), nor compliance with the
provisions thereof will violate any law, rule, regulation, order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the Company, any of the
Company's Subsidiaries or any Other Guarantor or the Company's or any Other
Guarantor's Organization Documents, Regulation T, U or X, or the provisions of
any indenture, instrument or agreement to which the Company, its Subsidiaries or
any Other Guarantor is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property,
is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder, except where such
violation, conflict or default would not have a Material Adverse Effect, or
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of
the Company, any of the Company's Subsidiaries or any Other Guarantor pursuant
to the terms of any such indenture, instrument or agreement. No order, consent,
approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or
registration with, or exemption by, any governmental or public body or
authority, or any subdivision thereof, is required to authorize, or is required
in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of, or the legality,
validity, binding effect or enforceability of, any of the Loan Documents.

                  (j) Unsecured Debt Rating. The Company has an Unsecured Debt
Rating of BBB- or higher assigned by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a
Division of The McGraw Hill Companies and of Baa3 or higher assigned by Moody's
Investor Service, Inc., and the consummation of the Loans or the Guaranty will
not cause any change, downgrade or withdrawal of such rating.

                  (k) Tax Returns and Payments. The Company, the REIT and the
Subsidiary Guarantors have filed all tax returns required to be filed by them
for which the filing date has passed and not been extended and has paid all
taxes and assessments payable by such Persons which have become due, other than
(i) those not yet delinquent or (ii) those that are reserved against in
accordance with GAAP which are being diligently contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings.

                  (l) ERISA. Neither the Company nor the Other Guarantors has
any Employee Benefit Plans other than those listed on Schedule 6. No accumulated
funding deficiency (as defined in Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA) or Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any Plan. As of the
Closing Date, the Unfunded Benefit Liabilities do not in the aggregate exceed
$500,000. The Company, the Other Guarantors and each member of their respective
ERISA Controlled Group have complied in all material respects with the
requirements of ERISA and the Code and plan documents for each Employee Benefit
Plan and Plans and are not in default (as defined in Section 4219(c)(5) of
ERISA) with respect to payments to a Multiemployer Plan. Neither the Company nor
any Other Guarantors, nor any member of their respective ERISA Controlled Groups
is subject to any present or potential liability or withdrawal liability or
annual withdrawal liability payments, which, individually or in the aggregate,
could materially adversely affect any of such Persons. To the best knowledge of
the Company, the Other Guarantors and their respective ERISA Controlled Group,
no Multiemployer Plan is or is likely to be in reorganization (within the
meaning of Section 4241 of ERISA or Section 418 of the Code) or is insolvent (as
defined in Section 4245 of ERISA). No material liability to the PBGC (other than
required premium payments), the Internal Revenue Service, any Plan or any trust
established under Title IV of ERISA has been, or


                                      -27-
<PAGE>   33

is expected by the Company, the Other Guarantors, or any member of their
respective ERISA Controlled Group to be, incurred by the Company, the Other
Guarantors, or any member of their respective ERISA Controlled Group. Except as
otherwise disclosed on Schedule 6 hereto, none of the Company, the Other
Guarantors, nor any member of their respective ERISA Controlled Group has any
contingent liability with respect to any post-retirement benefit under any
"welfare plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), other than liability for
continuation coverage under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA. No lien under Section
412(n) of the Code or 302(f) of ERISA or requirement to provide security under
Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or Section 307 of ERISA has been or is reasonably
expected by the Company, the Other Guarantors, or any member of their respective
ERISA Controlled Group to be imposed on the assets of the Company, the Other
Guarantors, or any member of their respective ERISA Controlled Group. Neither
the Company nor any Other Guarantor is a party to any collective bargaining
agreement. Neither the Company nor any Other Guarantor nor any of their ERISA
Controlled Group has engaged in any transaction prohibited by Section 408 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. As of the Closing Date and throughout the
term of the Guaranty, neither the Company nor any Other Guarantor is or will be
an "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, which is subject
to Title I of ERISA, and none of the assets of the Company or any Other
Guarantor will constitute "plan assets" of one or more such plans for purposes
of Title I of ERISA. As of the Closing Date and throughout the term of the
Loans, neither the Company nor any Other Guarantor is or will be a "governmental
plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA and neither the Company nor
any Other Guarantor will be subject to state statutes applicable to the Company
or such Other Guarantor regulating investments and fiduciary obligations, of the
Company or any Other Guarantor with respect to governmental plans.

                  (m)  Representations and Warranties in Loan Documents. 
All representations and warranties made by the Company, the REIT or any
Subsidiary Guarantor in the Loan Documents and the Program are true and correct

Company and the REIT, all factual information (taken as a whole) furnished by or

factual information (taken as a whole) hereafter furnished by or on behalf of
the Company, the REIT or any Subsidiary Guarantor in writing to the Agent will

material fact necessary to make such information (taken as a whole) not
misleading on the date as of which such information is dated or furnished. As of
the Closing Date, there are no facts, events or conditions directly and
specifically affecting the Company, the REIT, or any Subsidiary Guarantor known
to the Company, the REIT or any Subsidiary Guarantor and not disclosed to the
Agent, in the Furnished Information, in the Schedules attached hereto or in the
other Loan Documents, which, in the aggregate, have or could be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

title in all owned Real Property Assets, valid and marketable leasehold
interests in all of the leased and subleased Real Property Assets and, to the

to no Lien of any kind except for Permitted Liens. The Company or the applicable
Other Guarantor has good and marketable fee simple title in all of the
Unencumbered Assets. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no options or
other rights to acquire any of the Real Property Assets that run in favor of any
Person and there are no mortgages, deeds of trust, indentures, debt instruments
or other agreements creating a Lien against any of the Real Property Assets
other than Permitted Liens and, except for Unencumbered Assets, Permitted
Mortgage Debt.

                  (p) No Default. No Unmatured Default or Program Event of
Default exists under or with respect to any Loan Document. Neither the Company,
the Other Guarantors nor any of their respective Subsidiaries is in default in
any material respect beyond any applicable grace period under or with respect to
any other material agreement, instrument or undertaking to which it is a party
or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound in any respect, the
existence of which default could result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (q) Licenses, etc. The Company or the applicable Other
Guarantor has obtained and holds in full force and effect, all material
franchises, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, licenses, permits, certificates,
authorizations, qualifications, accreditations, easements, rights of way and
other rights, consents and approvals which are necessary for the operation of
the Real Property Assets and their respective businesses as presently conducted.

                  (r) Compliance With Law. To the best knowledge of the Company
and the REIT, each Other Guarantor is in material compliance with all Applicable
Laws and other laws, rules, regulations, orders, judgments, writs and decrees,
noncompliance with which could result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (s) Brokers. The Guarantors, the Agent and the Lenders hereby
represent and warrant that no brokers or finders were used in connection with
procuring the financing contemplated hereby and the Company and the REIT hereby
agree to indemnify and save the Agent and each Lender harmless from and against
any and all liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees

any claim or assertion by any party claiming by, through or under the
Guarantors, that it is entitled to compensation in connection with the financing
contemplated hereby and the Agent and the Lenders hereby agree to indemnify and
save the Company harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees or court costs) suffered or
incurred by the Company as a result of any claim or assertion by any party

compensation in connection with the financing contemplated hereby.

                  (t) Judgments. To the best knowledge of the Company and the
REIT, there are no judgments, decrees, or orders of any kind against the Company
or any Other Guarantor unpaid of record which would materially or adversely
affect the ability of any Guarantor to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement in a timely manner. To the best knowledge of the Company and the REIT,

or any Other Guarantor or any related entity, or any principal thereof, and
there are no material judgments against the Company or any Other Guarantor
unsatisfied of record or docketed in any court of the

                  (cc) Copy to Borrowers.  The Company has furnished a copy of

adopted, and the Program and the issuance of the Common Stock and Common OP 
Units pursuant thereto have been duly approved, by all requisite partnership and

                                      -33-
<PAGE>   39

on the Closing Date, shall have been duly issued in compliance with all
applicable laws and shall be fully paid and non-assessable. The offer, issuance,
sale and delivery of the Common Stock and Common OP Units to the Borrowers do
not require registration under the Securities Act. The shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Common OP Units have been duly authorized and
reserved for issuance and sale upon conversion of the Common OP Units, and the
Common Stock, when issued and delivered by the REIT upon such conversion, will
be validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable. The registration rights
agreements contained in the Program constitute the valid and binding obligation
of each party enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms.

                  (ee)  Conversion of Common OP Units.  The conversion by any 
Borrower of any Common OP Units into shares of Common Stock shall not occur

issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.

                  (gg) Borrower Event of Repayment. To the best knowledge of the
Company, no event has occurred and is continuing or would result from the making
of the Loans, that constitutes a Borrower Event of Repayment with respect to any
Borrower or would constitute a Borrower Event of Repayment with respect to any
Borrower but for the requirement that notice be given or time elapse or both.

                  (hh) Event of Default under Existing Credit Agreement. No 
"Event of Default" (as such term is defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) or
event which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an
"Event of Default" has occurred and is continuing.

                  (ii) Survival. The foregoing representations and warranties
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall continue in

         indemnity endorsement which provides that after the physical loss to
         the improvements and personal property has been repaired, the continued

         same level it was at prior to the loss, or the expiration of twelve
         (12) months from the date of the loss, whichever first occurs, and

         region in which the Real Property Asset is located.

                  (iii) All insurance provided for hereunder shall be obtained

ability assigned by Standard & Poor's Rating Group or, if Standard & Poor's

the Company may furnish the Agent with binders therefor to be followed by the
original Policies when issued.

                  (iv) The Company shall not obtain (A) any umbrella or blanket

         than to increase the coverage provided thereby) or canceled without at
         least 30 days' written notice to the Agent and any other party named
         therein as an insured; and

                           (B) each Policy shall provide that the issuers
         thereof shall give written notice to the Agent if the Policy has not
         been renewed thirty (30) days prior to its expiration.

statement certified by the Company or a duly authorized officer of the Company
of the amounts of insurance maintained in compliance herewith, of the risks
covered by such insurance and of the insurance company or companies which carry
such insurance and, if requested by the Agent, verification of the adequacy of
such insurance by an independent insurance broker or appraiser acceptable to the
Agent. The Agent and the Lenders agree that American Modern Home Group is an
acceptable insurance company for so long as its Best general policy rating is A+
or higher and its financial class is VII or greater.

                  (vii) If at any time the Agent is not in receipt of written
evidence that all insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, the

the Agent deems necessary to obtain such insurance coverage as the Agent and the
Lenders in their sole discretion deem appropriate, and all expenses incurred by
the Agent and the Lenders in connection with such action or in obtaining such
insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by the Company and the REIT to
the Agent upon demand and shall bear interest in accordance with Section 7.02 of
the Existing Credit Agreement; provided, however, in the event the agent under
the Existing Credit Agreement is a financial institution other than the Agent
hereunder, the Agent, prior to taking such action, shall request written
evidence from the Company or the Other Guarantors, as applicable, showing that
the agent under the Existing Credit Agreement is undertaking steps to obtain the
necessary insurance; provided further that if the Company or Other Guarantors
are not able to provide written evidence that all insurance required hereunder
is in full force and effect within 90 days after such request by the Agent, the
Agent may take any steps permitted under this clause (vii) to obtain such
insurance.

                  (viii) If the Real Property Assets shall be damaged or
destroyed, in whole or in part, by fire or other casualty, or condemned or taken
by eminent domain, the Company shall give prompt notice of such damage or taking
to the Agent and shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute the completion
of the repair and restoration of the Property as nearly as possible to the
condition the Property was in immediately prior to such fire or other casualty
or taking (the "Restoration"). The Company shall pay all costs of such
Restoration whether or not such costs are covered by insurance or any
condemnation award.

                  (d) Taxes. The Company and the Other Guarantors shall pay or
cause to be paid, when due (i.e., before any penalty or fine could be levied or
charged), all taxes, charges and assessments and all other lawful claims
required to be paid by the Company and the Other Guarantors, except as contested
in good faith and by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted, if adequate
reserves have been established with respect thereto in accordance with GAAP.

authorizations, qualifications, accreditations, easements, rights of way and
other rights, consents and approvals, except where the failure to so preserve
any of the foregoing (other than existence and good standing) could not, in the
aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (ii) The Company shall carry on and conduct its business in
substantially the same manner and substantially the same field of enterprise as
it is presently conducted.

                  (iii) The REIT shall carry on and conduct its business in

all governmental bodies, domestic or foreign, in respect of the conduct of their
business and the ownership of their property (including the Real Property
Assets), except for such laws, rules, statutes, regulations, decrees, orders and
restrictions, (i) which the Company or such Other Guarantor is contesting in
good faith and in compliance with and pursuant to appropriate proceedings
diligently prosecuted (provided that such contest does not and cannot (A) expose
any of the Agent, the Lenders, the Company or the Other Guarantors to any
criminal liability or penalty, (B) give rise to a Lien against any of the Assets
or any Real Property Asset, or (C) otherwise materially adversely affect any of
the Assets or the value thereof), or (ii) the failure to observe which, taken
individually or in the aggregate, could not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
The Company and the applicable Other Guarantors shall not permit the use of all
or any portion of any Real Property Asset to be used for any illegal activity.

                  (g) Performance of Obligations. The Company, the REIT and the
Subsidiary Guarantors shall perform all of their obligations under the terms of
each mortgage, indenture, security agreement, debt instrument, lease,
undertaking and contract by which it or any of the Real Property Assets is bound
or to which it is a party (other than the Loan Documents) so as not to cause a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (h) Stock.  REIT shall cause its issued and outstanding shares
of stock to be listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

                  (i) Change in Rating.  The Company shall promptly notify the

regarding a proposed termination from the PBGC.

                  (iii) Neither the Company nor the Other Guarantors shall
engage in any transaction which would cause any obligation, or action taken or
to be taken, hereunder (or the exercise by the Agent or the Lenders of any of
its rights under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents) to be a non-exempt
(under a statutory or administrative class exemption) prohibited transaction
under ERISA or result in a violation of a state statute regulating governmental
plans that would subject the Agent or any Lender to liability for a violation of
ERISA or such a state statute.

agent approved by the Agent and the Required Lenders in their sole discretion
(the "New Manager") to manage the Real Property Assets. The New Manager shall be
engaged by the Company pursuant to a written management agreement that complies
with the terms hereof and is otherwise satisfactory to the Agent and the

                  (ii) The Company and the REIT will take appropriate measures
to prevent and will not engage in or knowingly permit any illegal activities at

the Agent, or any Lender, from time to time, the Company shall provide to the
Agent, within 30 days after such request, at the expense of the Company and the
REIT, an Environmental Report for all Real Property Assets that have been
acquired after the date hereof, or with respect to the Real Property Assets
owned as of the date hereof, any Real Property Asset for which the Agent has a
reasonable basis for requiring such an Environmental Report (including, without
limitation, the fact that an 



                                      -46-
<PAGE>   52

environmental report was not delivered at or prior to the Closing Date or there
is a basis to believe that there may be Hazardous Materials or a threat of a
Release with respect to such Real Property Asset) as described in such request.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Agent or the Required
Lenders determine at any time that a material risk exists that any such
Environmental Report will not be provided within the time referred to above, the
Agent may retain an environmental consulting firm to prepare such Environmental
Report at the expense of the Company and the REIT, and the Company hereby grants
and agrees to cause any Guarantor which owns any Real Property Asset described
in such request to grant at the time of such request, to the Agent, such firm
and any agents of representatives thereof an irrevocable non-exclusive license,
subject to the rights of tenants, to enter onto their respective Real Property
Assets to undertake such an assessment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during
the term of the Existing Credit Agreement, the Agent shall not retain an
environmental consulting firm to prepare an Environmental Report if such a step
has been undertaken under the Existing Credit Agreement for such Real Property
Asset, provided, however, that in the event the agent under the Existing Credit
Agreement is a financial institution other than the Agent hereunder, the Company
shall, upon the Agent's request, provide written evidence that an environmental
consulting firm has been retained for such Real Property Asset by the agent
under the Existing Credit Agreement; provided further that if the Company is not
able to provide a copy of the requested Environmental Report within 30 days
after the date of such request by the Agent, the Agent may take any steps
permitted under this subsection (x) to obtain such Environmental Report.

                  (y) Documentation following Acquisition of an Interest in Real

Multiemployer Plan for which the Company or any Other Guarantor or any member of
their respective ERISA Controlled Groups (determined without reference to
Section 414(m) or (o) of the Code, if liabilities of entities in the Company's
or any Other Guarantor's ERISA Controlled Group solely by reason of Section
414(m) or (o) of the Code could not result in liability to the Company or Other
Guarantor) to an amount in excess of $1,000,000.00 or (B) result in liability or

         7.03     Nature of Guaranty; Continuing, Absolute and Unconditional.
Each Guarantor hereby agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (a)
its obligations hereunder shall be continuing, absolute and unconditional under
any and all circumstances and not subject to any reduction, limitation,
impairment, termination, defense (other than indefeasible payment in full),
setoff, counterclaim or recoupment whatsoever (all of which are hereby expressly
waived by it to the fullest extent permitted by law), whether by reason of any
claim of any character whatsoever, including, without limitation, any claim of
waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise and (b) the validity and
enforceability of this Guaranty shall not be impaired or affected by any of the
following: (i) any extension, modification or renewal of, or indulgence with
respect to, or substitution for, the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof or any
agreement relating thereto at any time; (ii) any failure or omission to perfect
or maintain any lien on, or preserve rights to, any security or collateral or to
enforce any right, power or remedy with respect to the Guaranteed Debt or any
part thereof or any agreement relating thereto, or any collateral securing the
Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof; (iii) any waiver of any right, power or
remedy or of any default with respect to the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof
or any agreement relating thereto or with respect to any collateral securing the
Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof; (iv) any release, surrender, compromise,
settlement, waiver, subordination or modification, with or without
consideration, of any collateral securing the Guaranteed Debt or any part
thereof, any other guaranties with respect to the Guaranteed Debt or any part
thereof, or any other obligations of any person or entity with respect to the
Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof; (v) the enforceability or validity of the
Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof or the genuineness, enforceability or
validity of any agreement relating thereto or with respect to any collateral
securing the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof; (vi) the application of
payments received from any source to the payment of indebtedness other than the
Guaranteed Debt, any part thereof or amounts which are not covered by this
Guaranty even though the Lenders might lawfully have elected to apply such
payments to any part or all of the Guaranteed Debt or to amounts which are not
covered by this Guaranty; (vii) the insolvency, bankruptcy or any other change
in the legal status of any Obligor; (viii) any change in, or the imposition of,
any law, decree, regulation or other governmental act which does or might
impair, delay or in any way affect the validity, enforceability or the payment
when due of the Guaranteed Debt; (ix) the failure of any Obligor to take any
action required in connection with the performance of the Guaranteed Debt; (x)
the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which such Guarantor may have
at any time against any Obligor or any other guarantor in connection herewith or
with any unrelated transaction; (xi) the disallowance of all or any portion of
any of the Lenders' claims for repayment of the Guaranteed Debt under section
502 or 506 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; or (xii) any other fact or
circumstance which might otherwise constitute grounds at law or equity for the
discharge or release of such Guarantor from its obligations hereunder, all
whether or not such Guarantor shall have had notice or knowledge of any act or
omission referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (xii) of this Section.
It is agreed that each Guarantor's liability hereunder is independent of any
other guaranties or other obligations at any time in effect with respect to the
Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof and that such Guarantor's liability
hereunder may be enforced regardless of the existence, validity, enforcement or
non-enforcement of any such other guaranties or other obligations or any
provision of any applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit payment by
any Obligor of the Guaranteed Debt in the manner agreed upon among the Agent,
the Lenders and any Obligor. To the extent that, by operation of Section 18 of
any Note or otherwise, the Lenders are not entitled to collect any portion of
the Guaranteed Debt in the amount and manner provided for in any Note (such









                                      -56-
<PAGE>   62

portion being the "Excess Amount"), the Guarantors shall nevertheless be
obligated to, and shall, pay such Excess Amounts to the Lenders upon demand made
on or after the date such Excess Amount was otherwise due.

         7.04     Dealings With Borrowers. In addition to the Guaranteed Debt,
other credit may be granted or continued from time to time by the Lenders to the
Borrowers without notice to or authorization from the Company regardless of any
Borrower's financial or other condition at the time of any such grant or
continuation. Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have an obligation to
disclose or discuss with the Company its assessment of the financial condition
of any Borrower.

         7.05     Subrogation. Each Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights
of the Agent and the Lenders against an Obligor in respect of any amounts paid
to the Agent and the Lenders by such Guarantor in respect of such Obligor
pursuant to the provisions hereof; provided, however, that none of the
Guarantors shall be entitled to enforce or to receive any payments arising out
of, or based upon, such right of subrogation with respect to an Obligor until
all of the principal of and interest on such Obligor's Note, if applicable, and
all other Obligations of such Obligor, have been paid in full.

         7.06     No Collateral. Notwithstanding any reference herein to any
collateral securing any of the Guaranteed Debt, it is acknowledged that, on the
date hereof, none of the Guarantors nor any Borrower has granted, or has any
obligation to grant, any security interest in or other lien on any of its
property (including, without limitation, the Common Stock or Common OP Units) to
the Lenders as security for the Guaranteed Debt.

         7.07     Rights To Payments, Etc. In the event that acceleration of the
time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Debt is stayed upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of any Obligor, or otherwise, all such amounts
shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors forthwith upon demand by the
Agent or the Required Lenders. Each Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent
that any Obligor makes a payment or payments to any of the Lenders on the
Guaranteed Debt, or the Agent or the Lenders receive any proceeds of collateral
securing the Guaranteed Debt, which payment or receipt of proceeds or any part
thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,
set aside or required to be returned or repaid to any Obligor, its estate,
trustee, receiver, debtor in possession or any other party, including, without
limitation, the Guarantors, under any insolvency or bankruptcy law, state or
federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such payment,
return or repayment, the obligation or part thereof which has been paid, reduced
or satisfied by such amount shall be reinstated and continued in full force and
effect as of the date when such initial payment, reduction or satisfaction
occurred.

         7.08     Miscellaneous.

                  (a) Any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction of
the amount of any Guaranteed Debt owing by any Obligor to the Lenders shall be
conclusive and binding on each Guarantor irrespective of whether such Guarantor
was a party to the suit or action in which such determination was made.















                                      -57-
<PAGE>   63

                  (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 7.07, this Guaranty
shall continue in effect until this Agreement has terminated, the Guaranteed
Debt has been paid in full and the other conditions of this Guaranty have been
satisfied.

                  (c) In addition to and without limitation of any rights,
powers or remedies of the Agent or the Lenders under applicable law, any time
after maturity of the Guaranteed Debt, whether by acceleration or otherwise, the
Agent or the Lenders may, in their sole discretion, with notice after the fact
to the Guarantors and regardless of the acceptance of any security or collateral
for the payment hereof, appropriate and apply toward the payment of the
Guaranteed Debt (i) any indebtedness due or to become due from any of the
Lenders to the Guarantors and (ii) any moneys, credits or other property
belonging to the Guarantors (including all account balances, whether provisional
or final and whether or not collected or available) at any time held by or
coming into the possession of any of the Agent or any Lender whether for deposit
or otherwise.

                  (d) Wherever possible, each provision of this Guaranty shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Guaranty shall be prohibited by or invalid under
such law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition
or invalidity without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the
remaining provisions of this Guaranty.

                                     ARTICLE VIII

                                    THE AGENT

         8.01     Appointment; Nature of Relationship. The First National Bank
of Chicago is hereby appointed by each of the Lenders as its contractual
representative (herein referred to as the "Agent") hereunder and under each
other Loan Document, and each of the Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Agent to
act as the contractual representative of such Lender with the rights and duties
expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. The Agent agrees to
act as such contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in
this Article VII. Notwithstanding the use of the defined term "Agent," it is
expressly understood and agreed that the Agent shall not have any fiduciary
responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and that the Agent is merely acting as the contractual representative
of the Lenders with only those duties as are expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In its capacity as the Lenders'
contractual representative, the Agent (i) does not hereby assume any fiduciary
duties to any of the Lenders, (ii) is a "representative" of the Lenders within
the meaning of Section 1-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code and (iii) is acting
as an independent contractor, the rights and duties of which are limited to
those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each
of the Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim against the Agent on any agency
theory or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of
which claims each

         8.02     Powers. The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers
under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms
of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The Agent shall have no implied duties to the









                                      -58-
<PAGE>   64

Lenders, or any obligation to the Lenders to take any action thereunder except
any action specifically provided by the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

         8.03     General Immunity. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Company, the Other
Guarantors, the Lenders or any Borrower for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection
herewith or therewith except to the extent such action or inaction is determined
in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
arisen from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.

         8.04     No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc. Neither the Agent
nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for
or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any statement,
warranty or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any
borrowing hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the covenants
or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each
Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article III, except
receipt of items required to be delivered solely to the Agent; (d) the existence
or possible existence of any Program Event of Default or Unmatured Default; (e)
the validity, enforceability, effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any
Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection
therewith; (f) the value, sufficiency, creation, perfection or priority of any
Lien in any collateral security; or (g) the financial condition of any Borrower
or any Guarantor or of any of the Guarantors' respective Subsidiaries. The Agent
shall have no duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is not required
to be furnished by the Borrower to the Agent at such time, but is voluntarily
furnished by the Borrower to the Agent (either in its capacity as the Agent or
in its individual capacity). The Agent shall promptly deliver to the Lenders any
documents delivered to the Agent by the Company or the REIT pursuant to
subsection 5.01(a) herein.

         8.05     Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and
under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by
the Required Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to
act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The Lenders hereby
acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary
action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by
the Required Lenders. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders Pro rata against any and
all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.

         8.06     Employment of Agents and Counsel. The Agent may execute any of
its duties as the Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or
through employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to
the Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care. The Agent shall be entitled to advice of








                                      -59-
<PAGE>   65

counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between the Agent and the Lenders
and all matters pertaining to the Agent's duties hereunder and under any other
Loan Document.

         8.07     Reliance on Documents; Counsel. The Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect to
legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel
may be employees of the Agent.

         8.08     Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders agree
to reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective
Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their
Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (a) for any amounts not
reimbursed by the Company or the Borrowers for which the Agent is entitled to
reimbursement by the Company or the Borrowers under the Loan Documents, (b) for
any other expenses incurred by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection
with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the
Loan Documents (including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the
Agent in connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between
two or more of the Lenders) and (c) for any liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan
Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the
transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such
amounts incurred by or asserted against the Agent in connection with any dispute
between the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the
enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any such other
documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to
the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Agent. The obligations of the Lenders under this
Section 8.08 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this
Agreement.

         8.09     Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Program Event of Default, Unmatured
Default or Borrower Event of Repayment unless the Agent has received written
notice from a Lender or the Company referring to this Agreement describing such
Program Event of Default, Unmatured Default or Borrower Event of Repayment and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Agent
receives such a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the
Lenders.

         8.10     Rights as a Lender. In the event the Agent is a Lender, the
Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document with respect to its Commitment and its Loans as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is a Lender, unless the context
otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The Agent and
its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in
any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those
contemplated by this Agreement







                                      -60-
<PAGE>   66

or any other Loan Document, with the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Borrower in which the Company, or such Subsidiary or such Borrower is not
restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person.

         8.11     Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other
Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Company and the
Other Guarantors and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         8.12     Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Company, such resignation to be
effective upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent
has been appointed, forty-five days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its
intention to resign. The Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause
by written notice received by the Agent from the Required Lenders, such removal
to be effective on the date specified by the Required Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint, on
behalf of the Company and the Lenders, a successor Agent. If no successor Agent
shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders within thirty days after
the resigning Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the
resigning Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Company and the Lenders, a
successor Agent. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Agent may at any
time without the consent of the Company or any Lender, appoint any of its
Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a successor Agent hereunder. If the
Agent has resigned or been removed and no successor Agent has been appointed,
the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Agent hereunder and the Company
shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations to the applicable Lender
and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the Lenders. No successor
Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor Agent has
accepted the appointment. Any such successor Agent shall be a commercial bank
having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Agent. Upon
the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of the Agent, the resigning or
removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and
under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation or removal
of an Agent, the provisions of this Article VIII shall continue in effect for
the benefit of such Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents.

         8.13     Notes. The Agent shall retain possession of the Notes on
behalf of the Lenders. Each Lender shall be entitled, upon request, to examine
or receive a copy of any Note. The Agent shall have only the duty to exercise
reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Notes,






                                      -61-
<PAGE>   67

which duty shall be fully satisfied if the Agent accords such Notes treatment
substantially the same as that which it accords similar property owned by it. If
any Borrower has issued Replacement Notes (as defined in the Note) pursuant to
Section 17 of his or her Note, then upon the request of any Lender the Agent
shall deliver to such Lender the Replacement Note payable to its order.

         8.14     Agent's Fee. The Company agrees to pay to the Agent, for its
own account, the fees agreed to by the Company and the Agent pursuant to that
certain letter agreement dated November 10, 1998, as amended by that certain
letter agreement dated December 7, 1998, or as otherwise agreed from time to
time.

         8.15     Delegation to Affiliates. The Company and the Lenders agree
that the Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates. Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents
and employees) which performs duties in connection with this Agreement shall be
entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other
protective provisions to which the Agent is entitled under Articles VIII and
XII.


                                     ARTICLE IX

                                RATABLE PAYMENTS

         9.01     Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or
otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments received
pursuant to Section 2.05 or Section 12.09) in a greater proportion than its
Pro-rata share of all such Loans, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to
purchase a portion of the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such
purchase each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of Loans. If any Lender,
whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or
otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such
amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon
demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the
benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their Loans. In case any
such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further
adjustments shall be made.


                                     ARTICLE X

                BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

         10.01    Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, the
Other Guarantors and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns,
except that neither the Company nor any Other Guarantor shall have the right to
assign its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents, provided that any
assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance with Section 10.03.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any Lender may at any time, without the
consent of the Company, any Other Guarantor or the Agent, assign all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Notes to







                                      -62-
<PAGE>   68

a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, however, that no such assignment to a Federal
Reserve Bank shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder.
The Agent may treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof (to the extent of
its Pro-rata interest therein) for all purposes hereof unless and until such
payee complies with Section 10.03 in the case of an assignment thereof or, in
the case of any other transfer, a written notice of the transfer is filed with
the Agent. Any assignee or transferee of a Note agrees by acceptance thereof to
be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents. Any request,
authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or
giving such authority or consent is the holder of any Note, shall be conclusive
and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such Note or of
any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

         10.02    Participations.

                  (a) Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may, in the
ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any
time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating
interests in any Advance owing to such Lender, any Note held by or payable to
such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents;
provided, however, that First Chicago shall at all times retain an interest in
the Notes in an aggregate minimum amount of $5,000,000. In the event of any such
sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's
obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations, such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all
purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by any Guarantor under
this Agreement or by the Borrowers under the Notes shall be determined as if
such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Guarantors, the
Borrowers and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan
Documents.

                  (b) Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to
approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment,
modification or waiver which effects any of the modifications referenced in
clauses (a)(i) through (v) of Section 12.01.

                  (c) Benefit of Setoff. The Guarantors agree that each
Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section
7.09(c) in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan
Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were
owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents; provided, that each
Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 7.09(c) with respect
to the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders
agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the
right of setoff provided in Section 7.09(c), agrees to share with each Lender,
any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such
amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 9.01 as if each Participant were
a Lender.

<PAGE>   69

        10.03     Assignments.

                  (a) Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may, in the ordinary
course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign
to one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all or any part of its
rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, provided that with respect to
any partial assignment, except as the Company and the Agent may otherwise
consent, such Lender ratably assigns its interest in all of the Notes and, in
the case of an assignment to a Person which is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a
Lender, such assignment shall be in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 or, if
less, all of the assigning Lender's interests in the Notes; provided, however,
that First Chicago shall at all times retain an interest in the Notes in an
aggregate minimum amount of $5,000,000. Such assignment shall be substantially
in the form from time to time specified by the Agent or in such other form as
may be agreed to by the parties thereto. The consent of the Agent and, so long
as no Program Event of Default is pending, the Company shall be required prior
to an assignment becoming effective with respect to a Purchaser which is not a
Lender or an Affiliate thereof. Such consent, in each case, shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

                  (b)  Effect; Effective Date. Upon (a) delivery to the Agent of
a notice of assignment, substantially in the form from time to time specified by
the Agent (a "Notice of Assignment"), together with any consents required by
Section 10.03(a), and (b) payment of a $3,500 fee to the Agent by the transferor
Lender for processing such assignment, such assignment shall become effective on
the effective date specified in such Notice of Assignment. On and after the
effective date of such assignment, (a) such Purchaser shall for all purposes be
a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by the
Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan
Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto, and (b)
the transferor Lender shall be released with respect to the percentage of the
Loans assigned to such Purchaser without any further consent or action by any
Guarantor, the Borrowers, the Lenders or the Agent. Upon the consummation of any
assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 10.03(b), the transferor
Lender, the Agent, the Borrowers and the Company shall make appropriate
arrangements so that replacement Notes are issued to the Agent to be held on
behalf of such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement
Notes, are issued to the Agent to be held on behalf of such Purchaser, in each
case in principal amounts reflecting their percentage of the Loans, as adjusted
pursuant to such assignment.

         10.04 Dissemination of Information. The Company authorizes each Lender
to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an
interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any
prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession
concerning the creditworthiness of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the
Borrowers, provided such Person agrees in writing to keep such information
confidential and use the same only for the purpose of making credit
determinations in connection with the financing contemplated hereby and to
enforce rights it may have, except that such Person shall not be restricted from
disclosing such information as is (a) required to be disclosed to any regulatory
or administrative body or commission, (b) required to be disclosed by subpoena
or similar process of applicable law, (c) disclosed to counsel, auditors, and
other professional advisors used by such Person on a need-to-know basis, or (d)
deemed necessary by such Person to be disclosed in










                                      -64-
<PAGE>   70

conjunction with any litigation between the Company or any Borrower and such
Person, or relating to the financing contemplated hereby.

         10.05    Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is
transferred to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States of America or any State thereof, the
transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 12.16.

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

         12.01    Amendments. (a) Subject to the provisions of this Section
12.01 and subject to Section 12 of each of the Notes, the Required Lenders (or
the Agent with the consent in writing of the Required Lenders) and the
Guarantors or a Borrower, as applicable, may enter into agreements supplemental
hereto for the purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan
Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders, the Guarantors
hereunder or waiving any Program Event of Default hereunder; provided, however,
that no such supplemental agreement shall, without the consent of each Lender
affected thereby:

                  (i)      Extend the final maturity of any Loan or Note or
                           reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the
                           rate or amount, or extend the time of payment, of
                           interest or fees or other amounts payable thereunder;









                                      -65-
<PAGE>   71

                  (ii)  Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
                        Required Lenders;

                  (iii) Release any Guarantor from its obligations under the
                        Guaranty;

                  (iv)  Amend this Section 12.01; or

                  (v)   Permit any assignment by any Guarantor of its
                        Obligations or its rights hereunder.

                  (b)   No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating
to the Agent shall be effective without the written consent of the Agent. The
Agent may waive payment of the fee required under Section 10.03(b) without
obtaining the consent of any other party to this Agreement. The Lenders shall
not consent to any amendment or modification of any Note increasing the
principal amount thereof or the rate of interest payable thereon without the
consent of the Company.

                  (c)   The Lenders agree that the definitions of "Net Worth",
"Operating Expenses" and "Substantial Assets" and subsections 5.01(o) and
5.02(b)(iii) hereunder shall be amended, modified or supplemented at such time
as and to the extent that the definitions "Net Worth", "Operating Expenses" and
"Substantial Assets" and Sections 5.16 and 6.04(c) of the Existing Credit
Agreement are amended, modified or supplemented; provided, however, that (i)
"Net Worth" shall be revised herein if and only to the extent that "Net Worth"
in the Existing Credit Agreement is amended, modified or supplemented to include
accumulated depreciation, (ii) "Operating Expenses" shall be revised herein if
and only to the extent that clause (e)(ii) therein is amended, modified or
supplemented under the Existing Credit Agreement to a period of 7 years; (iii)
"Substantial Assets" shall be revised herein if and only to the extent that the
percentage amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) therein shall be no
greater than 10%, respectively, (iv) subsection 5.01(o) shall be revised herein
if and only to the extent that Section 5.16 of the Existing Credit Agreement
shall be amended, modified or supplemented to permit the minimum Net Worth (as
amended in accordance with this subsection 12.01(c)) to be no less than
$350,000,000 plus 85% of the net proceeds from equity offerings subsequent to
the date hereof by the REIT and (v) subsection 5.02(b)(iii) shall be revised
herein if and only to the extent that Section 6.04(c) of the Existing Credit
Agreement shall be amended to require Milton Shiffman and Gary Shiffman to own a
minimum of 350,000 shares of Common Stock or OP Units in the aggregate at all
times. Notwithstanding, the foregoing, to the extent that any amendment,
modification or supplement to the Existing Credit Agreement to the definitions
and covenants specified in this subsection 12.01(c) are amended, modified or
supplemented so that the terms of such definitions or covenants therein are more
stringent than specified herein, this Agreement will be amended, modified or
supplemented only to the extent of such amendment, modification or supplement to
the Existing Credit Agreement.

         12.02     Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders 
or the Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such
right or be construed to be a waiver of any Program Event of Default or an
acquiescence therein. Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not
preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or
provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing
signed by the Lendrs required pursuant to Section 12.01,







                                      -66-
<PAGE>   72

and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. No waiver by
the Agent or the Lenders of any default shall operate as a waiver of any other
default or the same default on a future occasion, and no action by the Agent or
the Lenders permitted hereunder shall in any way affect or impair the Agent's or
the Lenders' rights or powers, or the obligations of any Guarantor under this
Agreement. All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall
be cumulative and all shall be available to the Agent and the Lenders until the
Obligations have been paid in full.

         12.03    Survival of Representations. All representations and
warranties of the Guarantors contained in this Agreement or in any Loan Document
shall survive delivery of the Notes and the making of the Loans herein
contemplated.

         12.04    Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit
to any Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any
applicable statute or regulation.

         12.05    Taxes. Any taxes (excluding taxes on the overall net income of
any Lender, any taxes assessed on any Lender pursuant to the Michigan Single
Business Tax and any corporate franchise taxes of any Lender) or other similar
assessments or charges payable or ruled payable by any governmental authority in
respect of the Loan Documents shall be paid by the Company (or the Borrowers, as
provided in the Notes), together with interest and penalties, if any.

         12.06    Headings. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of
the provisions of the Loan Documents.

         12.07    Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents embody the entire
agreement and understanding among the Company, the Agent and the Lenders and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the Company, the Agent
and the Lenders relating to the subject matter thereof other than the fee letter
dated October 6, 1998 between the Company and First Chicago.

         12.08    Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement. The
respective obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no
Lender shall be the partner or the agent of any other (except to the extent to
which the Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to
perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from
any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to
confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement is not
intended to, and shall not be construed to, create any rights (contractual,
equitable, pursuant to law or otherwise) in favor of any Borrower against the
Agent, any Lender or any Guarantor and no Borrower in his or her individual
capacity shall have the right to enforce any rights of any Guarantor hereunder.

         12.09    Expenses; Indemnification. The Company shall reimburse the
Agent for any costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent, which
attorneys may be employees of the Agent) paid or incurred by the Agent in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, review,
syndication, amendment, modification, and administration of the Loan Documents.
The Company also agrees






                                      -67-
<PAGE>   73

to reimburse the Agent and the Lenders for any costs, internal charges and
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and time charges of
attorneys for the Agent and the Lenders, which attorneys may be employees of the
Agent or the Lenders) paid or incurred by the Agent or any Lender in connection
with the collection and enforcement of the Loan Documents. The Company further
agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Lender, its directors, officers and
employees against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities
and expenses (including, without limitation, all expenses of litigation or
preparation therefor whether or not the Agent or any Lender is a party thereto)
which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
any Note or the other Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, the direct or indirect application or proposed application of the
proceeds of any Loan hereunder, any actions brought or threatened by, or any
claim made against the Agent or any Lender by, any Borrower in connection with
its Loan or, to the extent permitted by law, any breach of any consumer lending
law (other than any such Illinois law and Regulation Z of the Board of Governors
of Federal Reserve System) usury (other than Illinois law) or similar law
relating to the Loans; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required
to indemnify any party against any losses, claims, damages, penalties,
judgments, liabilities or expenses to the extent that they arise out of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification. The
obligations of the Company under this Section shall survive the termination of
this Agreement.

         12.10    Numbers of Documents. All statements, notices, closing
documents, and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Agent with
sufficient counterparts so that the Agent may furnish one to each of the
Lenders.

         12.11    Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document
that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid
without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the
operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared
to be severable.

         12.12    Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the
Guarantors and the Lenders and the Agent shall be solely that of guarantor and
lender. Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary
responsibilities to any Guarantor or any Borrower. Neither the Agent nor any
Lender undertakes any responsibility to any Guarantor or any Borrower to review
or inform any Guarantor or any Borrower of any matter in connection with any
phase of any Guarantor's business or operations. Each Guarantor agrees that
neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have liability to any Guarantor or any
Borrower (whether sounding in tort, contract or otherwise) for losses suffered
by any Guarantor or any Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any
way related to, the transactions contemplated and the relationship established
by the Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection
therewith, unless it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
and non-appealable judgment that such losses resulted from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the party from which recovery is sought.

         12.13    CHOICE OF LAW. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAWS
PROVISIONS, OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO








                                      -68-
<PAGE>   74

FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATIONS AND FEDERAL AGENCIES
AND BRANCHES OF FOREIGN BANKS.

         12.14    CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. THE GUARANTORS, THE AGENT AND EACH
LENDER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED
STATES FEDERAL OR ILLINOIS STATE COURT SITTING IN CHICAGO IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE PARTIES
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING
MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY
OBJECTION THEY MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT,
ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE AGENT OR ANY
LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ANY GUARANTOR IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION. ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY ANY GUARANTOR AGAINST THE AGENT OR ANY
LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH
ANY LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

         12.15    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE GUARANTORS, THE AGENT AND EACH
LENDER HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN
ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE
RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.

         12.16    Disclosure. Each Guarantor and each Lender hereby (a)
acknowledge and agree that First Chicago and/or its Affiliates from time to time
may hold other investments in, make other loans to or have other relationships
with the Company or any Borrower, including, without limitation, in connection
with any interest rate hedging instruments or agreements or swap transactions,
and (b) waive any liability of First Chicago or such Affiliate to the Company,
any Borrower or any Lender, respectively, arising out of or resulting from such
investments, loans or relationships other than liabilities arising out of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of First Chicago or its Affiliates.

         12.17    Withholding Tax Exemption. At least five Business Days prior
to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for the
account of any Lender, each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of
the United States of America or a state thereof, agrees that it will deliver to
the Company and the Agent two duly completed and correct copies of United States
of America Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in either case
that such Lender is entitled to receive all payments under this Agreement and
the Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes. Each Lender which so delivers a Form 1001 or 4224 further undertakes to
deliver to the Company and the Agent two additional duly completed and correct
copies of such form (or a successor form) on or before the date that such form
expires







                                      -69-
<PAGE>   75

(currently, three successive calendar years for Form 1001 and one calendar year
for Form 4224) or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event
requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, and such
amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably
requested by the Company or the Agent, in each case certifying that such Lender
is entitled to receive all payments under this Agreement and the Notes without
deduction or withholding of any United States of America federal income taxes,
unless a change in law (including without limitation any change in treaty,
statute or regulation) has occurred after the date hereof and prior to the date
on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such
forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and
delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender advises the Company
and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction
or withholding of United States of America federal income tax.

         12.18    Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Agreement.

                            [signature pages follow]

            ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS CLASSIFYING
                 AND DESIGNATING A SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK AS
                      JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK

                                   ----------

         Sun Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation, having its principal
office in the State of Michigan, in the City of Farmington Hills (the
"Company"), hereby certifies to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation
of Maryland that:

         Pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors by the
Charter and Bylaws of the Company, the Board of Directors pursuant to
resolutions adopted on April 24, 1998 (i) has duly classified 1,000,000 shares
of the authorized but unissued shares of the Preferred Stock of the Company as a
series designated the "Junior Participating Preferred Stock", and (ii)
determined the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers,
restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, and terms and
conditions of redemption of the shares of such series. Such preferences,
conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to
dividends, qualifications, and terms and conditions of redemption, and number of
shares are as follows:

SECTION 1. NUMBER OF SHARES AND DESIGNATION. This series of Preferred Stock
shall be designated the Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the "Preferred
Shares") and the number of shares which shall constitute such series shall be
1,000,000 shares, par value $.01 per share. Such number of shares may be
increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, that
no decrease shall reduce the number of Preferred Shares to a number less than
the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon
the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the Company convertible
into Preferred Shares.

SECTION 2. DIVIDEND RIGHTS.

(A) Subject to the rights of holders of any shares of any series of Preferred
Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the Preferred Shares
with respect to dividends, the holders of Preferred Shares shall be entitled
prior to the payment of any dividends on shares ranking junior to the Preferred
Shares to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of
funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on
the 15th day of January, April, July, and October in each year (each such date
being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on
the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or
fraction of a share of Preferred Shares, in an amount per share (rounded to the
nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1.00 or (b) subject to the provision
for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount
of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in
kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions (other than a dividend
payable in shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(the "Common Stock") or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
(by reclassification or otherwise)) declared on the Common Stock since the
immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the
first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or
fraction of a share of Preferred Shares. In the event the Company shall at any
time (i) declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common
Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the
outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in 

                                      A-1
<PAGE>   2

each such case the amount to which holders of Preferred Shares were entitled
immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall
be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event
and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to such event.

(B) The Company shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Preferred Shares
as provided in subparagraph (A) above immediately after it declares a dividend
or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of
Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall
have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a
dividend of $1.00 per share on the Preferred Shares shall nevertheless be
payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.

(C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding Preferred
Shares from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue
of such Preferred Shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to
the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case
dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from the date
of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders
of Preferred Shares entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall
begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the
Preferred Shares in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at
the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a
share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of
Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of Preferred
Shares entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared
thereon, which record date shall be no more than thirty (30) days prior to the
date fixed for the payment thereof.

SECTION 3. LIQUIDATION.

(A) Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, no
distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior
(either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the
Preferred Shares unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Preferred
Shares shall have received $1.00 per share (the "Liquidation Preference"), plus
an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon,
whether or not declared, to the date of such payment. Following the payment of
the full amount of the Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall
be made to the holders of shares of Preferred Shares unless, prior thereto, the
holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the
"Common Adjustment") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the
Liquidation Preference by (ii) 100 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in
subparagraph (C) below to reflect such events as stocks splits, stock dividends
and recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock) (such number in clause
(ii), the "Adjustment Number"). Following the payment of the full amount of the
Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding
Preferred Shares and shares of Common Stock, respectively, holders of Preferred
Shares and holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and
proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of
the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to the Preferred Shares and Common
Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.

(B) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to
permit payment in full of the Liquidation Preference and the liquidation
preferences of all other series of Preferred Stock, if any, which rank on a
parity with the Preferred Shares, then such remaining assets shall be
distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their
respective liquidation preferences. In the event, however, that there are not
sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Common Adjustment
after the payment in full of the Liquidation Preference, then such remaining
assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock.

(C) In the event the Company shall at any time (i) declare any dividend on
Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding
Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect
immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment
Number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is
the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
such event.

SECTION 4. NO REDEMPTION.

(A) Except as provided below, the Preferred Shares shall not be redeemable.

(B) The Preferred Shares are subject to the provisions of Article VII of the
Charter, including, without limitation, the provisions for the redemption of
Excess Stock (as defined in such Article).

SECTION 5. VOTING RIGHTS.  The holders of Preferred Shares shall have the 
following voting rights:

(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each
Preferred Share shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on all matters
voted on at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company. In the event the
Company shall at any time (i) declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock
payable in shares of Common Stock, or (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common
Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of
shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of
Preferred Shares were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted
by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to such event.

(B) Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of Preferred
Shares and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of
the Company having general voting rights shall vote together as one voting group
on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Company.

(C) Except as set forth herein or as otherwise provided by law, holders of
Preferred Shares shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not
be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of
Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.

SECTION 6. CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS.

(A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on
the Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and
until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not
declared, on Preferred Shares outstanding shall have been paid in full, the
Company shall not:

         declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem
         or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock
         ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution
         or winding up) to the Preferred Shares; declare or pay dividends on or
         make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity
         (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up)
         with the Preferred Shares, except dividends paid ratably on the
         Preferred Shares and all such parity stock on which dividends are
         payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the
         holders of all such shares are then entitled; redeem or purchase or
         otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking on a
         parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or
         winding up) with the Preferred Shares, provided that the Company 


                                      A-3
<PAGE>   4

         may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any
         such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Company
         ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution,
         liquidation or winding up) to the Preferred Shares; or purchase or
         otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Preferred Shares or
         any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Preferred Shares,
         except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by
         publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders
         of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after
         consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other
         relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes,
         shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable
         treatment among the respective series or classes.

(B)      The Company shall not permit any subsidiary of the Company to purchase 
or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Company unless
the Company could, under subparagraph (A) of this Section 6, purchase or
otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.

SECTION 7. REACQUIRED SHARES. Any Preferred Shares purchased or otherwise
acquired by the Company in any manner whatsoever shall be canceled promptly
after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation
become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as
part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or
resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and
restrictions on issuance set forth herein or in the Charter.

SECTION 8. MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, ETC. In case the Company shall enter into any
merger, consolidation, combination or other transaction in which the shares of
Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash
and/or any other property, then in any such case each Preferred Share shall at
the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share
(subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 100
times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property
(payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of
Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Company shall at any time
(i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii)
subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common
Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set
forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of
Preferred Shares shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

SECTION 9. RANKING. The Preferred Shares shall rank, with respect to the payment
of dividends and distribution of assets, junior to all other series of the
Company's Preferred Stock unless the terms of any such series shall provide
otherwise.

SECTION 10. AMENDMENT. The Charter, including the Articles Supplementary
establishing the rights and preferences of the Preferred Shares, shall not be
amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers,
preferences or special rights of the Preferred Shares so as to affect them
adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Preferred Shares, voting separately as one voting group.

SECTION 11. FRACTIONAL SHARES. Preferred Shares may be issued in fractions of a
share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional
shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in
distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of
Preferred Shares.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
                              --------------------

         THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
on this 31st day of December, 1998, but shall be effective as of January 1,
1999, by and between SUN COMMUNITIES, INC., a Maryland corporation (the
"Company"), and BRIAN W. FANNON (the "Executive").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, the Company desires to continue the employment of the
Executive, and the Executive desires to continue to be employed by the Company,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth below.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained in
this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

         1.       Employment.

                  (a) The Company agrees to employ the Executive and the
Executive accepts the employment, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth below. During the term of employment hereunder, the Executive shall serve
as the Chief Operating Officer of the Company, and shall do and perform
diligently all such services, acts and things as are customarily done and
performed by such officers of companies in similar business and in size to the
Company, together with such other duties as may reasonably be requested from
time to time by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), which
duties shall be consistent with the Executive's position as set forth above.

                  (b) For service as an officer and employee of the Company, the
Executive shall be entitled to the full protection of the applicable
indemnification provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Company, as they may be amended from time to time.

         2.       Term of Employment.

                  Subject to the provisions for termination provided below, the
term of the Executive's employment under this Agreement shall commence on
January 1, 1999 and shall continue thereafter for a period of three (3) years
ending on December 31, 2001.

         3.       Devotion to the Company's Business.

                  The Executive shall devote his best efforts, knowledge, skill,
and his entire productive time, ability and attention to the business of the
Company and its Affiliates (as defined in paragraph 12 below) during the term of
this Agreement.

         4.       Compensation.

                  (a) During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall pay
or provide, as the case may be, to the Executive the compensation and other
benefits and rights set forth in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of this Agreement.

                  (b) Base Compensation. As compensation for the services to be
performed hereafter, the Company shall pay to the Executive, during his
employment hereunder, an annual base salary (the "Base Salary") of One Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) per year, payable in accordance with the
Company's usual pay practices (and in any event no less


<PAGE>   2



frequently than monthly).

                  (c) Annual Salary Increase. On January 1 of each year,
commencing January 1, 2000, the Base Salary shall be increased by five percent
(5%) of the Base Salary for the immediately prior year or such greater increase
as may be deemed appropriate by the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion.

                  (d) Bonus. The Board shall prepare and adopt an executive
bonus plan (the "Bonus Plan") which shall be established for the payment of an
incentive bonus to the Executive based on the Company achieving certain
performance criteria to be established by the Company and the Executive. Such
Bonus Plan shall utilize the same bonus-formula methodology as that used in the
bonus plans for the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer. Upon adoption, a copy of the Bonus Plan shall be attached to this
Agreement and incorporated herein, and the Executive shall be eligible to
receive an award under the Bonus Plan on the terms and conditions set forth in
that document; provided, however, that such bonus shall not exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the Executive's then current Base Salary.

         5.       Benefits.

                  (a) Insurance. The Company shall provide to the Executive
life, medical and hospitalization insurance for himself, his spouse and eligible
family members as may be determined by the Board to be consistent with the
Company's standard policies.

                  (b) Benefit Plans. The Executive, at his election, may
participate, during his employment hereunder, in all retirement plans, 401(K)
plans and other benefit plans of the Company generally available from time to
time to other executive employees of the Company and for which the Executive
qualifies under the terms of the plans (and nothing in this Agreement shall or
shall be deemed to in any way affect the Executive's right and benefits under
any such plan except as expressly provided herein). The Executive shall also be
entitled to participate in any equity, stock option or other employee benefit
plan that is generally available to senior executives, as distinguished from
general management, of the Company. The Executive's participation in and
benefits under any such plan shall be on the terms and subject to the conditions
specified in the governing document of the particular plan.

                  (c) Annual Vacation. The Executive shall be entitled to four
(4) weeks vacation time each year without loss of compensation which shall be
scheduled with the advance approval of the Company. In the event that the
Executive is unable for any reason to take the total amount of vacation time
authorized herein during any year, he may accrue such unused time and add it to
the vacation time for any following year; provided, however, that no more than
ten (10) days of accrued vacation time may be carried over at any time (the
"Carry-Over Limit"). In the event that the Executive has accrued and unused
vacation time in excess of the Carry-Over Limit (the "Excess Vacation Time"),
the Excess Vacation Time shall be paid to the Executive within ten (10) days of
the end of the year in which the Excess Vacation Time was earned based on the
Base Salary then in effect. Upon any termination of this Agreement for any
reason whatsoever, accrued and unused vacation time (not to exceed twenty (20)
business days) shall be paid to the Executive within ten (10) days of such
termination based on the Base Salary in effect on the date of such termination.
For purposes of this Agreement, one-twelfth (1/12) of the applicable annual
vacation shall accrue on the last day of each month that the Executive is
employed under this Agreement.

         6.       Reimbursement of Business Expenses.

                  The Company shall reimburse the Executive or provide him with
an expense allowance during the term of this Agreement for travel, car
telephone, and other expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred by the
Executive in connection with the Company's business. The Executive shall furnish
such documentation with respect to reimbursement to be paid hereunder as the
Company shall reasonably request.

         7.       Termination of Employment.

                  (a) The Executive's employment under this Agreement may be
terminated:

                           (i)   by either the Executive or the Company at any
         time for any reason whatsoever or for no reason upon not less than
         thirty (30) days written notice;

                           (ii)  by the Company at any time for "cause" as
         defined below, without prior notice; and

                           (iii) upon the Executive's death.

                  (b) For purposes hereof, for "cause" shall mean the material
breach of any provision of this Agreement by the Executive, or any action of the
Executive (or the Executive's failure to act), which, in the reasonable
determination of the Board, involves malfeasance, fraud, or moral turpitude, or
which, if generally known, would or might have a material adverse effect on the
Company and/or its reputation.

         8.       Severance Compensation.

                  (a) In the event that the Company terminates the Executive's
employment under this Agreement without "cause" pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(i)
hereof, the Executive shall be entitled to any unpaid salary, bonus and benefits
accrued and earned by him hereunder up to and including the effective date of
such termination and the Company shall pay the Executive monthly an amount equal
to one-twelfth (1/12) of the Base Salary in effect on the date of such
termination for a period of up to twelve (12) months if the Executive fully
complies with paragraph 12 of this Agreement (the "Severance Payment").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect to
make the Severance Payment to the Executive in one lump sum due within thirty
(30) days of the Executive's termination of employment.

                  (b) In the event of termination of the Executive's employment
under this Agreement for "cause" or if the Executive voluntarily terminates his
employment hereunder, the Executive shall be entitled to no further compensation
or other benefits under this Agreement, except only as to any unpaid salary,
bonus and benefits accrued and earned by him hereunder up to and including the
effective date of such termination.

                  (c) Regardless of the reason for termination of the
Executive's employment hereunder, bonuses and benefits shall be prorated for any
period of employment not covering an entire year of employment.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph
8, the Company's obligation to pay, and the Executive's right to receive, any
compensation under this paragraph 8, including, without limitation, the
Severance Payment, shall terminate upon the Executive's breach of any provision
of paragraph 12 hereof or the Executive's breach of any provision of that
certain Reimbursement Agreement by and between the Executive and Sun


                                      -3-


<PAGE>   4


Communities Operating Limited Partnership. In addition, the Executive shall
promptly forfeit any compensation received from the Company under this paragraph
8, including, without limitation, the Severance Payment, upon the Executive's
breach of any provision of paragraph 12 hereof.

         9.       Affiliates. Upon any termination of the Executive's employment
under this Agreement, (a) the Executive shall be deemed to have resigned from
any and all offices or directorships held by the Executive in the Company and/or
the Affiliates, including, without limitation, Sun Home Services, Inc. ("Sun
Homes"), and (b) that certain Employment Agreement, of even date herewith,
between Sun Homes and the Executive shall be automatically terminated.

         10.      Effect of Change of Control.

                  (a) The Company or its successor shall pay the Executive the
Change in Control Benefits (as defined below) if there has been a Change in
Control (as defined below) and any of the following events has occurred: (i) the
Executive's employment under this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
paragraph 7(a)(i), (ii) upon a Change in Control under paragraph 10(f)(ii), the
Company or its successor does not expressly assume all of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, or (iii) there are less than eighteen (18) months
remaining under the term of this Agreement.

                  (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Change in Control
Benefits" shall mean the following benefits:

                      (i)  A cash payment equal to two and 99/100 (2.99) times
         the Base Salary in effect on the date of such Change in Control,
         payable within sixty (60) days of the Change in Control; and

                      (ii) Continued receipt of all compensation and benefits
         set forth in paragraphs 5(a) and 5(b) of this Agreement, until the
         earlier of (i) one year following the Change in Control (subject to the
         Executive's COBRA rights) or (ii) the commencement of comparable
         coverage from another employer. The provision of any one benefit by
         another employer shall not preclude the Executive from continuing
         participation in Company benefit programs provided under this paragraph
         10(b)(ii) that are not provided by the subsequent employer. The
         Executive shall promptly notify the Company upon receipt of benefits
         from a new employer comparable to any benefit provided under this
         paragraph 10(b)(ii).

                  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) in
the event that the Executive's employment under this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with paragraph 7(a)(i) within sixty (60) days prior to a Change in
Control, such termination shall be deemed to have been made in connection with
the Change in Control and the Executive shall be entitled to the Change in
Control Benefits; and (ii) in the event that the Executive's employment under
this Agreement is terminated by the Company or its successor in accordance with
paragraph 7(a)(i) after a Change in Control and the Executive was not already
entitled to the Change in Control Benefits under paragraph 10(a)(iii), the
Company or its successor shall pay the Executive an amount equal to the
difference between the Change in Control Benefits and the amounts actually paid
to the Executive under this Agreement after the Change in Control but prior to
his termination.

                  (d) The Change in Control Benefits are in addition to any and
all other Company benefits to which the Executive may be entitled, including,
without limitation, Base Salary, Severance Payment, and the exercise or
surrender of stock options as a result of the


                                      -4-


<PAGE>   5

Change in Control.

                  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Change in Control Benefits shall be reduced by all other payments to the
Executive which constitute "excess parachute payments" under Section 280(G) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

                  (f) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control"
shall be deemed to have occurred:

                      (i)   if any person or group of persons acting together
         (other than (a) the Company or any person (I) who on December 1, 1998
         was a director or officer of the Company, or (II) whose shares of
         Common Stock of the Company are treated as "beneficially owned" by any
         such director or officer, or (b) any institutional investor (filing
         reports under Section 13(g) rather than 13(d) of the Securities
         Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including any employee benefit plan
         or employee benefit trust sponsored by the Company)), becomes a
         beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company
         (including convertible securities) representing twenty percent (20%) or
         more of either the then-outstanding Common Stock of the Company or the
         combined voting power of the Company's then-outstanding voting
         securities;

                      (ii)  if the directors or stockholders of the Company
         approve an agreement to merge into or consolidate with, or to sell all
         or substantially all of the Company's assets to, any person (other than
         a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company formed for the purpose of
         changing the Company's corporate domicile); or

                      (iii) if the new directors appointed to the Board during
         any twelve-month period constitute a majority of the members of the
         Board, unless (I) the directors who were in office for at least twelve
         (12) months prior to such twelve-month period (the "Incumbent
         Directors") plus (II) the new directors who were recommended or
         appointed by a majority of the Incumbent Directors constitutes a
         majority of the members of the Board.

         For purposes of this paragraph 10(f), a "person" includes an
individual, a partnership, a corporation, an association, an unincorporated
organization, a trust or any other entity.

         11.      Stock Options. In the event of termination of the Executive's
employment under this Agreement for "cause", all stock options or other stock
based compensation awarded to the Executive shall lapse and be of no further
force or effect whatsoever in accordance with the Company's Amended and Restated
1993 Stock Option Plan. In the event that the Company terminates the Executive's
employment under this Agreement without "cause" or upon the death of the
Executive, all stock options and other stock based compensation awarded to the
Executive shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable; provided,
however, that such options and other stock based compensation cannot be
exercised until the expiration of the Noncompetition Period (as defined in
paragraph 12 below) and such stock options or other stock based compensation
shall be automatically forfeited upon the Executive's breach of any of the
provisions of paragraph 12 hereof. Any Stock Option Agreements between the
Company and the Executive shall be amended to conform to the provisions of this
paragraph 11. In the event of an inconsistency between the terms of a Stock
Option Agreement and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement
shall control.

         12.      Covenant Not To Compete and Confidentiality.

                  (a) The Executive acknowledges the Company's reliance and
expectation of


                                      -5-


<PAGE>   6


the Executive's continued commitment to performance of his duties and
responsibilities under this Agreement. In light of such reliance and expectation
on the part of the Company and as an inducement for the Company to enter into
this Agreement, the Executive agrees that:

                  (i)   for a period commencing on the date of this Agreement
         and ending upon the expiration of twelve (12) months following the
         termination of the Executive's employment under this Agreement for any
         reason, including, without limitation, the expiration of the term (the
         "Noncompetition Period"), the Executive shall not, directly or
         indirectly, engage in, or have an interest in or be associated with
         (whether as an officer, director, stockholder, partner, associate,
         employee, consultant, owner or otherwise) any corporation, firm or
         enterprise which is engaged in (A) the development, ownership, leasing,
         management or financing of manufactured housing communities, (B) the
         sales of manufactured homes, or (C) any other business which is
         competitive with the business then or at any time during the term of
         this Agreement conducted or proposed to be conducted by the Company, or
         any corporation owned or controlled by the Company or under common
         control with the Company (the "Affiliates"), anywhere within the
         continental United States or Canada; provided, however, that,
         notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that the
         Executive voluntarily terminates his employment with the Company, the
         Noncompetition Period shall extend until the later of the remainder of
         the initial 3-year term of this Agreement or the expiration of twelve
         (12) months following the termination of Executive's employment under
         this Agreement;

                  (ii)  the Executive shall not at any time, for so long as any
         Confidential Information (as defined below) shall remain confidential
         or otherwise remain wholly or partially protectable, either during the
         term of this Agreement or thereafter, use or disclose, directly or
         indirectly, to any person outside of the Company or any Affiliate any
         Confidential Information;

                  (iii) promptly upon the termination of this Agreement for any
         reason, the Executive (or in the event of the Executive's death, his
         personal representative) shall return to the Company any and all copies
         (whether prepared by or at the direction of the Company or the
         Executive) of all records, drawings, materials, memoranda and other
         data constituting or pertaining to Confidential Information;

                  (iv)  for a period commencing on the date of this Agreement
         and ending upon the expiration of the Noncompetition Period, the
         Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, divert, or by aid to
         others, do anything which would tend to divert, from the Company or any
         Affiliate any trade or business with any customer or supplier with whom
         the Executive had any contact or association during the term of the
         Executive's employment with the Company or with any party whose
         identity or potential as a customer or supplier was confidential or
         learned by the Executive during his employment by the Company; and

                  (v)   for a period commencing on the date of this Agreement
         and ending upon the expiration of the Noncompetition Period, the
         Executive shall not, either directly or indirectly, induce or attempt
         to induce any person with whom the Executive was acquainted while in
         the Company's employ to leave the employment of the Company or any of
         the Affiliates.

         As used in this Agreement, the term "Confidential Information" shall
mean all business information of any nature and in any form which at the time or
times concerned is not generally


                                      -6-

<PAGE>   7


known to those persons engaged in business similar to that conducted or
contemplated by the Company or any Affiliate (other than by the act or acts of
an employee not authorized by the Company to disclose such information) and
which relates to any one or more of the aspects of the present or past business
of the Company or any of the Affiliates or any of their respective predecessors,
including, without limitation, patents and patent applications, inventions and
improvements (whether or not patentable), development projects, policies,
processes, formulas, techniques, know-how, and other facts relating to sales,
advertising, promotions, financial matters, customers, customer lists, customer
purchases or requirements, and other trade secrets.

                  (b) The Executive agrees and understands that the remedy at
law for any breach by him of this paragraph 12 will be inadequate and that the
damages flowing from such breach are not readily susceptible to being measured
in monetary terms. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that, upon adequate proof of
the Executive's violation of any legally enforceable provision of this paragraph
12, the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain
a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach. Nothing in this
paragraph 12 shall be deemed to limit the Company's remedies at law or in equity
for any breach by the Executive of any of the provisions of this paragraph 12
which may be pursued or availed of by the Company.

         13.      Arbitration. Any dispute or controversy arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be settled finally and exclusively by
arbitration in the State of Michigan in accordance with the expedited procedures
of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then
in effect. Such arbitration shall be conducted by an arbitrator(s) appointed by
the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its rules and any
finding by such arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon the parties.
Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction thereof, and the parties consent to the jurisdiction
of the courts of the State of Michigan for this purpose. Nothing contained in
this paragraph 13 shall be construed to preclude the Company from obtaining
injunctive or other equitable relief to secure specific performance or to
otherwise prevent a breach or contemplated breach of this Agreement by the
Executive as provided in paragraph 12 hereof.

         14.      Notice. Any notice, request, consent or other communication
given or made hereunder shall be given or made only in writing and (a) delivered

                                  EXHIBIT 12.1

                COMPUTATION OF RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES
     AND RATIO OF EARNINGS TO COMBINED FIXED CHARGES AND PREFERRED DIVIDENDS

         The ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the Company (including the
Sun Partnerships and its subsidiaries and majority-owned partnerships) presents
the relationship of the Company's earnings to its fixed charges. "Earnings" as
used in the computation, is based on the Company's net income (loss) from
continuing operations (which includes a charge to income for depreciation and
amortization expense) before income taxes, plus fixed charges. "Fixed charges"
is comprised of (i) interest charges, whether expensed or capitalized, and (ii)
amortization of loan costs and discounts or premiums relating to indebtedness of
the Company and its subsidiaries and majority-owned partnerships, excluding in
all cases items which would be or are eliminated in consolidation.

         The Company's ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges presents the
relationship of the Company's earnings (as defined above) to fixed charges (as
defined above).
