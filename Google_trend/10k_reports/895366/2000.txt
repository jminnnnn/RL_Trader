ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL

    Duane Reade is the largest drugstore chain in metropolitan New York, based
on sales volume, with 88 of its 149 stores located in Manhattan's high-traffic
business and residential districts. Since opening its first store in 1960, the
Company has successfully executed a marketing and operating strategy tailored to
the unique characteristics of New York, the largest and most densely populated
market in the United States. For the fiscal year ended December 25, 1999, the
Company had sales of $839.8 million and EBITDA (earnings before interest, income
taxes, depreciation, amortization, extraordinary charge, nonrecurring charges
and other non-cash items) of $85.8 million, increases of 43.0% and 38.3%,
respectively, over the 1998 fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended December 25,
1999, the Company had net income of $40.7 million, which reflected a
$10.5 million income tax benefit. For the fiscal year ended December 26, 1998,
the Company had a net loss of $4.8 million after an extraordinary charge of
$23.6 million related to the early extinguishment of debt.

    The Company enjoys strong brand name recognition in metropolitan New York,
which it believes results from the Company's many locations in high-traffic
areas of Manhattan. The Company has developed an operating strategy designed to
capitalize on the unique characteristics of the metropolitan New York market,
which include high-traffic volume, complex distribution logistics and high costs
of occupancy, media advertising and personnel. The key elements of the Company's
operating strategy are (i) an everyday low price format and broad product
offerings, (ii) a low cost operating structure supported by its high volume
stores and low advertising and distribution costs and (iii) the ability to
design and operate its stores in a wide variety of sizes and layouts.

    The Company believes that its everyday low price format and broad product
offerings provide value and convenience for its customers and build customer
loyalty. The Company's everyday low price format results in prices that the
Company believes are lower, on average, than the prices offered by its
competitors.

    The Company is able to keep its operating costs relatively low due to its
high per store sales volume, relatively low warehouse and distribution costs and
relatively low advertising expenditures. The Company's high volume stores allow
it to effectively leverage occupancy costs, payroll and other store operating
expenses. The Company's 450,000 square foot distribution facility is centrally
located in Maspeth, Queens and, combined with the rapid turnover of inventory in
Duane Reade's stores, results in relatively low warehouse and distribution
costs.

    The Company has demonstrated its ability to successfully operate stores
using a wide variety of store configurations and sizes, which the Company
believes, is necessary to succeed in the metro New York City market. For
example, the size of the Company's stores ranges from 1,600 to 14,700 square
feet, and it operates 35 bi-level stores. The Company believes that its
flexibility in configuring stores provides it with a competitive advantage in
securing locations for its new stores, as many of its competitors target more
standardized spaces for their stores, which are more difficult to find in
metropolitan New York. In addition, the Company's management team has extensive
experience and knowledge of the New York real estate market, allowing it to
pursue attractive real estate opportunities.

    The Company was founded in 1960, and in June 1997, investment funds
affiliated with DLJ Merchant Banking Partners II, L.P. (the "DLJ Entities")
acquired approximately 91.5% of the outstanding capital stock of the Company. On
February 10, 1998, the Company successfully completed its initial public
offering, which raised approximately $102 million in new equity to the Company.
Upon consummation of the initial public offering (in which the DLJ Entities and
certain other selling security holders participated), the DLJ Entities owned
approximately 48.9% of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock.

                                       3
<PAGE>
    The Company operates 149 stores, 21 of which were opened during 1999. During
1998, the Company opened 33 stores. Additionally, in September 1998, the Company
purchased substantially all of the operating assets (including inventory and
store leases) from Rock Bottom, Inc. The Company completed the integration of 29
Rock Bottom stores into the Duane Reade chain during 1999.

COMPANY OPERATIONS

    MERCHANDISING:  Duane Reade's overall merchandising strategy is to provide
the broadest selection of branded and private label drugstore products available
in Manhattan and to sell them at everyday low prices. To further enhance
customer service and loyalty, the Company attempts to maintain a consistent
in-stock position in all merchandise categories. In addition to prescription and
over-the-counter ("OTC") drugs, the Company offers brand name and private label
health and beauty care products, food and beverage items, tobacco products,
cosmetics, housewares, hosiery, greeting cards, photofinishing, photo supplies,
seasonal merchandise and other products. Health and beauty care products,
including OTC drugs, represent the largest of the Company's product categories.
Popular brands of health and beauty care products are given ample shelf space,
and large sizes are offered, which the Company believes appeals to the value
consciousness of many Manhattan consumers. Convenience items such as candy,
snacks and seasonal goods are positioned near the check out registers to provide
optimum convenience and stimulate impulse purchases for the customers while
allowing the store employees to monitor those product categories that are
particularly susceptible to inventory shrink.

    In addition to the wide array of brand products offered in its stores, the
Company offers its own private label products. Private label products provide
customers with high-quality, lower priced alternatives to name brand products
while generating higher gross profit margins than name brand products. These
offerings also enhance Duane Reade's reputation as a value-oriented store. The
Company currently offers approximately 475 private label products. In 1999,
these private label products accounted for approximately 5.2% of non-pharmacy
sales. The Company believes that its strong brand image, reputation for quality
and reliability in the New York City market, and its economies of scale in
purchasing allow it to aggressively promote private label goods.

    The Company also offers same-day photofinishing services in all of its
stores and has installed one-hour photofinishing in 20 stores. Management
believes that photofinishing services contribute significantly to sales of other
merchandise categories because of customer traffic increases that result from
the customer visiting a store twice, in order to drop off film and pick up the
processed photos.

    PHARMACY:  The Company believes that its pharmacy business will continue to
contribute significantly to the Company's growth. Management also believes that
a larger and stronger pharmacy business will enhance customer loyalty and
generate incremental customer traffic, which is expected to increase sales of
Duane Reade's wide variety of OTC drugs and other non-pharmacy merchandise.
Duane Reade's prescription drug sales (as reflected by same store pharmacy
sales) grew by 21.0% in 1999 compared to 1998. Sales of prescription drugs
represented 31.9% of total sales in 1999 compared to 28.3% of total sales in
1998. The average number of prescriptions filled by Duane Reade per store per
week increased to 984 in 1999, which remains well below the industry chain store
average of approximately 1,150, providing significant opportunity for continued
pharmacy growth. The Company believes that the average number of prescriptions
filled per week by it lags behind the industry average because of (i) the
historically low penetration of Third Party Plans (as defined below) in the New
York City area and (ii) the Company's concentration of stores in business areas,
rather than residential areas. The Company believes continued pharmacy growth
will also increase overall customer traffic and benefit its non-pharmacy sales.

    The Company believes that its extensive network of conveniently located
stores, strong local market position, pricing policies and reputation for high
quality health care products and services provide it with a competitive
advantage in attracting pharmacy business from individual customers as well as
managed care organizations, insurance companies, employers and other third party
payors (collectively, "Third Party

                                       4
<PAGE>
Plans"). The percentage of the Company's total prescription drug sales
attributable to Third Party Plans increased to approximately 81% in 1999 from
approximately 78% in 1998. Although gross margins on sales to Third Party Plans
are generally lower than other prescription drug sales because of the highly
competitive nature of pricing for this business and the purchasing power of
Third Party Plans, management believes that the lower gross profit margins are
offset by the higher volume of pharmacy sales to Third Party Plan customers
allowing the Company to leverage other fixed store operating expenses. In
addition, the Company believes that Third Party Plans generate additional
general merchandise sales by increasing customer traffic in the stores. As of
December 25, 1999, the Company had contracts with over 200 Third Party Plans,
including every major Third Party Plan in the Company's market areas.

    Another important component of the Company's pharmacy growth strategy is the
continued acquisition of prescription files from independent pharmacies in
market areas currently served by existing Company stores. In 1999, the Company
purchased the prescription files of 13 independent pharmacies for an aggregate
total of $4.3 million which generated approximately $33.5 million in revenues on
an annualized basis. Independent pharmacists tend to have a higher proportion of
customers that are not Third Party Plans, which provide the Company with
incremental revenue and higher margin contribution. When appropriate, the
Company will retain the services of the pharmacist, whose personal relationship
with the customers generally maximizes the retention rate of the purchased file.
Since 1995, the Company has experienced an estimated 80% customer retention rate
with respect to prescription files acquired. Given the large number of
independent pharmacies in metropolitan New York, the Company believes that these
stores will provide additional acquisition opportunities in the future.

    The Company's pharmacies employ computer systems that link all of the
Company's pharmacies and enable them to provide customers with a broad range of
services. The Company's pharmacy computer network profiles customer medical and
other relevant information, supplies customers with information concerning their
drug purchases for income tax and insurance purposes and prepares prescription
labels and receipts. The computer network also expedites transactions with Third
Party Plans by electronically transmitting prescription information directly to
the Third Party Plan and providing on-line adjudication, which confirms at the
time of sale customer eligibility, prescription coverage and pricing and
co-payment requirements and automatically bills the respective plan. On-line
adjudication reduces losses from rejected claims and eliminates a portion of the
Company's paperwork for billing and collection of receivables and related costs.

    During 1999, the Company launched a new service initiative aimed at
improving customer service at its higher volume pharmacies. This service
utilizes a centrally located pharmacy that receives orders via internet, phone
or fax from customers and physicians, determines which prescriptions can be most
efficiently filled centrally and forwards the balance to the respective stores.
The selected prescriptions are filled, then delivered to the store in advance of
the scheduled pickup. Waiting time is reduced during peak periods. Meanwhile,
in-store pharmacy staff members have more time to service customers and fill
prescriptions that are needed on a more immediate basis. This centrally located
pharmacy contributes to improved inventory management, since large backup
supplies of expensive medications can be maintained in a single location rather
than each individual store. This concentration of inventory in one central
location also results in higher fill rates on less frequently used medications.
The Company expects to have 50 stores serviced by this facility by the end of
2000.

    INTERNET:  In 1999, the Company launched an interactive website,
duanereade.com, which customers may use to fill prescriptions and
over-the-counter medications as well as health and beauty care products and
other non pharmacy items. The company was one of the first major drug store
chains to offer full service Internet retailing to its customers. The Company's
strategy has been to develop the website as an additional vehicle to deliver
superior customer service, further supporting its strength as a
"brick-and-mortar" retailer. While sales generated on the website to date have
been immaterial to the Company's business overall, duanereade.com has positioned
the Company to exploit internet business as it may develop in the future.

    STORE OPERATIONS:  Duane Reade stores range in size from 1,600 to 14,700
square feet, with an average of 7,438 square feet per store. The Company's
stores are designed to facilitate customer movement and to minimize inventory
shrink. The Company believes that its wide, straight aisles and well-stocked
shelves allow customers to find merchandise easily and allow the store's
employees (managers, security guards, cashiers and stock clerks) to effectively
monitor customer behavior. The Company attempts to group merchandise logically
in order to enable customers to locate items quickly and to stimulate impulse
purchases.

    The Company establishes each store's hours of operation in an attempt to
best serve customer traffic patterns and purchase habits and to optimize store
labor productivity. Stores in Manhattan's business districts are generally open
five days a week. In residential and appropriate business/shopping districts,
stores are open six or seven days a week with a heavy emphasis on convenient,
early morning and late evening openings. In 1999, the Company had 22 stores
which were open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The Company intends to continue
to identify stores in which extended operating hours would improve customer
service and convenience and contribute to the Company's profitability. Many of
the Company's stores offer delivery services as an added customer convenience.
Customers can arrange for delivery by phone, fax, internet or at the store. Each
store is supervised by one store manager and one or more assistant store
managers. Stores are supplied by deliveries from the Company's warehouse in
Queens on an average of three times a week, allowing the stores to maintain a
high in-stock position, maximize store selling space and minimize inventory
required to be held on hand.

    The Company attempts to mitigate inventory shrink through (i) the employment
of full time security guards in each store, (ii) use of a state-of-the-art
Electronic Article Surveillance ("EAS") system that detects unremoved EAS tags
on valuable or easily concealed merchandise and (iii) merchandise delivery and
stocking during non-peak hours. Additionally, all store and warehouse employees
are trained to monitor inventory shrink, and the Company uses outside consulting
services to monitor employee behavior. The Company has a full-time team of loss
prevention professionals and utilizes an anonymous call-in line to allow
employees to report instances of theft. The Company also has ongoing audits of
warehouse picking and receiving and an anonymous reward line for the reporting
of theft. The Company believes that these programs have enabled it to control
inventory shrink and will enable it to continue to do so.

    PURCHASING AND DISTRIBUTION:  The Company purchases approximately 96% of its
non-pharmacy merchandise directly from manufacturers. The Company distributes
approximately 87% of its non-pharmacy merchandise through the Company's
warehouse and receives direct-to-store deliveries for approximately 13% of its
non-pharmacy purchases. Direct-to-store deliveries are made for greeting cards,
photofinishing, convenience foods and beverages. The Company purchases from over
1,000 vendors. The Company believes that there are ample sources of supply for
the merchandise currently sold in its stores.

    The Company manages its purchasing through a combination of forward buying,
national buying and vendor discount ("deal") buying in ways in which it believes
maximizes its buying power. For example, the Company uses a computerized
forecasting and investment program that is designed to determine optimal forward
buying quantities before an announced or anticipated price increase has been
implemented. By forward buying, the Company stocks up on regularly carried items
when manufacturers temporarily reduce the cost of goods or when a price increase
has been announced or is anticipated.

    Prescription medications are generally purchased under a long-term supply
agreement. Inventory is shipped directly to stores on a consignment basis.

    The Company currently operates one warehouse, which is located in Maspeth,
Queens. The warehouse contains approximately 450,000 square feet devoted to
inventory. The close proximity of the warehouse to the stores allows the Company
to supply the stores frequently, thereby minimizing inventory and maximizing
distribution economies. The Company also owns a fleet of trucks and vans, which
it uses for deliveries from the warehouse to the stores.

                                       6

    ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION:  The Company regularly promotes key items at
reduced retail prices during four-week promotional periods. Store windows and
in-store signs are utilized to communicate savings and value to shoppers.
Additionally, over 65 million bags with the highly recognizable Duane Reade logo
are used by its customers each year, helping to promote the Company's name
throughout metropolitan New York. The Company also utilizes full color circulars
to announce new stores and heavily circulates them in local areas to attract
customers. Typically, a new store sells one to two times its regular volume
during a grand opening promotion, which generally lasts two to three weeks. The
Company generally does not rely heavily on the use of print or broadcast media
to promote its stores. Rather, because of its many high-traffic locations, the
Company typically relies on in-window displays as its primary method of
advertising. The Company uses radio advertising that focuses on the Company's
pharmacy business, highlighting services enhanced by the modern pharmacy
computer system, pharmacist accessibility and enhanced convenience. In the fall
of 1999, the Company introduced a "Dollar Rewards" card for frequent shoppers.
This card entitles the holder to additional discounts and price reductions. The
program has resulted in the issuance of over 750,000 cards through the end of
February 2000.

    MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS:  The Company currently has modern pharmacy
and inventory management information systems. The pharmacy system (PDX) has
reduced the processing time for electronic reimbursement approval for
prescriptions from Third Party Plan providers from 50 seconds to 7 seconds, and
the inventory management systems have allowed the Company to increase turns of
non-forward buy inventory in the warehouse. The Company utilizes point of sale
(POS) systems in its stores. These systems allow the Company to better control
pricing, inventory and shrink, while maximizing the benefits derived from the
other parts of its systems installation program. POS also provides sales
analysis that enables the Company to improve labor scheduling, and helps
optimize planogram design by allowing detailed analysis of stock-keeping unit
sales.

    During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company implemented a computer
assisted merchandise replenishment system for store orders sourced through its
distribution center. This system utilizes item specific sales history within
each store to produce "suggested" orders for each store which can be accepted or
modified by the stores before being released to the distribution center. The
system is fully automated and improves in-stock conditions at reduced inventory
levels. The system was installed in 40 stores at December 25, 1999 and is
scheduled to be fully operational in the complete chain during 2000.

    COMPETITION:  The Company's stores compete on the basis of, among other
things, convenience of location and store layout, product mix, selection,
customer service and price. The New York City drugstore market is highly
fragmented due to the complexities and costs of doing business in the most
densely populated area of the country. The diverse labor pool, local customer
needs and complex real estate market in New York City all favor regional chains
and independents that are familiar with the market. Duane Reade's store format
is tailored to meet all of these requirements and has proven successful in both
the business and residential neighborhoods of Manhattan as well as the outer
boroughs.

    Because of the difficulties of operating in densely populated areas, the New
York City drugstore market remains somewhat under-penetrated by national chains
as compared to the rest of the country. Nationwide, approximately 75% of the
drugstore market is controlled by chains, while in New York City that number is
less than 65%. There can be no assurance that such underpenetration will
continue.

    Duane Reade believes that it has significant competitive advantages over
independent drugstores in New York City, including purchasing economies of
scale, a centrally located warehouse that minimizes store inventory and
maximizes selling space, a full line of in stock, brand name merchandise and a
convenient store format. Major chain competitors in the New York City market
include CVS, Rite Aide, Walgreens and Genovese/Eckerd.

    GOVERNMENT REGULATION:  Duane Reade's stores and its distribution facility
are registered with the federal U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and are subject to
various state and local licensing requirements.

                                       7
<PAGE>
Each of Duane Reade's pharmacies and pharmacists located in New York are
licensed by the State of New York. The pharmacy and pharmacists employed at
Duane Reade's stores in Newark and Bayonne, New Jersey are licensed by the State
of New Jersey. In addition, Duane Reade has been granted cigarette tax stamping
licenses from the State of New York and from the City of New York which permit
Duane Reade to buy cigarettes directly from the manufacturers and stamp the
cigarettes themselves. Duane Reade's stores possess cigarette tax retail dealers
licenses issued by the State of New York, the City of New York and the State of
New Jersey.

    EMPLOYEES:  As of December 25, 1999, Duane Reade had approximately 5,000
employees, 90% of whom were full-time. Approximately 3,500 of the Company's
5,000 employees are represented by unions. Non-union employees include employees
at corporate headquarters, employees at Duane Reade's personnel office, store
management and most part-time employees. The distribution facility employees are
represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs and
Warehousemen and Helpers of America, Local 815. The Company's three year
contract with this union expires on August 31, 2002. Store employees are
represented by the Allied Trade Council and as a result of the Rock Bottom
Acquisition, certain stores are represented by the National Health and Human
Services Employees Union AFL-CIO, Local 1199 ("Local 1199") and Local 340A New
York Joint Board. The Company's contract with the Allied Trade Council expires
August 31, 2001. The contract with Local 340A New York Joint Board expires
September 21, 2002. The Company is in the process of negotiating an initial
contract with Local 1199. Duane Reade believes that its relations with its
employees are good.

    TRADEMARKS:  The name "Duane Reade" and the "DR" logo are registered
trademarks. The Company believes that it has developed strong brand awareness
within the New York City area. As a result, the Company regards the Duane Reade
logo as a valuable asset.

    In addition, in connection with the Rock Bottom acquisition, Duane Reade
acquired the "Rock Bottom" name, the "Rock Bottom" logo and "RXCELLENT SERVICE
and Design," each of which are registered trademarks.

(3)  As used herein, "EBITDA" means earnings before interest, income taxes,
     depreciation, amortization, extraordinary charge, nonrecurring charges and
    other non-cash items (primarily deferred rents). Management believes that
    EBITDA, as presented, represents a useful measure of assessing the
    performance of the Company's ongoing operating activities as it reflects the
    earnings trends of the Company without the impact of certain non-cash
    charges. Targets and positive trends in EBITDA are used as the performance
    measure for determining management's bonus compensation; EBITDA is also
    utilized by the Company's creditors in assessing debt covenant compliance.
    The Company understands that, while EBITDA is frequently used by security
    analysts in the evaluation of companies, it is not necessarily comparable to
    other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential
    inconsistencies in the method of calculation. EBITDA is not intended as an
    alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of
    liquidity, nor an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's
    operating performance nor any other measure of performance in conformity
    with GAAP.

    A reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA for each period included
above is set forth below (dollars in thousands):

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

    The following should be read in connection with the consolidated financial
statements of the Company and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this
report.

GENERAL

    The Company generates revenues primarily through sales of OTC drugs and
prescription pharmaceutical products, health and beauty care products, food and
beverage items, tobacco products, cosmetics, housewares, hosiery, greeting
cards, photofinishing, photo supplies and seasonal merchandise. Health and
beauty care products, including OTC drugs, represent the largest of the
Company's product categories. The Company's primary costs and expenses consist
of (i) inventory costs, (ii) labor expenses and (iii) occupancy costs.

    The Company had sales per square foot of $968 and $1,040 in fiscal 1999 and
fiscal 1998, respectively. The Company believes that sales per square foot is a
useful measure of comparing the Company's performance to that of its competitors
because it is a measure of a store's sales productivity. The Company currently
expects that its sales per square foot may decline as it continues with its plan
to increase new store openings during fiscal 2000. The opening of such
additional stores may result in a decline in sales per square foot principally
because (i) the average square footage for new stores will often be greater than
that of the existing store base and (ii) new stores generally take some time to
reach a mature level of sales. The Company believes that its competitors in the
industry experience increases and decreases in sales per square foot for similar
reasons. Over the next two years, the Company plans to open approximately 30 to
40 stores, primarily in New York City.

    The Company includes stores that have been in operation for at least
13 months for purposes of calculating comparable store sales figures.

    In June 1997, the DLJ Entities and certain of its affiliates acquired
approximately 91.5% of the outstanding capital stock of the Company from Bain
Capital and certain other selling securityholders (the "Recapitalization"). Upon
consummation of such purchase, the Company reclassified all of its outstanding
capital stock (then consisting of four classes) into one class of common stock,
$0.01 par value per share. In February 1998, the Company successfully completed
an initial public offering (the "Offering") of its common stock.

    The Company's primary assets are its ownership of 99% of the outstanding
partnership interest of Duane Reade, a New York general partnership ("Duane
Reade") and ownership of all of the outstanding common stock of DRI I Inc.
("DRI"). DRI owns the remaining 1% partnership interest in Duane Reade.
Substantially all of the operations of the Company are conducted through Duane
Reade. In August 1999, the Company established two new subsidiaries, Duane Reade
International ("International") and Duane Reade Realty ("Realty"). Duane Reade
distributed to the Company and DRI all rights, title, and interest in all its
trademarks, trade names and all other intellectual properties ("IP"). In turn
the Company and DRI made a capital contribution of the IP to International. This
change was to create a controlled system to manage and exploit the IP and
various leases separate and apart from the retail operations. In addition, Duane
Reade distributed some of its store leases to the Company and DRI, which in turn
made a capital contribution of these leases to Realty. In addition, Realty is
the lessee under certain store leases entered into after its creation. Realty
subleases to Duane Reade the properties subject to those leases.

FISCAL 1999 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1998

    Net sales in 1999 were $839.8 million, an increase of 43.0% over 1998 net
sales of $587.4 million. The increase was due to increased comparable store
sales of 8.9% and the inclusion of 33 stores opened during 1998 for the entire
1999 period and 21 new stores opened in 1999. The increase in comparable store
sales was primarily attributable to increased pharmacy sales, which increased to
31.9% of total sales in 1999 compared to 28.3% of total sales in 1998. Pharmacy
sales have followed the general industry trend reflecting accelerated growth
rates versus front end sales.

    Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 74.0% for 1999 from
73.4% for 1998, resulting in a decrease in gross profit margin to 26.0% for 1999
from 26.6% for 1998. The decrease in gross margin resulted principally from
pharmacy sales making up a greater percentage of total sales and the impact of
lower gross margins in the Rock Bottom stores acquired in September 1998.

    Selling, general and administrative expenses were $135.8 million or 16.1% of
net sales and $94.6 million or 16.1% of net sales in 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The large number of new and immature stores, along with the
increased proportion of higher cost pharmacy business, has offset the favorable
leveraging of expenses associated with the Company's sales growth.

    Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in 1999 and 1998 was
$10.5 million and $7.1 million, respectively. The increase in amortization
resulted principally from the amortization of goodwill and identifiable
intangibles related to the Rock Bottom stores acquisition in September of 1998
as well as the acquisition of a portion of the Loves Stores chain in May of 1999
and increases in the amortization of customer lists and lease acquisition costs
for pharmacy acquisitions during 1999.

    The increase in depreciation from $7.0 million in 1998 to $10.9 million in
1999 resulted principally from depreciation on the 21 stores opened during 1999,
a full year of depreciation expense in 1999 on the 33 stores opened during 1998
and 29 Rock Bottom stores acquired in September of 1998 compared to a partial
year of depreciation expense in 1998.

                                       14
<PAGE>
    Store pre-opening expenses decreased from $3.3 million in 1998 to
$1.5 million in 1999 due to the opening of 21 new stores in 1999 compared to 33
in 1998.

    Net interest expense increased to $29.3 million in 1999 from $25.6 million
in 1998. The increase in interest expense was principally due to higher levels
of average borrowing and higher interest rates during 1999.

    The Company's income before income taxes increased 60.9% to $30.2 million in
1999 from $18.8 million in 1998.

    During 1999, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $10.5 million due
to the reversal of deferred tax asset valuation reserves which were partially
offset by the income tax provision for the current year's income. The Company
was not required to record an income tax provision in 1998 as it had no taxable
income and its net operating loss carry forwards and related deferred tax asset
had a valuation reserve of 100%.

    During 1998 the Company recorded a $23.6 million extraordinary charge
related to the early extinguishment of debt.

    The Company recorded net income of $40.7 million in 1999 versus a net loss
of $4.8 million in 1998. The increase of $45.5 million is a result of higher
gross profit as a result of higher sales, the extraordinary charge recorded in
1998, and the income tax benefit recorded in 1999, partially offset by higher
selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization and depreciation
expense.

FISCAL 1998 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1997

    Net sales in 1998 were $587.4 million, an increase of 36.7% over 1997 net
sales of $429.8 million. The increase was due to increased comparable store
sales of 6.5% and the inclusion of seven stores opened during 1997 for the
entire 1998 period, 33 new stores opened in 1998, and 28 stores purchased in the
Rock Bottom Acquisition. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily
attributable to increased pharmacy sales, which increased to 28.3% of total
sales in 1998 compared to 25.1% of total sales in 1997.

    Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 73.4% for 1998 from
75.0% for 1997, resulting in an increase in gross profit margin to 26.6% for
1998 from 25.0% for 1997. The increase in gross margin resulted principally from
contribution from higher margin merchandise such as greeting cards, photo
finishing, cosmetics, vitamins, generic drugs and private label products.

    Selling, general and administrative expenses were $94.6 million or 16.1% of
net sales and $65.4 million or 15.2% of net sales in 1998 and 1997,
respectively. The percentage increase in 1998 compared to 1997 resulted
principally from higher selling expenses related to higher store salaries as a
percentage of net sales and increases in other store-related expenses
(principally attributable to new stores during the early months of operation) as
well as approximately $1.4 million of nonrecurring transition costs related to
the integration of the Rock Bottom stores during the fourth quarter of 1998.
Transition costs related to the Rock Botton Acquisition include redundant costs
incurred related to the occupancy costs of an additional warehouse, the costs
related to maintaining duplicate warehouse and point of sale systems,
administrative payroll costs for positions during the integration period and
expenses incurred to convert the stores to the Duane Reade format.

    Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in 1998 and 1997 was
$7.1 million and $5.3 million, respectively. The increase in amortization
resulted principally from the amortization of goodwill and identifiable
intangibles related to the Rock Bottom stores as well as increases in the
amortization of customer lists and lease acquisition costs for pharmacy
acquisitions during 1998.

    The increase in depreciation from $3.5 million in 1997 to $7.0 million in
1998 resulted principally from depreciation on the 33 stores opened during 1998,
a full year of depreciation expense in 1998 on the seven

                                       15
<PAGE>
stores opened during 1997 compared to a partial year of depreciation expense in
1997 and depreciation expense on the 28 Rock Bottom stores.

    Store pre-opening expenses increased from $767,000 in 1997 to $3.3 million
in 1998 due to the opening of 33 new stores in 1998 compared to seven in 1997.

    Net interest expense decreased 25.7% to $25.6 million in 1998 from
$34.5 million in 1997. The decrease in interest expense was principally due to
the impact of the debt refinancing completed during February 1998 in connection
with the Refinancing Plan (as defined) which resulted in lower overall debt
levels and a reduction of interest rates.

    The Company's income before extraordinary charge increased by $33.5 million
to $18.8 million for 1998 from a net loss of $14.7 million for 1997 as a result
of the $12.7 million nonrecurring charges in the prior year period; decreased
interest expense; and increased sales and gross profit margin, partially offset
by increased selling, general and administrative expenses; store pre-opening
expenses; depreciation and amortization. Including the extraordinary charge
related to the early extinguishment of debt, the net loss for 1998 was
$4.8 million.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    In February 1998, the Company successfully completed the Offering, which was
part of a plan to refinance all of the Company's then existing indebtedness (the
"Refinancing Plan") in order to enhance the Company's financial flexibility to
pursue growth opportunities and implement capital improvements. The Refinancing
Plan resulted in a reduction in the Company's overall indebtedness, a
simplification of the Company's capital structure and access to additional
borrowings. The principal components of the Refinancing Plan were: (i) the sale
by the Company of 6.7 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of
approximately $102 million; (ii) the execution of a new secured credit agreement
(the "Existing Credit Agreement"), which provided for borrowings up to
approximately $160 million ($130 million of term loans and up to $30 million of
revolving loans); (iii) the issuance of $80 million aggregate principal amount
of the Company's 9 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 (the "Senior Notes")
for net proceeds of approximately $77 million; (iv) the repayment of all
outstanding borrowings under the Company's former credit agreement (the "Former
Credit Agreement"), the outstanding principal amount of which was $89.8 million
as of December 27, 1997; (v) the redemption of the Company's outstanding 15%
Zero Coupon Senior Subordinated Notes due 2004 (the "Zero Coupon Notes"); and
(vi) the redemption of the Company's outstanding 12% Senior Notes due 2002 (the
"12% Senior Notes").

    On August 14, 1998, in connection with the Rock Bottom Acquisition, the
Existing Credit Agreement was amended to allow for increased term loan
borrowings of $10 million. On September 11, 1998, also in connection with the
Rock Bottom Acquisition, the Existing Credit Agreement was amended and restated
to increase available term loan borrowings by $70 million, bringing the total
permitted borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement to $240 million
($210 million of term loans and up to $30 million of revolving loans).

    On March 17, 1999, in connection with additional planned pharmacy
acquisitions and capital spending requirements, the Existing Credit Agreement
was amended and restated again to increase available borrowings by $35 million
to $275 million ($235 million of term loans and $40 million of revolving loans).
On December 16, 1999 the Existing Credit Agreement was amended to increase
permitted revolving loan borrowings to $60 million of which $40 million was
actually made available to the Company at December 25, 1999.

    On January 7, 2000 and February 11, 2000 available revolver borrowings were
increased by $6.0 million and $4.0 million respectively, bringing total
available revolver borrowings to $50 million.

    On March 17, 2000, in order to provide additional availability of capital to
the Company for general working capital needs, the Existing Credit Agreement was
amended and restated to permit available term

                                       16
<PAGE>
loan borrowings to increase by up to $30 million of which $10 million was
actually made available to the Company. In addition, available revolver
borrowings were increased by $5.0 million, bringing total available borrowings
under the Existing Credit Agreement to $300 million ($245 million of term loans
and $55 million of revolver loans). The additional $10 million proceeds of the
term loans were used to reduce revolver borrowings.

    Working capital was $120.0 million and $90.0 million as of December 25, 1999
and December 26, 1998, respectively. The increase is primarily due to increases
in inventory related to the opening of 21 additional stores during 1999, the
reversal of the valuation reserve on the current portion of the deferred tax
asset and increases in accounts receivable due to additional volume.

    The Company's EBITDA increased by $23.7 million or 38.3% to $85.8 million in
1999 compared to 1998. EBITDA as a percentage of sales was 10.2% in 1999 as
compared to 10.6% in 1998.

    For fiscal 1999, net cash provided by operating activities was
$16.9 million, compared to $5.5 million for fiscal 1998. The primary reason for
the increase in net cash provided was increased cash earnings partially offset
by increases in working capital and decreases in other liabilities associated
with new store additions and the timing of disbursements.

    For fiscal 1999, net cash used in investing activities was $45.3 million,
compared to $111.6 million for fiscal 1998. Net cash used in investing
activities in 1999 was due to capital expenditures of $37.2 million primarily
related to the opening and remodeling of new and renovated stores and capital
expenditures related to the conversion of Rock Bottom stores to the Duane Reade
format, $8.5 million for lease acquisition and pharmacy file acquisition costs,
$10.3 million to purchase six Love's stores and a Pasteur Pharmacy offset by
proceeds of $10.7 million from the sale of assets. Net cash used in investing
activities in 1998 was due to the Rock Bottom acquisition and capital
expenditures related to the opening of new stores, store remodeling, lease and
pharmacy file acquisition costs.

    For fiscal 1999, net cash provided by financing activities was
$28.6 million, compared to $106.6 million for fiscal 1998. The net cash provided
in 1999 was primarily due to additional borrowings under credit facilities. The
net cash provided in 1998 was primarily from the proceeds of the public offering
and additional bank borrowings.

    The Company's capital requirements primarily result from opening and
stocking new stores and from the continuing development of management
information systems. The Company believes that there are significant
opportunities to open additional stores, and currently plans to open
approximately 30 to 40 stores during the next two years. The Company expects to
spend approximately $25 million in fiscal 2000 on capital expenditures primarily
for new and replacement stores and an additional $5 million for lease and
pharmacy file acquisition costs.. Working capital is also required to support
inventory for the Company's existing stores. Historically, the Company has been
able to lease its store locations.

    Leases for seven of the Company's stores that generated approximately 3.9%
of the Company's net sales for fiscal 1999 are scheduled to expire before the
end of fiscal 2001. The Company believes that it will be able to renew such
leases on economically favorable terms or, alternatively, find other
economically attractive locations to lease.

    As of December 25, 1999, approximately 3,500 of the Company's approximately
5,000 employees were represented by various labor unions and were covered by
collective bargaining agreements. Pursuant to the terms of such collective
bargaining agreements, the Company is required to pay certain annual increases
in salary and benefits to such employees. The Company does not believe that such
increases will have a material impact on the Company's liquidity or results of
operations.

    The Company believes that, based on current levels of operations and
anticipated growth, cash flow from operations, together with other available
sources of funds, including additional borrowings under the Existing Credit
Agreement, will be adequate for at least the next two years to make required
payments of

                                       17

principal and interest on the Company's indebtedness, to fund anticipated
capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to comply with the
terms of its debt agreements. As of December 25, 1999, the Company had borrowed
approximately $28.5 million under the revolving portion of its bank credit
facility and had approximately $11.1 million of remaining availability. The
ability of the Company to meet its debt service obligations and reduce its total
debt will be dependent upon the future performance of the Company and its
subsidiaries which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial,
business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of
which are beyond the Company's control. In addition, there can be no assurance
that the Company's operating results, cash flow and capital resources will be
sufficient for repayment of its indebtedness in the future. Substantially all of
the Company's borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement bear interest at
floating rates; therefore, the Company's financial condition will be affected by
the changes in prevailing interest rates. The Company has entered into an
interest rate protection agreement for $65.0 million of its floating rate debt
that caps LIBOR rates at 6.5%. Theis agreement expires in November 2000 (See
note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements).

TAX BENEFITS FROM NET OPERATING LOSSES

    At December 25, 1999, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards
("NOLs") of approximately $68 million, which are due to expire in the years 2007
through 2018. These NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income through
2018 and thereby reduce or eliminate the Company's federal income taxes
otherwise payable. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
imposes significant limitations on the utilization of NOLs in the event of an
"ownership change," as defined in Section 382 of the Code (the "Section 382
Limitation"). The Section 382 Limitation is an annual limitation on the amount
of pre-ownership change NOLs that a corporation may use to offset its
post-ownership change income. The Section 382 Limitation is calculated by
multiplying the value of a corporation's stock immediately before an ownership
change by the long-term tax-exempt rate (as published by the Internal Revenue
Service). Generally, an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation if
the aggregate increase in the percentage of stock ownership (by value) of that
corporation by one or more 5% shareholders (including certain groups of
shareholders who in the aggregate own at least 5% of that corporation's stock)
exceeds 50 percentage points over a three-year testing period. The
Recapitalization caused the Company to experience an ownership change. As a
result, the Company currently is subject to an annual Section 382 Limitation of
approximately $8.5 million in 2000 and 2001 and approximately $5.1 million from
2002 to 2007 on the amount of NOLs generated prior to the Recapitalization that
the Company may utilize to offset future taxable income. NOLs generated by the
Company since the Recapitalization (approximately $18 million) are not subject
to the Section 382 Limitation and may be used to offset future taxable income.
There can be no assurance that any NOLs will be able to be used by the Company
to offset future taxable income or that such NOLs will not become subject to
limitation due to future ownership changes. However, based on the Company's
recent and projected performance, management believes that it is more likely
than not that the full value of the NOL's will be realized.

SEASONALITY

    In general, sales of drugstores items such as prescription drugs, OTC drugs
and health and beauty care products exhibit limited seasonality in the
aggregate, but do vary by product category. Quarterly results are primarily
affected by the timing of new store openings and the sale of seasonal products.
In view of the Company's expansion of seasonal merchandising, the Company
expects slightly greater revenue sensitivity relating to seasonality in the
future.

INFLATION

    The Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on results
of operations for the Company during the three years ended December 25, 1999.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

    FASB Statement No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities" requires that derivative instruments such as options, forward
contracts and swaps be recorded as assets and liabilities at fair value and
provides guidance for recognition of changes in fair value depending on the
reason for holding the derivative. The Company does not presently have
significant transactions involving derivative instruments, but may do so in the
future. The Company is required to adopt Statement No. 133 for the first quarter
of 2001 and may adopt it earlier.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MARKET RISK

    The financial results of the Company are subject to risk from interest rate
fluctuations on debt which carries variable interest rates. Variable rate debt
outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement was approximately $256 million
at December 25, 1999, which is somewhat lower than the Company expects its
outstanding variable rate debt to be during the next twelve months. The
anticipated outstanding balances, however, are not expected to be materially
greater than at December 25, 1999. Based on the December 25, 1999 outstanding
balances, a 0.50% change in interest rates would affect pre-tax annual results
of operations by approximately $1.3 million. The Company also has $80 million of
Senior Notes outstanding at December 25, 1999. These notes, which bear interest
at a fixed annual rate of 9 1/4%, are not subject to risk from interest rate
fluctuations.

    The principal objective of the Company's investment management activities is
to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and to
facilitate the funding needs of the Company. As part of its investment
management, the Company may use derivative financial products such as interest
rate hedges and interest rate swaps. During 1998, in connection with the
Existing Credit Agreement requirements, the Company entered into an interest
rate protection agreement for $65.0 million of its floating rate debt. This
agreement expires in November of 2000 and caps the LIBOR rate at 6.5% (see
note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements).

of Duane Reade Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December 25, 1999
and December 26, 1998 and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the 52 week periods ended December 25, 1999, December 26, 1998 and
December 27, 1997 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

                        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    Duane Reade Inc. (the "Company") was formed on June 16, 1992 for the purpose
of acquiring Daboco, Inc. ("Daboco"). The acquisition took place on
September 25, 1992. Daboco and DRI I Inc. ("DRI"), a subsidiary of Daboco, were
general partners in Duane Reade, which operates retail drugstores (149 at
December 25, 1999) in the New York metropolitan area.

    During June 1997, the Company entered into a recapitalization agreement (the
"Agreement") with its stockholders ("Stockholders") and DLJ Merchant Banking
Partners II, L.P. ("DLJMBPII") and certain of its affiliates (the "DLJMBP
Entities") as investors ("Investors"). The Agreement provided for (i) the
purchase by Investors from the Stockholders of substantially all their stock
holdings in the Company, (ii) a conversion of all of the outstanding shares of
the Company into a newly authorized class of Class B common stock and (iii) the
creation of a new authorized class of preferred stock which will carry the
rights and preferences granted by the Company's board of directors when issued.

    Shares were converted as follows:

Common and Common Class A...................................        28/1
Common Class P and Common Class P-1.........................       355/1
</TABLE>

    In addition, because of the change in control, the Company was obligated to
and made offers to repurchase all outstanding 12% Senior Notes due 2002 and Zero
Coupon Notes at 101% of the principal amount or accreted value thereof,
respectively. Such offers expired on September 12, 1997. The Company repurchased
an aggregate of $107,000 principal amount of 12% Senior Notes due 2002 and
$9,000 of Zero Coupon Notes pursuant to the offers.

    On January 14, 1998, the Company effected an 8.326 reverse stock split of
its common stock. All references to common stock amounts, shares and per share
data included herein have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to such
reverse stock split.

    In February 1998, the Company successfully completed an initial public
offering of its stock which was part of a plan to refinance all of the Company's
existing indebtedness in order to enhance the Company's financial flexibility.
In connection with this plan, Daboco was merged with and into the Company.

    Significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements are as follows:

    PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:  The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain prior year amounts have
been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

    The Company has no assets or operations other than its investment in its
subsidiary guarantors. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements
present the combined assets and operations of the subsidiary guarantors.

    REPORTING YEAR:  The fiscal year for the Company is the 52/53 week reporting
period ending on the last Saturday in December.

    RECEIVABLES:  Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from various
insurance companies and governmental agencies under third party payment plans
for prescription sales and amounts due from

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
vendors, a majority of which relate to promotional programs. The Company has not
provided an allowance for doubtful accounts as its historical write-offs have
been immaterial. The Company reflects promotional allowances from vendors as a
reduction of cost of sales or advertising expense, when such allowances are
earned. The carrying value of the Company's receivables approximate fair value
given the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.

    INVENTORIES AND COST OF SALES:  During the third quarter of 1998, the
Company changed its inventory costing method from the last-in, first-out retail
dollar value method (LIFO) to the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The effect
of this change was immaterial to the accompanying financial statements.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. When appropriate,
provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or damaged inventory. In 1998, the
Company entered into an arrangement with a pharmaceutical distributor whereby
prescription drug inventory is shipped directly to the Company's stores, with
payment due only when inventory is sold. On November 19, 1999 the Company
terminated this arrangement and entered into a new arrangement with a different
pharmaceutical distributor, its primary supplier of pharmaceutical products.
Under the new arrangement, prescription drug inventory continues to be shipped
directly to the Company's stores. Payment is made twice per month for inventory
sold subject to a $30 million cap on inventory classified as shipped on
consignment. Such inventory is accounted for as consigned merchandise and is not
recorded on the Company's balance sheet. As of December 25, 1999 and
December 26, 1998, the cost of such inventory was approximately $30 million and
$15 million, respectively. Cost of sales includes distribution and occupancy
costs.

    PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT:  Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over
estimated useful lives of assets as follows:

<TABLE>
<S>                            <C>
Buildings and improvements...  30 years
Furniture, fixtures and        5-10 years
  equipment..................
Computer Equipment...........  7 years
Leasehold improvements.......  Life of lease or, if shorter, the remaining asset life
</TABLE>

    OTHER ASSETS:  Deferred financing costs which arose in connection with
borrowings under the Former Credit Agreement and with the issuance of the 12%
Senior Notes and the Zero Coupon Notes are amortized using the straight-line
method, the results of which are not materially different from the interest
method, over the term of the respective debt issue. Deferred financing costs
which arose in connection with the Existing Credit Agreement and the Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2008 are amortized using the interest method, over the
term of the debt.

    Pharmacy file and lease acquisition costs are amortized over 5 years and the
remaining life of the lease, respectively.

    Systems development costs, consisting principally of costs relating to the
new management information systems, are amortized using the straight-line method
over a period of seven years.

    INTANGIBLE ASSETS: Goodwill is amortized on the straight-line method over
40 years. The carrying value of goodwill is periodically reviewed and evaluated
by the Company based principally on its expected future undiscounted operating
cash flows. Should such evaluation result in the Company concluding that the
carrying amount of goodwill has been impaired, an appropriate write-down would
be made.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    PRE-OPENING EXPENSES:  Store pre-opening costs, other than capital
expenditures, are expensed when incurred.

    INCOME TAXES:  Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method
prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109.

    RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS:  FASB Statement No. 133 "Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" requires that derivative
instruments such as options, forward contracts and swaps be recorded as assets
and liabilities at fair value and provides guidance for recognition of changes
in fair value depending on the reason for holding the derivative. The Company
does not presently have significant transactions involving derivative
instruments, but may do so in the future. The Company is required to adopt
Statement No. 133 for the first quarter of 2001.

    USE OF ESTIMATES:  The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues, costs and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

    NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE:  Basic earnings (loss) per share is
computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share gives effect to all dilutive
potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares
include shares issuable upon exercise of the Company's stock options.

    Potential common shares relating to options to purchase common stock were
not included in the weighted average number of shares for 1997 because their
effect would have been anti-dilutive.

2. REFINANCING PLAN AND INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING

    In February 1998, the Company successfully completed an initial public
offering of its stock which was part of a plan to refinance all of the Company's
existing indebtedness (the "Refinancing Plan") in order to enhance the Company's
financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities and implement capital
improvements. The Refinancing Plan resulted in a reduction in the Company's
overall indebtedness, a simplification of the Company's capital structure and
access to additional borrowings. The principal components of the Refinancing
Plan were: (i) the sale by the Company of 6.7 million shares of common stock for
net proceeds of approximately $102 million; (ii) the execution of a new secured
credit agreement (the "Existing Credit Agreement") which provided for borrowings
up to approximately $160 million ($130 million of term loans and up to
$30 million of revolving loans); (iii) the issuance of $80 million in aggregate
principal amount of the Company's 9 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 (the
"Senior Notes") for net proceeds of approximately $77 million (the "Notes
Offering"); (iv) the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the Company's
former credit agreement (the "Former Credit Agreement"); (v) the redemption of
the Company's outstanding 15% Zero Coupon Senior Subordinated Notes; due 2004
(the "Zero Coupon Notes") and (vi) the redemption of the Company's outstanding
12% Senior Notes due 2002 (the "12% Senior Notes"). The interest rates under the
Existing Credit Agreement are approximately the same as interest rates under the
Former Credit Agreement.

3. ACQUISITIONS

    During 1999, the Company purchased a portion of the operating assets (six
stores including inventory and leases) of Love's Pharmacies, a chain of drug
stores operating 17 stores in New York City and substantially all of the assets
of a Pasteur Drug Store (one store including inventory and lease). The aggregate
purchase price paid for the two acquisitions was $15.3 million. The transaction
was accounted for as a purchase, with the purchase price being allocated to
inventory ($1.8 million), property and equipment ($.1million), identifiable
intangibles ($1.4 million) and goodwill ($12.4 million) net of reserves for
expenses and liabilities assumed ($.4 million). The operations of the acquired
Love's and Pasteur stores have been included in the consolidated statement of
income from the date of acquisition. The unaudited pro forma sales of the
Company had these acquisitions occurred at the beginning of 1998 are
$612 million for 1998 and $851 million for 1999. The unaudited pro forma income
before extraordinary items, net income and earnings per share for 1998 and 1999
would not be materially different than as reported in the consolidated statement
of income. In management's opinion, the unaudited pro forma combined results are
not necessarily indicative of the actual results that would have occurred had
the acquisitions been consumated at the beginning of 1998 or of future results
of the combined operations.

    On September 11, 1998, the Company purchased substantially all of the
operating assets (including inventory and leases) of Rock Bottom Stores, Inc., a
health and beauty aid retailer operating 38 stores primarily in the outer
boroughs of New York City (the "Rock Bottom Acquisition"). The purchase price
paid was $64.9 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The
acquisition, accounted for under the purchase method, was financed with
$80 million in additional term loans under the Existing Credit Agreement. During
1999, the Company finalized the sale of acquired non-compatible closeout
inventory and recorded a $7.7 million adjustment to increase goodwill for the
difference between estimated and actual markdowns. Additionally, the Company
finalized its retrofit program for acquired stores and recorded a write-down of
$9.6 million to adjust the non recoverable carrying value of disposed furniture
and fixtures as additional goodwill. The Company is currently a party to
arbitration proceedings arising out of disputes with the seller over the
purchase price, and related matters. The purchase price (as adjusted) was
allocated to inventory ($12.0 million), property held for sale ($6.7 million),
property and equipment ($7.3 million), identifiable intangibles ($5.2 million)
and goodwill ($46.3 million) net of reserves for expenses, store closings and
liabilities assumed ($12.6 million).

    Ten stores acquired as part of the acquisition were originally designated
for sale or closure as of December 26, 1998. These stores were operated for a
period of time after the acquisition. During 1999, six of the stores were sold
with no resultant gain or loss. One of the stores was turned back to the
landlord and the Company was released from the lease obligation. Two of the
stores have been closed, one of which has been subleased. The remaining store is
still being operated and is expected to be closed in 2000. The results of the
operations of these ten stores were not included in the Company's operating
statements through September, 1999 (one year after acquisition). Their results,
including the proceeds from asset sales, were included in goodwill which, during
the year, resulted in an increase in goodwill of $1.3 million. The one store
remaining in operation has been included in the results of operations since
September, 1999.

    During 1999, the Company sold the warehouse for net proceeds of

profit in the consolidated statement of operations.

    The Company sold six stores classified as held for sale during 1999 for net
proceeds of $3.5 million. The difference between the net proceeds and the
recorded amount was adjusted to goodwill and therefore resulted in no gain or
loss. The remaining store classified as held for sale at December 26, 1998 was
not sold during 1999 and those assets have been reclassified as operating
assets.

    EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT:  In connection with the Refinancing Plan
(Note 2), the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with an affiliate of the
DLJMB Entities and various financial institutions providing for term loans of
$130 million and a revolving credit facility of $30 million. The Existing Credit
Agreement is comprised of (i) a revolving credit facility of up to $30 million,
which includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for
same-day notice swingline loans, (ii) Tranche A term loans of $50 million and
(iii) Tranche B term loans of $80 million. The proceeds of loans under the
Existing Credit Agreement may also be used to fund the Company's working capital
needs, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including the
issuance of letters of credit.

    On August 14, 1998, in connection with the Rock Bottom Acquisition, (see
note 3 to consolidated financial statements), the Existing Credit Agreement was
amended to allow for increased Tranche C term loan borrowings of $10 million. On
September 11, 1998, also in connection with the Rock Bottom Acquisition, the
Existing Credit Agreement was amended and restated to increase Tranche C term
loans by $70 million, bringing the total permitted borrowings to $240 million
($210 million of term loans and up to $30 million of revolving loans). Proceeds
from the additional term loan were used for the $64.9 million purchase price and
for additional working capital needs and capital expenditures in connection with
the acquisition.

9. DEBT (CONTINUED)

    On March 17, 1999 the Existing Credit Agreement was amended and restated to
increase available borrowings by $35 million, bringing total permitted
borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement to $275 million ($235 million of
term loans and $40 million of revolving loans). On December 16, 1999 the
Existing Credit Agreement was amended to increase permitted revolving loan
borrowings to $60.0 million of which $40 million was made available to the
Company at December 25, 1999.

    As of December 25, 1999, borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit
facility were $28.5 million (classified as a noncurrent liability); in addition,
$0.4 million in letters of credit had been issued. The revolving credit facility
expires on February 15, 2004.

    At December 25, 1999, the aggregate maturities of debt are as follows
(dollars in thousands):

</TABLE>

    The weighted average interest rate on all borrowings under the Existing
Credit Agreement at December 25th, 1999 was 8.7%.

    Borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement bear interest annually, at
the Company's option, at a rate based on either (i) an "Alternate Base Rate"
(defined as, generally, the higher of the Federal Funds Rate, as published by
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 0.5%, or the administrative agent's
prime lending rate) plus (a) in the case of Tranche A term loans or revolving
credit loans, 1.75%; (b) in the case of Tranche B term loans, 2.0%; (c) in the
case of Tranche C term loans, 2.25%; or (ii) a reserve-adjusted "LIBO" rate,
plus (x) in the case of Tranche A term loans or revolving credit loans, 2.50%;
through January 2000 and 2.00% effective February 17, 2000 (y) in the case of
Tranche B term loans, 2.75%; or (z) in the case of Tranche C term loans, 3.00%.
In addition, the Company must pay a fee on the face amount of each letter of
credit outstanding at a rate equal to the LIBO margin. The Company has entered
into an interest rate protection agreement for $65 million of its floating rate
debt. This agreement caps the "LIBO" rate used in up to $65 million of
borrowings under the Credit Agreement at 6.5%. This agreement expires in
November of 2000.

    Borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement are guaranteed by, and
secured by a pledge of all of the capital stock and assets of, the Company's
subsidiaries.

    The Existing Credit Agreement contains various covenants that limit or
restrict, among other things, subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence of
indebtedness, the creation of liens, transactions with affiliates, restricted
payments, investments and acquisitions, mergers, consolidations, dissolutions,
asset sales, dividends, distributions, and certain other transactions and
business activities by the Company.

    Financial performance covenants include interest coverage, leverage ratios,
minimum net worth requirements and fixed charge coverage. At December 25, 1999,
the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants in the Existing Credit
Agreement.

9. DEBT (CONTINUED)
    Subsequent to the December 25th, 1999 year end date, the following changes
were made to the Existing Credit Agreement:

    On January 7, 2000 and February 11, 2000 available revolver borrowings were
increased by $6.0 million and $4.0 million respectively, bringing total
available revolver borrowings to $50 million.

    On March 17, 2000, in order to provide additional availability of capital to
the Company for general working capital needs, the Existing Credit Agreement was
amended and restated to permit available term loan borrowings to increase by up
to $30 million of which $10 million was actually made available to the Company.
In addition, available revolver borrowings were increased by $5.0 million,
bringing total available borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement to
$300 million ($245 million of term loans and $55 million of revolver loans). The
additional $10 million proceeds of the term loans were used to reduce the
revolver borrowings.

    FORMER CREDIT AGREEMENT:  On September 30, 1997, the Company entered into
the Former Credit Agreement with an affiliate of the DLJMB Entities and various
financial institutions providing for a term loan of $65.5 million and a
revolving credit facility of $30 million. All amounts outstanding were repaid in
full in February 1998 in connection with the Company's Refinancing Plan (see
Note 2).

    9 1/4% SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE FEBRUARY 15, 2008:  In connection with
the Refinancing Plan (see Note 2) the Company issued $80 million aggregate
principal amount of Senior Notes, which bear interest at a rate of 9 1/4% per
annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on each February 15 and August 15
beginning on August 15, 1998. The Senior Notes will mature on February 15, 2008.
The Senior Notes represent senior subordinated unsecured obligations of the
Company. The Company's payment obligations under the Senior Notes are guaranteed
on a senior subordinated basis by all of the Company's present and future
subsidiaries.

    Prior to February 15, 2001 the Company is permitted to redeem up to 35% of
the Senior Notes at a redemption price of 109.25% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, with the net proceeds of one
or more public or private sales of common stock or preferred stock of the
Company, provided that at least 65% of the Senior Notes remain outstanding
immediately after the occurrence of any such redemption. At any time on or after
February 15, 2003, the Senior Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company,
in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 104.625% of the principal amount
thereof declining ratably to par of February 15, 2006.

    The indenture governing the Senior Notes (the "Senior Note Indenture")
provides that, in the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the Senior
Note Indenture) of the Company, the Company is required to make an offer to
purchase in cash all or any part of the outstanding Senior Notes at a price of
101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon to the date of repurchase.

    The Senior Note Indenture contains restrictive covenants that, among other
things, impose limitations on the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries
(i) to incur additional indebtedness, (ii) to merge, consolidate or sell or
dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, (iii) to issue certain
preferred stock, pay cash dividends or make other distributions on account of
the Company's equity interests, repurchase equity interests or subordinated
indebtedness and make certain other restricted payments, (iv) to create certain
liens, (v) to enter into transactions with affiliates and (vi) to sell assets.

10. CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS

    As of December 25, 1999, the present value of capital lease obligations was
$4.9 million (of which $1.9 million was payable during the next twelve months).
Such obligations are payable in monthly installments over three to five year
periods and bear interest at an average rate of 10.8%. At December 25, 1999 the
aggregate maturities of capitalized lease obligations are as follows (dollars in

December 27, 1997, respectively.

11. PREFERRED STOCK

    The Company's authorized preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, consists
of 5,000,000 shares of which no shares were issued or outstanding at
December 25, 1999.

    The Company's Board of Directors has the authority, without further action
of the shareholders of the Company, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or
more series and to fix or determine the designations, preferences, rights and
any qualifications, limitation or restrictions of the share of each such series
thereof, including the dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights,
voting rights, terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions),
redemption price or prices, liquidation preferences, and the number of shares
constituting any series.

    The Company's Board of Directors, without shareholder approval, can issue
preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect
the voting power of holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock,
while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions
and other corporate purposes, may have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or
preventing a change in control of the Company.

12. COMMON STOCK

    The Company's authorized common stock, par value $.01 per share, consists of
75,000,000 shares of which 17,202,955 shares were issued and outstanding at
December 25, 1999.

    Holders of the common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of
record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. The issued and
outstanding shares of common stock are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred
stock, the holders of outstanding shares of common stock are entitled to receive
dividends out of assets legally available therefor at such times and in such
amounts as the board of directors may from time to time determine. The shares of
common stock are not redeemable or convertible, and the holders thereof have no
preemptive or subscription rights to purchase any securities of the Company.

    Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of
shares of common stock are entitled to receive on a pro rata basis the assets of
the Company which are legally available for

The Company did not record a provision for income taxes during the 52 weeks
ended December 26, 1998 or the 52 weeks ended December 27, 1997 due to the fact
that it had no taxable income for these years and its deferred tax assets
related to its net operating loss carry forwards had a 100% valuation reserve.

    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between book and tax bases of the respective assets and liabilities at
December 25, 1999 and December 26, 1998 and are summarized as follows (in

    At December 25, 1999, the Company had net operating losses ("NOLs")
aggregating $68.3 million, which may be used to reduce future taxable income of
the Company through 2018. Due to a change in control, $50.7 million of the NOLs
are subject to an annual utilization limit of $8.5 million in 2000 and 2001 and
$5.1 million thereafter through 2017.

    As of December 26, 1998, management concluded that realization of the
deferred tax assets was not more likely than not and a valuation allowance of
$53 million continued to be provided. As of December 25, 1999, based on the
Company's performance and projections of future earnings, management

concluded that realization of the remaining deferred tax assets was more likely
than not and accordingly reversed the remaining valuation allowance, resulting
in a reduction of goodwill by $13.7 million (relating to NOLs arising in 1992)
and the recognition of a tax benefit of $21.0 million. During the 52 weeks ended
December 25, 1999, the valuation allowance was reduced by $18.3 million related
to deferred tax assets which were utilized to offset the current year's
earnings. Such reduction resulted in a $8.5 million reduction of goodwill
(relating to NOLs arising in 1992) and the recognition of a tax benefit of
$9.8 million.

    The provision for income taxes for the 52 weeks ended December 25, 1999,
December 26, 1998 and December 27, 1997 differs from the amounts of income tax
determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to

    LITIGATION:  The Company from time to time is involved in routine legal
matters incidental to its business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate
resolution of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

    MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS:  The Company has employment agreements with several
of its executives providing, among other things, for employment terms of up to
three years. Pursuant to the terms of such employment and related agreements,
the Company and various executives entered into agreements pursuant to which
(i) executives' salary and bonuses were established and (ii) executives
purchased shares of common stock. In the event of employment termination, all of
the stock may be repurchased by the Company at the then market price. As of
December 25, 1999, an aggregate 264,485 shares of common stock purchased
pursuant to this plan are held by employees and former employees.

    COMMITMENTS:  The Company has established a Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan ("SERP") which presently covers only its Chairman. Such SERP
provides for vesting over a twenty year period. However, if the Chairman's
employment is terminated without cause, as defined, or if the Chairman resigns
with cause, as defined, such vesting becomes immediate, in which event the
Company would be liable to the Chairman (in addition to amounts accrued in the
financial statements) in the amount of approximately $650,000.

    The Company is subject to a loan agreement between the Company, certain of
the DLJMB Entities and an executive of the Company whereby the Company has an
obligation to assume an $800,000 loan made to said executive, should certain of
the DLJMB Entities elect. At December 25, 1999, the DLJMB Entities have not
exercised such election (see note 18 to consolidated financial statements).

15. BENEFIT PLANS

    On October 12, 1992, the Company adopted the 1992 Stock Option Plan of Duane
Reade Holding Corp. (the "Plan"). Under the Plan, a committee designated by the
Board of Directors to administer the Plan (the "Committee") may grant, to
executive and other key employees of the Company, nonqualified stock options to
purchase up to an aggregate of 510,757 shares of common stock of the Company at
an exercise price fixed by the Committee. The options are exercisable at such
time or times as the Committee determines at or subsequent to grant. The term of
the options set by the Committee shall not exceed 10 years. The plan has been
frozen with respect to future grants.

    During 1997, the Company adopted an Equity Participation Plan, as amended,
which provides 1,971,181 options for shares of common stock of the Company to be
granted to employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company if
the Company meets specific performance targets. At December 25, 1999, options
for 1,810,695 shares have been granted (net of options for 32,570 shares that
have been cancelled) to employees and certain non-employee directors. Under the
plan, shares granted to employees vest 20% on each of the first through fifth
anniversarys of the issue date with some options subject to accelerated vesting
if certain EBITDA targets are achieved.

    As permitted, the Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based
compensation plans. Had compensation cost for the Company's stock-based
compensation plan been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for
awards under the Plan, consistent with the alternative method of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," the pro forma decrease in the Company's net income for the 52
weeks ended December 25, 1999 would have been $2,470,000. The proforma increase
in the Company's net loss for the 52 weeks ended December 26, 1998 and
December 27, 1997 would have been $420,000 and less than $100,000, respectively.
The pro forma compensation expense for stock options has been estimated using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend
yield of 0%, expected volatility of of 50.0% in 1999, 50.0% in 1998 and 60.0% in
1997, risk free interest rates of 6.6% in 1999, a range from 4.16% to 5.79% in
1998 and 6.0% in 1997 and an expected term of 8 years. These pro forma
disclosures may not be representative of the effects on reported net income for
future years since options vest over several years and options granted prior to
fiscal 1995 are not considered.

    The Company maintains an employee savings plan pursuant to Section 401(k)
(the "401(k) Plan") of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") which covers
substantially all non-union employees other than key employees as defined by
IRC. Eligible participating employees may contribute up to 10% of their pretax
salaries, subject to certain IRC limitations. The 401(k) Plan, as amended,
provides for employer matching contributions at the discretion of the Company
(to a maximum of 1% of pretax salaries) and has a feature under which the
Company may contribute additional amounts for all eligible employees. During the
52 weeks ended December 25, 1999, the Company funded $59,000 of matching
contributions for the 1998

plan year. No employer contributions have yet been made for plan year 1999 and
no employer contributions were made for plan year 1997.

    Duane Reade is under contract with local unions to contribute to
multi-employer pension and welfare benefit plans for certain of its employees.
For the 52 weeks ended December 25, 1999, December 26, 1998 and December 27,
1997, contributions to such plans were $10,159,000, $8,658,000 and $6,751,000,
respectively.

16. EXTRAORDINARY CHARGE

    During the 52 weeks ended December 26, 1998, as a result of the completion
of the Refinancing Plan, the Company incurred a $23.6 million extraordinary
charge due to the early extinguishment of debt. The extraordinary charge
included redemption premiums on the 12% Senior Notes and Zero Coupon Notes of
approximately $11.5 million, accelerated amortization of deferred financing
costs and other transaction expenses of approximately $8.1 million, and
accelerated accretion of Zero Coupon Notes to the indenture stated value of
approximately $4.0 million.

17. NONRECURRING CHARGES

    During the first quarter of 1997, the Company considered a public offering
of its common stock and took certain steps in connection with these plans. Such
plans were abandoned upon consummation of the transaction discussed in Note 1.

    Costs and expenses incurred in connection with the abandoned public
offering, the recapitalization and the exchange offers referred to in Note 1
aggregated approximately $12.7 million, including investment banking fees of
$7.7 million (including $3.5 million to an affiliate of the Investors and
$0.6 million to the Stockholders), write-off of unamortized deferred financing
costs relating to the Former Credit Agreement of $1.8 million, legal and
accounting fees of $1.6 million, stand-by commitment fees relating to the
exchange offers of $1.2 million to an affiliate of the Investors and other costs
of $0.4 million. The Company has treated these expenses as non-recurring because
such expenses related to financing activities in connection with the
Recapitalization and related events, which the Company does not expect to
repeat.

18. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

    In 1992, the Company and the then principal stockholder of the Company (who
has subsequently sold most of its shares, see Note 1) entered into a
professional services agreement whereby consulting, advisory, financial and
other services were provided at the Company's request, for a five year term.
During the 52 weeks ended December 25, 1999 and December 26, 1998, such fees
aggregated approximately $.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively.

    During the 52 weeks ended December 27, 1997, the Investors paid an executive
approximately $0.8 million for advisory services rendered and a former executive
approximately $1.6 million for the repurchase and cancellation of exercisable
stock options. The accompanying financial statements do not reflect such
payments.

    On September 30, 1997, the Company entered into the Former Credit Agreement
in which DLJ Capital Funding, Inc., an affiliate of the Investors ("DLJ
Funding"), acted as the arranger and syndication agent. In connection with the
Former Credit Agreement, DLJ Funding received a customary funding fee of

18. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)
approximately $2.4 million. On February 13, 1998, the Company entered into the
Existing Credit Agreement, for which DLJ Funding acted as the manager and
syndication agent. In connection with the Existing Credit Agreement, DLJ Funding
received a customary funding fee of approximately $1.9 million. On
September 11, 1998, the Existing Credit Agreement was amended and restated for
which DLJ Funding acted as the manager and syndication agent and for which DLJ
Funding received a customary funding fee of approximately $1.8 million. On
March 17, 1999 and again on December 16, 1999 the existing credit agreement was
amended and restated for which DLJ Funding acted as the manager and syndication
agent and for which DLJ received a customary funding fee of $.7 million.

    DLJ (an affiliate of DLJMBPII) acted as financial advisor to the Company in
connection with the structuring of the Recapitalization and received customary
fees for such services of approximately $3.5 million and reimbursement for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, and affiliates of DLJ received standby
commitment fees of approximately $1.2 million in connection with change of
control offers for the Zero Coupon Notes and the 12% Senior Notes, which were
required as a result of the Recapitalization. The Company agreed to indemnify
DLJ in connection with its acting as financial advisor. In addition, as lead
underwriter, DLJ received its pro rata portion of the underwriters compensation
for consummation of the Offering, which was approximately $4.3 million. DLJ also
served as sole underwriter in connection with the Offering of the Company's
Senior Notes and received an estimated $2.4 million of underwriting compensation
payable in connection therewith. In addition, the DLJ Entities sold 1,091,658
additional shares of common stock in the Offering pursuant to the exercise by
the underwriters of an over-allotment option, and the total net proceeds to such
DLJ Entities were approximately $16.8 million.

    On November 9, 1998, upon unanimous approval of the Board of Directors of
the Company, the Company extended a $2.0 million loan to the Company's Chief
Executive Officer (the "CEO Loan"). For so long as the Existing Credit Agreement
is outstanding, the CEO Loan bears interest at the rate of interest paid by the
Company on its revolving loans outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement.
Thereafter, the CEO Loan will bear interest at LIBOR plus 300 basis points. The
CEO Loan becomes due upon the earliest to occur of (i) the termination of the
executive's employment with the Company, (ii) the termination of the executive's
employment agreement with the Company, (iii) any sale by the executive of 15% or
more of the Company's common stock held by the executive or (iv) November 9,
2003.

    The Company is subject to a loan agreement between the Company, certain of
the DLJMB Entities and the Company's Chief Executive Officer ("Executive")
whereby the Company has an obligation to assume an $800,000 loan made to
Executive should certain of the DLJMB Entities elect. At December 25, 1999, the
DLJMB Entities have not exercised such election. During 1999, as approved by the
Board of Directors, the Company paid $200,000 of the original principal amount
of $1,000,000 under the loan agreement to the DLJMB entities, as well as $97,314
in interest. The Executive has entered into a separate promissory note dated
June 7, 1999 with the Company for the amount of the total Company payment of
$297,314. The terms of this promissory note require the executive to repay the
principal amount of the note and all accrued interest in full on December 19,
2002. Interest accrues on this note at the federal mid-term rate in effect
within 30 days after the payment by the Company to the Executive of any
incentive bonus. Under the Executive's employment contract, interest on this
note will be forgiven by the Company if certain EBITDA targets are achieved. On
December 30, 1999 the Company made an additional payment of $200,000 to the
DLJMB Entities on the remaining balance of $800,000 as well as $78,583 in
interest. The Executive has entered into a separate promissory note dated
December 30, 1999 with the Company for the

ANTHONY J. CUTI
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

                                                          June 14, 1999



Mr. John Henry
Two Sage Rd.
Toms River, NJ 08753

Dear John,

         Received your executed employment letter and would like to take this
opportunity to congratulate you on joining our team.

         With regard to your modification of the Termination provision, I was
not clear on what you intended by specifying that it applies to your position of
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. If your concern was that
involuntary transfer to another responsibility should be considered termination
I do not have a problem with that. Otherwise, if I somehow missed the point,
please clarify.

         I would like to arrange a lunch with you, Gary, Jerry and Bill at your
earliest convenience before June 25th. Could you arrange this date with Patty?


                                   Sincerely,


                                   /s/ Anthony J. Cuti

Dear Tony:

You correctly interpreted my concern and I am fine with your response.

I will contact Patty today to set up the meeting you requested. It would be
helpful to me if the meeting could be at the beginning or end of a day. Lunch
meetings in the city consume almost half the business day considering the travel
time.

Thanks,

Dear Tony:

Attached is the executed employment letter. I have executed this letter with the
understanding that the Termination Provision will apply to my position as Senior
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I recognize that this may not have
been your intention. While it's unlikely that this will ever be an issue, this
is protection I enjoy in my current employment agreement that I do not want to
lose. If this clarification is unacceptable to you or if you would like to
discuss further, I will be available at your convenience.

If this is acceptable to you, I would like to start receiving any financial and
operational reports, which will enhance my understanding of the company, and the
various issues in which I will become involved.

I am fully aware of the confidentiality requirements and would agree to keep any
and all information you would provide strictly confidential.

You can send any information to my home address. E-mail or fax # above.



Regards,

/s/ John K. Henry

TERMINATION:            Should your employment be involuntarily terminated
                        for any reason, except for cause, you will be
                        entitled to a severance equivalent of 12 months
                        salary. Additionally, should your termination be the
                        product of a change in control on a voluntary or
                        involuntary basis, your stock options will
                        immediately vest and the Company will assure that

                        one year salary.

                        A relocation of your principal office work location

                        considered a termination without cause. "Cause" shall
                        be defined as a conviction of a crime, knowingly
                        commit a violation of Company policy resulting in
                        material damage to the Company, or refusal to perform
                        any of the responsibilities of the position. (See
                        attached Letter of Understanding).

                                      NOTE

$297,319.44                                                         June 7, 1999

            FOR VALUE RECEIVED, ANTHONY CUTI, a natural person residing in the
State of New Jersey (the "Borrower"), hereby promises to pay to the order of
DUANE READE INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Lender"), in full on December 19,
2002 the principal sum of Two Hundred Ninety-Seven Thousand Three Hundred
Nineteen Dollars ($297,319.44) and all accrued and unpaid interest from December
30, 1999 in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately
available funds. Interest on this note shall accrue at a rate per annum equal at
all times to the Federal Mid-Term Rate in effect within thirty days after the
payment by the Lender to the Borrower of any Target Bonus or Incentive Bonus
(each as defined in the Employment Agreement).

            This Note evidences the loan made by the Lender to the Borrower
under the Employment Agreement, dated as of October 27, 1997 and effective as of
June 18, 1997 (the "Employment Agreement") between the Lender and the Borrower
and is subject to the terms set forth therein, including, without limitation,
those terms set forth in Exhibit C to the Employment Agreement. Capitalized
terms used and not otherwise defined in this Note shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in the Employment Agreement.

            If EBITDA for the calendar year ended immediately prior to the
Termination Date equals or exceeds the Base EBITDA Target for such year and as
of the Termination Date, EBITDA for the current calendar year is at least
anticipated (as reasonably determined by the Lender's outside auditors) to equal
or exceed the Base EBITDA Target for such year, the Lender will forgive the
interest accrued on this Note as of such date (the "Forgiveness"), and the
Borrower will not be required to pay additional interest thereon. The Lender
will make an additional payment to the Borrower such that, on an after-tax
basis, he receives the benefit of the full amount of the Forgiveness. The Lender
shall have the right to reduce as an offset to this Note any amount payable to
the Borrower pursuant to Section 17(a)(i) and (ii) of the Employment Agreement
by the principal balance outstanding under this Note as of the Termination Date.

            Each of the following shall constitute an "Event of Default":

            (a) The Borrower shall fail to make any payment of principal or
interest on the Note by the date that is five days after such payment is due;

            (b) The Borrower's employment with the Lender shall be terminated
for any reason or the Borrower shall materially breach any provision of the
Employment Agreement; or

            (c) The Borrower shall die or become incapacitated.

            Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the principal hereof and
accrued interest hereon shall become, or may be declared to be, forthwith due
and payable, without
<PAGE>

presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are
expressly waived by the Borrower.

            THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH,
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLES
THEREOF RELATED TO CONFLICTS OF LAW). THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY
AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS NOTE.

      Amortization Amount divided by (2) 4, and (iii) provide each Lender, the
      Borrower and the Syndication Agent with a copy of such revised Percentages
      and amortization schedule promptly following any such revisions thereto.

      Revolving Loan Commitment Amount equals $0; and

            (b) following the prepayment in full of the Term Loans, on the date
      the Term Loans would otherwise have been required to be prepaid pursuant
      to clause (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of Section 3.1.1, in an amount equal
      to the amount by which the Term Loans would otherwise have been required
      to be prepaid if any Term Loans had been outstanding. Any such reduction
      of the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount which reduces the Revolving Loan
      Commitment Amount below the Letter of Credit Commitment Amount or the
      Swing Line Loan Commitment Amount shall result in an automatic and
      corresponding permanent reduction of the Letter of Credit Commitment
      Amount or the Swing Line Loan Commitment Amount, as the case may be, to an
      aggregate amount not in excess of the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount, as
      so reduced, without any further action on the part of the Issuer or the
      Swing Line Lender.

      SECTION 2.2.3. Increase in the Revolving Commitment Amount. (a) The
Borrower may, from time to time on any Business Day, request an increase in the
Revolving Loan Commitment Amount by delivering an Increase Request to the
Agents. Upon receipt of each such Increase Request, the Administrative Agent
shall promptly forward such Increase Request to each Lender with a Revolving
Loan Commitment, and each such existing Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment
shall have the right (but not the obligation) to commit to all or a specified
portion of the proposed increase.

            (b) Each Lender, acting in its sole discretion, shall, by notice to
      the Agents given no later than the date (the "Increase Consent Date") that
      is five Business Days after the date that the Administrative Agent
      forwards such Increase Request to them, advise the Agents (x) whether or
      not such Lender agrees to the increase its Revolving Loan Commitment and
      (y) the principal amount, stated in Dollars, of the proposed increase to
      the Revolving Loan Commitment of such Lender (any existing Lender agreeing
      to any increase being called an "Increasing Lender"); provided, that each
      Lender that determines not to increase its Revolving Loan Commitment (a
      "Non-Increasing Lender") shall notify the Agents of such fact promptly
      after such determination (but in any event no later than the Increase
      Consent Date) and any Lender that does not advise the Agents on or before
      the Increase Consent Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Increasing Lender.
      The Syndication Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of the names of
      the Increasing Lenders and the Non-Increasing Lenders and the amount of
      each Increasing Lender's proposed increase upon receipt of each notice
      from such Lender. The election of any Lender to agree to such increases
      (as each proposed increase may be decreased during the allocation process
      set forth in clause (d) below) shall be irrevocable but shall not obligate
      any other Lender to so agree.

            (c) If the aggregate amount of the proposed increase in the
      Revolving Loan Commitments of the then existing Lenders pursuant to clause
      (b) above is less than the aggregate increase in Revolving Loan
      Commitments requested by the Borrower, then the proposed increase may be
      offered to prospective Lenders (and existing Lenders may still consider
      the offer). Each such prospective Lender (each, a "New Revolving Lender"),
      shall, by notice to the Borrower and the Agents given no later than five
      Business Days after the Increase Consent Date, advise the Borrower and the
      Agents of the amount, stated in Dollars, of the Revolving Loan Commitments
      to which such New Revolving Lender is willing to commit.

            (d) The Syndication Agent and the Borrower shall allocate the
      increased Revolving Loan Commitments among the Increasing Lenders and the
      New Revolving Lenders (if any) as they may agree; provided that the
      resulting Revolving Loan Commitment of each New Revolving Lender shall be
      at least $1,000,000 and provided, further that any Lender that does not
      advise the Agents on or before the Increase Consent Date shall be deemed
      to be a Non-Increasing Lender. Following such allocation the Syndication
      Agent shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent who shall in turn
      promptly notify each then existing Lender and each New Revolving Lender of
      the increased Revolving Loan Commitments, confirming the effective date


                                      -44-
<PAGE>

      thereof and the aggregate amount of Revolving Loan Commitments after
      giving effect to such increase, (y) each then existing Lender of the
      amount of the increase (if any) in its Revolving Loan Commitment and (z)
      each New Revolving Lender of its new Revolving Loan Commitment; and on
      such Increase Date, each Increasing Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment
      shall automatically, without any other action by any Person, be increased
      by such additional amount.

            (e) Each New Revolving Lender shall, following the Increase Consent
      Date but prior to the Increase Date, execute and deliver a Revolving Loan
      Commitment Acceptance pursuant to which it undertakes a Revolving Loan
      Commitment hereunder (and such New Revolving Lender shall thereupon become
      a "Lender" for all purposes of this Agreement) in the amount agreed to by
      such New Revolving Lender.

            (f) Each Lender by delivering an election to increase its Revolving
      Loan Commitment and each New Revolving Lender by delivering a Revolving
      Loan Commitment Acceptance, as the case may be, hereby agrees to and
      confirms its obligations set forth in Section 2.6 based on such Lender's
      or New Revolving Lender's revised Revolving Loan Commitments as then in
      effect on the Increase Date.

            (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase in the aggregate
      Revolving Loan Commitments hereunder pursuant to this Section 2.2.3 shall
      not be effective unless:

                  (i) if any Revolving Loans are outstanding hereunder on the
            Increase Date, the principal amount of all such Revolving Loans
            shall on or prior to such date be repaid, together with accrued
            interest thereon and any costs incurred by any existing Lender in
            accordance with Section 4.4 (but all such Revolving Loans may, on
            the terms and conditions hereof, be reborrowed on the Increase Date
            pro rata among all of the Lenders (including the New Revolving
            Lenders) based on their revised Revolving Loan Commitments as then
            in effect on such date) and the Administrative Agent may, in its
            sole discretion, net out the differences prior to the Increase and
            following the Increase based on each Lender's Percentage of the
            Revolving Loan Commitment Amount;

                  (ii) the Borrower shall have given the Syndication Agent the
            Increase Request no more than 20 Business Days prior to any such
            Increase Date;

                  (iii) the Borrower has complied with Section 5.1;

                  (iv) concurrently with the increase in the Revolving Loan
            Commitment, the Administrative Agent shall recalculate each Lender's
            Revolving Loan Commitment Percentage by reducing each Non-Increasing
            Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage, increasing each Increasing
            Lender's Revolving Loan Percentage and establishing a


                                      -45-
<PAGE>

            Revolving Loan Percentage for each New Revolving Lender, as
            applicable and as appropriate; and

                  (v) there shall have been no voluntary reduction of the
            Revolving Loan Commitment Amount pursuant to Section 2.2.1.

            (h) The aggregate amount of increases to the Revolving Loan
      Commitment Amount pursuant to this Section 2.2.3 may not exceed
      $5,000,000, and the amount of each individual increase in the Revolving
      Loan Commitment Amount pursuant to this Section 2.2.3 shall at least equal
      to $1,000,000 or any larger integral multiple of $1,000,000.

      SECTION 2.3. Borrowing Procedures and Funding Maintenance. Loans (other
than Swing Line Loans) shall be made by the Lenders in accordance with Section
2.3.1, and Swing Line Loans shall be made by the Swing Line Lender in accordance
with Section 2.3.2.

      SECTION 2.3.1. Additional Term C Loans and Revolving Loans. By delivering
a Borrowing Request to the Administrative Agent on or before 12:00 noon, New
York City time, on a Business Day, the Borrower may from time to time
irrevocably request, on not less than one Business Day's notice (in the case of
Base Rate Loans) or three Business Days' notice (in the case of LIBO Rate Loans)
nor more than five Business Days' notice (in the case of any Loans), that a
Borrowing be made, in the case of LIBO Rate Loans, in an aggregate amount of
$1,000,000 or any larger integral multiple of $500,000, and in the case of Base
Rate Loans, in an aggregate amount of $500,000 or any larger integral multiple
of $100,000, or, in either case, in the unused amount of the applicable
Commitment. No Borrowing Request shall be required, and the minimum aggregate
amounts specified under this Section 2.3.1 shall not apply, in the case of
Revolving Loans made under clause (b) of Section 2.3.2 to refund Refunded Swing
Line Loans or deemed made under Section 2.6.2 in respect of unreimbursed
Disbursements. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
each Borrowing shall be comprised of the type of Loans, and shall be made on the
Business Day, specified in such Borrowing Request. On or before 11:00 a.m., New
York City time, on such Business Day each Lender shall deposit with the
Administrative Agent same day funds in an amount equal to such Lender's
Percentage of the requested Borrowing. Such deposit will be made to an account
which the Administrative Agent shall specify from time to time by notice to the
Lenders. To the extent funds are received from the Lenders, the Administrative
Agent shall make such funds available to the Borrower by wire transfer to the
accounts the Borrower shall have specified in its Borrowing Request. No Lender's
obligation to make any Loan shall be affected by any other Lender's failure to
make any Loan.

      SECTION 2.3.2. Swing Line Loans. (a) By telephonic notice, promptly
followed (within one Business Day) by the delivery of a confirming Borrowing
Request, to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent on or before
12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day the proposed Swing Line Loan
is to be made, the Borrower may from time to time irrevocably request that a
Swing Line Loan be made by the Swing Line Lender in a minimum principal amount
of $100,000 or


                                      -46-
<PAGE>

any larger integral multiple of $50,000. All Swing Line Loans shall be made as
Base Rate Loans and shall not be entitled to be converted into LIBO Rate Loans.
The proceeds of each Swing Line Loan shall be made available by the Swing Line
Lender, by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day telephonic notice
is received by it as provided in this clause (a), to the Borrower by wire
transfer to the account the Borrower shall have specified in its notice
therefor.

      (b) If (i) any Swing Line Loan (A) shall be outstanding for more than four
Business Days or (B) is or will be outstanding on a date when the Borrower
requests that a Revolving Loan be made or (ii) any Default (other than a Default
of the nature set forth in Section 8.1.9) shall occur and be continuing, each
Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment (other than the Swing Line Lender)
irrevocably agrees that it will, at the request of the Swing Line Lender and
upon notice from the Administrative Agent, make a Revolving Loan (which shall
initially be funded as a Base Rate Loan) in an amount equal to such Lender's
Percentage of the aggregate principal amount of all such Swing Line Loans then
outstanding (such outstanding Swing Line Loans hereinafter referred to as the
"Refunded Swing Line Loans"); provided, that the Swing Line Lender shall not
request, and no Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment shall make, any Refunded
Swing Line Loan if, after giving effect to the making of such Refunded Swing
Line Loan, the sum of all Swing Line Loans and Revolving Loans made by such
Lender, plus such Lender's Percentage of the aggregate amount of all Letter of
Credit Outstandings, would exceed such Lender's Percentage of the then existing
Revolving Loan Commitment Amount. On or before 11:00 a.m. (New York City time)
on the first Business Day following receipt by each Lender of a request to make
Revolving Loans as provided in the preceding sentence, each such Lender with a
Revolving Loan Commitment shall deposit in an account specified by the Swing
Line Lender the amount so requested in same day funds and such funds shall be
applied by the Swing Line Lender to repay the Refunded Swing Line Loans. At the
time the aforementioned Lenders make the above referenced Revolving Loans, the
Swing Line Lender shall be deemed to have made, in consideration of the making
of the Refunded Swing Line Loans, a Revolving Loan in an amount equal to the
Swing Line Lender's Percentage of the aggregate principal amount of the Refunded
Swing Line Loans. Upon the making (or deemed making, in the case of the Swing
Line Lender) of any Revolving Loans pursuant to this clause (b), the amount so
funded shall become outstanding under such Lender's Revolving Note and shall no
longer be owed under the Swing Line Note. All interest payable with respect to
any Revolving Loans made (or deemed made, in the case of the Swing Line Lender)
pursuant to this clause (b) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the
period of time during which the Swing Line Lender had outstanding Swing Line
Loans in respect of which such Revolving Loans were made.

      (c) If, at any time prior to the making of Revolving Loans to replace any
outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to clause (b) above, any Default of the
nature of the nature set forth in Section 8.1.9 shall have occurred, each Lender
with a Revolving Loan Commitment (other than the Swing Line Lender) irrevocably
agrees that it will, at the request of the Swing Line Lender and upon notice
from the Administrative Agent, purchase an undivided participation interest in
all such Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to its Percentage of the aggregate
outstanding amount of such Swing Line Loans and


                                      -47-
<PAGE>

transfer immediately to an account identified by the Swing Line Lender, in
immediately available funds, the amount of its participation. The Swing Line
Lender will deliver to each such Lender, promptly following receipt of such
funds, a participation certificate, dated the date of receipt of such funds and
in the amount of such Lender's participation if requested to do so by such
Lender.

      (d) The Borrower expressly agrees that, in respect of each Lender's funded
participation interest in any Swing Line Loan, such Lender shall be deemed to be
in privity of contract with the Borrower and have the same rights and remedies
against the Borrower under the Loan Documents as if such funded participation
interest in such Swing Line Loan were a Revolving Loan.

      (e) Each Lender's obligation (in the case of Lenders with a Revolving Loan
Commitment) to make Revolving Loans or purchase participation interests in Swing
Line Loans, as contemplated by clause (b) or (c) above, shall be absolute and
unconditional and without recourse to the Swing Line Lender and shall not be
affected by any circumstance, including (i) any set-off, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Lender may have against
the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason
whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, an Event of Default
or a Material Adverse Effect; (iii) the acceleration or maturity of any Loans or
the termination of any Commitment after the making of any Swing Line Loan; (iv)
any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any
other Obligor or any Lender; or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

      SECTION 2.3.3. Loans Made Prior to the Date Hereof. As of the Amendment
Effective Date, the Existing Term A Loans, the Existing Term B Loans, the August
1998 Term C Loans, the September 1998 Term C Loans and the March 1999 Term C
Loans shall continue to remain outstanding hereunder as Term A Loans, Term B
Loans, August 1998 Term C Loans, September 1998 Term C Loans and March 1999 Term
C Loans respectively, in each case, as if made hereunder on the Amendment
Effective Date.

      SECTION 2.4. Continuation and Conversion Elections. By delivering a
Continuation/Conversion Notice to the Administrative Agent on or before 12:00
noon, New York City time, on a Business Day, the Borrower may from time to time
irrevocably elect, on not less than one Business Day's notice (in the case of a
conversion of LIBO Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans) or three Business Days' notice
(in the case of a continuation of LIBO Rate Loans or a conversion of Base Rate
Loans into LIBO Rate Loans) nor more than five Business Days' notice (in the
case of any Loans) that all, or any portion (a) in a minimum amount of
$1,000,000 or any larger integral multiple of $500,000, be, in the case of Base
Rate Loans, converted into LIBO Rate Loans or, in the case of LIBO Rate Loans,
continued as LIBO Rate Loans or (b) in a minimum amount of $500,000 or any
larger integral multiple of $100,000, be, in the case of LIBO Rate Loans,
converted into Base Rate Loans (in the absence of delivery of a
Continuation/Conversion Notice with respect to any LIBO Rate Loan at least three
Business Days before the last day of the then current Interest Period with
respect thereto, such


                                      -48-
<PAGE>

LIBO Rate Loan shall, on such last day, automatically convert to a Base Rate
Loan); provided, however, that (x) each such conversion or continuation shall be
pro rated among the applicable outstanding Loans of the relevant Lenders, and
(y) no portion of the outstanding principal amount of any Loans may be continued
as, or be converted into, LIBO Rate Loans when any Default or Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing.

      SECTION 2.5. Funding. Each Lender may, if it so elects, fulfill its
obligation to make, continue or convert LIBO Rate Loans hereunder by causing one
of its foreign branches or Affiliates (or an international banking facility
created by such Lender) to make or maintain such LIBO Rate Loan, so long as such
action does not result in increased costs to the Borrower; provided, however,
that such LIBO Rate Loan shall nonetheless be deemed to have been made and to be
held by such Lender, and the obligation of the Borrower to repay such LIBO Rate
Loan shall nevertheless be to such Lender for the account of such foreign
branch, Affiliate or international banking facility; provided further, however,
that, except for purposes of determining whether any such increased costs are
payable by the Borrower, such Lender shall cause such foreign branch, Affiliate
or international banking facility to comply with the applicable provisions of
clause (b) of Section 4.6 with respect to such LIBO Rate Loan. In addition, the
Borrower hereby consents and agrees that, for purposes of any determination to
be made for purposes of Section 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 or 4.4, it shall be conclusively
assumed that each Lender elected to fund all LIBO Rate Loans by purchasing
Dollar deposits in its LIBOR Office's interbank Eurodollar market.

      SECTION 2.6. Issuance Procedures. By delivering to the Administrative
Agent an Issuance Request on or before 12:00 noon, New York City time, on a
Business Day, the Borrower may, from time to time irrevocably request, on not
less than three nor more than ten Business Days' notice (or such shorter or
longer notice as may be acceptable to the Issuer), in the case of an initial
issuance of a Letter of Credit, and not less than three nor more than ten
Business Days' notice (unless a shorter or longer notice period is acceptable to
the Issuer) prior to the then existing Stated Expiry Date of a Letter of Credit,
in the case of a request for the extension of the Stated Expiry Date of a Letter
of Credit, that the Issuer issue, or extend the Stated Expiry Date of, as the
case may be, an irrevocable Letter of Credit on behalf of the Borrower (whether
the account party on such Letter of Credit is the Borrower or a Subsidiary of
the Borrower) in such form as may be requested by the Borrower and approved by
the Issuer, for the purposes described in Section 7.1.9; provided, however, that
no extension of the Stated Expiry Date of an outstanding Letter of Credit may
provide for a Stated Expiry Date subsequent to the earlier of (i) the Revolving
Loan Commitment Termination Date and (ii) one year from the date of such
extension. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any
separate application for any Letter of Credit, the Borrower hereby acknowledges
and agrees that it shall be obligated to reimburse the Issuer upon each
Disbursement paid under a Letter of Credit, and it shall be deemed to be the
obligor for purposes of each such Letter of Credit issued hereunder (whether the
account party on such Letter of Credit is the Borrower or a Subsidiary of the
Borrower). Upon receipt of an Issuance Request, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify the Issuer and each Lender thereof. Each Letter of Credit shall
by its terms be stated to expire on a date (its "Stated Expiry Date")


                                      -49-
<PAGE>

no later than the earlier to occur of (i) the Revolving Loan Commitment
Termination Date or (ii) one year from the date of its issuance. The Issuer will
make available to the beneficiary thereof the original of each Letter of Credit
which it issues hereunder.

      SECTION 2.6.1. Other Lenders' Participation. Upon the issuance of each
Letter of Credit issued by the Issuer pursuant hereto, and without further
action, each Lender (other than the Issuer) that has a Revolving Loan Commitment
shall be deemed to have irrevocably purchased from the Issuer, to the extent of
its Percentage in respect of Revolving Loans, and the Issuer shall be deemed to
have irrevocably granted and sold to such Lender a participation interest in
such Letter of Credit (including the Contingent Liability and any Reimbursement
Obligation and all rights with respect thereto), and such Lender shall, to the
extent of its Percentage in respect of Revolving Loans, be responsible for
reimbursing promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) the Issuer for
Reimbursement Obligations which have not been reimbursed by the Borrower in
accordance with Section 2.6.3. In addition, such Lender shall, to the extent of
its Percentage in respect of Revolving Loans, be entitled to receive a ratable
portion of the Letter of Credit fees payable pursuant to Section 3.3.3 with
respect to each Letter of Credit and of interest payable pursuant to Section 3.2
with respect to any Reimbursement Obligation. To the extent that any Lender has
reimbursed the Issuer for a Disbursement as required by this Section, such
Lender shall be entitled to receive its ratable portion of any amounts
subsequently received (from the Borrower or otherwise) in respect of such
Disbursement.

      SECTION 2.6.2. Disbursements; Conversion to Revolving Loans. The Issuer
will notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly of the
presentment for payment of any drawing under any Letter of Credit issued by the
Issuer, together with notice of the date (the "Disbursement Date") such payment
shall be made (each such payment, a "Disbursement"). Subject to the terms and
provisions of such Letter of Credit and this Agreement, the Issuer shall make
such payment to the beneficiary (or its designee) of such Letter of Credit.
Prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the first Business Day following the
Disbursement Date (the "Disbursement Due Date"), the Borrower will reimburse the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuer, for all amounts which the
Issuer has disbursed under such Letter of Credit, together with interest thereon
at the rate per annum otherwise applicable to Revolving Loans (made as Base Rate
Loans) from and including the Disbursement Date to but excluding the
Disbursement Due Date and, thereafter (unless such Disbursement is converted
into a Revolving Loan made as a Base Rate Loan on the Disbursement Due Date), at
a rate per annum equal to the rate per annum then in effect with respect to
overdue Revolving Loans (made as Base Rate Loans) pursuant to Section 3.2.2 for
the period from the Disbursement Due Date through the date of such
reimbursement; provided, however, that, if no Default shall have then occurred
and be continuing, unless the Borrower has notified the Administrative Agent no
later than one Business Day prior to the Disbursement Due Date that it will
reimburse the Issuer for the applicable Disbursement, then the amount of the
Disbursement shall be deemed to be a Borrowing of Revolving Loans constituting
Base Rate Loans and following the giving of notice thereof by the Administrative
Agent to the Lenders, each Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment (other than
the Issuer) will deliver to the Issuer on the Disbursement Due Date immediately
available funds in an amount equal to such Lender's Percentage of


                                      -50-
<PAGE>

such Borrowing. Each conversion of Disbursement amounts into Revolving Loans
shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower that on the date
of the making of such Revolving Loans all of the statements set forth in Section
5.2.1 are true and correct.

      SECTION 2.6.3. Reimbursement. The obligation (a "Reimbursement
Obligation") of the Borrower under Section 2.6.2 to reimburse the Issuer with
respect to each Disbursement (including interest thereon) not converted into a
Revolving Loan made as a Base Rate Loan pursuant to Section 2.6.2, and, upon the
failure of the Borrower to reimburse the Issuer and the giving of notice thereof
by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders, each Lender's (to the extent it has
a Revolving Loan Commitment) obligation under Section 2.6.1 to reimburse the
Issuer or fund its Percentage of any Disbursement converted into a Revolving
Loan made as a Base Rate Loan, shall be absolute and unconditional under any and
all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to
payment which the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, may have or have
had against the Issuer or any such Lender, including any defense based upon the
failure of any Disbursement to conform to the terms of the applicable Letter of
Credit (if, in the Issuer's good faith opinion, such Disbursement is determined
to be appropriate) or any non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary
of the proceeds of such Letter of Credit; provided, however, that after paying
in full its Reimbursement Obligation hereunder, nothing herein shall adversely
affect the right of the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, to commence
any proceeding against the Issuer for any wrongful Disbursement made by the
Issuer under a Letter of Credit as a result of acts or omissions constituting
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuer.

      SECTION 2.6.4. Deemed Disbursements. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of any Event of Default of the type described in clauses (a)
through (d) of Section 8.1.9 or, with notice from the Administrative Agent
acting at the direction of the Required Lenders, upon the occurrence and during
the continuation of any other Event of Default,

            (a) an amount equal to that portion of all Letter of Credit
      Outstandings attributable to the then aggregate amount which is undrawn
      and available under all Letters of Credit issued and outstanding shall,
      without demand upon or notice to the Borrower or any other Person, be
      deemed to have been paid or disbursed by the Issuer under such Letters of
      Credit (notwithstanding that such amount may not in fact have been so paid
      or disbursed); and

            (b) upon notification by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower of
      its obligations under this Section, the Borrower shall be immediately
      obligated to reimburse the Issuer for the amount deemed to have been so
      paid or disbursed by the Issuer.

Any amounts so payable by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be
deposited in cash with the Administrative Agent and held as collateral security
for the Obligations in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by the
Issuer. At such time as the Events of Default giving rise to the deemed
disbursements hereunder shall have been cured or waived, the Administrative
Agent shall return to the

<PAGE>

Borrower all amounts then on deposit with the Administrative Agent pursuant to
this Section, together with accrued interest at the Federal Funds Rate, which
have not been applied to the satisfaction of such Obligations.

      SECTION 2.6.5. Nature of Reimbursement Obligations. The Borrower and, to
the extent set forth in Section 2.6.1, each Lender with a Revolving Loan
Commitment, shall assume all risks of the acts, omissions or misuse of any
Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof. The Issuer (except to the extent of
its own gross negligence or willful misconduct) shall not be responsible for (i)
the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any
Letter of Credit or any document submitted by any party in connection with the
application for and issuance of a Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact
prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent
or forged, (ii) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal
effect of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or
assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or the proceeds
thereof in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for
any reason, (iii) failure of the beneficiary to comply fully with conditions
required in order to demand payment under a Letter of Credit, (iv) errors,
omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages,
by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, or (v) any loss or delay in the
transmission or otherwise of any document or draft required in order to make a
Disbursement under a Letter of Credit. None of the foregoing shall affect,
impair or prevent the vesting of any of the rights or powers granted to the
Issuer or any Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment hereunder. In furtherance
and extension and not in limitation or derogation of any of the foregoing, any
action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuer in good faith (and not
constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct) shall be binding upon the
Borrower, each Obligor and each such Lender, and shall not put the Issuer under
any resulting liability to the Borrower, any Obligor or any such Lender, as the
case may be.

      SECTION 2.6.6. Indemnity. In addition to amounts payable as elsewhere
provided herein, the Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save
the Issuer harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities,
damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and allocated costs of internal counsel) which the Issuer may incur or be
subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (a) the issuance of the
Letters of Credit, other than as a result of the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of the Issuer as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or
(b) the failure of the Issuer to honor a drawing under any Letter of Credit as a
result of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or
future de jure or de facto government or governmental authority.

      SECTION 2.6.7. Borrower's Guaranty of Reimbursement Obligations under
Letters of Credit Issued for the Account of its Subsidiaries. The Borrower
agrees as follows in respect of the reimbursement obligations under Letters of
Credit issued for the account of its Subsidiaries:


                                      -52-
<PAGE>

      (a) The Borrower hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably

            (i) guarantees the full and punctual payment when due, whether at
      stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand
      or otherwise, of all such reimbursement obligations now or hereafter
      existing, of each of its Subsidiaries (the "Account Parties") that is an
      account party to a Letter of Credit which arise out of, or are incurred in
      connection with, such Letters of Credit, whether for principal, interest,
      fees, expenses or otherwise (including all such amounts which would become
      due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of
      the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. ss.362(a), and the operation
      of Sections 502(b) and 506(b) of the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11
      U.S.C. ss.502(b) and ss.506(b)), and

            (ii) indemnifies and holds harmless each Secured Party and each
      holder of a Note for any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable
      attorney's fees and expenses) incurred by such Secured Party or such
      holder, as the case may be, in enforcing any rights under the guaranty set
      forth in this Section 2.6.7.

The guaranty set forth in this Section 2.6.7 constitutes a guaranty of payment
when due and not of collection, and the Borrower specifically agrees that it
shall not be necessary or required that any Secured Party or any holder of any
Note exercise any right, assert any claim or demand or enforce any remedy
whatsoever against any Account Party or any other Obligor (or any other Person)
before or as a condition to the obligations of the Borrower under the guaranty
set forth in this Section 2.6.7 (such obligations hereinafter referred to as the
"Guaranteed Obligations").

      (b) The Borrower agrees that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default of
the nature set forth in clauses (a) through (d) of Section 8.1.9, at a time when
any of the Guaranteed Obligations of any Account Party may not then be due and
payable, then the Borrower agrees that it will pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the Secured Parties forthwith the full amount which would be
payable under the guaranty set forth in this Section 2.6.7 by the Borrower if
all such Guaranteed Obligations were then due and payable.

      (c) The guaranty set forth in this Section 2.6.7 shall in all respects be
a continuing, absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guaranty of payment, and
shall remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations of the
Account Parties have been paid in full in cash, all Obligations of the Borrower
and each other Obligor hereunder have been paid in full in cash, all Letters of
Credit have been terminated or expired, all Rate Protection Agreements have been
terminated or expired and all Commitments shall have terminated. The Borrower
guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations of the Account Parties will be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and each other Loan
Document under which they arise, regardless of any law, regulation or order now
or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the
rights of any Secured Party or any holder of


                                      -53-
<PAGE>

any Note with respect thereto. The liability of the Borrower under the guaranty
set forth in this Section 2.6.7 shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable
irrespective of:

            (i) any lack of validity, legality or enforceability of this
      Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document;

            (ii) the failure of any Secured Party or any holder of any Note

                  (A) to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or
            remedy against any Account Party, any other Obligor or any other
            Person (including any other guarantor (including the Borrower))
            under the provisions of this Agreement, any Note, any other Loan
            Document or otherwise, or

                  (B) to exercise any right or remedy against any other
            guarantor (including the Borrower) of, or collateral securing, any
            Guaranteed Obligations of any Account Party;

            (iii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in
      any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations of any Account
      Party, or any other extension, compromise or renewal of any Guaranteed
      Obligation of any Account Party;

            (iv) any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination of any
      Guaranteed Obligations of any Account Party for any reason, including any
      claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall
      not be subject to (and the Borrower hereby waives any right to or claim
      of) any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination
      whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality, nongenuineness,
      irregularity, compromise, unenforceability of, or any other event or
      occurrence affecting, any Guaranteed Obligations of any Account Party or
      otherwise;

            (v) any amendment to, rescission, waiver, or other modification of,
      or any consent to departure from, any of the terms of this Agreement, any
      Note or any other Loan Document;

            (vi) any addition, exchange, release, surrender or non-perfection of
      any collateral, or any amendment to or waiver or release or addition of,
      or consent to departure from, any other guaranty, held by any Secured
      Party or any holder of any Note securing any of the Guaranteed Obligations
      of any Account Party; or

            (vii) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
      defense available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, any Account
      Party any surety or any guarantor.

      (d) The Borrower agrees that the guaranty set forth in this Section 2.6.7
shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any
time any payment (in whole or in part) of any of


                                      -54-
<PAGE>

the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any
Secured Party or any holder of any Note, upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of any Account Party or otherwise, all as though such payment had
not been made.

      (e) The Borrower hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance
and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations of any
Account Party or any other Obligor and the guaranty set forth in this Section
2.6.7 and any requirement that the Administrative Agent, any other Secured Party
or any holder of any Note protect, secure, perfect or insure any security
interest or Lien, or any property subject thereto, or exhaust any right or take
any action against any Account Party, any other Obligor or any other Person
(including any other guarantor) or entity or any collateral securing the
Guaranteed Obligations of any Account Party.

      (f) The Borrower agrees that it will not exercise any rights which it may
acquire by way of rights of subrogation under the guaranty set forth in this
Section 2.6.7, by any payment made under the guaranty set forth in this Section
2.6.7 or otherwise, until the prior payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed
Obligations of each Account Party, the prior payment in full in cash of all
Obligations of the Borrower, the termination or expiration of all Letters of
Credit, the termination or expiration of all Rate Protection Agreements and the
termination of all Commitments. Any amount paid to the Borrower on account of
any such subrogation rights prior to the payment in full in cash of all
Guaranteed Obligations of each Account Party shall be held in trust for the
benefit of the Secured Parties and each holder of a Note and shall immediately
be paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and
each holder of a Note and credited and applied against the Guaranteed
Obligations of each Account Party, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that if

            (i) the Borrower has made payment to the Secured Parties and each
      holder of a Note of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations of any
      Account Party, and

            (ii) all Guaranteed Obligations of each Account Party have been paid
      in full in cash, all Obligations of the Borrower have been paid in full in
      cash, all Letters of Credit have been terminated or expired and all
      Commitments have been permanently terminated,

each Secured Party and each holder of a Note agrees that, at the Borrower's
request, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties and the
holders of the Notes, will execute and deliver to the Borrower appropriate
documents (without recourse and without representation or warranty) necessary to
evidence the transfer by subrogation to the Borrower of an interest in the
Guaranteed Obligations of each Account Party resulting from such payment by the
Borrower. In furtherance of the foregoing, for so long as any Obligations
(including Guaranteed Obligations) or Commitments remain outstanding, the
Borrower shall refrain from taking any action or commencing any proceeding
against any Account Party(or its successors or assigns, whether in connection
with a


                                      -55-
<PAGE>

bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise) to recover any amounts in the respect of
payments made under the guaranty set forth in this Section 2.6.7 to any Secured
Party or any holder of a Note.

      (g) The guaranty set forth in this Section 2.6.7 shall:

            (i) be binding upon the Borrower, and its successors, transferees
      and assigns; and

            (ii) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
      Administrative Agent and each other Secured Party.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (b), any Lender may
assign or otherwise transfer (in whole or in part) any Note or Credit Extension
held by it to any other Person or entity, and such other Person or entity shall
thereupon become vested with all rights and benefits in respect thereof granted
to such Lender under any Loan Document (including the guaranty set forth in this
Section 2.6.7) or otherwise, subject, however, to any contrary provisions in
such assignment or transfer, and to the provisions of Section 11.11 and Article
X.

      SECTION 2.6.8. Continued Letters of Credit. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, the Letters of Credit (as defined in the Existing Credit
Agreement) shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit issued hereunder by the
Issuer on the Amendment Effective Date.

      SECTION 2.7. Register; Notes.

            (a) Each Lender may maintain in accordance with its usual practice
      an account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of the Borrower to such
      Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts
      of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to
      time hereunder. In the case of a Lender that does not request, pursuant to
      clause (b)(ii) below, execution and delivery of a Note evidencing the
      Loans made by such Lender to the Borrower, such account or accounts shall,
      to the extent not inconsistent with the notations made by the
      Administrative Agent in the Register, be conclusive and binding on the
      Borrower absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of any
      Lender to maintain such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise
      affect any Obligations of the Borrower or any other Obligor.

            (b)(i) The Borrower hereby designates the Administrative Agent to
      serve as the Borrower's agent, solely for the purpose of this clause (b),
      to maintain a register (the "Register") on which the Administrative Agent
      will record each Lender's Commitment, the Loans made by each Lender and
      each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each
      Lender and annexed to which the Administrative Agent shall retain a copy
      of each Lender Assignment Agreement delivered to the Administrative Agent
      pursuant to Section 11.11.1. Failure to make any recordation, or any error
      in such recordation, shall not affect the


                                      -56-
<PAGE>

      Borrower's obligation in respect of such Loans. The entries in the
      Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the
      Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person
      in whose name a Loan (and as provided in clause (ii) the Note evidencing
      such Loan, if any) is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes of
      this Agreement, notwithstanding notice or any provision herein to the
      contrary. A Lender's Commitment and the Loans made pursuant thereto may be
      assigned or otherwise transferred in whole or in part only by registration
      of such assignment or transfer in the Register. Any assignment or transfer
      of a Lender's Commitment or the Loans made pursuant thereto shall be
      registered in the Register only upon delivery to the Administrative Agent
      of a Lender Assignment Agreement duly executed by the assignor thereof and
      the compliance by the parties thereto with the other requirements of
      Section 11.11.1. No assignment or transfer of a Lender's Commitment or the
      Loans made pursuant thereto shall be effective unless such assignment or
      transfer shall have been recorded in the Register by the Administrative
      Agent as provided in this Section.

            (ii) The Borrower agrees that, upon the request to the
      Administrative Agent by any Lender, the Borrower will execute and deliver
      to such Lender, as applicable, a Revolving Note, a Term Note (or
      Registered Note) and/or a Swing Line Note evidencing the Loans made by
      such Lender. The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes each Lender to
      make (or cause to be made) appropriate notations on the grid attached to
      such Lender's Notes (or on any continuation of such grid), which
      notations, if made, shall evidence, inter alia, the date of, the
      outstanding principal amount of, and the interest rate and Interest Period
      applicable to the Loans evidenced thereby. Such notations shall, to the
      extent not inconsistent with the notations made by the Administrative
      Agent in the Register, be conclusive and binding on the Borrower absent
      manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to make
      any such notations shall not limit or otherwise affect any Obligations of
      the Borrower or any other Obligor. The Loans evidenced by any Registered
      Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment
      pursuant to Section 11.11.1) be payable to the order of the payee named
      therein and its registered assigns. A Registered Note and the obligation
      evidenced thereby may be assigned or otherwise transferred in whole or in
      part only by registration of such assignment or transfer of such
      Registered Note and the obligation evidenced thereby in the Register (and
      each Registered Note shall expressly so provide). Any assignment or
      transfer of all or part of an obligation evidenced by a Registered Note
      shall be registered in the Register only upon surrender for registration
      of assignment or transfer of the Registered Note evidencing such
      obligation, accompanied by a Lender Assignment Agreement duly executed by
      the assignor thereof and the compliance by the parties thereto with the
      other requirements of Section 11.11.1, and thereupon, if requested by the
      assignee, one or more new Notes shall be issued to the designated assignee
      and the old Registered Note shall be returned by the Administrative Agent
      to the Borrower marked "exchanged". No assignment of a Registered Note and
      the obligation evidenced thereby shall be effective unless it shall have
      been recorded in the Register by the Administrative Agent as provided in
      this Section.

      SECTION 3.1.1. Repayments and Prepayments. The Borrower shall repay in
full the unpaid principal amount of each Loan upon the Stated Maturity Date
therefor. Prior thereto, the Borrower

            (a) may, from time to time on any Business Day, make a voluntary
      prepayment, in whole or in part, of the outstanding principal amount of
      any

            (i) Loans (other than Swing Line Loans); provided, however, that

                        (A) any such prepayment of the Term Loans shall be made
                  pro rata among the Term Loans of the same type and, if
                  applicable, having the same Interest Period of all Lenders
                  that have made such Term Loans, and any such prepayment of
                  Revolving Loans shall be made pro rata among the Revolving
                  Loans of the same type and, if applicable, having the same
                  Interest Period of all Lenders that have made such Revolving
                  Loans;

                        (B) the Borrower shall comply with Section 4.4 in the
                  event that any LIBO Rate Loan is prepaid on any day other than
                  the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan;

                        (C) all such voluntary prepayments shall require at
                  least one Business Day's notice in the case of Base Rate
                  Loans, three Business Days' notice in the case of LIBO Rate
                  Loans, but no more than five Business Days' notice in the case
                  of any Loans, in each case in writing to the Administrative
                  Agent; and

                        (D) all such voluntary partial prepayments shall be, in
                  the case of LIBO Rate Loans, in an aggregate amount of
                  $1,000,000 or any larger integral multiple of $500,000, and,
                  in the case of Base Rate Loans, in an aggregate amount of
                  $500,000 or any larger integral multiple of $100,000, or, in
                  either case, in the aggregate principal amount of all Loans of
                  the applicable Tranche and type then outstanding; or

                  (ii) Swing Line Loans; provided, however, that


                                      -58-
<PAGE>

                        (A) all such voluntary prepayments shall require prior
                  telephonic notice to the Swing Line Lender on or before 12:00
                  noon, New York City time, on the day of such prepayment (such
                  notice to be confirmed in writing by the Borrower within 24
                  hours thereafter); and

                        (B) all such voluntary partial prepayments shall be in
                  an aggregate amount of $100,000 and an integral multiple of
                  $50,000 or in the aggregate principal amount of all Swing Line
                  Loans then outstanding;

            (b) shall, no later than five Business Days following the delivery
      by the Borrower of its annual audited financial reports required pursuant
      to clause (c) of Section 7.1.1 (beginning with the financial reports
      delivered in respect of the 1998 Fiscal Year), deliver to the
      Administrative Agent a calculation of the Excess Cash Flow for the Fiscal
      Year last ended and, no later than five Business Days following the
      delivery of such calculation, make a mandatory prepayment of the Term
      Loans in an amount equal to 75% of the Excess Cash Flow (if any) for such
      Fiscal Year, to be applied as set forth in Section 3.1.2;

            (c) shall, not later than one Business Day following the receipt of
      any Net Debt Proceeds by the Borrower, any Designated Guarantor or any of
      their respective Subsidiaries, deliver to the Administrative Agent a
      calculation of the amount of such Net Debt Proceeds and make a mandatory
      prepayment of the Term Loans in an amount equal to 100% of such Net Debt
      Proceeds to be applied as set forth in Section 3.1.2;

            (d) shall, concurrently with the receipt of any Net Equity Proceeds
      by the Borrower, any Designated Guarantor or any of their respective
      Subsidiaries, deliver to the Administrative Agent a calculation of the
      amount of such Net Equity Proceeds, and no later than five Business Days
      following the delivery of such calculation, make a mandatory prepayment of
      the Term Loans in an amount equal to 50% of such Net Equity Proceeds to be
      applied as set forth in Section 3.1.2;

            (e) shall, following the receipt by the Borrower, any Designated
      Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries of any Casualty Proceeds
      in excess of $500,000 (individually or in the aggregate (when taken
      together with Net Disposition Proceeds) over the course of a Fiscal Year),
      deliver to the Administrative Agent a calculation of the amount of such
      Casualty Proceeds and make a mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans in an
      amount equal to 100% of such Casualty Proceeds within 60 days of the
      receipt thereof to be applied as set forth in Section 3.1.2; provided,
      however, that no mandatory prepayment on account of Casualty Proceeds
      shall be required under this clause if the Borrower informs the Agents in
      writing no later than 60 days following the occurrence of the Casualty
      Event resulting in such Casualty Proceeds of its, such Designated
      Guarantor's or such Subsidiary's good faith intention to apply such
      Casualty Proceeds to the rebuilding or replacement of the damaged,
      destroyed or


                                      -59-
<PAGE>

      condemned assets or property and the Borrower, such Designated Guarantor
      or such Subsidiary in fact uses such Casualty Proceeds to rebuild or
      replace such assets or property within 365 days following the receipt of
      such Casualty Proceeds, with the amount of such Casualty Proceeds unused
      after such 365-day period being applied to the Term Loans pursuant to
      Section 3.1.2; provided, further, however, that (i) at any time when any
      Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, all
      Casualty Proceeds (together with Net Disposition Proceeds not applied as
      provided in clause (f) below) shall be deposited in an account maintained
      with the Administrative Agent to pay for such rebuilding or replacement
      whenever no Default or Event of Default is then continuing or except as
      otherwise agreed to by the Agents for disbursement at the request of the
      Borrower, such Designated Guarantor or such Subsidiary, as the case may
      be, or (ii) if all such Casualty Proceeds (together with Net Disposition

      excess of $1,000,000 have not yet been applied as described in the notice
      required above (or in accordance with clause (f) below), all such Casualty
      Proceeds and Net Disposition Proceeds shall be deposited in an account
      maintained with the Administrative Agent for disbursement at the request
      of the Borrower, such Designated Guarantor or such Subsidiary, as the case
      may be, to be used for the purpose(s) set forth in such written notice(s);

      Proceeds in excess of $500,000 (individually or in the aggregate (when
      taken together with Casualty Proceeds) over the course of a Fiscal Year),
      deliver to the Administrative Agent a calculation of the amount of such
      Net Disposition Proceeds and make a mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans
      in an amount equal to 100% of such Net Disposition Proceeds within one
      Business Day of the receipt thereof to be applied as set forth in Section
      3.1.2; provided, however, that no mandatory prepayment on account of Net
      Disposition Proceeds shall be required under this clause if the Borrower
      informs the Agents in writing no later than one Business Day following the
      receipt of such Net Disposition Proceeds of its, such Designated
      Guarantor's or such Subsidiary's good faith intention to apply such Net
      Disposition Proceeds to the replacement of the sold, conveyed or
      transferred assets or property with any other long-term assets or property
      that are used or useful in the permitted business activities of the
      Borrower and its Subsidiaries and the Borrower, such Designated Guarantor
      or such Subsidiary in fact uses such Net Disposition Proceeds to replace
      such assets or property within 365 days following the receipt of such Net
      Disposition Proceeds, with the amount of such Net Disposition Proceeds
      unused after such 365-day period being applied to the Term Loans pursuant
      to Section 3.1.2; provided, further, however, that (i) at any time when
      any Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, all
      Net Disposition Proceeds (together with Casualty Proceeds not applied as
      provided in clause (e) above) shall be deposited in an account maintained
      with the Administrative Agent to pay for such replacement whenever no
      Default or Event of Default is then continuing or except as otherwise
      agreed to by the Agents for disbursement at the request of the Borrower,
      such Designated Guarantor or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, or (ii)

      an aggregate amount equal to the excess, if any, of the sum of (i) the
      aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Revolving Loans and Swing
      Line Loans and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit
      Outstandings over the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount as so reduced;

            (n) shall, immediately upon the occurrence of the Stated Maturity
      Date of any Loans or Obligations, whether by way of acceleration pursuant
      to Section 8.2 or 8.3 or otherwise, repay all outstanding Loans and other
      Obligations, unless, pursuant to Section 8.3, only a portion of all Loans
      and other Obligations are so accelerated (in which case the portion so
      accelerated shall be so prepaid).

      Each prepayment of any Loans made pursuant to this Section shall be
without premium or penalty, except as may be required by Section 4.4. No
prepayment of principal of any Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans pursuant to
clause (a) of this Section 3.1.1 shall cause a reduction in the Revolving Loan
Commitment Amount or the Swing Line Loan Commitment Amount, as the case may be.

      SECTION 3.1.2. Application. (a) Subject to clause (b) below, each
prepayment or repayment of principal of the Loans of any Tranche shall be
applied, to the extent of such prepayment or repayment, first, to the principal
amount thereof being maintained as Base Rate Loans, and second, to the principal
amount thereof being maintained as LIBO Rate Loans.


                                      -63-
<PAGE>

      (b) Each prepayment of Term Loans made pursuant to clauses (a), (b), (c),
(d), (e) and (f) of Section 3.1.1 shall be applied, on a pro rata basis, to the
outstanding principal amount of all remaining Term Loans and the remaining
scheduled quarterly amortization payments in respect thereof, until all such
Term Loans have been paid in full; provided, however, that in the case of any
such prepayment of Term B Loans or Term C Loans made pursuant to clause (b),
(c), (d), (e) and (f) of Section 3.1.1, any Lender that has Term B Loans or Term
C Loans may elect not to have such Loans prepaid by delivering a notice to the
Administrative Agent at least one Business Day prior to the date that such
prepayment is to be made in which notice such Lender shall decline to have such
Loans prepaid with the amounts set forth above, in which case the amounts that
would have been applied to a prepayment of such Lender's Term B Loans or Term C
Loans shall instead be applied to a prepayment of the principal amount (if any)
of all outstanding Term A Loans until all outstanding Term A Loans have been
prepaid in full, then applied to a prepayment of the principal amount (if any)
of all outstanding Swing Line Loans until all outstanding Swing Line Loans have
been prepaid in full and then applied to a prepayment of the principal amount
(if any) of all outstanding Revolving Loans until all outstanding Revolving
Loans have been prepaid in full, with the balance (if any) being returned by the
Administrative Agent to the Borrower. No prepayment of principal of any
Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans pursuant to the proviso of the immediately
preceding sentence shall cause a reduction in the Revolving Loan Commitment
Amount or the Swing Line Loan Commitment Amount, as the case may be.

      SECTION 3.2. Interest Provisions. Interest on the outstanding principal
amount of the Loans shall accrue and be payable in accordance with this Section
3.2.

      SECTION 3.2.1. Rates. Each Base Rate Loan shall accrue interest on the
unpaid principal amount thereof for each day from and including the day upon
which such Loan was made or converted to a Base Rate Loan to but excluding the
date such Loan is repaid or converted to a LIBO Rate Loan at a rate per annum
equal to the sum of the Alternate Base Rate for such day plus the Applicable
Margin for such Loan on such day. Each LIBO Rate Loan shall accrue interest on
the unpaid principal amount thereof for each day from and including the first
day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to but excluding the date such
Loan is repaid or converted to a Base Rate Loan at a rate per annum equal to the
sum of the LIBO Rate (Reserve Adjusted) for such Interest Period plus the
Applicable Margin for such Loan on such day.

      SECTION 3.2.2. Post-Maturity Rates. After the date any principal amount of
any Loan shall have become due and payable (whether on the applicable Stated
Maturity Date, upon acceleration or otherwise), or any other monetary Obligation
(other than overdue Reimbursement Obligations which shall bear interest as
provided in Section 2.6.2) of the Borrower shall have become due and payable,
the Borrower shall pay, but only to the extent permitted by law, interest (after
as well as before judgment) on such amounts at a rate per annum equal to (a) in
the case of any overdue principal of Loans, overdue interest thereon, overdue
commitment fees or other overdue amounts in respect of Loans or other
obligations (or the related Commitments) under a particular Tranche, the rate
that would


                                      -64-
<PAGE>

otherwise be applicable to Base Rate Loans under such Tranche pursuant to
Section 3.2.1 plus 2% and (b) in the case of other overdue monetary Obligations,
the rate that would otherwise be applicable to Revolving Loans made as Base Rate
Loans plus 2%.

      SECTION 3.2.3. Payment Dates. Interest accrued on each Loan shall be
payable, without duplication:

            (a) on the Stated Maturity Date therefor;

            (b) on the date of any payment or prepayment, in whole or in part,
      of principal outstanding on such Loan, to the extent of the unpaid
      interest accrued through such date on the principal so paid or prepaid;

            (c) with respect to Base Rate Loans, on each Quarterly Payment Date
      occurring after the Amendment Effective Date hereunder;

            (d) with respect to LIBO Rate Loans, on the last day of the
      applicable Interest Period (and, if such Interest Period shall exceed
      three months, at intervals of three months after the first day of such
      Interest Period);

            (e) with respect to the principal amount of any Base Rate Loans
      converted into LIBO Rate Loans on a day when interest would not otherwise
      have been payable pursuant to clause (c), on the date of such conversion;
      and

            (f) on that portion of any Loans the Stated Maturity Date of which
      is accelerated pursuant to Section 8.2 or 8.3, immediately upon such
      acceleration.

Interest accrued on Loans, Reimbursement Obligations or other monetary
Obligations arising under this Agreement or any other Loan Document after the
date such amount is due and payable (whether on the Stated Maturity Date, upon
acceleration or otherwise) shall be payable upon demand.

      SECTION 3.3. Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay the fees set forth in this
Section 3.3. All such fees shall be non-refundable.

      SECTION 3.3.1. Commitment Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender that has a Revolving Loan
Commitment, for each day during the period (including any portion thereof when
any of the Lenders' Revolving Loan Commitments are suspended by reason of the
Borrower's inability to satisfy any condition of Article V) commencing on the
Amendment Effective Date and continuing to but excluding the Revolving Loan
Commitment Termination Date, a commitment fee on such Lender's Percentage of the
unused portion of the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount, whether or not then
available, for such day at a rate per annum


                                      -65-
<PAGE>

equal to the Applicable Commitment Fee for such day. Such commitment fees shall
be payable by the Borrower in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date, commencing
with the first such day following the Amendment Effective Date, and on the
Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date. The making of Swing Line Loans by
the Swing Line Lender shall not constitute usage under the Revolving Loan
Commitment for the purpose of calculating the commitment fees to be paid by the
Borrower to the Lenders (other than the Swing Line Lender) pursuant to this
Section 3.3.1.

      SECTION 3.3.2. Syndication Agent's, Administrative Agent's and Arranger's
Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to each of the Syndication Agent, the
Administrative Agent and the Arranger for each such Person's own account, the
fees set forth in the Fee Letter and the Administrative Agent's Fee Letter in
accordance with their respective terms.

      SECTION 3.3.3. Letter of Credit Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to

            (a) the Administrative Agent, for the pro rata account of the Issuer
      and each other Lender that has a Revolving Loan Commitment, a Letter of
      Credit fee for each day on which there shall be any Letters of Credit
      outstanding in an amount equal to the product of (i) a rate per annum
      equal to the then Applicable Margin for Revolving Loans maintained as LIBO
      Rate Loans multiplied by (ii) the Stated Amount of each such Letter of
      Credit; and

            (b) the Issuer (i) a Letter of Credit fronting fee for each day on
      which there shall be any Letters of Credit outstanding in an amount equal
      to 0.25% per annum on the Stated Amount of each such Letter of Credit, and
      (ii) from time to time promptly after demand, the normal issuance,
      presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard
      administrative costs and charges of the Issuer relating to Letters of
      Credit as from time to time in effect.

Fees payable pursuant to this Section shall be payable quarterly in arrears on
each Quarterly Payment Date and on the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination
Date.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                     CERTAIN LIBO RATE AND OTHER PROVISIONS

      SECTION 4.1. LIBO Rate Lending Unlawful. If any Lender shall determine
(which determination shall, upon notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders,
be conclusive and binding on the Borrower) that the introduction of or any
change in or in the interpretation of any law makes it unlawful, or any central
bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such
Lender to make, continue or maintain any Loan as, or to convert any Loan into, a
LIBO Rate Loan, the obligations of such Lender to make, continue, maintain or
convert any Loans as or to LIBO Rate Loans


                                      -66-
<PAGE>

shall, upon such determination, forthwith be suspended until such Lender shall
notify the Administrative Agent that the circumstances causing such suspension
no longer exist (with the date of such notice being the "Reinstatement Date"),
and (a) all LIBO Rate Loans previously made by such Lender shall automatically
convert into Base Rate Loans at the end of the then current Interest Periods
with respect thereto or sooner, if required by such law or assertion and (b) all
Loans thereafter made by such Lender and outstanding prior to the Reinstatement
Date shall be made as Base Rate Loans, with interest thereon being payable on
the same date that interest is payable with respect to the corresponding
Borrowing of LIBO Rate Loans made by Lenders not so affected.

      SECTION 4.2. Deposits Unavailable. If the Administrative Agent shall have
determined that (a) Dollar deposits in the relevant amount and for the relevant
Interest Period are not available to the Administrative Agent in its relevant
market, or (b) by reason of circumstances affecting the Administrative Agent's
relevant market, adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate
applicable hereunder to LIBO Rate Loans, then, upon notice from the
Administrative Agent to the Borrower and the Lenders, the obligations of all
Lenders under Sections 2.3 and 2.4 to make or continue any Loans as, or to
convert any Loans into, LIBO Rate Loans shall forthwith be suspended until the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

      SECTION 4.3. Increased LIBO Rate Loan Costs, etc. The Borrower agrees to
reimburse each Lender for any increase in the cost to such Lender of, or any
reduction in the amount of any sum receivable by such Lender in respect of,
making, continuing or maintaining (or of its obligation to make, continue or
maintain) any Loans as, or of converting (or of its obligation to convert) any
Loans into, LIBO Rate Loans. Such Lender shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower in writing of the occurrence of any such
event, such notice to state, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and the
additional amount required fully to compensate such Lender for such increased
cost or reduced amount. Such additional amounts shall be payable by the Borrower
directly to such Lender within five days of its receipt of such notice, and such
notice shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the
Borrower.

      SECTION 4.4. Funding Losses. In the event any Lender shall incur any loss
or expense (including any loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation
or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to make,
continue or maintain any portion of the principal amount of any Loan as, or to
convert any portion of the principal amount of any Loan into, a LIBO Rate Loan)
as a result of (i) any conversion or repayment or prepayment of the principal
amount of any LIBO Rate Loans on a date other than the scheduled last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, whether pursuant to Section 3.1 or
otherwise, (ii) any Loans not being made as LIBO Rate Loans in accordance with
the Borrowing Request therefor, or (iii) any Loans not being continued as, or
converted into, LIBO Rate Loans in accordance with the Continuation/Conversion
Notice therefor, then, upon the written notice of such Lender to the Borrower
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall, within five days
of its receipt thereof, pay directly to such Lender such amount as


                                      -67-
<PAGE>

will (in the reasonable determination of such Lender) reimburse such Lender for
such loss or expense. Such written notice (which shall include calculations in
reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and
binding on the Borrower.

      SECTION 4.5. Increased Capital Costs. If any change in, or the
introduction, adoption, effectiveness, interpretation, reinterpretation or
phase-in of, any law or regulation, directive, guideline, decision or request
(whether or not having the force of law) of any court, central bank, regulator
or other governmental authority affects or would affect the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by any Lender, the Issuer or any Person
controlling such Lender or the Issuer, and such Lender or the Issuer determines
(in its sole and reasonable discretion) that the rate of return on its or such
controlling Person's capital as a consequence of its Commitments, participation
in, or the issuance or extension of, any Letter of Credit or any Loan made by
such Lender or the Issuer is reduced to a level below that which such Lender,
the Issuer or such controlling Person could have achieved but for the occurrence
of any such circumstance, then, in any such case upon notice from time to time
by such Lender or the Issuer to the Borrower, the Borrower shall immediately pay
directly to such Lender or the Issuer additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Lender, the Issuer or such controlling Person for such reduction
in rate of return. A statement of such Lender or the Issuer as to any such
additional amount or amounts (including calculations thereof in reasonable
detail) shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on
the Borrower. In determining such amount, such Lender or the Issuer may use any
method of averaging and attribution that it (in its sole and absolute
discretion) shall deem applicable.

      SECTION 4.6. Taxes. (a) All payments by the Borrower of principal of, and
interest on, the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder (including
Reimbursement Obligations, fees and expenses) shall be made free and clear of
and without deduction for any present or future income, excise, stamp or
franchise taxes and other taxes, fees, duties, withholdings or other charges of
any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority, but excluding franchise
taxes and other taxes imposed on or measured by any Agent's, the Documentation
Agent's, the Issuer's or any Lender's net income or receipts (such non-excluded
items being called "Taxes"). In the event that any withholding or deduction from
any payment to be made by the Borrower hereunder is required in respect of any
Taxes pursuant to any applicable law, rule or regulation, then the Borrower will
(i) pay directly to the relevant taxing authority the full amount required to be
so withheld or deducted, (ii) promptly forward to the Administrative Agent an
official receipt or other documentation satisfactory to the Administrative Agent
evidencing such payment to such authority, and (iii) pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer or such
Lender such additional amount or amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net
amount actually received by such Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer or
such Lender will equal the full amount such Agent, the Documentation Agent, the
Issuer or such Lender would have received had no such withholding or deduction
been required.


                                      -68-
<PAGE>

      Moreover, if any Taxes are directly asserted against any Agent, the
Documentation Agent, the Issuer or any Lender with respect to any payment
received by such Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer or such Lender
hereunder, such Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer or such Lender may
pay such Taxes and the Borrower will promptly pay to such Person such additional
amounts (including any penalties, interest or expenses) as is necessary in order
that the net amount received by such Person after the payment of such taxes
(including any Taxes on such additional amount) shall equal the amount such
Person would have received had such Taxes not been asserted.

      If the Borrower fails to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing
authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
respective Lenders, the required receipts or other required documentary
evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Lenders for any incremental Taxes,
interest or penalties that may become payable by any Lender as a result of any
such failure. For purposes of this Section 4.6, a distribution hereunder by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to or for the account of any Lender shall be
deemed a payment by the Borrower.

      (b) Upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, each
Lender that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United
States shall, on or prior to the due date of any payments under this Agreement
to such Lender, provide two or more (as the Borrower or the Administrative Agent
may reasonably request) United States Internal Revenue Service Forms 4224 or
Forms 1001 or, solely if such Lender is claiming exemption from United States
withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to
payments of "portfolio interest", United States Internal Revenue Service Forms
W-8 and a certificate signed by a duly authorized officer of such Lender
representing that such Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section
881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, or such other forms or documents (or successor forms
or documents), appropriately completed, as may be applicable to establish the
extent, if any, to which a payment to such Lender are exempt from withholding or
deduction of Taxes.

      SECTION 4.7. Payments, Computations, etc. Unless otherwise expressly
provided, all payments by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document shall be made by the Borrower to
the Administrative Agent for the pro rata account of the Lenders, the
Documentation Agent, the Agents or the Arranger, as applicable, entitled to
receive such payment. All such payments required to be made to the
Administrative Agent shall be made, without setoff, deduction or counterclaim,
not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date due, in same day or
immediately available funds, to such account as the Administrative Agent shall
specify from time to time by notice to the Borrower. Funds received after that
time shall be deemed to have been received by the Administrative Agent on the
next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall promptly remit in
same day funds to each Lender, the Documentation Agent, each Agent or the
Arranger, as the case may be, its share, if any, of such payments received by
the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, the Documentation
Agent, such Agent or the Arranger, as the case may be. All interest and fees
shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days (including the first
day but excluding the last day) occurring during the period for which such
interest or fee is payable over


                                      -69-
<PAGE>

a year comprised of 360 days (or, in the case of interest on a Base Rate Loan
that is not calculated at the Federal Funds Rate, 365 days or, if appropriate,
366 days). Whenever any payment to be made shall otherwise be due on a day which
is not a Business Day, such payment shall (except as otherwise required by
clause (a) of the definition of the term "Interest Period") be made on the next
succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in
computing interest and fees, if any, in connection with such payment.

      SECTION 4.8. Sharing of Payments. If any Lender shall obtain any payment
or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of setoff or
otherwise) on account of any Loan or Reimbursement Obligations (other than
pursuant to the terms of Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5) in excess of its pro rata
share of payments then or therewith obtained by all Lenders entitled thereto,
such Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the
Credit Extensions made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing
Lender to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably with each of them;
provided, however, that if all or any portion of the excess payment or other
recovery is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, the purchase shall
be rescinded and each Lender which has sold a participation to the purchasing
Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the ratable
extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such selling Lender's
ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such selling
Lender's required repayment to the purchasing Lender in respect of such
recovery, to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect
of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section may, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including pursuant to Section 4.9) with respect to such participation as fully
as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this
Section applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its
rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights
of the Lenders entitled under this Section to share in the benefits of any
recovery on such secured claim.

      SECTION 4.9. Setoff. Each Lender shall, upon the occurrence of any Event
of Default described in clauses (a) through (d) of Section 8.1.9 or, with the
consent of the Required Lenders, upon the occurrence of any other Event of
Default, to the fullest extent permitted by law, have the right to appropriate
and apply to the payment of the Obligations then owing to it (whether or not
then due), and (as security for such Obligations) the Borrower hereby grants to
each Lender a continuing security interest in, any and all balances, credits,
deposits, accounts or moneys of the Borrower then or thereafter maintained with
or otherwise held by such Lender; provided, however, that any such appropriation
and application shall be subject to the provisions of Section 4.8. Each Lender
agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any
such setoff and application made by such Lender; provided, however, that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and
application. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to
other


                                      -70-
<PAGE>

rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff under applicable law or
otherwise) which such Lender may have.

      SECTION 4.10. Replacement of Lenders. Each Lender hereby severally agrees
as set forth in this Section. If any Lender (an "Affected Lender") makes demand
upon the Borrower for (or if the Borrower is otherwise required to pay) amounts
pursuant to Section 4.3, 4.5 or 4.6 and the payment of such additional amounts
are, and are likely to continue to be, more onerous in the reasonable judgment
of the Borrower than with respect to the other Lenders, the Borrower may, within
30 days of receipt by the Borrower of such demand or notice (or the occurrence
of such other event causing the Borrower to be required to pay such
compensation), as the case may be, give notice (a "Replacement Notice") in
writing to the Agents and such Affected Lender of its intention to replace such
Affected Lender with a financial institution (a "Replacement Lender") designated
in such Replacement Notice. If the Agents shall, in the exercise of their
reasonable discretion and within 30 days of their receipt of such Replacement
Notice, notify the Borrower and such Affected Lender in writing that the
designated financial institution is satisfactory to the Agents (such consent not
being required where the Replacement Lender is already a Lender), then such
Affected Lender shall, subject to the payment of any amounts due pursuant to
Section 4.4, assign, in accordance with Section 11.11.1, all of its Commitments,
Loans, Notes and other rights and obligations under this Agreement and all other
Loan Documents (including Reimbursement Obligations, if applicable) to such
designated financial institution; provided, however, that (i) such assignment
shall be without recourse, representation or warranty and shall be on terms and
conditions reasonably satisfactory to such Affected Lender and such designated
financial institution, (ii) the purchase price paid by such designated financial
institution shall be in the amount of such Affected Lender's Loans and its
Percentage of outstanding Reimbursement Obligations, together with all accrued
and unpaid interest and fees in respect thereof, plus all other amounts
(including the amounts demanded and unreimbursed under Sections 4.3, 4.5 and
4.6), owing to such Affected Lender hereunder and (iii) the Borrower shall pay
to the Affected Lender and the Agents all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Affected Lender and the Agents in connection with such
assignment and assumption (including the processing fees described in Section
11.11.1). Upon the effective date of an assignment described above, the
Replacement Lender shall become a "Lender" for all purposes under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents.

Terms for which meanings are provided in F.R.S. Board Regulation U or X or any
regulations substituted therefor, as from time to time in effect, are used in
this Section with such meanings.

      SECTION 6.14. Accuracy of Information. All material factual information
concerning the financial condition, operations or prospects of the Borrower,
each Designated Guarantor and their respective Subsidiaries heretofore or
contemporaneously furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower, any Designated
Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries in writing to the Agents, the
Documentation Agent, the Arranger, the Issuer or any Lender for purposes of or
in connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or with
respect to the New Transaction is, and all other such factual information
hereafter furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower, any Designated Guarantor or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to the Agents, the Documentation Agent, the
Arranger, the Issuer or any Lender will be, taken as a whole, true and accurate
in all material respects on the date as of which such information is dated or
certified and such information is not, or shall not be, taken as a whole, as the
case may be, incomplete by omitting to state any material fact necessary to


                                      -77-
<PAGE>

make such information not misleading at such time in light of the circumstances
under which such statements were made. Any term or provision of this Section to
the contrary notwithstanding, insofar as any of the factual information
described above includes assumptions, estimates, projections or opinions, no
representation or warranty is made herein with respect thereto; provided,
however, that to the extent any such assumptions, estimates, projections or
opinions are based on factual matters, the Borrower and each Designated
Guarantor have reviewed such factual matters and nothing has come to the
attention of any such Person in the context of such review which would lead it
to believe that such factual matters were not or are not true and correct in all
material respects or that such factual matters omit to state any material fact
necessary to make such assumptions, estimates, projections or opinions not
misleading in any material respect.

      SECTION 6.15. Solvency. The New Transaction (including, among other
things, the incurrence of the initial Credit Extension hereunder and the
execution and delivery by the Guarantors of the Guarantees) will not involve or
result in any fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance under the provisions
of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. ss.101 et seq., as from time to
time hereafter amended, and any successor or similar statute) or any applicable
state law respecting fraudulent transfers or fraudulent conveyances. On the
Amendment Effective Date, after giving effect to the New Transaction, Holdings
and its Subsidiaries and the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, in each case taken
as a whole, are Solvent.

      SECTION 6.16. Pharmaceutical Laws. (a) The Borrower, each Designated
Guarantor and each of their respective Subsidiaries has obtained all permits,
licenses and other authorizations which are required with respect to the
ownership and operations of its business under any Pharmaceutical Law, except
where the failure to obtain such permits, licenses or other authorizations would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      (b) The Borrower, each Designated Guarantor and each of their respective
Subsidiaries is in compliance with all terms and conditions of all such permits,
licenses, orders and authorizations, and is also in compliance with all
Pharmaceutical Laws, including all other limitations, restrictions, conditions,
standards, prohibitions, requirements, obligations, schedules and timetables
contained in the Pharmaceutical Laws, except where the failure to comply with
such terms, conditions or laws would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

      (c) Other than as set forth in Item 6.16(c) ("Pharmaceutical Liabilities")
of the Disclosure Schedule, none of the Borrower, any Designated Guarantor nor
any of their respective Subsidiaries has any liabilities, any claims against it
and presently any outstanding notices imposed or based upon any provision of any
Pharmaceutical Law, except for such liabilities, claims, citations or notices
which individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

      SECTION 6.17. Seniority of the Obligations and Senior Debt under the
Senior Subordinated Indenture. (a) The Senior Subordinated Notes have been
issued and sold to the underwriters thereof


                                      -78-
<PAGE>

on the Closing Date in accordance with and pursuant to the Senior Subordinated
Note Indenture and the other Senior Subordinated Note Documents and in
compliance with all laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and
all other applicable federal and state securities laws. The issuance of the
Senior Subordinated Notes and the execution of the Senior Subordinated Note
Indenture and the other Senior Subordinated Note Documents have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Holdings, the
Borrower and DRI I and will not require any consent or approval of any
governmental agency or authority that has not been obtained prior to the Closing
Date. The issuance of the Senior Subordinated Notes and the execution of the
Senior Subordinated Note Indenture and the other Senior Subordinated Note
Documents do not conflict with (i) any material provision of any material law,
(ii) the Organic Documents of Holdings, the Borrower or DRI I, (iii) any
material agreement binding upon Holdings, the Borrower or DRI I, or (iv) any
material court or administrative order or decree applicable to Holdings, the
Borrower or DRI I, and do not and will not require, or result in, the creation
or imposition of any Lien on any asset of Holdings, the Borrower or DRI I. All
representations and warranties of Holdings, the Borrower or DRI I contained in
the Senior Subordinated Note Indenture and the other Senior Subordinated Note
Documents are true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date.

      (b) Each Senior Subordinated Note Document (including the Senior
Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee) constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Holdings and the Borrower, as the
case may be, enforceable against each of Holdings and the Borrower, as the case
may be, in accordance with its terms. The subordination provisions of each such
Senior Subordinated Note Document will be enforceable against the holders of the
Senior Subordinated Notes by the holder of any "Senior Debt" (as defined in the
Senior Subordinated Note Indenture). All Obligations, including those to pay
principal of and interest (including post-petition interest) on the Loans and
Reimbursement Obligations, and fees and expenses in connection therewith,
constitute "Senior Debt" (as defined in the Senior Subordinated Note Indenture)
and all such Obligations are entitled to the benefits of the subordination
created by such Senior Subordinated Note Document. Each of Holdings and the
Borrower acknowledges that the Agents, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer and
each Lender is entering into this Agreement, and is extending its Commitments,
in reliance upon the subordination provisions of such Senior Subordinated Note
Documents and this Section.

      SECTION 6.18. Year 2000. Each Obligor believes that the "Year 2000
Problem" (that is, the risk that computer applications used by such Obligor may
be unable to recognize and properly perform date-sensitive functions involving
certain dates prior to and any date after December 31, 1999) could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

such properties is no longer economically desirable.

      SECTION 7.1.4. Insurance. Each of the Borrower and each Designated
Guarantor will, and will cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to,

      written notice of cancellation or of lapse shall be given to the
      Administrative Agent by the insurer.

            (e) The Borrower, such Designated Guarantor or such Subsidiary, as

Lender or its representatives whether or not any representative of the Borrower,
such Designated Guarantor or such Subsidiary is present, so long as the
Borrower, such Designated Guarantor or such Subsidiary has been afforded a
reasonable opportunity to be present) and (iii) to examine, and photocopy
extracts from, any of its books or other corporate or partnership records. The
cost and expense of one such visit (the "Paid Visit") by each Agent in each
Fiscal Year shall be borne by the Borrower; provided, however, that the cost and
expenses of any visit made by such Agent after a Default or an Event of Default
has occurred and is then continuing shall be for the account of the Borrower and
shall not count as the Paid Visit made by such Agent.

      SECTION 7.1.6. Environmental Covenant. Each of the Borrower and each
Designated Guarantor will, and will cause each of their respective Subsidiaries

      property, a Mortgage) and a Perfection Certificate, together with Uniform
      Commercial Code financing statements (form UCC-1) executed and delivered
      by the Subsidiary naming the Subsidiary as the debtor and the
      Administrative Agent as the secured party, or other similar instruments or
      documents, in appropriate form for filing under the Uniform Commercial
      Code and any other applicable recording statutes, in the case of real
      property, of all jurisdictions as may be necessary or, in the opinion of
      the Administrative Agent, desirable to perfect the security interest of
      the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Subsidiary Security Agreement or
      a Mortgage, as the case may be; and

            (b) the Borrower shall promptly deliver the Borrower Pledge
      Agreement to the Agents, duly executed and delivered by an Authorized
      Officer of the Borrower (unless so executed and delivered previously), and
      shall promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, the Subsidiary Pledge
      Agreement to the Agents, duly executed and delivered by an Authorized
      Officer of the relevant Subsidiary (unless so executed and delivered
      previously), and shall promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
      Administrative Agent under a Pledge Agreement (or a supplement thereto)
      certificates (if any) representing all of the issued and outstanding
      shares of Capital Stock of such Subsidiary owned by the Borrower or any
      Subsidiary of the Borrower, as the case may be, along with undated stock
      powers for such certificates, executed in blank, or, if any securities
      subject thereto are uncertificated securities or are held through a
      financial intermediary, confirmation and evidence satisfactory to the
      Agents that appropriate book entries have been made in the relevant books
      or records of a financial intermediary or the issuer of such securities,
      as the case may be, or other appropriate steps shall have been taken under
      applicable law resulting in the perfection of the security interest
      granted in favor of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of a
      Pledge Agreement;

together, in each case, with such opinions, in form and substance and from
counsel satisfactory to the Agents, as the Agents may reasonably request;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, no Foreign Subsidiary
shall be required to execute and deliver (x) a Mortgage or the Subsidiary
Security Agreement (or a supplement thereto) or (y) the Subsidiary Guaranty (or
a supplement thereto) in the event that such execution and delivery thereof
would result in a material increase in tax or similar liabilities for the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, nor will the Borrower or
any Subsidiary of the Borrower be required to deliver in pledge pursuant to a
Pledge Agreement in excess of 65% of the total combined voting power of all
classes of Capital Stock of a Foreign Subsidiary entitled to vote in the event
that such pledge would result in a material increase in tax or similar
liabilities for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis.

      SECTION 7.1.8. Future Leased Property and Future Acquisitions of Real
Property; Future Acquisition of Other Property. (a) Prior to entering into any
new lease of real property or renewing any existing lease of real property
following the Amendment Effective Date (including any lease entered into in
connection with a Sale and Leaseback Transaction), each of the Borrower and each
Designated Guarantor shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries that is not a Foreign Subsidiary to, use its (and their)
commercially reasonable best efforts (which shall not require the expenditure of
cash or the making of any material concessions under the relevant lease) to
deliver to the Administrative Agent a Property Waiver executed by the lessor of
any real property that is to be leased by the Borrower, such Designated
Guarantor or such Subsidiary for a term in excess of one year in any state which
by statute grants such lessor a "landlord's" (or similar) Lien which is superior
to the Administrative Agent's.

      (b) In the event that the Borrower, any Designated Guarantor or any of
their respective Subsidiaries that is not a Foreign Subsidiary shall acquire any
real property having a value as determined in good faith by the Agents in excess
of $1,000,000 in the aggregate, the Borrower, such Designated Guarantor or such
Subsidiary shall, promptly after such acquisition, execute a Mortgage and
provide the Agents with (i) evidence of the completion (or satisfactory
arrangements for the completion) of all recordings and filings of such Mortgage
as may be necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of the Agents, desirable
effectively to create a valid, perfected first priority Lien, subject to Liens
permitted by Section 7.2.3, against the properties purported to be covered
thereby, (ii) mortgagee's title insurance policies in favor of the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties in amounts and in
form and substance and issued by insurers, reasonably satisfactory to the
Agents, with respect to the property purported to be covered by such Mortgage,
insuring that title to such property is marketable and that the interests
created by the Mortgage constitute valid first Liens thereon free and clear of
all defects and encumbrances other than as approved by the Agents, and such
policies shall also include a revolving credit endorsement and such other
endorsements as the Agents shall request and shall be accompanied by evidence of
the payment in full of all premiums thereon, and (iii) such other approvals,
opinions, or documents as the Agents may reasonably request; provided, however,
that the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is not a Foreign Subsidiary
will not have to execute and deliver a Mortgage in respect of such property
under the terms of this clause (b) if (A) the Borrower or such Subsidiary
acquires such property for the purposes of entering into a Sale and Leaseback
Transaction pursuant to Section 7.2.14 (such property a "Subject Property"), (B)
such Subject Property is sold within one year of the date of its purchase, and

creditors of any Designated Guarantor shall, to the extent permitted by GAAP,
clearly establish the corporate separateness of such Designated Guarantor from

action, or conduct its affairs in a manner, which is likely to result in the
corporate existence of such Designated Guarantor on the one hand and of any

Designated Guarantor in a bankruptcy, reorganization or other insolvency
proceeding.

indebtedness of the Borrower to such Designated Guarantor or such Subsidiary, if
the Agents, after an Event of Default has occurred, so requests, shall be
collected, enforced and received by such Designated Guarantor or such Subsidiary
as trustee for the Agents, the Issuer and the Lenders and be paid over to the
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Agents, the Issuer and the Lenders on
account of the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Agents, the Issuer and the
Lenders, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the obligations of
such Designated Guarantor or such Subsidiary hereunder or under each other Loan
Document to which it is a party. Prior to the transfer by any Designated
Guarantor or any their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Borrower) of any
note or negotiable instrument evidencing any indebtedness of the Borrower to

note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is subject to this
subordination.

Guarantor agrees with the Agents, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer and each
Lender that, until all Commitments have terminated, all Letters of Credit have
terminated or expired and all Obligations have been paid and performed in full,
each of the Borrower and each Designated Guarantor will perform the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.2.

      SECTION 7.2.1. Business Activities. (a) The Borrower will not, and will
not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, engage in any business activity, except
business activities of the type in which the Borrower and its Subsidiaries are
engaged on the Closing Date and such activities as may be incidental, similar or
related thereto.

            (b) No Designated Guarantor will engage in any business activity
      other than

            (i) (A) in the case of Holdings, (1) its continuing ownership of the
      99% general partnership interest in the Borrower, all the shares of
      Capital Stock of DRI I and 99% of all of the shares of Capital Stock of
      each of Duane Reade IP and Duane Reade Realty and (2) guaranteeing the
      obligations of Duane Reade Realty under leases relating to realty that is
      subleased to the Borrower, (B) in the case of DRI I, (1) its continuing
      ownership of the 1% general partnership interest in the Borrower and 1% of
      all of the shares of Capital Stock of each of Duane Reade IP and Duane
      Reade Realty and (2) guaranteeing the obligations of Duane Reade Realty
      under leases relating to realty that is subleased to the Borrower, (C) in
      the case of Duane Reade IP, its continuing ownership of the Intellectual
      Property Collateral (as defined in the Affiliate Security Agreement) in
      which it has an interest and the licensing thereof to the Borrower and
      such other activities directly related thereto (including the filing of
      applications and registrations relating to all Trademark Collateral (as
      defined in the Affiliate Security Agreement) in which it has an interest)
      and (D) in the case of Duane Reade Realty, its entering into leases and
      acquiring realty that is concurrently subleased to the Borrower and such
      other activities directly related thereto, and

      (including SEC reporting requirements) and the obligations applicable to
      it under the Loan Documents and the Material Documents to which such
      Designated Guarantor is a party. Without limiting the generality of the
      immediately preceding sentence, no Parent Guarantor will take any action,
      including the filing of any income tax return, that would result in the
      Borrower ceasing to be treated as a partnership within meaning of Section
      761(a) of the Code for Federal income tax purposes.

8.1.9) shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, and be
continuing, the Administrative Agent, upon the direction of the Required
Lenders, shall by notice to the Borrower declare all or any portion of the
outstanding principal amount of the Loans and other Obligations (including
Reimbursement Obligations) to be due and payable, require the Borrower to
provide cash collateral to be deposited with the Administrative Agent in an
amount equal to the undrawn amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding and/or
declare the Commitments (if not theretofore terminated) to be terminated,
whereupon the full unpaid amount of such Loans and other Obligations which shall
be so declared due and payable shall be and become immediately due and payable,
without further notice, demand or presentment, and/or, as the case may be, the
Commitments shall terminate and the Borrower shall deposit with the
Administrative Agent cash collateral in an amount equal to the undrawn amount of
all Letters of Credit outstanding.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                    GUARANTY

      SECTION 9.1. Guaranty. Each Designated Guarantor hereby jointly and
severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably

            (a) guarantees the full and punctual payment when due, whether at
      stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand
      or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Borrower and each other Obligor
      now or hereafter existing, whether for principal, interest, fees, expenses
      or otherwise (including all such amounts which would become due but for
      the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the United
      States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. ss.362(a), and the operation of Sections
      502(b) and 506(b) of the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.
      ss.502(b) and ss.506(b)), and

            (b) indemnifies and holds harmless each Secured Party and each
      holder of a Note for any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable
      attorney's fees and expenses) incurred by such Secured Party or such
      holder, as the case may be, in enforcing any rights under the guaranty set
      forth in this Article IX;

provided, however, that (i) DRI I, with respect to its guaranty of the
Obligations of Holdings, and (ii) each Affiliate Guarantor shall be liable under
the guaranty set forth in this Article IX for the maximum amount of such
liability that can be incurred without rending such guaranty, as it relates to
such Designated Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent
conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount. The guaranty
set forth in this Article IX constitutes a guaranty of payment when due and not
of collection, and each Designated Guarantor specifically agrees that it shall
not be necessary or required that any Secured Party or any holder of any Note
exercise any right,


                                     -104-
<PAGE>

assert any claim or demand or enforce any remedy whatsoever against the Borrower
or any other Obligor (or any other Person) before or as a condition to the
obligations of each Designated Guarantor under the guaranty set forth in this
Article IX.

      SECTION 9.2. Acceleration of Parent Guaranty. Each Designated Guarantor
agrees that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default of the nature set forth
in clauses (a) through (d) of Section 8.1.9, at a time when any of the
Obligations of the Borrower and each other Obligor may not then be due and
payable, then each Designated Guarantor agrees that it will pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Secured Parties forthwith the full
amount which would be payable under the guaranty set forth in this Article IX by
each Designated Guarantor if all such Obligations were then due and payable.

      SECTION 9.3. Guaranty Absolute, etc. The guaranty set forth in this
Article IX shall in all respects be a continuing, absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable guaranty of payment, and shall remain in full force and effect until
all Obligations of the Borrower and each other Obligor have been paid in full in
cash, all obligations of each Designated Guarantor under the guaranty set forth
in this Article IX shall have been paid in full in cash, all Letters of Credit
have been terminated or expired, all Rate Protection Agreements have been
terminated or expired and all Commitments shall have terminated. Each Designated
Guarantor guarantees that the Obligations of the Borrower and each other Obligor
will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and each
other Loan Document under which they arise, regardless of any law, regulation or
order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms
or the rights of any Secured Party or any holder of any Note with respect
thereto. The liability of each Designated Guarantor under the guaranty set forth
in this Article IX shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable irrespective
of:

            (a) any lack of validity, legality or enforceability of this
      Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document;

            (b) the failure of any Secured Party or any holder of any Note

                  (i) to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or
            remedy against the Borrower, any other Obligor or any other Person
            (including any other guarantor (including any Designated Guarantor))
            under the provisions of this Agreement, any Note, any other Loan
            Document or otherwise, or

                  (ii) to exercise any right or remedy against any other
            guarantor (including any Designated Guarantor) of, or collateral
            securing, any Obligations of the Borrower or any other Obligor;


                                     -105-
<PAGE>

            (c) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any
      other term of, all or any of the Obligations of the Borrower or any other
      Obligor, or any other extension, compromise or renewal of any Obligation
      of the Borrower or any other Obligor;

            (d) any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination of any
      Obligations of the Borrower or any other Obligor for any reason, including
      any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and
      shall not be subject to (and the each Designated Guarantor hereby waives
      any right to or claim of) any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment
      or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality,
      nongenuineness, irregularity, compromise, unenforceability of, or any
      other event or occurrence affecting, any Obligations of the Borrower or
      any other Obligor or otherwise;

            (e) any amendment to, rescission, waiver, or other modification of,
      or any consent to departure from, any of the terms of this Agreement, any
      Note or any other Loan Document;

            (f) any addition, exchange, release, surrender or non-perfection of
      any collateral, or any amendment to or waiver or release or addition of,
      or consent to departure from, any other guaranty, held by any Secured
      Party or any holder of any Note securing any of the Obligations of the
      Borrower or any other Obligor; or

            (g) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
      defense available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, the Borrower,
      any surety or any guarantor.

      SECTION 9.4. Reinstatement, etc. Each Designated Guarantor agrees that the
guaranty set forth in this Article IX shall continue to be effective or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment (in whole or in part)
of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any
Secured Party or any holder of any Note, upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of the Borrower or any other Obligor or otherwise, all as though
such payment had not been made.

      SECTION 9.5. Waiver, etc. Each Designated Guarantor hereby waives
promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice with respect to
any of the Obligations of the Borrower or any other Obligor and the guaranty set
forth in this Article IX and any requirement that the Administrative Agent, any
other Secured Party or any holder of any Note protect, secure, perfect or insure
any security interest or Lien, or any property subject thereto, or exhaust any
right or take any action against the Borrower, any other Obligor or any other
Person (including any other guarantor) or entity or any collateral securing the
Obligations of the Borrower or any other Obligor.

      SECTION 9.6. Postponement of Subrogation, etc. Each Designated Guarantor
agrees that it will not exercise any rights which it may acquire by way of
rights of subrogation under the guaranty set forth in this Article IX, by any
payment made under the guaranty set forth in this Article IX or otherwise, until
the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations of the Borrower and each
other


                                     -106-
<PAGE>

Obligor, the termination or expiration of all Letters of Credit, the termination
or expiration of all Rate Protection Agreements and the termination of all
Commitments. Any amount paid to any Designated Guarantor on account of any such
subrogation rights prior to the payment in full in cash of all Obligations of
the Borrower and each other Obligor shall be held in trust for the benefit of
the Secured Parties and each holder of a Note and shall immediately be paid to
the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and each holder
of a Note and credited and applied against the Obligations of the Borrower and
each other Obligor, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement; provided, however, that if

            (a) each Designated Guarantor has made payment to the Secured
      Parties and each holder of a Note of all or any part of the Obligations of
      the Borrower and each other Obligor, and

            (b) all Obligations of the Borrower and each other Obligor have been
      paid in full in cash, all Letters of Credit have been terminated or
      expired, all Rate Protection Agreements have been terminated or expired
      and all Commitments have been permanently terminated,

each Secured Party and each holder of a Note agrees that, at any Designated
Guarantor's request, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties
and the holders of the Notes, will execute and deliver to the applicable
Designated Guarantor appropriate documents (without recourse and without
representation or warranty) necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to
such Designated Guarantor of an interest in the Obligations of the Borrower or
such other Obligor, as the case may be, resulting from such payment by such
Designated Guarantor. In furtherance of the foregoing, for so long as any
Obligations or Commitments remain outstanding, each Designated Guarantor shall
refrain from taking any action or commencing any proceeding against each of the
Borrower and each other Obligor (or its successors or assigns, whether in
connection with a bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise) to recover any amounts in
the respect of payments made under the guaranty set forth in this Article IX to
any Secured Party or any holder of a Note.

      SECTION 9.7. Successors, Transferees and Assigns; Transfers of Notes, etc.
The guaranty set forth in this Article IX shall:

            (a) be binding upon each Designated Guarantor and its successors,
      transferees and assigns; and

            (b) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Administrative
      Agent and each other Secured Party.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (b), any Lender may
assign or otherwise transfer (in whole or in part) any Note or Credit Extension
held by it to any other Person or entity, and such other Person or entity shall
thereupon become vested with all rights and benefits in respect thereof


                                     -107-
<PAGE>

granted to such Lender under any Loan Document (including the guaranty set forth
in this Article IX) or otherwise, subject, however, to any contrary provisions
in such assignment or transfer, and to the provisions of Section 11.11 and
Article X.

      SECTION 9.8. Right of Contribution. Each Designated Guarantor hereby
agrees that to the extent that a Designated Guarantor shall have paid more than
its proportionate share of any payment made under the guaranty set forth in this
Article IX to any Secured Party or any holder of a Note, such Designated
Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against
any other Designated Guarantor under such guaranty who has not paid its
proportionate share of such payment. Each Designated Guarantor's right of
contribution shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 9.6. The
provisions of this Section 9.8 shall in no respect limit the obligations and
liabilities of any Designated Guarantor to the Administrative Agent and each
other Secured Party for the full amount by such Designated Guarantor under such
guaranty.

                                    ARTICLE X

                                   THE AGENTS

      SECTION 10.1. Actions. Each Lender hereby appoints DLJ as its Syndication
Agent and Fleet as its Administrative Agent under and for purposes of this
Agreement, the Notes and each other Loan Document. Each Lender authorizes the
Agents to act on behalf of such Lender under this Agreement, the Notes and each
other Loan Document and, in the absence of other written instructions from the
Required Lenders received from time to time by the Agents (with respect to which
each of the Agents agrees that it will comply, except as otherwise provided in
this Section or as otherwise advised by counsel), to exercise such powers
hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to or required of the
Agents by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as may be
reasonably incidental thereto. Each Lender hereby indemnifies (which indemnity
shall survive any termination of this Agreement) the Agents, ratably in
accordance with their respective Term Loans outstanding and Commitments (or, if
no Term Loans or Commitments are at the time outstanding and in effect, then
ratably in accordance with the principal amount of Term Loans held by such
Lender, and their respective Commitments as in effect in each case on the date
of the termination of this Agreement), from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses of any kind or nature
whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted
against, any of the Agents in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Notes and any other Loan Document, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, and as to which any Agent is not reimbursed by the Borrower or
any other Obligor (and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower or any
other Obligor to do so); provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for
the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses which are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final proceeding to have resulted solely from such Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Agents shall not be required to take
any action hereunder, under


                                     -108-
<PAGE>

the Notes or under any other Loan Document, or to prosecute or defend any suit
in respect of this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document, unless it is
indemnified hereunder to its satisfaction. If any indemnity in favor of any of
the Agents shall be or become, in such Agent's determination, inadequate, such
Agent may call for additional indemnification from the Lenders and cease to do
the acts indemnified against hereunder until such additional indemnity is given.

      SECTION 10.2. Funding Reliance, etc. Unless the Administrative Agent shall
have been notified by telephone, confirmed in writing, by any Lender by 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on the day prior to a Borrowing that such Lender will
not make available the amount which would constitute its Percentage of such
Borrowing on the date specified therefor, the Administrative Agent may assume
that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent and,
in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding
amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such amount
available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender severally agrees and the
Borrower agrees to repay the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
the Administrative Agent made such amount available to the Borrower to the date
such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at the interest rate
applicable at the time to Loans comprising such Borrowing.

      SECTION 10.3. Exculpation. None of the Agents, the Swing Line Lender, the
Issuer or the Arranger nor any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or agents shall be liable to any Lender for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or in
connection herewith or therewith, except for its own willful misconduct or gross
negligence, nor responsible for any recitals or warranties herein or therein,
nor for the effectiveness, enforceability, validity or due execution of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, nor for the creation, perfection or
priority of any Liens purported to be created by any of the Loan Documents, or
the validity, genuineness, enforceability, existence, value or sufficiency of
any collateral security, nor to make any inquiry respecting the performance by
the Borrower of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document. Any
such inquiry which may be made by any Agent, the Swing Line Lender or the Issuer
shall not obligate it to make any further inquiry or to take any action. The
Agents, the Swing Line Lender and the Issuer shall be entitled to rely upon
advice of counsel concerning legal matters and upon any notice, consent,
certificate, statement or writing which the Agents, the Swing Line Lender or the
Issuer, as applicable, believe to be genuine and to have been presented by a
proper Person.

      SECTION 10.4. Successor. The Syndication Agent may resign as such upon one
Business Day's notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent may resign as such at any time upon at least 30 days' prior
notice to the Borrower and all Lenders. If the Administrative Agent at any time
shall resign, the Required Lenders may, with the prior consent of the Borrower
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), appoint another Lender as a
successor Administrative Agent which shall thereupon become the Administrative
Agent hereunder. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment,
within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving notice of


                                     -109-
<PAGE>

resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be one of the
Lenders or a commercial banking institution organized under the laws of the
United States or a United States branch or agency of a commercial banking
institution, and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a
successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to receive from the retiring Administrative Agent such documents of
transfer and assignment as such successor Administrative Agent may reasonably
request, and shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the
retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder as the Administrative Agent, the provisions of (i) this
Article X shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, and (ii)
Section 11.3 and Section 11.4 shall continue to inure to its benefit.

      SECTION 10.5. Credit Extensions by each Agent. Each Agent, the Swing Line
Lender and the Issuer shall have the same rights and powers with respect to (x)
(i) in the case of the Agents and the Swing Line Lender, the Credit Extensions
made by it or any of its Affiliates and (ii) in the case of the Issuer, the
Loans made by it or any of its Affiliates, and (y) the Notes held by such Agent,
the Swing Line Lender, the Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates as any
other Lender and may exercise the same as if it were not an Agent or the Issuer.
Each Agent, the Swing Line Lender, the Issuer and each and their respective
Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any
kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the
Borrower as if such Agent, the Swing Line Lender or Issuer were not an Agent,
the Swing Line Lender or the Issuer hereunder.

      SECTION 10.6. Credit Decisions. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently of each Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Arranger, the Swing
Line Lender, the Issuer and each other Lender, and based on such Lender's review
of the financial information of the Borrower, this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents (the terms and provisions of which being satisfactory to such Lender)
and such other documents, information and investigations as such Lender has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit decision to extend its Commitments. Each
Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently of each Agent, the
Documentation Agent, the Arranger, the Swing Line Lender, the Issuer and each
other Lender, and based on such other documents, information and investigations
as it shall deem appropriate at any time, continue to make its own credit
decisions as to exercising or not exercising from time to time any rights and
privileges available to it under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

      SECTION 10.7. Copies, etc. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt
notice to each Lender and the Issuer of each notice or request required or
permitted to be given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement (unless concurrently delivered to the Lenders and
the Issuer by the Borrower). The Administrative Agent will distribute to each
Lender and the Issuer each document or instrument received for such Lender's or
the Issuers's account and copies


                                     -110-
<PAGE>

of all other communications received by the Administrative Agent from the
Borrower for distribution to the Lenders and/or the Issuer by the Administrative
Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

      SECTION 10.8. The Swing Line Lender, the Issuer, the Documentation Agent,
the Syndication Agent and the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything
else to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the
Swing Line Lender, the Issuer, the Documentation Agent and the Agents, in their
respective capacities as such, each in such capacity, shall have no duties or
responsibilities under this Agreement or any other Loan Document nor any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or otherwise exist against the Swing Line Lender, the Issuer, the
Documentation Agent or any Agent, as applicable, in such capacity except as are
explicitly set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

      SECTION 11.1. Waivers, Amendments, etc. The provisions of this Agreement
and of each other Loan Document may from time to time be amended, modified or
waived, if such amendment, modification or waiver is in writing and consented to
by the Borrower and each Obligor party thereto and by the Required Lenders;
provided, however, that no such amendment, modification or waiver which would:

            (a) modify any requirement hereunder that any particular action be
      taken by all the Lenders or by the Required Lenders shall be effective
      unless consented to by each Lender;

            (b) modify this Section 11.1, or clause (a) of Section 11.10, change
      the definition of "Required Lenders", increase any Commitment Amount or
      the Percentage of any Lender, reduce, or extend the due date for, any fees
      described in Section 3.3 (other than any fee referred to in Section
      3.3.2), release any Guarantor from its obligations under any Guaranty, or
      release all or substantially all of the collateral security (except in
      each case as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, any such
      Guaranty, a Security Agreement or a Pledge Agreement) or extend any
      Commitment Termination Date shall be made without the consent of each
      Lender adversely affected thereby;

            (c) extend the due date for, or reduce the amount of, (i) any
      scheduled repayment or prepayment of principal of or interest on any Loan
      (or reduce the principal amount of or rate of interest on any Loan) or
      (ii) any repayment of any Reimbursement Obligation (or reduce the amount
      of or rate of interest on any Reimbursement Obligation) shall be made
      without the


                                     -111-
<PAGE>

      consent of the holder of the Note evidencing such Loan or, in the case of
      a Reimbursement Obligation, the Issuer owed, and those Lenders
      participating in, such Reimbursement Obligation;

            (d) affect adversely the interests, rights or obligations of any
      Agent, the Swing Line Lender, the Issuer or the Arranger (in its capacity
      as Agent, the Swing Line Lender, the Issuer or the Arranger), unless
      consented to by such Agent, the Swing Line Lender, the Issuer or the
      Arranger, as the case may be; or

            (e) have the effect (either immediately or at some later time) of
      enabling the Borrower to satisfy a condition precedent to the making of a
      Revolving Loan, the Swing Line Loan or the issuance of a Letter of Credit
      without the consent of Lenders holding at least 51% of the Revolving Loan
      Commitments; or

            (f) amend, modify or waive the provisions of clause (a)(i) of
      Section 3.1.1 or clause (b) of Section 3.1.2 or effect any amendment,
      modification or waiver that by its terms adversely affects the Lenders
      participating in any Tranche differently from those of Lenders
      participating in other Tranches, without the consent of the holders of the
      Notes evidencing greater than 50% of the aggregate amount of Loans
      outstanding under each Tranche affected by such modification, or, in the
      case of a modification affecting the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount, the
      Lenders holding greater than 50% of the Revolving Loan Commitments.

No failure or delay on the part of any Agent, the Issuer, any Lender or the
holder of any Note in exercising any power or right under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such power or right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. No notice to or
demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle it to any notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances. No waiver or approval by any Agent, the Issuer,
any Lender or the holder of any Note under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall, except as may be otherwise stated in such waiver or approval, be
applicable to subsequent transactions. No waiver or approval hereunder shall
require any similar or dissimilar waiver or approval thereafter to be granted
hereunder.

      SECTION 11.2. Notices. All notices and other communications provided to
any party hereto under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be in
writing or by facsimile and addressed, delivered or transmitted to such party at
its address or facsimile number set forth on its signature page hereto or on
Schedule II hereto or, in the case of a Lender that becomes a party hereto after
the date hereof, as set forth in the Lender Assignment Agreement pursuant to
which such Lender becomes a Lender hereunder or at such other address or
facsimile number as may be designated by such party in a notice to the other
parties. Any notice, if mailed and properly addressed with postage prepaid or if
properly addressed and sent by pre-paid courier service, shall be deemed given
when received; any


                                     -112-
<PAGE>

notice, if transmitted by facsimile, shall be deemed given when transmitted (and
electronic confirmation of receipt thereof has been received).

      SECTION 11.3. Payment of Costs and Expenses. The Borrower agrees to pay on
demand all reasonable expenses of each of the Agents and the Arranger (including
the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel to the Agents and the
Arranger and of local or foreign counsel, if any, who may be retained by counsel
to the Agents) in connection with

            (a) the syndication by the Syndication Agent and the Arranger of the
      Loans, the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
      Agreement and of each other Loan Document, including schedules and
      exhibits, and any amendments, waivers, consents, supplements or other
      modifications to this Agreement or any other Loan Document as may from
      time to time hereafter be required, whether or not the transactions
      contemplated hereby are consummated;

the Borrower hereby, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law,

Act of 1933, as amended, or Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), free and harmless from and
against any and all actions, causes of action, suits, losses, costs, liabilities
and damages, and expenses actually incurred in connection therewith
(irrespective of whether any such Indemnified Party is a party to the action for
which indemnification hereunder is sought), including reasonable attorneys' fees
and disbursements (collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), incurred by the
Indemnified Parties or any of them as a result of, or arising out of, or
relating to

            (a) any transaction financed or to be financed in whole or in part,
      directly or indirectly, with the proceeds of any Credit Extension;

            (b) the entering into and performance of this Agreement and any
      other Loan Document by any of the Indemnified Parties (including any
      action brought by or on behalf of the Borrower as the result of any
      determination by any Lender to make any Credit Extension hereunder);

            (c) any investigation, litigation or proceeding related to any
      acquisition or proposed acquisition by Duane Reade Realty, the Borrower or
      any of its Subsidiaries of all or any portion of the stock or assets of
      any Person, whether or not such Agent, the Documentation Agent, the
      Issuer, the Arranger or such Lender is party thereto;

            (d) any investigation, litigation or proceeding related to any
      environmental cleanup, audit, compliance or other matter relating to Duane
      Reade Realty's, the Borrower's or any of its Subsidiaries' compliance with
      or liability under Environmental Law or the Release by Duane Reade Realty,
      the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any Hazardous Material; or

            (e) the presence on or under, or the escape, seepage, leakage,
      spillage, discharge, emission or release from, any real property owned or
      operated by Duane Reade Realty, the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof of
      any Hazardous Material present on or under such property in a manner
      giving rise to liability at or prior to the time Duane Reade Realty, the
      Borrower or such Subsidiary owned or operated such property (including any
      losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, costs, expenses or claims asserted
      or arising under any Environmental Law), regardless of whether caused by,
      or within the control of, Duane Reade Realty, the Borrower or such
      Subsidiary,

except for any such Indemnified Liabilities arising for the account of a
particular Indemnified Party by reason of the relevant Indemnified Party's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Borrower and its permitted successors and
assigns hereby waive, release and agree not to make any claim, or bring any cost
recovery action against, any Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer, the
Arranger or any Lender under CERCLA or any state equivalent, or any similar law
now existing or hereafter enacted, except to the extent arising out of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of any Indemnified Party. It is expressly
understood and agreed that to the extent that any of such Persons is strictly
liable under


                                     -114-
<PAGE>

any Environmental Laws, Duane Reade Realty's or the Borrower's obligation to
such Person under this indemnity shall likewise be without regard to fault on
the part of Duane Reade Realty or the Borrower, to the extent permitted under
applicable law, with respect to the violation or condition which results in
liability of such Person. If and to the extent that the foregoing undertaking
may be unenforceable for any reason, Duane Reade Realty and the Borrower hereby
agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each
of the Indemnified Liabilities which is permissible under applicable law.

under Sections 4.8 and 10.1, shall in each case survive any assignment or
participation pursuant to Section 11.11, any termination of this Agreement, the
payment in full of all Obligations and the termination of all Commitments. The
representations and warranties made by the Borrower and each other Obligor in
this Agreement and in each other Loan Document shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and each such other Loan Document.

      SECTION 11.6. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as
to such provision and such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of
this Agreement or such Loan Document or affecting the validity or enforceability
of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

      SECTION 11.7. Headings. The various headings of this Agreement and of each
other Loan Document are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or such other Loan Document or any
provisions hereof or thereof.

      SECTION 11.8. Execution in Counterparts, Effectiveness, etc. This

together but one and the same agreement. This Agreement shall become effective
pursuant to the terms of the Amendment Agreement.

      SECTION 11.9. Governing Law; Entire Agreement. THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES
AND, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED THEREIN, EACH OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT SHALL EACH BE DEEMED TO BE A CONTRACT MADE UNDER AND GOVERNED BY THE

Loan Documents constitute the entire understanding among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any prior agreements, written
or oral, with respect thereto.

      SECTION 11.10. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns; provided,


                                     -115-
<PAGE>

however, that (a) the Borrower may not assign or transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each of the Agents
and all Lenders, and (b) the rights of sale, assignment and transfer of the
Lenders are subject to Section 11.11.

      SECTION 11.11. Sale and Transfer of Loans and Notes; Participations in
Loans and Notes. Each Lender may assign, or sell participations in, its Loans
and Commitments to one or more other Persons, on a non pro rata basis (except as

      SECTION 11.11.1. Assignments. Any Lender (the "Assignor Lender"),

            (a) with the written consents of the Borrower, the Agents and (in
      the case of any assignment of participations in Letters of Credit or
      Revolving Loan Commitments) the Issuer (which consents shall not be
      unreasonably delayed or withheld and which consents of the Agents and the
      Issuer shall not be required in the case of assignments made by or to DLJ
      or any of its Affiliates and which consent of the Borrower shall not be
      required if a Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
      continuing), may at any time assign and delegate to one or more commercial
      banks or other financial institutions or funds which are regularly engaged
      in making, purchasing or investing in loans or securities, and

            (b) with notice to the Borrower, the Agents, and (in the case of any
      assignment of participations in Letters of Credit or Revolving Loan
      Commitments) the Issuer, but without the consent of the Borrower, the
      Agents or the Issuer, may assign and delegate to any of its Affiliates or
      Related Funds or to any other Lender

(each Person described in either of the foregoing clauses as being the Person to
whom such assignment and delegation is to be made, being hereinafter referred to
as an "Assignee Lender"), all or any fraction of such Lender's total Loans,
participations in Letters of Credit and Letter of Credit Outstandings with
respect thereto and Commitments (which assignment and delegation shall be, as
among Revolving Loan Commitments, Revolving Loans and participations in Letters
of Credit, of a constant, and not a varying, percentage) (the "Assigned Amount")
in a minimum aggregate amount of (i) $1,000,000 in the case of an assignment to
an existing Lender or an Affiliate or Related Fund thereof and $5,000,000 in the
case of an assignment to an Assignee Lender that is not an existing Lender or an
Affiliate or Related Fund thereof or (ii) the then remaining amount of such
Lender's Loans and Commitments; provided, however, that any such Assignee Lender
will comply, if applicable, with the provisions contained in Section 4.6 and the
Borrower, each other Obligor, the Agents and the Issuer shall be entitled to
continue to deal solely and directly with such Assignor Lender in connection
with the interests so assigned and delegated to an Assignee Lender until

            (c) written notice of such assignment and delegation, together with
      payment instructions, addresses and related information with respect to
      such Assignee Lender, shall have


                                     -116-
<PAGE>

      been given to the Borrower and the Agents by such Assignor Lender and such
      Assignee Lender;

            (d) such Assignee Lender shall have executed and delivered to the
      Borrower and the Agents a Lender Assignment Agreement, accepted by the
      Agents;

            (e) the processing fees described below shall have been paid; and

            (f) the Administrative Agent shall have registered such assignment
      and delegation in the Register pursuant to clause (b) of Section 2.7.

From and after the date that the Agents accept such Lender Assignment Agreement
and such assignment and delegation is registered in the Register pursuant to
clause (b) of Section 2.7, (i) the Assignee Lender thereunder shall be deemed
automatically to have become a party hereto and to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder have been assigned and delegated to such Assignee Lender
in connection with such Lender Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and
obligations of a Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and (ii)
the Assignor Lender, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have
been assigned and delegated by it in connection with such Lender Assignment
Agreement, shall be released from its obligations hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.7, within ten Business
Days after its receipt of notice that the Agent has received an executed Lender
Assignment Agreement, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent (for delivery to the relevant Assignee Lender) new Notes
evidencing such Assignee Lender's assigned Loans and Commitments and, if the
Assignor Lender has retained Loans and Commitments hereunder, replacement Notes
in the principal amount of the Loans and Commitments retained by the Assignor
Lender hereunder (such Notes to be in exchange for, but not in payment of, those
Notes then held by such Assignor Lender). Each such Note requested shall be
dated the date of the predecessor Notes, if any. The Assignor Lender shall mark
such predecessor Notes "exchanged" and deliver them to the Borrower. Unless
otherwise specified in the Lender Assignment Agreement, interest and fees in
respect of the Assigned Amount that (A) have accrued prior to the date of such
assignment shall be for the account of the Assignor Lender and (B) accrue on and
subsequent to the date of such assignment shall be for the account of the
Assignee Lender. Accrued interest and fees shall be paid at the same time or
times provided in this Agreement. Such Assignor Lender or such Assignee Lender
(unless the Assignor Lender or the Assignee Lender is DLJ or any of its
Affiliates) must also pay a processing fee to the Administrative Agent upon
delivery of any Lender Assignment Agreement in the amount of $3,500, unless such
assignment and delegation is by a Lender to its Affiliate or Related Fund or if
such assignment and delegation consists of a pledge by a Lender to a Federal
Reserve Bank (or in the case of a Lender that is an investment fund, to the
trustee under the indenture to which such fund is a party), as provided below or
is otherwise consented to by the Administrative Agent. Any attempted assignment
and delegation not made in accordance with this Section 11.11.1 shall be null
and void. Nothing contained in this Section 11.11.1 shall prevent or prohibit
any Lender from pledging its rights (but not its obligations to make Loans or
participate in


                                     -117-
<PAGE>

Letters of Credit or Letter of Credit Outstandings) under this Agreement and/or
its Loans and/or its Notes hereunder (i) to a Federal Reserve Bank in support of
borrowings made by such Lender from such Federal Reserve Bank, or (ii) any
Lender that is a fund that invests in bank loans may pledge all or any portion
of its rights (but not its obligations to make Loans or participate in Letters
of Credit or Letter of Credit Outstandings) hereunder to any trustee or any
other representative of holders of obligations owed or securities issued by such
fund as security for such obligations or securities, in either case without
notice to or consent of the Borrower or the Agents; provided, however, that (A)
such Lender shall remain a "Lender" under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, and (B) any assignment by such trustee shall be subject to the
provisions of clause (a) of this Section 11.11.1. In the event that S&P, Moody's
or Thompson's BankWatch (or InsuranceWatch Ratings Service, in the case of
Lenders that are insurance companies (or Best's Insurance Reports, if such
insurance company is not rated by Insurance Watch Ratings Service)) shall, after
the date that any Lender with a Commitment to make Revolving Loans or
participate in Letters of Credit becomes a Lender, downgrade the long-term
certificate of deposit rating or long-term senior unsecured debt rating of such
Lender, and the resulting rating shall be below BBB-, Baa3 or C (or BB, in the
case of Lender that is an insurance company (or B, in the case of an insurance
company not rated by InsuranceWatch Ratings Service)) respectively, then the
Issuer or the Borrower (with the consent of the Agents and the Issuer) shall
have the right, but not the obligation, upon notice to such Lender and the
Agents, to replace such Lender with an Assignee Lender in accordance with and
subject to the restrictions contained in this Section, and such Lender hereby
agrees to transfer and assign without recourse (in accordance with and subject
to the restrictions contained in this Section) all its interests, rights and
obligations in respect of its Revolving Loan Commitment under this Agreement to
such Assignee Lender; provided, however, that (i) no such assignment shall
conflict with any law, rule and regulation or order of any governmental
authority and (ii) such Assignee Lender shall pay to such Lender in immediately
available funds on the date of such assignment the principal of and interest and
fees (if any) accrued to the date of payment on the Loans made, and Letters of
Credit participated in, by such Lender hereunder and (iii) the Borrower shall
have paid such Lender all other amounts accrued for such Lender's account or
owed to it hereunder or under any other Loan Document.

      SECTION 11.11.2. Participations. Any Lender may at any time sell to one or
more commercial banks or other financial institution (each such commercial bank
and other financial institution being herein called a "Participant")
participating interests in any of the Loans, Commitments, participations in
Letters of Credit and Letters of Credit Outstandings or other interests of such
Lender hereunder; provided, however, that

            (a) no participation contemplated in this Section shall relieve such
      Lender from its Commitments or its other obligations hereunder or under
      any other Loan Document;

            (b) such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance
      of its Commitments and such other obligations;


                                     -118-
<PAGE>

            (c) the Borrower and each other Obligor, the Agents and the Issuer
      shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
      with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and each of
      the other Loan Documents;

            (d) no Participant, unless such Participant is an Affiliate or
      Related Fund of such Lender, or is itself a Lender, shall be entitled to
      require such Lender to take or refrain from taking any action hereunder or
      under any other Loan Document, except that such Lender may agree with any
      Participant that such Lender will not, without such Participant's consent,
      agree to (i) any reduction in the interest rate or amount of fees that
      such Participant is otherwise entitled to, (ii) a decrease in the
      principal amount, or an extension of the final Stated Maturity Date, of
      any Loan in which such Participant has purchased a participating interest
      or (iii) a release of all or substantially all of the collateral security
      under the Loan Documents or any Guarantor under any Guaranty, in each case
      except as otherwise specifically provided in a Loan Document; and

            (e) the Borrower shall not be required to pay any amount under
      Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 11.3 and 11.4 that is greater than the amount
      which it would have been required to pay had no participating interest
      been sold.

The Borrower acknowledges and agrees, subject to clause (e) above, that, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each Participant, for purposes of
Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 4.9, 11.3 and 11.4, shall be considered a
Lender.

      SECTION 11.12. Other Transactions. Nothing contained herein shall preclude
any Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer, the Arranger or any other Lender
from engaging in any transaction, in addition to those contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the Borrower or any of its Affiliates
in which the Borrower or such Affiliate is not restricted hereby from engaging
with any other Person.

      SECTION 11.13. Independence of Covenants. All covenants contained in this
Agreement and each other Loan Document shall be given independent effect such
that, in the event a particular action or condition is not permitted by any of
such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or be
otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall not, unless
expressly so provided in such first covenant, avoid the occurrence of a Default
or an Event of Default if such action is taken or such condition exists.

      SECTION 11.14. Confidentiality. The Agents, the Documentation Agent, the
Issuer, the Arranger and the Lenders shall hold all non-public information
obtained pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement or obtained by them
based on a review of the books and records of Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries in accordance with their customary procedures for handling
confidential information of this nature, but may make disclosure to any of their
examiners, regulators (including the


                                     -119-

National Association of Insurance Commissioners), Affiliates, outside auditors,
counsel and other professional advisors in connection with this Agreement or as
reasonably required by any potential bona fide transferee, participant or
assignee, or in connection with the exercise of remedies under a Loan Document,
or as requested by any governmental agency or representative thereof or pursuant
to legal process; provided, however, that

            (a) unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order,
      each Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer, the Arranger and each
      Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower of any request by any
      governmental agency or representative thereof (other than any such request
      in connection with an examination of the financial condition of such
      Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer, Arranger and Lender by such
      governmental agency) for disclosure of any such non-public information
      and, where practicable, prior to disclosure of such information;

            (b) prior to any such disclosure pursuant to this Section 11.14,
      each Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuer, the Arranger and each
      Lender shall require any such bona fide transferee, participant and
      assignee receiving a disclosure of non-public information to agree, for
      the benefit of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, in writing

                  (i) to be bound by this Section 11.14; and

                  (ii) to require such Person to require any other Person to
            whom such Person discloses such non-public information to be
            similarly bound by this Section 11.14;

            (c) disclosure may, with the consent of the Agents and the Borrower,
      be made by any Lender to any direct or indirect contractual counterparties
      of such Lender in swap agreements or such contractual counterparties'
      professional advisors; provided that such contractual counterparty or
      professional advisor agrees in writing to keep such information
      confidential to the same extent required of the Lenders hereunder; and

            (d) except as may be required by an order of a court of competent
      jurisdiction and to the extent set forth therein, no Lender shall be
      obligated or required to return any materials furnished by the Borrower or
      any Affiliate thereof.

      SECTION 11.15. Forum Selection and Consent to Jurisdiction. ANY LITIGATION
BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR

<PAGE>

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

      SECTION 4.1. Representations and Warranties. In order to induce the
Lenders to execute and deliver this Amendment Agreement, each of the Borrower
and each Designated Guarantor hereby represents and warrants as set forth below:

            (a) After giving effect to this Amendment Agreement, the amendment
      of the Existing Credit Agreement does not impair the validity,
      effectiveness or priority of the Liens granted pursuant to the Pledge
      Agreement and the Security Agreement (as such terms are defined in the
      Existing Credit Agreement, collectively, the "Security Documents"), and
      such Liens continue unimpaired with the same priority to secure repayment
      of all Obligations, whether heretofore or hereafter incurred. Neither the
      amendment of the Existing Credit Agreement effected pursuant to this
      Amendment Agreement nor the execution, delivery, performance or
      effectiveness of this


                                       -4-
<PAGE>

      Amendment Agreement requires that any new filings be made or other action
      taken to perfect or to maintain the perfection of such Liens. The position
      of the Lenders with respect to such Liens, the Collateral (as defined in
      the Security Documents) in which a security interest was granted pursuant
      to the Security Documents, and the ability of the Administrative Agent to
      realize upon such Liens pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents
      have not been adversely affected in any material respect by the amendment
      of the Existing Credit Agreement effected pursuant to this Amendment
      Agreement or by the execution, delivery, performance or effectiveness of
      this Amendment Agreement.

            (b) Each Obligor reaffirms as of the Amendment Effective Date such
      Person's respective covenants and agreements contained in the Credit
      Agreement, each Security Agreement and each Pledge Agreement to which such
      Person is a party, including, in each case, as such covenants and
      agreements may be modified by the Amendment Agreement. Each such Obligor
      further confirms that each such Loan Document to which such Person is a
      party is and shall continue to be in full force and effect and the same
      are hereby ratified, approved and confirmed in all respects, except that
      upon the occurrence of the Amendment Effective Date, all references in
      such Loan Documents to the "Credit Agreement", "Loan Documents",
      "thereunder", "thereof", "therein" or words of like or similar import
      shall mean and be a reference to the Credit Agreement and the Loan
      Documents (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement).

            (c) Both before and immediately after giving effect to this
      Amendment Agreement,

                  (i) the representations and warranties set forth in Article VI
            of the Credit Agreement (excluding, however, those contained in
            Section 6.7 of the Credit Agreement) and each other Loan Document
            are, in each case, true and correct (unless stated to relate solely
            to an earlier date, in which case such representations and
            warranties shall be true and correct as of such earlier date);

                  (ii) except as disclosed by the Borrower or any Parent
            Guarantor to the Agents, the Documentation Agent and the Lenders
            pursuant to Section 6.7 of the Credit Agreement

                        (A) no labor controversy, litigation, arbitration or
                  governmental investigation or proceeding (including any
                  relating to any Pharmaceutical Law) is pending or, to the
                  knowledge of the Borrower or any Parent Guarantor, threatened
                  against the Borrower, any Parent Guarantor or any of their
                  respective Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to
                  have a Material Adverse Effect or which purports to affect the
                  legality, validity or enforceability of this Second Amendment,
                  the Credit Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document;
                  and


                                      -5-
<PAGE>

                        (B) no development has occurred in any labor
                  controversy, litigation, arbitration or governmental
                  investigation or proceeding (including any relating to any
                  Pharmaceutical Law) disclosed pursuant to Section 6.7 of the
                  Credit Agreement which could reasonably be expected to have a
                  Material Adverse Effect; and

                  (iii) no Default has (or will have) occurred and is (or will
            be) continuing, and neither the Borrower, any Parent Guarantor nor
            any of their respective Subsidiaries are in material violation of
            any law or governmental regulation or court order or decree
            (including any Pharmaceutical Law).

                                    ARTICLE V

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      SECTION 5.1. Cross-References. References in this Amendment Agreement to
any Article or Section are, unless otherwise specified or otherwise required by
the context, to such Article or Section of this Amendment Agreement.

      SECTION 5.2. Loan Document Pursuant to Credit Agreement. This Amendment
Agreement is a Loan Document executed pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement and shall be construed, administered and applied in accordance
with all of the terms and provisions of the Third Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement.

      SECTION 5.3. Successors and Assigns. This Amendment Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

      SECTION 5.4. Counterparts. This Amendment Agreement may be executed by the
parties hereto in several counterparts, each of which when executed and
delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which shall constitute
together but one and the same agreement.

      SECTION 5.5. Governing Law. THIS AMENDMENT AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY
AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

                     FIRST AMENDMENT TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


         THIS AMENDMENT (the "AMENDMENT") is made as of the 13th day of March
2000 and shall hereby constitute the first amendment to the employment
agreement, dated October 27, 1997, and effective as of June 18, 1997 (the
"AGREEMENT"), and is made by and among Duane Reade, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "COMPANY") and Anthony Cuti (the "EXECUTIVE"). Capitalized
terms that are not otherwise defined in this Amendment shall have the meanings
assigned to them in the Agreement.

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, the Executive and the Company entered into the Agreement,
effective June 18, 1997 and Executive is currently employed by the Company under
the Agreement; and

         WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 34 of the Agreement (as numbered prior to
this Amendment), the Company and the Executive may amend the agreement by an
instrument in writing, signed by the Executive and the Chairman of the Board of
Directors of the Company; and

         WHEREAS, the parties desire to enter into this Amendment, which
Amendment shall be effective as of the date first set forth above;

         NOW THEREFORE, and in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
agreements set forth herein, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree
as follows:

         1. EARNINGS AMOUNT. The following definition is hereby inserted in
Section I of the Agreement after the definition of "EBITDA ACHIEVEMENT FACTOR"
and before the definition of "EMPLOYMENT RELATED AGREEMENTS":


         "EARNINGS AMOUNT" shall mean, as of the Termination Date, the greater
         of :

         (i) for any period during the Term of Employment, the largest dollar
         amount equal to the sum of the Base Salary, Incentive Bonus and Target
         Bonus earned by the Executive (or deferred by him) during such period,
         and

         (ii) the dollar amount equal to the result of the following formula:

         (S + MTB + MIB) x Y, where

         S= Base Salary earned by the Executive during the period immediately
         prior to the Termination Date,

         MTB = the maximum Target Bonus the Executive could have earned during
         the period immediately prior to the Termination Date,


<PAGE>


         MTB = the maximum Incentive Bonus the Executive could have earned
         during the period immediately prior to the Termination Date, and

         Y = an appreciation rate of 10% per annum through the end of the then
         current Term of Employment.

         2. EMPLOYMENT RELATED AGREEMENTS. The definition of "EMPLOYMENT RELATED
AGREEMENT" in Section 1 of the Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and
replaced by the following:


         "EMPLOYMENT RELATED AGREEMENTS" shall mean this Agreement, the DLJ
Note, the Company Note, the Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement, the
Non-Qualified Performance Stock Option Agreement and the Non-Qualified
Super-Performance Stock Option Agreement, as such documents may be amended from
time to time.

                       the Company's standard payroll practices, for the
                       twenty-four-month period immediately following the
                       Termination Date (the "CONTINUATION PERIOD") an amount

<PAGE>

                  (viii) EXTENSION OF CONTINUATION PERIOD. If:

                           (A) the Termination Date is on or prior to the sixth
                  anniversary of the Start Date.

                           (B) the Termination Date is within the one-year
                  period following the date of a Sale of the Company,

                  which constituted the Company prior to its sale are at least
                  anticipated (as reasonably determined by the Company's outside
                  auditors) to achieve the Base EBITDA Target for the year in
                  which occurs the Termination Date,


                  then the Continuation Period referred to in Section 17(a)(ii)

         on the Earnings Amount, and deeming the Term of Employment for purposes
         of Section 15(a) to equal 20 years. The SERP Payment specified in this

         Amount and based on a Term of Employment, for purposes of
         Section 15(a), equal to 20 years. The SERP Payment specified in this
         Section 17(c)(v) will be in full satisfaction of all obligations under
         the SERP.

         7. GROSS-UP: SECTION 280G OF THE CODE. The following is added to the
Agreement as Section 18 thereof and the prior Sections 18 through 34 are
renumbered accordingly as Sections 19 through 35.

                  18. GROSS-UP: SECTION 280G OF THE CODE. Notwithstanding
         anything herein to the contrary. If it is determined that any portion
         of the Payments (as hereinafter defined) provided in this Agreement
         would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the
         Code or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax
         (such excise tax, together with any interest or penalties thereon,
         is herein referred to as an "EXCISE TAX"), then the Executive shall be
         entitled to an additional cash payment (a "GROSS-UP PAYMENT") in an
         amount that will place the Executive in the same after tax economic
         position that the Executive would have enjoyed if the Exotic Tax had
         not applied to the Payment. The amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall
         be determined by a nationally recognized accounting firm agreed upon by
         Executive and the Company (the "ACCOUNTING FIRM"). No Gross-Up



                                        3
<PAGE>

         Payments shall be payable hereunder if the Accounting Firm determines
         that the Payments are not subject to an Excise Tax. The Accounting Firm
         shall be paid by the Company for services performed hereunder.

                  PAYMENT means (1) any amount due or paid to the Executive
         under this Agreement. (ii) any amount that is due or paid to the
         Executive under any plan, program or arrangement of the Company and its
         subsidiaries, and (iii) any amount of benefits that is due or payable
         to the Executive under this Agreement or under any plan, program or
         arrangement of the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates not
         otherwise covered under clause (i) or (ii) hereof which must reasonably
         be taken into account under Section 280G of the Code and the
         regulations pertinent thereto in determining the amount of the
         "PARACHUTE PAYMENTS" received by the Executive, including, without
         limitation, any amounts which must be taken into account under the Code
         and regulations as a results of (x) the acceleration of the vesting of
         Options or any other equity compensation that the Executive may receive
         in the future.

                  (b) DETERMINATION OF GROSS-UP PAYMENT. Subject to the
         provision of Section 18(c), all determinations required under this
         Section 18, including whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the
         amount of the Payments constituting excess parachute payments, and the
         amount of the Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by the Accounting Firm,
         which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the
         Executive and the Company within fifteen days of any date reasonably
         requested by the Executive or the Company on which a determination
         under this Section 18 is necessary or advisable. The Company shall pay
         the Executive in cash the initial Gross-Up Payments within 5 days of
         the receipt by the Executive and the Company of the Accounting Firm's
         determination. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is
         payable by the Executive, the Company shall cause the Accounting Firm
         to provide the Executive with an opinion that the Accounting Firm has
         substantial authority under the Code and regualtions promulgated
         thereunder not to report an Excise Tax on the Executive's federal
         income tax return. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be
         binding upon the Executive and the Company. If the initial Gross-Up
         Payment is insufficient to completely place the Executive in the same
         after-tax economic position that the Executive would have enjoyed if
         the Excise Tax had not applied to the Payments (hereinafter an
         "UNDERPAYMENT"), the Company, after exhausting its remedies under
         Section 18(c) below, shall promptly pay the Executive in cash an
         additional Gross-UP Payment in respect of the Underpayment.

                  (c) PROCEDURES. The Executive shall notify the Company in
         writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if
         successful, would require the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up
         Payment. Such notice shall be given as soon as practicable after the
         Executive knows of such claim and shall appraise the Company of the
         nature of the claim and the date on which the claim is requested to be
         paid. The Executive agrees not to pay the claim until the expiration of
         the thirty day period following the date on which the Executive
         nofities the Company, or such shorter period ending on the date the
         taxes with respect to such claim are due (the "NOTICE PERIOD"). If the
         Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of
         the Notice Period that it desires to contest the claim, the Executive
         shall: (i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the
         Company relating to the claim; (ii) take such action in connection with
         the claim as the Company may reasonably request, including without
         limitation accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by
         an attorney reasonably selected by the Company and reasonably
         acceptable to the Executive; (iii) cooperate with the Company in good
         faith in contesting the claim; and (iv) permit the Company to
         participate in any proceedings relating to the claim. The Executive
         shall permit the Company to control all proceedings related to the
         claim and, at its option, permit the Company to pursue or forgo any and
         all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings, and conferences with
         the taxing authority in respect of such claim. If requested by the
         Company, the Executive agrees either to pay the tax claimed and sue for
         a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner and to
         prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative
         tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdictions and in one or more
         appellate courts as the Company shall determine: PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
         that, if the Company directs the Executive to pay such



                                        4


<PAGE>

         claim and pursue a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such
         payment to the Executive on an after-tax and interest-free basis (the
         "ADVANCE"). The Company's control of the contest related to the claim
         shall be limited to the issues related to the Gross-Up Payment and the
         Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be,
         any other issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing
         authority. If the Company does not notify the Executive in writing
         prior to the end of the Notice Period of its desire to contest the
         claim, the Company shall pay the Executive in cash an additional
         Gross-Up Payment in respect of the excess parachute payments that are
         the subject of the claim, and the Executive agrees to pay the amount of
         the Excise Tax that is the subject of the claim so the applicable
         taxing authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (d) REPAYMENTS. If, after receipt by the Executive of an
         Advance, the Executive becomes entitled to a refund with respect to the
         claim to which such Advance relates, the Executive shall pay the
         Company the amount of the refund (together with any interest paid or
         credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after receipt by
         the Executive of an Advance, a determination is made that the Executive
         shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to the claim and the
         Company does not promptly notify the Executive of its intent to contest
         the denial of refund, then the amount of the Advance shall not be
         required to be repaid by the Executive and the amount thereof shall
         offset the amount of the additional Gross-Up Payment then owing to the
         Executive.

                  (e) FURTHER ASSURANCES. The Company shall indemnify the
         Executive and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from
         any costs, expenses, penalties, fines, interest or other liabilities
         ("LOSSES") incurred by the Executive with respect to the exercise by
         the Company of any of its rights under this Section 18, including,
         without limitation, any Losses related to the Company's decision to
         contest a claim or any imputed income to the Executive resulting from
         any Advance or action taken on the Executive's behalf by the Company
         hereunder. The Company shall pay all legal fees and expenses incurred
         under this Section 18, and shall promptly reimburse the Executive for
         the reasonable expenses of the Accounting Firm, including, without
         limitation, the fees and expenses related to the opinion referred to in
         Section 18(b).

         8. CONTINUING EFFECT OF THE AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect as amended herein.

         9. ATTORNEYS FEES. The Company shall pay or reimburse Executive for all
reasonable legal fees and costs incurred in the drafting, negotiation and
execution of this Amendment.

         10. COUNTERPARTS. This Amendment may be executed by the parties hereto
in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but both such
counterparts shall together constitute one and the same document.
