                                Item 1. Business
Company Overview

         Hungarian  Telephone and Cable Corp.  ("HTCC" or the "Registrant"  and,
together with its  consolidated  subsidiaries,  the  "Company")  provides  basic
telephone services in five defined regions within the Republic of Hungary (each,
an "Operating  Area" and together,  the "Operating  Areas")  pursuant to 25-year
telecommunications  concessions  granted  by  the  Hungarian  government.  HTCC,
through its four  majority-owned  operating  subsidiaries  (each,  an  Operating
Company and together,  the "Operating  Companies"),  owns and operates virtually
all  existing  public  telephone  exchanges  and local  loop  telecommunications
network  facilities in its Operating Areas and is the exclusive provider through
November 1, 2002 of non-cellular local voice telephone services in such areas.

         The Company acquired its concession rights from the Hungarian  Ministry
of Transportation,  Telecommunications and Water Management (the "Ministry") for
$11.5  million  (at  historical  exchange  rates)  and  purchased  the  existing
telecommunications    infrastructure   in   the   Operating   Areas,   including
approximately  61,400 access lines, from Magyar  Tavkozlesi Rt.  ("Matav"),  the
formerly  State-controlled  monopoly  telephone  company,  for $23.2 million (at
historical  exchange  rates).  Kelet-Nograd  Com Rt.  ("KNC") and Raba Com.  Rt.
("Raba-Com"),   two  of  the   Operating   Companies,   acquired   the  existing
telecommunications  assets  in their  respective  Operating  Areas in the  first
quarter of 1995, while Papa es Tersege Telefon  Koncesszios Rt.  ("Papatel") and
Hungarotel  Tavkozlesi Rt.  ("Hungarotel"),  the other two Operating  Companies,
acquired the existing  telecommunications  assets in their respective  Operating
Areas on January 1, 1996. Since the acquisition of such existing  networks,  the
Operating Companies have incurred capital expenditures through December 31, 1999

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

of $181  million (at  historical  exchange  rates) to expand and  upgrade  their
network   facilities   which  has  resulted  in  the   completion  of  a  modern
communications  network in each of the Operating  Areas,  which networks include
new digital  switches and increased  network  capacity,  utilizing the latest in
communications  transmission technology.  As of December 31, 1999, the Company's
telecommunications  networks had  approximately  200,500 access lines in service
(including  pay phones).  The completion of the Company's  network  construction
program has resulted in the addition of  approximately  139,100 new access lines
in service (including pay phones) to the 61,400 access lines acquired from Matav
and the  replacement  of all of the 10,810 manual  exchange  lines acquired from
Matav.

         The  Company  completed  its  network  modernization  and  construction
program in each of its Operating  Areas primarily  through turnkey  construction
contracts  with  Siemens   Telefongyar   Kft.,   Ericsson   Technika  and  Fazis
Telecommunication  System  Design and  Construction  Corporation.  The Company's
networks now have the capacity,  with some additional capital  expenditures,  to
provide basic telephone services to virtually all of the estimated 276,500 homes
and 36,200 business and other institutional  subscribers  (including  government
institutions)  within its Operating Areas. The build-out was primarily  financed
through a $170 million  credit  facility with Postabank es  Takarekpenztar  (the
"Original   Postabank   Credit   Facility"),   a   Hungarian   commercial   bank
("Postabank"),  which was subsequently refinanced and a $47.5 million contractor
financing   facility.   See  "-  Revision  of  Capital   Structure,"  "-  Recent
Developments,"  Item 3 "Legal  Proceedings,"  Item 7 Management  Discussion  and
Analysis of Financial  Conditions and Results of Operations - Introduction"  and
Notes 1(a) and 10(d) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

         The following  table sets forth certain  information as of December 31,
1999 with respect to each of the Operating Companies.

The Republic of Hungary

         Hungary is located in Central  Europe  bordering on Austria,  Slovenia,
Croatia,  Yugoslavia,  Romania, Ukraine and Slovakia. Six West European capitals
are within a one-hour  flight.  Its total area is  approximately  93,030  square
kilometers.  It has 10.1 million  inhabitants,  approximately  2 million of whom
reside in Hungary's capital, Budapest.

         For nearly 40 years,  Hungary was under  central  state  control with a
one-party government and a centrally planned economy. Democracy was restored and
the  foundations  of a market  economy were built  between  1988 and 1990.  Free
elections were held in 1990. Today, Hungary has a parliamentary democracy with a
single-chamber  National  Assembly.  As a result of a large scale  privatization
effort, private enterprise has become the basis of the Hungarian economy.

         Today,  Hungary is  considered  the most  developed  country in Central
Europe.  Since  1989,  foreign  direct  investment  has been  approximately  $20
billion.  Foreign direct  investment was approximately $2 billion in 1999 and is
expected to stay at that level in 2000. On a per capita basis,  Hungary has been
the largest Central  European  recipient of foreign direct  investment since the
transition to a market economy.  In comparison to Poland and the Czech Republic,
Hungary  received  (on a per capita  basis)  nearly 3 times the level of foreign
direct investment of Poland and twice that of the Czech Republic.

         Since  1995,  the  Hungarian  government  has  embarked  on an economic
stabilization  effort  aimed at putting  the  economy on a  sustainable  path of
low-inflationary growth. Hungary has experienced the following annual GDP growth
rates since the initiation of that effort:  1.7% in 1995;  1.3% in 1996; 3.5% in
1997;  5% in 1998,  and  4.9% in  1999.  The  unemployment  rate  has  gradually
decreased from 11.1% in 1995 to 7.0% in 1999.  The Hungarian  inflation rate has
been steadily  decreasing as well as evidenced by the following declining annual
inflation rates: 28.2% in 1995; 23.6% in 1996; 18.2% in 1997; 14.5% in 1998; and
10.0% in 1999.

         In March 1998,  Hungary's  application  for  membership in the European
Union  ("EU") was  accepted.  Hungary is now in the process of  negotiating  the
terms of its official accession into the EU. Hungary is not expected to become a
member of the EU until 2003 at the earliest.  In March 1999,  Hungary joined the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  Hungary is also a member of the World Trade
Organization.

Overview of Hungarian Telecommunications Industry

    Early State of Hungarian Telecommunications Industry

        In 1989,  the  state-owned  Post,  Telegraph and  Telephone  ("PTT") was
divided  into three  separate  companies:  the  Hungarian  Broadcasting  Company
("Antenna Hungaria"),  the Hungarian Post Office ("Magyar Posta") and Matav. The
Hungarian  PTT was  historically  the exclusive  provider of  telecommunications
services in Hungary. The Hungarian  telecommunications  market was significantly
underdeveloped  without  the  necessary  investment  in  the  telecommunications
infrastructure necessary to achieve a comparable level of teledensity to that of
Western  Europe.  As  of  December  31,  1995,  Hungary  had a  basic  telephone
penetration  rate of approximately 21 telephone access lines per 100 inhabitants
compared to a European  Union average of  approximately  48 access lines per 100
inhabitants and a United States average of approximately 60 access lines per 100
inhabitants. Of such access lines in Hungary,  approximately 40% were located in
Budapest (in which approximately 20% of Hungary's  population  resides).  In the
Company's Operating Areas, access line penetration was approximately nine access
lines  per 100  inhabitants  as of  December  31,  1995.  By  comparison,  basic
telephone  penetration  rates in other Eastern  European  countries  such as the
Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Bulgaria, as of December 31, 1995, were 23,
15, 21 and 28 access lines per 100 inhabitants, respectively.

    Privatization of Matav and Local Telephone Service

         Beginning  in 1992,  the  Hungarian  government  began the  process  of
privatizing  Hungary's  telecommunications  industry  by selling an initial  30%
stake in Matav  (raised  to 67% in 1995) to a  consortium  called  MagyarCom,  a
company  wholly  owned by  Deutsche  Telekom  AG,  the German  public  telephone
operator  ("Deutsche   Telekom"),   and  Ameritech,   the  United  States  based
telecommunications  company. In 1997 Matav completed its initial public offering
pursuant to which  MagyarCom's  stake in Matav was reduced to approximately  60%
and the Hungarian  State's stake was reduced to approximately  6%. The Hungarian
State also retained certain  shareholder rights by retaining one "Golden Share."
In 1999 the Hungarian  State sold its  remaining 6% ownership  interest in Matav
but retained its "Golden Share." As of December 31, 1999,  MagyarCom owned 59.5%
of Matav while 40.5% was publicly traded.

         In  1992  the   Ministry   divided   the   country   into  54   primary
telecommunications  service  areas  in  order  to  take  some  of  such  primary
telecommunications service areas out of Matav's national network with respect to
the provision of local basic telephone  service while allowing Matav to continue
its  monopoly in the  provision  of domestic  and  international  long  distance
services. In 1993, the Ministry solicited bids for concessions to build, own and
operate  telecommunications  networks  in the 25  service  areas  which had been
chosen  to  exit  the  Matav  system.  As of  December  31,  1999,  23 of the 25
concessions for which the Ministry  solicited bids had been awarded.  Holders of
those  concessions today (each a Local Telephone  Operator,  "LTO", and together
the "LTOs") include: the Company (presently 5 areas);  United Telecom Investment
Rt. ("UTI"), a consortium formed by Alcatel Austria AG and US Telecom East, Inc.
(4 areas); Vivendi-Telecom Hungary ("Vivendi") owned by affiliates of Vivendi SA
of France and General Electric  Capital Corp. (5 areas);  an affiliate of United
Pan-Europe  Communications NV ("UPC") (1 area); a consortium comprised of Bezeq,
the Israeli PTO, and Matav (3 areas);  and Matav (5 areas).  Matav also retained
the rights to service 2 areas for which there were no successful  bidders.  Each
of the LTOs  (including  Matav) received 25 year licenses to provide local basic
telephone  service  with  exclusivity  rights  in their  respective  concessions

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

through  2002 (2001 in the case of Matav  except for 5 areas in which  Matav has
exclusivity rights through 2002). In addition to the fees paid to the government
which  aggregated  approximately  $80.0 million (at historical  exchange rates),
each of the non-Matav LTOs  negotiated a separate asset purchase  agreement with
Matav for each  concession  area's existing basic telephone plant and equipment,
which led to the transfer of approximately  260,000 access lines from a total of
1.2 million access lines in the Matav system. Matav's concession areas presently
cover  approximately  75% of Hungary's  population and  approximately 70% of its
geographic area.

    Cellular Service

         In addition to the  liberalization  of basic  telephone  services,  the
Ministry also initially  selected two consortia to provide  nationwide  cellular
telephone  services.  A consortium  comprised of Matav and MediaOne  Group Inc.,
formerly  part of U.S.  West,  was granted two  licenses to provide  both analog
(NMT-450)  ("Westel  450") and digital  (GSM-900)  ("Westel 900") services while
Pannon GSM  Tavkozlesi  ("Pannon") was granted a license to provide only digital
cellular  services.  Pannon's  shareholders  include  Telenor Invest A/S, Norway
(25.8%); Tele Danmark A/S (6.6%); Sonera Holding NV (23%), Media Tel Holding Rt.
(15.2%);  and KPN NV, the Dutch phone company ("KPN") (29.4%). In 1999, MediaOne
announced that it was going to sell its holdings in Westel 450 and Westel 900 to
Deutsche  Telekom.  Matav has announced that it intends to exercise an option it
has to purchase the interests in Westel 450 and Westel 900 that Deutsche Telekom
is acquiring from MediaOne.

         In June  1999,  a  consortium  comprised  of  Vodaphone  Air Touch Plc.
(50.1%),  RWE Telliance  (19.9%),  Antenna Hungaria (20%) and Magyar Posta (10%)
(together,  "Vodaphone") was the winning bidder for a digital 1800-megahertz (or
DCS frequency) mobile phone license. It began operations in late 1999.

    Domestic and International Long Distance Services

         At the end of 2001,  Matav's  right to provide  exclusive  domestic and
international  long distance voice  transmission  is due to expire.  In 1998, to
further  stimulate  future  competition  in this market,  the  Ministry  awarded
Pan-Tel  Rt., a newly  formed  Hungarian  company  ("Pan-Tel"),  the licenses to
provide such services as data transmission,  voice mail and other services which
are  not  subject  to  exclusive  concessions.   Pan-Tel  started  building  its
telecommunications network in 1998 which network is nearly complete. The current
shareholders of Pan-Tel include MAV Rt. (the Hungarian railway company) (25.1%),
PT Investment Holding Company (25.9%) and KPN (49%).

    The Hungarian Telecommunications Industry Today

         The Ministry  recently  announced  that it will revise its laws in 2000
regarding the  regulation  of the  telecommunication  market in accordance  with
European Union standards. The regulation of telephony,  cable television and the
Internet  would be  affected.  However,  the  Company  does not expect  that the
exclusivity period of its concession rights will be affected.

        Since the privatization of the Hungarian  telecommunications market, the
LTOs and Matav have spent  approximately  $822 million as of September  30, 1998
(at  September  30,  1998  exchange  rates)  to  build  modern  state-of-the-art
telecommunications   networks   throughout   Hungary.   As  a  result   of  such
construction,  Matav had approximately 2.9 million access lines connected to its
telecommunications  networks and the other LTOs (including the Company) had over
800,000  access  lines  connected  to their  telecommunications  networks  as of
December 31, 1999.

        In the mobile telecommunications  marketplace, Westel 450 and Westel 900
had 98,000 and  842,000  subscribers,  respectively,  as of December  31,  1999.
Pannon had approximately 669,000 subscribers as of December 31, 1999.

        Due to  the  completion  of  the  Company's  network  modernization  and
construction  program,  access line penetration in the Company's Operating Areas
has  increased to 30 access lines per 100  inhabitants  as of December 31, 1999.
Given  that the  Company's,  Matav's,  and the other  LTOs'  investments  in the
Hungarian  telecommunications  market  over the last  several  years  produced a
significant increase in the overall penetration rate in Hungary to approximately
34% as of December 31, 1999 and the  expansion of the mobile  telecommunications
market,  the Company expects to benefit from a continued  increase in the use of
its  telecommunications  services by its customer base as the overall  Hungarian
telecommunications market continues to expand. See also "- Competition."

     HTCC and its Operating Companies

         In 1994,  the Ministry  awarded KNC and Raba-Com  concession  rights to
construct  local  telephone  exchanges  and  provide  non-cellular  local  voice
telephone  services  for a period of 25 years,  with  exclusivity  for the first
eight years. The Company  subsequently  acquired two other Operating  Companies,
Hungarotel and Papatel, that had been awarded substantially identical concession
rights by the Ministry.  Matav continues to be the sole provider of domestic and
international long distance non-cellular voice telephone services through 2001.

         HTCC conducts its operations through the Operating Companies. Set forth
below is an organizational  chart of the Company and its principal  stockholders
as of April 11, 2000. Share ownership percentages of HTCC are based on shares of
HTCC's  common stock (the "Common  Stock")  owned as of April 11, 2000,  without
giving  effect to  outstanding  options  or  warrants.  Additionally,  ownership
percentages for the Operating  Companies do not give effect to future  Hungarian
equity  ownership  requirements.  See  "-Regulation - Hungarian Equity Ownership
Requirements."

Citizens Agreements provide Citizens with certain preemptive rights to purchase,
upon the issuance of Common  Stock in certain  circumstances  to third  parties,
shares of Common Stock in order to maintain its percentage ownership interest on
a fully diluted basis.  Assuming the exercise of all of its  outstanding  rights
and options to purchase  Common Stock as of April 11, 2000,  Citizens  would own
35.1% of the  outstanding  Common  Stock on a  fully-diluted  basis.  For a more

         The Company and  Postabank  entered  into a  Dual-Currency  Bridge Loan
Agreement  (the  "Postabank  Bridge Loan  Agreement")  pursuant to which  HTCC's
subsidiaries  borrowed the  equivalent of $111 million in Hungarian  forints (at

Agreement or (y) May 10, 2000,  and then Postabank can only transfer such shares
incrementally  through 2003 subject to the Company's right of first refusal. The
Company's  right of first  refusal  expires in January 2003 and is assignable by
the  Company  to any  beneficial  holder  of  more  than  10%  of the  Company's
outstanding  Common  Stock.  The  Company  applied the  proceeds  from the stock
issuance to the repayment of the Original Postabank Credit Facility. Pursuant to
the Securities Purchase  Agreement,  the Company issued notes to Postabank in an
aggregate  amount of $25 million (the  "Notes")  with  detachable  warrants (the
"Warrants").  The Notes  accrue  interest,  which is payable  semi-annually,  at
3-1/2% plus the LIBOR rate for the  applicable six month  interest  period.  The
Notes which mature in 2007 are transferable subject to applicable security laws.

between the Company and Postabank enable Postabank to purchase  2,500,000 shares
of the  Company's  common  stock  at an  exercise  price of $10 per  share.  The
exercise  period  commences on January 1, 2004 and terminates on March 31, 2007.

(the  "Danish  Fund Stock  Purchase  Agreement")  pursuant  to which the Company
issued 1,285,714 shares of Common Stock in exchange for $9 million.  The Company
applied  the  proceeds  from the Danish  Fund Stock  Purchase  Agreement  to the
repayment of the Original Postabank Credit Facility.  The Danish Fund agreed not

consideration  for such  shares,  Citizens  (i)  transferred  to the Company for
cancellation  a $8.4 million  promissory  note issued by the Company to Citizens
which was to mature in 2004,  and (ii) agreed to renounce  and forego any rights
whatsoever to any payment of the $21 million which was payable by the Company to

                                      -12-

Citizens in quarterly  installments  of $750,000 from 2004 through and including
2010.  Citizens,  as the holder of the Preferred  Shares, is entitled to receive
cumulative  cash dividends at an annual rate of 5%,  compounded  annually on the
liquidation  value of $70 per share. The Company may redeem the Preferred Shares
at any time.  Citizens can convert each of the  Preferred  Shares into shares of

Agreement  requires  Citizens  not to transfer  any shares of HTCC common  stock
which it may hold prior to May 15, 2000 without the prior written consent of the
Company and Postabank.  Citizens  also  waived  any and all preemptive and anti-
dilution rights in connection with the transactions described above.

Recent Developments

    The April 2000 Syndicated Credit Facility

         On April 11, 2000,  the Company  entered into a EUR 130 million  Senior
Secured Debt Facility  Agreement (the "Debt  Agreement") with a European banking
syndicate  which was arranged by Citibank  N.A.  ("Citibank")  and  Westdeutsche
Landesbank Girozentrale ("WestLB").  The Company intends to draw down the entire
EUR 130 million ($124 million at current  exchange  rates),  which funds will be
used in their entirety, along with another $6 million of other Company funds, to
pay off the entire  outstanding  balance  (EUR 128 million,  approximately  $122
million at current  exchange rates) of the Postabank Bridge Loan Agreement which
will result in the  termination  of the Postabank  Bridge Loan  Agreement  which
matures on May 12, 2000, as well as fees associated with the Debt Agreement. The
borrowers  under the Debt  Agreement  are the  Operating  Companies who were the
borrowers under the Postabank Bridge Loan Agreement. The Debt Agreement and some
of the related  agreements are described below.  (The descriptions and summaries
herein do not purport to be complete, and are subject to, and qualified in their
entirety by, reference to each such agreement, copies of some of which are filed
as exhibits hereto. See Item 14 below).

         The Debt  Agreement has two  facilities.  Facility A is a floating rate
term loan in the amount of EUR 125 million (the "Term Facility") which principal
is repayable semi-annually on each June 30 and December 31 beginning on June 30,
2001 and ending on December 31, 2007. The amounts of the principal repayments on
the Term Facility are to be an  escalating  percentage of the amounts drawn down
(EUR 125 million). Any amounts borrowed under the Term Facility have to be drawn
down within thirty days of the  execution of the Debt  Agreement in either euros
or Hungarian forints. The Company intends to borrow the full EUR 125 million, or
its equivalent in euros and Hungarian forints. Any amounts borrowed in Hungarian
forints are repayable in Hungarian forints.  The Term Facility loans denominated
in euros accrue  interest at the rate of the Applicable  Margin  (defined below)
plus the EURIBOR rate for the applicable  interest  period.  The EURIBOR rate is
the  percentage  rate per annum  determined  by the  Banking  Federation  of the
European  Union for the  applicable  interest  period.  The  portion of the Term
Facility loan  denominated in Hungarian  forints accrues interest at the rate of
the  Applicable  Margin  (defined  below) plus the BUBOR rate for the applicable
interest  period.  The BUBOR rate is the  percentage  rate per annum  determined
according  to the rules  established  by the  Hungarian  Forex  Association  and
published by the National Bank of Hungary for the  applicable  interest  period.
The  applicable  interest  period  for the  portion of the Term  Facility  loans
denominated in euros is, at the Company's option,  one, three or six months. The
Company  intends to choose six months.  The applicable  interest  period for the
portion of the Term Facility loans  denominated in Hungarian  forints is, at the
Company's  option,  in one or three months.  The Company intends to choose three
months.  Interest is payable at the end of each interest period.  The Applicable
Margin is  initially  1.75%.  The  Applicable  Margin may be  adjusted  downward
incrementally to a minimum of 1.15% subject to the financial  performance of the
Company as measured by the ratio of the  Company's  senior debt to its  earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

         Facility B is a  floating  rate  revolving  loan in the amount of EUR 5
million (the "Revolving  Facility")  which can only be drawn down in euros.  The

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

Revolving  Facility will be reduced to EUR 2.5 million on December 31, 2005. The
Revolving  Facility is available until December 31, 2007. The Company intends to
borrow the full amount of the  Revolving  Facility to pay off the balance of the
Postabank  Bridge Loan Agreement and fees associated with the  transaction.  The
principal amount borrowed under the Revolving Facility is due at the end of each
interest period at which point the Company can,  subject to certain  conditions,
roll over the amount of principal  borrowed.  The applicable interest period for
the Revolving  Facility is, at the Company's option,  one, three, or six months.
The Company intends to choose six months. Interest is payable at the end of each
interest period calculated similar to a Term Facility loan denominated in euros.

         As part of the Debt  Agreement,  the  Company is  required  to hedge at
least 50% of the euro  borrowings  until a minimum of 50% of Facility A has been
cancelled,  prepaid or repaid.  Dependent on its cash flow,  commencing in 2001,
the Company will be required to prepay the equivalent of $25 million on Facility
A until such time as $25 million has been prepaid.  The amount of the prepayment
in any year shall be at least 50% of the Company's excess cash flow, if any, for
the previous  financial  year as defined in the Debt  Agreement.  The prepayment
amount is due within 15 days of the publication of each annual Form 10-K filing.

         The Company is obligated to pay a commitment  fee equal to the lower of
 .75% or 50% of the Applicable Margin on any available unused  commitment.  Since
the Company intends to borrow the full amount of the Debt Agreement soon,  there
is no  commitment  fee payable at the  present  time.  The  Company  will pay an
arrangement  fee in the amount of EUR 2,665,000  (approximately  $2.5 million at
current exchange rates) and an agency fee in the amount of $60,000. HTCC and one
of  its  subsidiaries,   HTCC  Consulting  Rt.,  are  guarantors  for  the  HTCC
subsidiaries under the Debt Agreement. The Company pledged all of its intangible
and tangible assets,  including HTCC's ownership  interests in its subsidiaries,
and its real property to secure all of the obligations under the Debt Agreement.
The  Company  and  Citibank  Rt.(as  security  agent)  entered  into a series of
agreements to secure all of the Company's  obligations under the Debt Agreement.
The Debt Agreement  contains the customary  representation  and warranties.  The
Company  is  subject  to  some  restrictive  covenants  including   restrictions
regarding the ability of the Company to pay dividends,  borrow funds, merge with
another  company and  dispose of its assets.  The Debt  Agreement  contains  the
customary events of default,  which would trigger early repayment of the balance
on the Debt Agreement  including those related to a change of control.  If prior
to the later of December 31, 2001 or the Trigger Date (as defined  below),  Tele
Danmark  sells any of the shares of Common Stock that it currently  owns or Tele
Danmark and the Danish Fund no longer own, in the  aggregate,  at least 30.1% of
the  outstanding  Common  Stock,  the Company would be in default under the Debt
Agreement.  Tele  Danmark  and  the  Danish  Fund  currently  own  32.1%  of the
outstanding  Common Stock.  The Trigger Date is defined as the date on which for
the prior two fiscal  quarters the  Company's  debt to EBITDA ratio is less than
3.5 to 1. Following the Trigger Date,  Tele Danmark can only transfer its shares
with the prior written  consent of banks holding at least 66.7% of the Company's
outstanding debt under the Debt Agreement.

Strategy

         The  Company's  primary  focus is to continue to increase call revenues
and reduce  operating  costs while  continuing to add  residential  and business
customers to its networks.  To accomplish these goals, the Company is continuing
its efforts to expand its product and service  offerings to its entire  customer
base, increase its operational efficiencies and increased its marketing efforts.
The Company has  implemented  the following  operational  strategies in order to
further its business objectives.

                                      -14-

     Revenue Growth

         The  Company  intends to  continue  to  increase  its call  revenues by
increasing  the  usage  of  its  product  and  service  offerings  by  both  its
residential   and  business   customers.   Since  the   availability  of  modern
telecommunications  services is a relatively  new phenomena in Hungary,  the key
factor in  increasing  the usage is  educating  both  customer  segments  on the
availability  and  benefits of the  Company's  products  and  services.  For the
residential  customers,  the Company is focusing  its efforts on  educating  the
residential  customer on the availability of such products and services as voice
mail, caller ID and call waiting, which are all new to the Company's residential
customer base. The Company is also highlighting the benefits of the Internet and
encouraging its use by offering special discounted rates for Internet usage. One
of the tools that the Company is  deploying  to increase  customer  awareness of
these  services is video and personal  demonstrations  in the  customer  service
centers  which are located in each of the Operating  Areas.  The Company is also
focusing its marketing and educating  efforts at its business  customers,  which
represent  44% of the  Company's  total call  revenues.  The  Company has placed
emphasis  on  increasing  the  installation  and usage  levels of the  Company's
business  customers  by  focusing  on the  marketing  and  sales of  deregulated
services including managed lease lines, PBX sales and services,  ISDN,  Internet
and Digifon Services (e.g. call  forwarding,  call waiting,  call barring).  The
Company  has  assigned  an account  manager  to each  business  customer  who is
responsible for meeting with each business  customer to find out such customer's
telecommunications  needs.  The account manager can then demonstrate each of the
Company's  products and  services  and,  working  together  with that  customer,
develop a telecommunications  strategy using the Company's products and services
which can best enhance that customer's business.

          The Company  plans to continue its revenue  growth by  increasing  the
penetration  levels in the  residential  sector.  To that end,  the  Company  is
continuing  its mass  marketing  efforts to the  residences who have not yet had
service.  The Company is also marketing the benefits of additional  lines to its
existing residential and business customer.

     New Products and Services

     The Company continues to offer the latest  telecommunications  products and
services as they become  available in the  telecommunications  marketplace.  The
Company  plans to  introduce  Internet  Protocol-  based  voice  services to its
customers  in 2000.  This will  enable the  Company to offer long  distance  and
international  calling  services at discounted rates without  violating  Matav's
domestic long distance and international calling monopoly.

     Marketing

         As the exclusive  provider of basic telephone services in the Operating
Areas, the Company's primary marketing objective is to increase the usage of its
telephone  services by its  existing  residential  and  business  customers.  In
addition,  the Company intends to attract new subscribers by targeting the needs
of various market segments, while  maintaining  superior  customer  service  and
reliability based on current "state of the art"  telecommunications  technology.
The Company's  targeted  market segments are: (i)  residential  customers;  (ii)
small businesses and professionals;  (iii) medium and large businesses; and (iv)
government institutions.

                                      -15-
<PAGE>



         For its residential  customers and potential  customers,  the Company's
marketing  efforts  include  advertising on radio and  television,  door-to-door
marketing surveys,  newspaper  advertising,  participation in local trade shows,
direct mail, community meetings and billboard  advertising.  The Company is also
offering  discounts for Internet users. To increase the residential  penetration
rate, the Company has  implemented  short  marketing  campaigns  targeting those
residences without phone service.  To induce the potential customers the Company
has offered special limited time only special rates on the connection fee. Since
many Hungarians still prefer face-to-face  personal  marketing,  the Company has
leveraged  the benefits of having a customer  service  center in each  Operating
Area to give personal demonstrations.

         For its larger  business  customers,  the Company  has trained  account
managers to service these customers and potential customers by educating them on
the  availability of "turn-key"  business  communications  solutions and several
"value added services"  including the premium rate services,  voice mail and all
of the Digifon services (e.g. call forwarding,  call waiting, call barring). The
Company believes that this effort will result in a greater  understanding by its
business  customers and potential  business  customers of the potential  revenue
gains that can be achieved with advanced telecommunications technology.

    Customer Service

         The Company believes that providing a high level of customer service is
important to achieving  its  objective of  attracting  additional  customers and
increasing the usage of existing services by its current customer base. Prior to
completion of the construction  program, some customers waited for over 20 years
for telephone service. Today, most residences and businesses can be connected to
one of the Company's networks within 7 days. The Company also operates full time
operator  service  centers in each of the  Operating  Areas which are staffed by
operators capable of providing,  among other things, call completion assistance,
directory assistance and trouble reporting on a 24 hour basis. In addition,  the
Company  operates  customer service centers in each of the Operating Areas which
offer facsimile,  Internet,  photocopying  and telephone bill payment  services.
These offices also sell  communications  equipment,  process  telephone  service
applications and handle billing inquiries.  The Company reorganized its customer
service centers by implementing the necessary  changes to make such centers more
"customer friendly." The Company is providing more choices for its customers and
more product information  instruction.  For its business customers,  the Company
has account representatives for each customer.

         Most  of  the  Company's   subscriber   base  consists  of  residential
customers.  As of  December  31,  1999,  87%  of  subscribers  were  residential
customers and 13% were business and other institutional  subscribers  (including
government institutions).

     Operational Efficiency

         The Company is increasing its productivity  and operational  efficiency
by achieving  certain  economies  of scale with  respect to network  management,
administration,   customer  service,  billing,   accounts  receivable,   payroll
processing,  purchasing and network  maintenance.  For example,  the Company has
implemented  its own centralized  operating and accounting  system in all of its
Operating Areas. A significant  increase in operational  efficiency has resulted

                                      -16-
<PAGE>

from the  implementation  of this system  specifically  in the areas of customer
billing  and  financial  accountability.  In  addition,  some  of the  Company's
Operating  Areas are  contiguous,  which  facilitates the realization of certain
economies  of scale.  For  example,  by using  fiber  optic  technology  between
contiguous   Operating  Areas,   the  Company   realizes   certain   operational
efficiencies by  centralizing  certain  functions.  As of December 31, 1999, the
Operating Companies had a total of 296 access lines per employee.

    Mergers and Strategic Alliances

         As the  Hungarian  telecommunications  market  continues to develop and
become more  liberalized  as the monopolies of Matav and the LTOs expire and the
newer entrants  expand their  presence in Hungary,  the Company will continue to
review  its  options  with   respect  to  any  merger  or   strategic   alliance
possibilities that will enhance shareholder value.

Operations

     Services

         The Company provides  non-cellular local voice telephone service in the
Operating  Areas  which  allows   subscribers  to  have  facsimile,   and  modem
transmission  capabilities  and  makes  available  to its  subscribers,  through
interconnection  with Matav,  domestic and international long distance services.
In  addition  to these  standard  services,  the  Company  currently  offers its
subscribers  data  transmission  and  other  value-added   services,   including
Internet, voice mail, ISDN, caller ID, call waiting, call forwarding,  three-way
calling, toll free calling services and audio text services.

         The  Company's  revenues  are derived  from the  provision of local and
domestic and international long distance telephone services which consist of (i)
charges for measured  telephone  service,  which vary  depending on the day, the
time of day, distance and duration of the call, (ii) connection and subscription
fees, and (iii) other operating revenues  consisting  principally of charges and
fees from leased  lines,  public  phones,  detailed  billing and other  customer
services, including revenues from the sale and lease of telephone equipment.

         Measured Service. Charges for local and domestic and international long
distance  measured  service vary with the number of pulses  generated by a call.
The number of pulses  generated for a particular  call depends upon the day, the
time of day, the distance covered and the duration of the call.  Currently,  the
Company charges HUF 12.0 ($.048) per pulse for all local calls. The Ministry has
traditionally  adjusted such fees annually based on the Hungarian Consumer Price
Index.  However,  the  Ministry  did not  change  the fees per  pulse in 2000 as
compared to 1999 because of the  Ministry's  efforts to  rebalance  the fees for
telecommunications services. To that end, the Ministry did not change the length
between  pulses for local  calls but  increased  the length  between  pulses for
domestic long distance and international  calls. The net result is that the fees
for local  calls will not change  from 1999 to 2000 while the fees for  domestic
long distance and  international  calls in 2000 will decrease 40% from the rates
in 1999. For all local calls within an Operating  Area, the Company  retains all
of the revenues  associated  with the call.  For domestic  long  distance  calls

                                      -17-
<PAGE>

outside of an Operating Area (including those between Operating Areas, including
adjacent Operating Areas) and all international calls, the Company has a revenue
sharing  arrangement  with Matav the terms of which are  governed by a decree of
the Ministry. Pursuant to this revenue sharing arrangement,  the Company charges
for and collects  from its  customers  the fees for domestic  long  distance and
international  calls.  The Company  then pays these fees to Matav but retains an
interconnection  fee. For domestic long distance and international  calls to the
Company's  customers,  the  Company  receives  an  interconnection  fee.  Mobile
telephone  calls to customers in the Operating Areas and calls from customers in
the  Operating  Areas to mobile  phones are  included in  long-distance  service
revenues  shared with Matav.  Since 1998 the Ministry has taken gradual steps to
regulate the interconnection  fees in accordance with  internationally  accepted
benchmarks  with the goal of creating a cost-based  interconnection  fee regime.
The Company  believes  that this  revised  regulatory  policy has resulted in an
overall  increase in the  Company's  revenue per call in 1999 for domestic  long
distance and  international  calls over the amount received in 1998 and that the
Company will realize additional benefits in the future. See "- Regulation - Rate
Setting and Revenue Sharing."

         Subscription  and  Connection  Fees.  The  Company  collects  a monthly
subscription fee from its customers. Such fees vary depending on such factors as
whether the services are provided to a residential or business or other customer
(including  government  institutions),  and whether the  customer is linked to a
digital or analog  exchange.  The Company charges a monthly  subscription fee to
digital  customers of HUF 1,532 ($6.07) for residential  customers and HUF 2,672
($10.58) for business and other institutional  subscribers (including government
institutions). These rates increased 32% from 1999. The company also offers some
of its low usage customers a reduced  subscription  fee with a limited amount of
local calls at the regular  local  calling rate but a higher local  calling rate
for usage  over  such  limit.  See "-  Regulation  - Rate  Setting  and  Revenue
Sharing."

         Connection fees are earned when a customer is added to the network. The
Company  may collect  the full  connection  fee  provided  that the  customer is
connected within 30 days;  otherwise,  the Company may only collect a portion of
the  connection  fee and must  connect  the  subscriber  within  one year.  Upon
connection,  the  Company  may collect  the  remaining  portion of the fee.  The
connection  fee is not  recognized  as income  until  the  customer  receives  a
telephone and the connection is made. Currently,  connection fees are HUF 30,000
($118.80) for  residential  customers and HUF 90,000  ($356.41) for business and
other institutional subscribers (including government  institutions),  which are
the maximum  allowable  fees,  pursuant to a decree of the  Ministry.  Customers
requesting  additional access lines are charged an additional connection fee per
line.

         Other  Operating  Revenue.  The Company  supplies  private line service
(point-to-point  and  point-to-multi-point)   primarily  to  businesses.  As  of
December  31,  1999,  approximately  3,323  leased  lines  were in  service.  In
addition,  as of December 31,  1999,  the Company had 1,916 public pay phones in
the Operating  Areas in accordance  with the terms of the Concession  Contracts.
The Company  generates  additional  revenues from the  provision of  value-added
services,  including  ISDN,  voice mail,  call  waiting,  call  forwarding,  and
three-way  calling,  as well as  through  the  sale  and  leasing  of  telephone
equipment.

     Pricing

         Maximum  pricing levels are set by the Ministry and  historically  rate
increases have tracked  inflation,  as measured by either the Hungarian Producer
Price Index ("PPI") or the Hungarian Consumer Price Index ("CPI").  In 1997, the
Ministry set forth a new regulatory framework for regulating annual increases in
the fees for (a) local calls, (b) domestic long distance and international calls
and (c)  subscription  fees.  In  addition  to  separate  price  caps  for  such
categories  of  services,  the Ministry  enacted a  rebalancing  formula,  which

                                      -18-
<PAGE>

provides for greater  increases in charges for subscription fees and local calls
than in domestic long distance and international calls. See also "- Regulation -
Rate Setting and Revenue  Sharing." The  Company's  customers are on a one-month
billing cycle. For domestic long distance and  international  calls, the Company
is required to charge the same tariffs as Matav.  For local  calls,  the Company
may choose to increase  its rates up to the  permitted  amount or charge a lower
rate.  Measured  service rate  increases  are effected by the Ministry by either
increasing  charges  per pulse or reducing  the time  interval  between  pulses,
depending on the time of day and other factors. In addition, the Company charges
additional fees for services such as data transmission, voice mail, call waiting
and call  transfer in all of its  Operating  Areas.  The fees  charged for these
services are not subject to regulation by the Ministry.

         The Company has been allowing its subscribers to pay connection fees on
various  installment  basis  plans  and  encourages  customers  to  lease  their
telephones. The Company believes that to date the various installment plans have
resulted in an increase in the number of subscribers in the Operating Areas.

         The Company currently  purchases  telephone sets in bulk from a variety
of  manufactures.  Customers  can choose to buy the phone or lease the phone and
pay a monthly  fee of HUF 180  ($0.71).  Although  there is no Ministry or other
governmental  regulation relating to lease rates, the Company adjusts such rates
annually  according to the  Hungarian  PPI.  Approximately  49% of the Company's
subscribers as of December 31, 1999 leased their phones from the Company.

Network Design, Construction and Performance

         The Company has constructed a versatile modern  communications  network
which  substantially  replaced the antiquated  system purchased from Matav. This
new system  provides many of the  technologically  advanced  services  currently
available  in the United  States and  Western  Europe.  The  Company's  networks
maintain  the North  American  standard,  or "P01",  grade of  service.  The P01
standard  means that one call out of 100 will be blocked in the busiest  hour of
the  busiest  season.  The  Company  believes  that  its  ability  to  meet  the
telecommunications  requirements  of its  customers  through  a  combination  of
conventional   fiber  optic  and  wireless  local  loop  technology  affords  it
significant  flexibility with respect to network development and network capital
expenditures.  The Company has replaced all manually  operated local battery and
common  battery  cord type  switchboards  purchased  from Matav while  retaining
certain analog  switching  systems.  The Company  upgraded such analog switching
systems allowing such systems to mimic many of the features  available in modern
digital switching systems with a minimal investment.

     Conventional Network Design

         In developing its networks, the Company has implemented service quality
and  redundancy  objectives  on par with  Western  European  and North  American
digital  network  standards.  Certain of the networks  constructed  are based on
digital  hosts and  remotes  with  fiber  optic  rings  and  copper  feeder  and
distribution.  Such a distribution system is the conventional system used in the
United States and Western Europe. Telecommunications services are transmitted to
the home through twisted pair copper wire telephone cable.

                                      -19-
<PAGE>

         The  Company's  conventional  networks  have been designed to employ an
open  architecture,   generally  using  Synchronous  Digital  Hierarchy  ("SDH")
technology for system resilience. The Company's networks are designed to provide
voice and high speed data  services.  The  Company  believes  that the  flexible
design of the  conventional  networks  it has  constructed  allows it to readily
implement new technologies  and provide enhanced or new services.  The Company's
switches in its conventional  networks allow it to connect to networks  operated
by other LTOs or by Matav in order to route voice and data transmissions between
subscribers.

     Wireless Network Design

         In certain  portions of the Operating  Areas,  the Company is deploying
wireless  network   technology   based  upon  the  Digital   Enhanced   Cordless
Telecommunications   ("DECT")  system  which   interfaces  radio  technology  to
fiber-optic,  digital  microwave  or  fixed  copper  networks.  The  use of DECT
technology  generally  reduces the time and expense of installation and securing
rights of way. In a conventional network build,  significant  investment must be
made in order to offer  service to a large  proportion  of  potential  customers
whether or not they become actual  customers.  By contrast,  the use of the DECT
system in a network build-out  provides for capital  investment  proportional to
the number of  customers  actually  connected  because the radio links and other
required equipment are installed only for those households  choosing to take the
service and are installed only at the time service is requested.

         In many areas in which the  Company  is  utilizing  a wireless  network
design,  the  Company is  deploying  a fiber optic cable to the node in the same
fashion as in a conventional network build-out.  At each newly constructed node,
the Company has constructed a radio base station ("RBS"),  rather than switching
to twisted pair copper wire  distribution to the home. Each RBS has the capacity
to provide service to between 200 and 600 customers. As additional customers are
brought onto the network,  the Company  will install a  transceiver  unit at the
subscriber's  premises.  Such  transceiver's  operating  software  is  digitally
encrypted so that it will operate only with its  supporting  RBS. A conventional
telephone  jack  is  then  installed  in  the  subscriber's  household  near  an
electrical  outlet which is used to power the  transceiver  unit. The subscriber
then uses a conventional phone to make outgoing and receive incoming calls.

         The DECT-based  wireless  local loop system  provides the same grade of
service as a conventional  telephone network. In addition,  a DECT-based network
is able to provide many of the same services as a  conventional  copper  network
including voice mail, call forwarding and call barring.

     Network Administration

         The Company  actively  monitors the switching  centers and all critical
network  operational  parameters in each Operating Area. As digital features are
introduced into their  respective  networks,  the network  technicians  have the
ability to monitor  the  networks  and  evaluate  and respond  accordingly.  The
Company  will also be able to analyze the  performance  data  generated by these
systems  in order to make the  operating  adjustments  or  capital  expenditures
necessary to enhance individual network operations.

The Operating Companies

         The  following  is  a  brief  description  of  each  of  the  Operating
Companies:


                                      -20-

central   natural  gas   distributor);   Phillips  (a  Dutch-owned   electronics
manufacturer); EcoPlast (a plastics producer); and Saga (a British-owned poultry
processor).  As of December 31, 1999, Raba-Com had 22,300 access lines connected
to its network.  The Raba-Com  network  utilizes a combination of a conventional
build and fiber optic infrastructure.

Regulation

         In November  1992,  the  Hungarian  Parliament  enacted  the  Hungarian
Telecommunications  Act of 1992 (the  "Telecom  Act") which took effect in 1993.
The Hungarian Telecom Act provided for, among other things, the establishment of
the conditions under which individuals and companies  (including Matav,  foreign
persons and foreign owned companies) could bid for concessions to build, own and
operate local  telecommunications  networks in  designated  service  areas.  The
Hungarian  Telecom Act also gave the  Ministry  the  authority  to regulate  the
industry,   including   the  setting  of  local,   domestic  long  distance  and
international  rates,  the sharing of revenues  between the LTOs and Matav,  the
accrediting  of  equipment  vendors and the setting of  standards  in respect of
network  development and services offered.  In order to meet these  obligations,
the  Hungarian  Telecom  Act  created  a  professional   supervisory  body,  the
Telecommunications  Chief Inspectorate (the "Inspectorate")  which is supervised
by the  Ministry.  Its tasks include  supervising  the progress of the LTOs with
respect to build-out scheduling,  equipment purchases and the quality of network
construction.

     Concession Contracts

         Pursuant  to the  Hungarian  Telecom  Act and in  accordance  with  the
Concession  Act of 1991, in connection  with the award of a concession,  each of
the LTOs entered  into a Concession  Contract  with the Ministry  governing  the
rights  and  obligations  of the LTO with  respect  to each  concession.  Topics
addressed by individual concession contracts include the royalties to be paid to
the Ministry, guidelines concerning LTO capital structure, build-out milestones,
employment guidelines and the level of required contributions to meet social and
educational  requirements.  For example, the Concession Contracts stipulate that
an LTO may not change its capital structure by more than 10% without the express
written consent of the Ministry and that former Matav  employees  generally must
be retained  for the first five to eight years of  operation.  The Company  may,
however, enter into termination agreements with its employees.

         Corporate  Governance.  The amended Concession Contracts for Hungarotel
and  Papatel  provide  that two out of every  five  members  of their  Boards of
Directors and one-half of the members of their  Supervisory  Boards be Hungarian
citizens.

         Exclusivity.  The  Concession  Contracts  provide  that each  Operating
Company has the exclusive  right to provide  non-cellular  local voice telephone
services for eight years.  Commencing in 2002,  the Ministry will have the right
to grant additional concessions for non-cellular local voice telephone services.


                                      -22-
<PAGE>


         Milestones/Network  Construction.  Each  of  the  Concession  Contracts
prescribe  certain  build-out  obligations   ("milestones")  that  require  each
Operating  Company  to  install  a  specified  number  of  access  lines  within
prescribed  time periods.  Each of the Operating  Companies met their  build-out
requirements in 1999.
See "- Fines."

         Royalties.  Each of the LTOs is required by the terms of its individual
concession  contract  to  pay  annual  royalties  to  the  Ministry  equal  to a
percentage of net revenue from basic  telephone  services.  Net revenue for this
purpose are  generally  defined as gross revenue from basic  telephone  services
less interconnect fees paid to Matav. The royalty  percentage may also differ by
region. For example, the Operating Companies must pay royalties in the following
percentage  amounts:  KNC 0.1%;  Raba-Com 1.5%;  Hungarotel  (Bekescsaba)  2.3%;
Hungarotel  (Oroshaza)  0.3%; and Papatel 2.3%. These amounts are paid annually,
in arrears.

         Social and  Educational  Contributions.  In addition  to the  royalties
described above,  Concession  Contracts may also call for social and educational
contributions  based on revenues of the Operating  Company,  excluding  VAT. The
Concession  Contracts for KNC and Raba-Com  require them to contribute  1.5% and
1.0% of such revenues,  respectively, to support social and educational projects
in their Operating Areas. The Concession  Contracts for Hungarotel require it to
pay an  amount  equal  to 10  times  the  local  occupational  excise  tax.  The
applicability  and  enforceability  of such  obligation is presently  uncertain.
However,  the Ministry stated in a letter to Hungarotel that it will not enforce
this particular provision of Hungarotel's Concession Contract.

         Renewal.  Each Concession Contract provides for a 25-year term with the
right to submit a  proposal,  within 18 months  prior to the  expiration  of the
Concession  Contract to apply for an additional  12-1/2 years which the Ministry
may  grant  if  it  approves  the  Operating  Company's  proposal,   subject  to
consultation  with local  authorities and professional  and consumer  protection
bodies. Such extension would involve the payment of an additional concession fee
to be set by the Ministry prior to the submission of the proposal.  In the event
the  proposal  is  rejected  or is not timely  filed,  the  concession  would be
auctioned by the Ministry,  although the existing  Operating  Company would have
priority in the event the  Operating  Company's  proposal  provides for the same
terms and conditions as that of another bidder.

         Fines.   The  failure  to  meet  required  construction  milestones may
result  in  the levying of fines by the Ministry.  Such fines are computed based
on  a  contractual  formula  and  may  be  substantial.   Each  of the Operating
Companies met their build-out  requirements in 1999.

         Termination  upon  Lack of  Performance.  If an LTO is unable to comply
with its  Concession  Contracts,  the  Ministry  has the right to  abrogate  the
Concession  Contract.  In  such an  instance,  the  Ministry  has  authority  to
determine alternative provisions for such service, which may include the sale of
the LTO's  telecommunications  assets to another provider. In such case, the LTO
would be  obligated  to sell its  assets  under the terms of a  contract  to the
provider to whom the concession is transferred. The Company believes that it has
demonstrated  substantial performance to date under its Concession Contracts and
that its relations with the Ministry are good and, therefore,  the chance of any
termination of any Concession Contract is remote.


                                      -23-

         Dispute  Resolution.   Any   disputes   arising  with  respect  to  the
interpretation  of  a  Concession  Contract  will  be adjudicated by a Hungarian
court.

     Hungarian Equity Ownership Requirements.

         The Ministry has stipulated in the Concession  Contracts for Hungarotel
and Papatel,  as amended in June 1996, that each of the Operating Companies must
meet certain Hungarian ownership  requirements so that by the end of the seventh
year of their Concession  Contracts Hungarian ownership must consist of 25% plus
one share of the relevant  Operating  Company.  For the first three months after
assuming  operations of an Operating Area from Matav, no Hungarian ownership was
required.  For the  seven-year  period  following  the  date or  amendment  of a
Concession  Contract,  as the case may be, Hungarian  ownership must be at least
10%, except that during such period,  such ownership may be reduced to as low as
1% for a period of up to two years.  During such  seven-year  period,  while the
Hungarian  ownership block is required to be at least 10%, such Hungarian owners
of a 10% equity  holding in an  Operating  Company  must have voting power of at
least 25% plus one share,  thus  providing  Hungarian  owners the right to block
certain   transactions   which,   under  Hungarian   corporate  law,  require  a
supermajority  (75%) of stockholders  voting on the matter,  such as mergers and
consolidations, increases in share capital and winding-up.

         For these purposes, Hungarian ownership of shares means shares owned by
Hungarian citizens. Shares owned by a corporation are considered Hungarian owned
only in proportion to the Hungarian ownership of such corporation.  The LTOs can
also fulfill the 25% plus one share Hungarian  ownership  requirement by listing
such shares on the Budapest Stock Exchange.

         The equity ownership  requirements  and exceptions  described above are
contained in the June 1996  amended  Concession  Contracts  for  Hungarotel  and
Papatel.  The equity  ownership  requirements  expressly  set forth in KNC's and
Raba-Com's Concession Contracts call for a stricter 25% plus one share Hungarian
ownership  requirement.  However, the Ministry has stated,  pursuant to a letter
dated September 18, 1996, that it intends that all of the Operating Companies be
treated equally with respect to such ownership requirements.

         If the Hungarian  ownership does not meet the required levels,  the LTO
is required to give notice to the  Ministry,  which may then  require the LTO to
rectify the situation  within three months,  or a shorter period if the Ministry
considers that there has been a delay in the required notification. With respect
to the Company, Postabank, a Hungarian commercial bank, owns approximately 20.2%
of  HTCC  which  is the  majority  owner  of all  of  the  Operating  Companies.
Therefore,  the Ministry  deems the Company in  compliance  with the current 10%
ownership requirement,  however, the Company is currently not in compliance with
the 25% ownership requirement. The Ministry is, however, currently reviewing the
Hungarian equity  ownership  requirements and has indicated that it is not going
to enforce at this time the 10% Hungarian equity ownership  requirement.  In the
event that the Ministry adopts new Hungarian equity ownership requirements,  the
Company  will  formulate  plans  to meet  any such  Hungarian  equity  ownership
requirements.  Failure to do so, or failure to comply with the greater  than 25%
Hungarian  ownership  requirement at the end of the  seven-year  period might be
considered a serious  breach of a Concession  Contract,  giving the Ministry the
right, among other things, to terminate the Concession Contract. There can be no
assurance  that the Company will be able to increase the Hungarian  ownership in
the Operating  Companies in a manner sufficient to comply with such requirements
in the future.

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

         The Hungarian  ownership  requirements  would effectively give minority
Hungarian  stockholders in the Operating  Companies the ability to block certain
corporate  transactions  requiring the approval of 75% of stockholders voting on
the matter, including mergers and consolidations, increases in share capital and
winding-up.  In  addition,  unless  the  Hungarian  ownership  requirements  are
formally  changed,  compliance  would  result in a  reduction  in the  Company's
ownership in the Operating Companies, and, consequently,  the Company's share of
income,   if  any,  or  loss  of  the  Operating   Companies   will  be  reduced
proportionately.

       Rate-Setting and Revenue Sharing

         Pursuant to the  Hungarian Act LXXXVII of 1990 on Pricing (the "Pricing
Act") and the Telecom Act, the Ministry, issues, in agreement with the Hungarian
Ministry  of Finance,  decrees  regulating  the  tariffs for  telecommunications
services provided by the Company, Matav and the other LTOs.

         In 1997 the  Ministry  adopted  Decree No.  31/1997 of the KHVM on Fees
Related to  Telecommunication  Services  Subject to Concession (the "1997 Tariff
Decree") which regulated the Operating  Companies'  subscription  fees, fees for
local  calls,  and fees  collected  on  behalf of Matav  for long  distance  and
international  calls.  The 1997 Tariff  Decree set separate  price caps for each
category of service  through  2000,  which price caps  provided  for annual rate
increases  based on the CPI for the prior year. The Ministry may also reduce the
CPI percentage  increase by an efficiency factor to obtain the maximum allowable
price  increase.  The 1997 Decree also provided for a rebalancing  formula which
allowed greater  increases in the charges for subscription  fees and local calls
than in domestic long distance or  international  calls. For 2000, in accordance
with the general  policies  set forth in the 1997 Tariff  Decree,  the  Ministry
adopted Decree No. 1/2000 (I.18) (the "2000 Tariff  Decree") which provides for:
a 32% increase in the subscription fee for the Company's residential  customers;
a 60% increase in the subscription fee for the Company's business customers;  no
increase in local calls  within an  Operating  Area;  and a 40% decrease in long
distance and international  calls. The intended effect of the 2000 Decree was to
provide  for an  overall  2000  price  increase  of a  maximum  6%  based on the
anticipated  inflation  rate in 2000. The 1999 increase in the Hungarian CPI was
10%.

          The Ministry also regulates the revenue sharing  arrangements  between
the LTOs  (including  the  Operating  Companies)  and Matav with respect to long
distance and international  calls. The revenue sharing  arrangements provide for
the Operating Companies to retain an interconnection fee from the fees collected
from the Operating  Companies'  customers  for long  distance and  international
calls and for Matav to pay the Operating  Companies an  interconnection  fee for
domestic  long  distance  or  international  calls  terminating  with one of the
Operating Company's  customers.  In 1998 the Ministry announced that it intended
to start regulating the interconnection  fees based on internationally  accepted
benchmarks  with the goal of creating a  cost-based  interconnection  fee regime
within the  parameters of European  Union  standards.  To that end,  starting in
1999,  the  interconnection  fees  were  revised  to  compensate  the LTOs  more
favorably  for costs than in the prior years.  For 2000,  the  Ministry  adopted
Decree 8/2000  (III.29) (the "2000  Interconnection  Decree") which provides for
each LTO to receive in 2000 an average  interconnection  fee of HUF 13.22/minute
for the  initiation  of a domestic long  distance or  international  call and an
average fee of HUF  8.02/minute  for the termination of a domestic long distance
or international  call. For future years, the LTOs other than Matav as part of a
formal association (the "LTO Association") recently provided the Ministry with a
paper outlining its position with respect to the implementation of a longer term
cost-based  interconnection  fee regime,  which is already a requirement  for EU
members. See " - Competition."

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

         The Ministry  regulates  the  subscriber  connection  fees  pursuant to
Decree 11/1995 (VII.12) KHVM, as amended, on the One-Time Access Fee Payable for
Establishment  of Public  Telephone  Service Access Points (the  "Connection Fee
Decree").  The Connection Fee Decree provides for maximum subscriber  connection
fees at HUF 90,000 ($415.70) for business customers and HUF 30,000 ($138.57) for
residential  customers.   See  "-  Operations  -  Services  -  Subscription  and
Connection Fees."

     Hungarian Taxation

         Corporate  Income  Tax.  The  operations  of  the  Company's  Hungarian
subsidiaries,  including  the  Operating  Companies,  are  subject to  Hungarian
corporate income tax. Generally, Hungarian corporations are subject to tax at an
annual rate of 18.0%. The Operating  Companies  fulfilled certain criteria which
entitled  them to a 100.0%  reduction  in income  taxes for the five year period
ending  December  31,  1998  and a  60.0%  reduction  in  income  taxes  for the
subsequent five year period ending December 31, 2003,  provided certain criteria
continue to be met. See Note 1(j) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Operating Companies are currently eligible for such tax treatment.  However,
the corporate income tax is reviewed,  and subject to change,  annually. Any tax
increase or change in the tax exempt  status of the  Operating  Companies  could
have a material adverse effect on the Company.

         Value  Added  Tax  ("VAT").  The  Hungarian  VAT  system  is  virtually
identical to the one used in most European  countries.  VAT is a consumption tax
which is fully borne by the final consumer of a product or service.  The current
rates of VAT in Hungary vary  between  0.0% and 25.0%,  depending on the type of
product or service.

         Social Insurance  Contributions.  The level of contributions for social
insurance  in Hungary is one of the highest in Europe.  In 1999  employers  were
required to pay the state 33% of an employee's gross salary as a social security
contribution   and  3.0%  of  an  employee's  gross  salary  as  the  employer's
contribution  to the  unemployment  fund.  In addition,  the Company must pay an
additional HUF 3,600 ($14.26) per month for each employee for health  insurance.
The  Company's  share of  pension,  unemployment,  social  security  and  health
insurance payments are reflected in operating and maintenance expenses.

Competition

         The  Concession   Contracts   provide  for  an  eight-year   period  of
exclusivity in the provision of  non-cellular  local voice  telephone  services,
which ends in 2002, while the initial 25-year terms of the Concession  Contracts
are  scheduled to expire in 2019.  Other  telecommunications  service  providers
presently are permitted to apply for licenses to provide non-exclusive  services
(e.g.,  data  transmission  and voice mail)  throughout  Hungary,  including the
Operating Areas. In addition, beginning in 2002, other competitors may choose to
enter the non-cellular  local voice telephone services market, but the terms and
conditions upon which such market entry will be effected are today unclear.

                                      -26-
<PAGE>

         In  1998,  the  Ministry   awarded   Pan-Tel  the  license  to  provide
non-exclusive  telecommunications  services such as data  transmission and voice
mail. The current shareholders of Pan-Tel include MAV Rt. (the Hungarian railway
company,  "MAV"), PT Investment  Holding Company and KPN NV (the Dutch telephone
company).  In 1998 Pan-Tel started  building its nationwide fiber optic backbone
network along the  rights-of-way of MAV which is expected to be completed by the
end of 2000.  Pan-Tel is currently  providing business  communications  services
such as digital data, fax and video  transmission using Internet Protocol ("IP")
data transmission technology,  primarily to large customers.  Pan-Tel focused on
the large,  multinational companies and government  organizations as its initial
target market.  In 1999, the Hungarian  government  granted Pan-Tel two separate
licenses  to  provide  IP-based  voice  services  to  residential  and  business
customers. The Hungarian government determined that such service did not violate
Matav's  monopolistic  voice  concession since voice-over IP is considered "data
transfer".  Matav has recently initiated its own voice-over IP service.  Pan-Tel
also  owns a  majority  stake  in  one of  Hungary's  largest  Internet  Service
Providers.

         The  Company  faces  competition  from  the  four  Hungarian   cellular
providers:  Westel 450; Westel 900;  Pannon;  and the newest entrant  Vodaphone.
Presently,  the airtime and monthly fees charged by the cellular  operators  are
generally more than the fees for comparable services charged by the Company.

         Another entrant into the marketplace,  Novacom  Telecommunications Kft.
("Novacom") owned by affiliates of RWE Telliance AG, a German telecommunications
company,  EnBW AG, a German  electricity  provider and Elmu Rt.,  the  Hungarian
electricity distributor ("Elmu"), is expanding the fiber optic infrastructure of
Elmu in order to compete in the  telecommunications  market.  Novacom offers its
customers  corporate network services,  managed leased lines, ISDN, frame relay,
X25, ATM IP-based data  transmission,  closed user group voice and PBX services.
Novacom also recently initiated voice-over IP service.

         Other  Hungarian  telecommunications  providers  include the  following
entities:  GTS Hungary Kft.  ("GTS") which provides data  transmission  services
through a nationwide  microwave  network and a satellite based network (GTS also
owns  one of  the  leading  Hungarian  ISPs);  Antenna  Hungaria,  the  national
broadcaster  which is still  state-owned,  has a national  microwave network and
recently announced plans to establish a joint venture with Hungarian Electricity
Works Rt.  ("MVM") to operate MVM's  existing  telecom  network;  and Global One
Telecommunications  Kft., which provides  IP-based data  transmission  services.
There are also several other VSAT (very small  aperture  terminal)  providers in
Hungary.

         The Hungarian cable  television  market is highly  fragmented with over
150 cable  television  providers.  The Hungarian  cable  television  industry is
undergoing  consolidation.  United  Pan-Europe  Communications NV ("UPC") is the
largest cable television operator in Hungary. UPC owners include UnitedGlobalCom
Inc., the global  television  operator of Denver,  Colorado (51%), and Microsoft
Corp. (8%) of Redmond, Washington.

         The Ministry  recently  announced  that it will revise its laws in 2000
regarding the  regulation  of the  telecommunication  market in accordance  with
European Union standards. The regulation of telephony,  cable television and the
Internet  would be affected.  The Company  does not expect that the  exclusivity
period of its concession rights, which expire in 2002, will be affected.

                                      -27-
<PAGE>

         Hungary's  application  for membership in the European Union (the "EU")
was  accepted.  Hungary is now in the  process of  negotiating  the terms of its
accession into the EU. The EU has adopted numerous  directives  providing for an
open telecommunications market among its member nations. Hungary is not expected
to become a member of the  European  Union  until 2003 at the  earliest by which
time the exclusivity rights of the LTOs and Matav will have expired.

Employees

         The Company had a total of  approximately  665 employees,  including 10
expatriates,  as of March 1999.  The Company  considers its  relations  with its
employees to be satisfactory.

                               Item 2. Properties

         The Company  leases its office  space in Budapest at a current  monthly
rental of DM 30,749  (approximately  $15,000 at  current  exchange  rates).  The
Company is in the process of selling its old office  headquarters  in  Budapest.
The  Company  leases  1,157  square feet of office  space at 100 First  Stamford
Place,  Stamford,  CT at a monthly  rental of $2,508.  The Company is moving its
U.S. office to Suite 32, Tokeneke  Center,  30 Center Street,  Darien,  CT 06820
effective May 1, 2000 at a monthly rental of $1,500.  The Company  believes that
its leased and owned  office  space is  adequate  for its  present  needs but is
currently reviewing its alternatives as to its future needs.

         In addition, each Operating Company owns or leases the following office
or customer  service space in its respective  Operating Area: KNC owns or leases
57,000 square feet of total space; Raba-Com owns or leases 15,000 square feet of
total space;  Hungarotel owns or leases 119,594 square feet of total space;  and
Papatel owns or leases 18,000 square feet of total space.

                            Item 3. Legal Proceedings

         Hungarotel  is  a  defendant  in  a  lawsuit  filed  by  Dialcont  Kft.
("Dialcont")  on March 28,  1996 in Hungary  alleging a breach of  contract  for
services  allegedly  provided  by  Dialcont  during  1994 and 1995.  The Company
believes that  Dialcont's  claims are without merit and is vigorously  defending
itself against such claims. Dialcont is seeking HUF 222 million ($879,000). This
action is still pending in the Hungarian court system.

         Raba-Com is a defendant in a lawsuit filed by an individual residential
customer  in Hungary on  December 4, 1997.  The  plaintiff  sought a refund of a
minimal amount alleging that his home was connected to Raba-Com's  network in an
untimely  fashion.  Raba-Com  prevailed  on the merits in the lower  court.  The
plaintiff  appealed the case in the appellate  court which court  overturned the
lower court's  decision.  Raba-Com  filed an appeal with the  Hungarian  Supreme
Court which is still pending.  Should, however,  Raba-Com lose its appeal at the
Supreme  Court  level,  the Company  could be subject to  additional  claims for
refunds.  The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to this claim and any
others that may be filed regarding this matter.

         HTCC  Consulting  Rt.  ("Consulting")   and   Papatel  are  involved in
several  disputes  with the Hungarian  taxing  authorities (the "APEH") pursuant
to  which the APEH alleges that Consulting owes HUF 105  million  (approximately


                                      -28-
<PAGE>


$416,000)  and  Papatel  owes  HUF  26  million  (approximately   $103,000)  for
various  reasons.   The Operating  Companies  believe  that  the APEH claims are
without merit and are vigorously  defending  themselves against such claims.

         During 1996 and 1997,  the Company  entered into  several  construction
contracts  with a  Hungarian  contractor  which  totaled  $59.0  million  in the
aggregate,  $47.5 of which was financed by a contractor financing facility.  The
contractor financed the facility through Postabank. As of December 31, 1998, the
balance  owed  by  the  Company  on  the  contractor   financing   facility  was
approximately $36.6 million.  The Company and the contractor have a disagreement
with respect to several issues  relating to the quality and quantity of the work
done by the contractor.  The Company has rejected  invoices of approximately HUF
700 million  (approximately $2.8 million). In order to resolve these issues, the
Company  purchased  from  Postabank the  receivables  owed by the  contractor to
Postabank with respect to the contractor  financing  facility.  The Company also
purchased from Postabank some of the  obligations  which the Company owed to the
contractor  under the  contractor  financing  facility  which  were  assumed  by
Postabank.  The  Company  then  set  off  its  uncontested  liabilities  to  the
contractor  against  the  amounts  owed to the  Company by the  contractor.  The
contractor  is now  seeking  payment  under  separate  invoices in the amount of
approximately  $24 million for work which the  Company is  disputing  because of
quality and quantity issues. The Company still has claims against the contractor
of  approximately  $31 million which is more than the  contractor's  claim.  The
Company is reviewing its options with respect to such dispute.  At this time the
outcome of such dispute cannot be predicted with certainty. The Company believes
that it will prevail on the merits such that it will not be responsible  for the
full amount of the contractor's  claims. There can, however, be no assurances as
to the final outcome or course of action of such dispute.

         The Company and its  subsidiaries  are involved in various  other legal
actions  arising in the ordinary  course of business.  The Company is contesting
these legal actions in addition to the suits noted above;  however,  the outcome
of individual  matters is not predictable with assurance.  Although the ultimate
resolution  of these  actions  (including  the actions  discussed  above) is not
presently  determinable,  the Company believes that any liability resulting from
the current  pending legal actions  involving the Company,  in excess of amounts
provided  therefor,  will not have a material  adverse  effect on the  Company's
consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

           Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

Dividend Policy

         It is the present policy of the Company to retain earnings,  if any, to
finance the development and growth of its businesses.  Accordingly, the Board of
Directors does not anticipate that cash dividends will be paid until earnings of
the Company  warrant  such  dividends,  and there can be no  assurance  that the
Company can achieve such earnings.

         At present,  HTCC's only  source of  revenues  is  payments,  including
repayment of any  intercompany  loans,  payments  under its  management  service
agreements and dividends,  if any, from the Operating  Companies.  The Operating
Companies'  ability to pay dividends or make other capital  distributions to the
Company is governed by Hungarian law.  Currently,  the Operating  Companies have
negative net equity and are not permitted to pay dividends.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
         of Operations

Introduction

         HTCC  is  engaged  primarily  in the  provision  of  telecommunications
services  through its  majority-owned  operating  subsidiaries,  KNC,  Raba-Com,
Papatel  and   Hungarotel.   The  Company   earns   substantially   all  of  its
telecommunications revenue from measured service fees, monthly line rental fees,
connection fees, public pay telephone services and ancillary services (including
charges for additional services purchased at the customer's discretion).

         During 1996 and 1997 the  Company  embarked  on a  significant  network
development  program which met its  substantial  demand  backlog,  increased the
number of basic  telephone  access  lines in  service  and  modernized  existing
facilities.  The  development  and  installation  of the  network in each of the
Company's Operating Areas required significant capital expenditures.

         Now that the Company's network is substantially  built-out, the ability
of the Company to generate  sufficient revenues to satisfy cash requirements and
become profitable will depend upon a number of factors,  including the Company's
ability to attract  additional  customers,  revenues  per  customer and on-going
construction costs. These factors are expected to be primarily influenced by the
success of the Company's  operating  and marketing  strategies as well as market
acceptance of  telecommunications  services in the Company's Operating Areas. In
addition,  the  Company's  profitability  may  be  affected  by  changes  in the
Company's regulatory environment and other factors that are beyond the Company's
control.  The success of the Company's strategy is dependent upon its ability to
increase revenues through increased usage and the addition of new subscribers.

         The Company  funded its  construction  costs and working  capital needs
over the past several years primarily  through a $170 million  Postabank  Credit
Facility  (the  "Original  Postabank  Credit  Facility")  and  a  $47.5  million
contractor  financing facility.  The Company and the Hungarian  contractor which
granted the contractor  financing  facility have a disagreement  with respect to
several  issues  relating to the  quality  and  quantity of the work done by the
contractor.  In addition, on March 31, 1999, the Company did not have sufficient
funds on hand to pay the first installment due on the Original  Postabank Credit
Facility. Due to this fact, as well as the disagreement the Company has with the
Hungarian  contractor,  on March 30, 1999, and May 12, 1999, the Company entered
into a  series  of  transactions  (see  notes  4,  5,  6, 8 and 11 of  Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements)  which  restructured the Company's debt and
capital  structure.  As  the  final  step  in  the  Company's  debt  and  equity
restructuring which started in 1999, on April 11, 2000, the Company entered into
a EUR  130  million  Senior  Secured  Debt  Facility  with  a  European  banking
syndicate. See "- Liquidity and Capital Resources" below.

         To date, the Company's  activities have involved the acquisition of the
concessions  and  telecommunications  networks  from  Matav  and the  subsequent
design,   development  and   construction   of  the  modern   telecommunications
infrastructure  that  the  Company  now has in  service.  The  Company  paid the
Ministry $11.5 million (at historical exchange rates) for its concessions, spent
approximately  $23.2  million  (at  historical  exchange  rates) to acquire  the
existing  telecommunications assets in its Operating Areas from Matav, and spent
$181 million  through  December 31, 1999 (at historical  exchange  rates) on the
development and  construction of its  telecommunications  infrastructure.  Since
commencing the provision of telecommunications  services in the first quarter of
1995, the Company's network construction and expansion program has added 139,100
access  lines  through  December 31, 1999 to the 61,400  access  lines  acquired
directly  from Matav.  As a result,  the Company  had  200,500  access  lines in
operation at year end 1999.

      Telephone Service Revenues, Net                 $45.4           $38.7
                                                      ======          =====

         The Company  recorded a 17% increase in net telephone  service revenues
to $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $38.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 1998.

         Net measured service and subscription  revenues  increased 18% to $39.1
million for the year ended  December  31,  1999 from $33.1  million for the year
ended December 31, 1998. Measured service revenues increased 9% to $35.2 million
in 1999 from $32.2 million in 1998 while  subscription  revenues increased 2% to
$10.9  million in 1999 from $10.7 million in 1998.  These  increases in call and
subscription  fee  revenues  are the result of a 7% increase  in average  access
lines in service from  approximately  178,000 lines for the year ended  December
31, 1998 to  approximately  190,000 lines for the year ended  December 31, 1999.
The growth in access lines is not fully reflected in increased  measured service
revenues  as newer  customers  require a period  of  maturity  before  producing
revenues similar to established telephone customers.

         These  revenues  have been  offset by net  interconnect  charges  which
totaled  $7.0  million for the year ended  December 31, 1999 as compared to $9.8
million  for the year ended  December  31,  1998.  As a  percentage  of call and
subscription  revenues,  net interconnect charges have declined from 23% for the
year ended December 31, 1998 to 15% for the year ended December 31, 1999, due to
a higher  proportion of local  traffic as additional  access lines are placed in
service plus a negotiated  reduction in interconnect  fees effective  January 1,
1999. Based upon recent  negotiations  with Matav and the Hungarian  Ministry of
Telecommunications,  the Company  expects net  interconnect,  as a percentage of
call and subscription revenues, to remain consistent with 1999 levels in 2000.

         Connection  fees for the year ended  December  31,  1999  totaled  $1.8
million as  compared  to $2.0  million  for the year ended  December  31,  1998.
Connection  fees increased in functional  currency terms by 5% due to additional
access lines being  connected in 1999 as compared to 1998.  However,  due to the
devaluation of the Hungarian  forint during the period,  connection fees for the
year have remained relatively consistent in U.S dollar terms with 1998 amounts.


                                      -33-
<PAGE>


         Other operating  revenues increased 25% to $4.5 million during the year
ended  December 31, 1999 compared to $3.6 million during the year ended December
31, 1998 due to revenues  generated from the provision of direct lines and other
miscellaneous telephony service revenues.

     Operating and Maintenance Expenses

         Operating and maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999
decreased to $17.5 million compared to $19.6 million for the year ended December
31, 1998. On a per line basis,  operating and maintenance  expenses decreased to
approximately  $92 per average  access line for the year ended December 31, 1999
from  $110  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  1998 as the  Company  achieved
productivity   improvements  and  increased  its  focus  on  reducing  operating
expenses,  particularly  through reductions in the number of expatriates working
for the Company. The Company does not expect significant  decreases in operating
and maintenance  expenses in 2000. However,  on a per line basis,  operating and
maintenance  costs are expected to decline as additional  access lines are added
during 2000.

     Depreciation and Amortization

         Depreciation  and amortization  charges  increased to $11.8 million for
the year ended  December 31, 1999 from $11.6 million for the year ended December
31, 1998. Depreciation and amortization charges increased in functional currency
terms by approximately 13% due to additional capital expenditures.  However, due
to the devaluation of the Hungarian  forint during the period,  depreciation and
amortization charges for the year ended 1999 have remained relatively consistent
in U.S.  dollar terms with 1998 amounts.  The Company expects  depreciation  and
amortization  charges in 2000 to increase in  functional  currency  terms due to
additional capital expenditures in its operating subsidiaries,  however, in U.S.
dollar  terms  the  Company  expects  depreciation  and  amortization  to remain
consistent  with 1999 amounts due to devaluation of the operating  subsidiaries'
functional currency.

     Management Fees

         There was no  management  fee expense for the year ended  December  31,
1999 as compared to $2.5  million for the year ended  December  31,  1998.  This
decrease is due to the termination of management  services agreement between the
Company and Citizens  International  Management Services Company. See Note 15 of
Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  Company  does not have any
continuing management services agreements.

     Cost of Termination of Management Services Agreement

         For the year ended  December  31, 1998,  the Company  recorded a charge
totaling  $11.1  million  representing  the  present  value of  payments  due to
Citizens  International  Management  Services  Company under a  termination  and
consulting agreement. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

                                      -34-
<PAGE>

     Income (Loss) from Operations

         Income from  operations  was $16.2 million for the year ended  December
31, 1999  compared to a loss from  operations of $6.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 1998.  Adjusted for the cost of terminating the management services
agreement  and  management  fees,  income  from  operations  for the year  ended
December 31, 1998 amounted to $7.6 million.  Contributing  to such  improvements
were higher  revenues  and lower  operating  and  maintenance  expenses  and the
elimination  of the  management  fees  described  above  during  the year  ended
December 31, 1999 as compared to the year ended  December  31,  1998,  offset by
increased depreciation and amortization charges during the year.

     Foreign Exchange Losses

         Foreign  exchange losses increased $2.6 million to $2.8 million for the
year ended  December 31, 1999 from $0.2 million for the year ended  December 31,
1998. Such foreign  exchange  losses resulted  primarily from the devaluation of
the Hungarian forint against the U.S. dollar during the period. This increase in
foreign exchange losses during the period is due to the Company's  restructuring
of its debt obligations in May 1999. Prior to its  restructuring the Company had
debt  denominated  in Hungarian  forints.  The Company now has debt  obligations
denominated  in U.S.  dollars  and  euros,  as well as  Hungarian  forints.  See
"Liquidity and Capital  Resources"  section below for information  regarding the
Company's  debt  restructuring  during the period.  See also the  "Inflation and
Foreign Currency" and "Market Risk Exposure" sections below.

     Interest Expense

         Interest expense decreased to $32.5 million for the year ended December
31, 1999 from $45.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998.  This decrease
was attributable to lower average debt levels during the year ended December 31,
1999 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1998.  This reduction in average
debt levels outstanding during the period is due to the Company's  restructuring
of its debt  obligations  in May 1999. The decrease also reflects lower interest
rates  paid on  borrowings  in U.S.  dollars  and euros  compared  to  Hungarian
forints.

     Interest Income

         Interest  income  increased to $1.7 million for the year ended December
31, 1999 from $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 primarily due to
higher average cash balances outstanding during the period.

     Other, net

         Other, expense amounted to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31,
1999 as compared to other income of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31,
1998. This decrease is due to an approximate  $0.8 million gain realized related
to the  termination  of the former  management  services  agreement  between the
Company and Citizens International  Management Services Company during 1998. The
Company does not have any continuing management services agreements. See Note 15
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Loss Before Extraordinary Items

         As a result of the factors discussed above, the Company recorded a loss
before  extraordinary  items of $17.8 million,  or $1.85 per share, for the year
ended  December  31, 1999 as compared  to a loss before  extraordinary  items of
$50.6 million, or $9.53 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1998.

      Extraordinary Items, net

         For  the  year  ended  December  31,  1999,  the  Company  recorded  an
extraordinary  item of $20.9 million comprised of extraordinary  income of $27.1
million  which  consists  of a  $9.0  million  gain  on  extinguishment  of  the
liabilities  the  Company  had  with  Citizens  and  a  $18.1  million  gain  on
extinguishment of all amounts due under a contractor financing facility,  offset
in part by a  non-cash  charge of $6.2  million  related  to the  write-off  the
remaining  unamortized  deferred  financing costs and credits  pertaining to the
Original Postabank Credit Facility.


      Net Income (Loss)

         As a result of the factors  discussed  above,  the Company recorded net
income of $3.2 million,  or $0.33 per share for the year ended December 31, 1999
as  compared to a net loss of $50.6  million,  or ($9.53) per share for the year
ended December 31, 1998.

         The Company recorded a 2% increase in net telephone service revenues to
$38.7  million for the year ended  December 31, 1998 from $37.9  million for the
year ended December 31, 1997.

         Net measured service and subscription  revenues  increased 43% to $33.1
million for the year ended  December  31,  1998 from $23.2  million for the year
ended  December 31,  1997.  Measured  service  revenues  increased  23% to $32.2
million in 1998 from $26.2 million in 1997 while subscription revenues increased
49% to $10.7 million in 1998 from $7.2 million in 1997.  These increases in call
and subscription fee revenues are the result of a 35% increase in average access
lines in service from  approximately  132,000 lines for the year ended  December
31, 1997 to  approximately  178,000 lines for the year ended  December 31, 1998.
The growth in access lines is not fully reflected in increased  measured service
revenues  as newer  customers  require a period  of  maturity  before  producing
revenues similar to established telephone customers.

                                      -36-
<PAGE>

         These  revenues  have been  offset by net  interconnect  charges  which
totaled $9.8  million for the year ended  December 31, 1998 as compared to $10.2
million  for the year ended  December  31,  1997.  As a  percentage  of call and
subscription  revenues,  net interconnect charges have declined from 31% for the
year ended December 31, 1997 to 23% for the year ended December 31, 1998, due to
a higher  proportion of local  traffic as additional  access lines are placed in
service plus a negotiated  reduction in interconnect  fees effective  January 1,
1998.

         Connection  fees for the year ended  December  31,  1998  totaled  $2.0
million as compared to $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.  This
decrease reflects the reduction in the number of new access lines connected from
approximately  81,700 during the year ended  December 31, 1997 to  approximately
9,900  lines  during the year ended  December  31,  1998.  Connection  fees were
expected to decline substantially during the year as the majority of wait-listed
customers have been provided with access lines.  The Company expects  connection
fees to continue to decline as no significant  backlog of wait-listed  customers
exists.

         Other operating revenues increased 100% to $3.6 million during the year
ended  December 31, 1998 compared to $1.8 million during the year ended December
31,  1997 due to  revenues  generated  from the  provision  of direct  lines and
revenues generated from Lucent PBX sales and related maintenance services.

     Operating and Maintenance Expenses

         Operating and maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 1998
decreased to $19.6 million compared to $25.0 million for the year ended December
31, 1997. On a per line basis,  operating and maintenance  expenses decreased to
approximately  $110 per average access line for the year ended December 31, 1998
from  $190  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  1997 as the  Company  achieved
productivity  improvements,  including  discontinuing the use of labor intensive
manual switchboards through the use of modern switching  technology,  as well as
increased focus on reducing operating expenses.

     Termination of Management Services Agreement

         For the year ended  December  31, 1998,  the Company  recorded a charge
totaling  $11.1  million  representing  the  present  value of  payments  due to
Citizens  International  Management  Services  Company under a  termination  and
consulting agreement. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Depreciation and Amortization

         Depreciation  and amortization  charges  increased to $11.6 million for
the year ended  December 31, 1998 from $8.3 million for the year ended  December
31, 1997.

     Management Fees

         Management fees pursuant to management service agreements  decreased to
$2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $5.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 1997.  This decrease was due to the termination of management
services  agreement  between the Company and Citizens  International  Management
Services Company. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The
Company does not have any continuing management services agreement.

     Loss from Operations

         Loss from  operations  increased  to $6.1  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 1998 compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.
Excluding  the  cost  of  terminating  the  management  services  agreement  and
management  fees,  income from  operations for the years ended December 31, 1998
and  1997  would  have  been  $7.6  million  and  $4.5  million,   respectively.
Contributing to such  improvements  were higher revenues and lower operating and
maintenance  expenses during the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 1997, offset by increased  depreciation and amortization
charges during the year

     Foreign Exchange Loss

         Foreign  exchange  losses  decreased to $0.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 1998 from $0.5 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997.  Such
foreign  exchange losses  resulted from the devaluation of the Hungarian  forint
against the U.S. dollar and the German Mark.

     Interest Expense

         Interest expense increased to $45.9 million for the year ended December
31, 1998 from $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.  This increase
was  attributable  to higher  average debt levels during the year ended December
31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997 as the Company incurred
additional   indebtedness   in  order  to  continue  the   construction  of  its
telecommunications   networks  and  repay  other  loan   obligations.   Interest
capitalized and included in the cost of construction of certain long term assets
amounted to approximately $0.3 million during 1998 and $4.5 million in 1997.

     Other, net

         Other,  net income amounted to $0.8 million for the year ended December
31,  1998 as  compared to $13,000 for the year ended  December  31,  1997.  This
increase  during the year ended December 31, 1998 is due to an approximate  $0.8
million  gain  realized  related to the  termination  of the  former  management
services  agreement  between the Company and Citizens  International  Management
Services Company.  Under such termination  agreement,  the Company satisfied its
obligations,  under a previous management services agreement, of $9.6 million by
issuing  100,000 shares of Common Stock valued at $513,000 and a promissory note
in the amount of $8.4 million.  See Note 15 of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.

     Net Loss

         As a result of the factors  discussed above, the Company recorded a net
loss of $50.6 million,  or $9.53 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1998
as compared  to a net loss of $36.2  million,  or $7.97 per share,  for the year
ended December 31, 1997.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

         The Company has historically funded its capital requirements  primarily
through  a  combination  of debt,  equity  and  vendor  financing.  The  ongoing
development and  installation of the network in each of the Company's  Operating
Areas  required  significant  capital  expenditures  ($181 million at historical
exchange rates through December 31, 1999).  The Company's  networks now have the
capacity to provide basic  telephone  services to virtually all of the potential
subscribers within its Operating Areas.

         On October 15, 1996,  the Company  entered into a $170 million  10-year
Multi-Currency  Credit Facility with Postabank (the "Original  Postabank  Credit
Facility").  Proceeds from the Original Postabank Credit Facility could be drawn
entirely in Hungarian  forints and up to 20% of the principal  could be drawn in
U.S.  dollars  through  March 31,  1999.  Drawdowns  in  Hungarian  forints bore
interest  at a rate  of  2.5%  above  the  average  of the  yield  on  six-  and
twelve-month discounted Hungarian treasury bills while drawdowns in U.S. dollars
bore interest at 2.5% above LIBOR. Interest for the first two years was deferred
at the Company's option. Amounts outstanding in Hungarian forints, including any
deferred interest,  were payable in 32 equal quarterly installments beginning on
March 31, 1999.

         In October 1996,  the Company  borrowed the equivalent of $82.3 million
in Hungarian forints under the Original Postabank Credit Facility. Approximately
$75.2  million of this  amount  was used to repay  Citicorp  all funds  advanced
pursuant to a $75.0 million  secured term loan credit  facility  entered into in
March  1996,  and $2.0  million  in fees and costs  representing  settlement  in
connection with the cancellation of the Company's  proposed private placement of
debt securities.  The remaining $5.1 million was used to pay management fees and
reimbursable  costs  owed  to  Citizens  pursuant  to  the  Management  Services
Agreement with Citizens.  An additional $5.6 million of the facility was used to
pay loan  origination  fees and costs to  Postabank  under the terms of the loan
agreement, $2 million of which were reimbursed to the Company in equal quarterly
installments  over a two year period,  and was being  amortized over the life of
the  loan  facility.  The  remainder  of the  proceeds  were  used  to  complete
construction of the Company's  telecommunication  networks,  provide  additional
working capital,  and refinance or repay other existing debt obligations.  As of
December  31, 1998,  the Company had borrowed the entire $170 million  under the
Postabank Credit Facility.

         On May 12, 1999, the Company entered into various agreements as part of
a revision of its capital  structure with the following  parties:  Postabank Rt.
("Postabank"); Tele Danmark A/S ("Tele Danmark"); the Danish Investment Fund for
Central and Eastern  Europe (the "Danish  Fund");  CU  CapitalCorp  and Citizens
International  Management  Services  Company,  each of which  is a  wholly-owned
subsidiary of Citizens  Utilities  Company  (Citizens  Utilities Company and its
subsidiaries  are hereinafter  referred to as  "Citizens").  As a result of such
agreements,  the Company  extinguished  all of its  obligations (i) to Postabank
under the Original Postabank Credit Facility in the amount of approximately $193
million  and the amounts  borrowed  to settle a portion  due under a  contractor
financing  facility in the amount of approximately  $16 million;  (ii) to one of
its  contractors  under  a  contractor  financing  facility  in  the  amount  of
approximately $35 million; and (iii) to Citizens under a $8.4 million promissory
note which was payable in 2004 and an  obligation to pay Citizens $21 million in
28 quarterly installments of $750,000 each from 2004 through and including 2010.
The  effect  of these  transactions  has  been a  significant  reduction  in the
financial  obligations  of the Company.  The Company has borrowed from Postabank
$138 million  ($134  million at current  exchange  rates) under a one-year  dual

                                      -39-

currency  bridge loan  agreement in Hungarian  forints and euros and $25 million
pursuant to certain  unsecured  notes which mature in 2007.  Some of the various
agreements which were entered into as of May 12, 1999 are described herein. (The
descriptions and summaries herein do not purport to be complete, and are subject
to, and qualified in their entirety by, reference to each such agreement, copies
of which are filed as Exhibits hereto).

         The Company and  Postabank  entered  into a Dual  Currency  Bridge Loan
Agreement  (the  "Postabank  Bridge Loan  Agreement")  pursuant to which  HTCC's
subsidiaries  borrowed the  equivalent of $111 million in Hungarian  forints and
$27 million in euros which funds were  applied to the  repayment of the Original
Postabank  Credit  Facility.  The loan is  repayable  on May 10,  2000 and bears
interest  at an initial  rate of 2.25% (the  "Margin")  plus the  Budapest  Bank
Offering  Rate  or Euro  LIBOR  Rate  (currently  approximately  15%  and  2.5%,
respectively)  which  Margin  increases  incrementally  to 4.25%,  in  quarterly
increments  of 1% over the next  year.  HTCC and one of its  subsidiaries,  HTCC
Consulting  Rt. are  guarantors  for the HTCC  subsidiaries  under the Postabank
Bridge  Loan  Agreement.  The Company  has  pledged  all of its  intangible  and
tangible assets,  including HTCC's ownership interests in its subsidiaries,  and
its real property to secure all of the  obligations  under the Postabank  Bridge
Loan  Agreement.  The Company entered into a series of agreements to secure such
obligations under the Postabank Bridge Loan Agreement.

         The Company and  Postabank  also  entered  into a  Securities  Purchase
Agreement (the  "Securities  Purchase  Agreement")  pursuant to which  Postabank
purchased  2,428,572  shares of the  Company's  common  stock  for an  aggregate
purchase price of $34 million.  The Securities  Purchase  Agreement provides for
one person designated by Postabank to be nominated for election to the Company's
Board of Directors.  Postabank  cannot  transfer its shares until the earlier of
(x) the repayment in full of all the obligations under the Postabank Bridge Loan
Agreement or (y) May 10, 2000,  and then Postabank can only transfer such shares
incrementally  through 2003 subject to the Company's right of first refusal. The
Company's  right of first  refusal  expires in January 2003 and is assignable by
the  Company  to any  beneficial  holder  of  more  than  10%  of the  Company's
outstanding  common  stock.  The  Company  applied the  proceeds  from the stock
issuance to the repayment of the Original Postabank Credit Facility. Pursuant to
the Securities Purchase  Agreement,  the Company issued notes to Postabank in an
aggregate  amount of $25 million (the  "Notes")  with  detachable  warrants (the
"Warrants").  The Notes accrue interest, which is payable semi-annually,  at the
LIBOR rate applicable for the six month interest  period,  plus 4%. On April 11,
2000,  the Notes were amended  such that the interest  rate was changed to LIBOR
plus 3.5%. The Notes which mature in 2007 are transferable subject to applicable
security laws.  The Warrants  which were issued  pursuant to a series of Warrant
Agreements  between the  Company  and  Postabank  enable  Postabank  to purchase
2,500,000  shares of the Company's  common stock at an exercise price of $10 per
share.  The exercise period commences on January 1, 2004 and terminates on March
31,  2007.  The  Company  has the right to  terminate  the  Warrants  in full or
proportionately  prior to January 1, 2004  provided  that the  Company  repays a
proportionate amount of the Notes and an amount equal to 7-1/2% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes repaid,  concurrently  with the termination of the
Warrants.

         The Company and Tele Danmark  entered into a Stock  Purchase  Agreement
(the "TD  Stock  Purchase  Agreement")  pursuant  to which  the  Company  issued
1,571,429  shares of Common  Stock in  exchange  for $11  million.  The  Company
applied the proceeds  from the TD Stock  Purchase  Agreement to the repayment of
the Original Postabank Credit Facility.  Tele Danmark agreed not to transfer the
shares to any party prior to May 11, 2000 without the prior  written  consent of
the Company.

                                      -40-
<PAGE>


         The Company and the Danish Fund entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement
(the  "Danish  Fund Stock  Purchase  Agreement")  pursuant  to which the Company
issued 1,285,714 shares of Common Stock in exchange for $9 million.  The Company
applied  the  proceeds  from the Danish  Fund Stock  Purchase  Agreement  to the
repayment of the Original Postabank Credit Facility.  The Danish Fund agreed not
to transfer  the shares to any party  except for Tele  Danmark  prior to May 11,
2000 without the prior written consent of the Company.

         The Company and Citizens  entered into a Stock Purchase  Agreement (the
"Citizens  Stock  Purchase  Agreement')  pursuant to which the Company issued to
Citizens  1,300,000  shares of Common Stock and 30,000  shares of the  Company's
Series  A  Preferred  Stock,  par  value  $0.01  (the  "Preferred  Shares").  In
consideration  for such  shares,  Citizens  (i)  transferred  to the Company for
cancellation  a $8.4 million  promissory  note issued by the Company to Citizens
which was to mature in 2004, (ii) agreed to forego half of the accrued  interest
due on the promissory note through May 15, 1999 and (iii) agreed to renounce and
forego any rights whatsoever to any payment of the $21 million which was payable
by the Company to  Citizens  in  quarterly  installments  of $750,000  from 2004
through and including 2010. Citizens,  as the holder of the Preferred Shares, is
entitled  to  receive  cumulative  cash  dividends  at an  annual  rate  of  5%,
compounded  annually on the liquidation  value of $70 per share. The Company may
redeem  the  Preferred  Shares at any time.  Citizens  can  convert  each of the
Preferred  Shares into  shares of the  Company's  common  stock on a one for ten
basis.  The  Citizens  Stock  Purchase  Agreement  provided  that if the average
closing  price of the  Company's  common  stock for the twenty (20) trading days
ending  March 31, 2000 is less than $7.00 per share,  then HTCC shall issue such
number of HTCC  Preferred  Shares (with a value of $70 per share) equal in value
to (i) 1,600,000  times (ii) $7.00 less the average closing price of HTCC common
stock for such twenty (20) trading day period.  The average closing price of the
Company's  common stock for the above  mentioned  period was more than $7.00 per
share and as a result,  no additional  shares of HTCC preferred  stock have been
issued to Citizens. The Citizens Stock Purchase Agreement also requires Citizens
not to transfer  any shares of HTCC common  stock which it may hold prior to May
15,  2000  without  the prior  written  consent of the  Company  and  Postabank.
Citizens  also  waived  any and  all  preemptive  and  anti-dilution  rights  in
connection  with the  transactions  described  above.  As a result  of the Stock
Purchase Agreement with Citizens,  the Company recorded  extraordinary income of
$9.0 million during the second quarter of 1999 which represented the gain on the
extinguishment of the liabilities the Company had with Citizens.

         During 1996 and 1997,  the Company  entered into  several  construction
contracts  with a  Hungarian  contractor  which  totalled  $59.0  million in the
aggregate,  $47.5  million  of which  was  financed  by a  contractor  financing
facility.  The  contractor  financed the financing  facility  through a facility
provided by  Postabank.  As of December  31,  1998,  the balance  owed under the
contractor  financing facility was $36.6 million.  On March 30, 1999,  Postabank
assumed HUF 7 billion  plus accrued  interest of HUF 348 million  (approximately
$30.9  million)  of the  Company's  liability  under  the  contractor  financing
facility from the contractor,  due to the contractor's  financial  difficulties,
and sold this debt back to the  Company for HUF 3 billion  (approximately  $12.6
million).  The purchase of the debt was financed by Postabank.  On the same day,
the Company purchased HUF 4 billion  (approximately  $16.8 million) of loans the
contractor had with Postabank for HUF 900 million  (approximately  $3.8 million)
and  subsequently  offset the  booked  value of the loans  purchased  of HUF 900
million (approximately $3.8 million) against the outstanding amounts owed to the
contractor.  The purchase of these loans was also  financed by  Postabank.  As a
result of the above transactions,  the Company recorded an extraordinary gain of
HUF 4.3 billion  (approximately $18.1 million) during the second quarter of 1999
which  reflects  the  extinguishment  of all  amounts  due under the  contractor
financing facility.

         As a result of the agreements  above, the Company had 11,981,579 shares
of common stock  outstanding as of December 31, 1999. The following parties hold
the following  percentages of such shares:  Postabank 20.3%; Tele Danmark 21.4%;
the Danish Fund 10.7%;  Citizens  19.2%;  and others 28.4%.  On a  fully-diluted
basis, the Company had 20,218,638 shares outstanding. The following parties hold
the following  percentages of such shares:  Postabank 24.4%; Tele Danmark 12.7%;
the Danish Fund 6.4%; Citizens 35.2%; and others 21.3%.

         On April 11, 2000,  the Company  entered into a EUR 130 million  Senior
Secured Debt Facility  Agreement (the "Debt  Agreement") with a European banking
syndicate.  The Company  intends to draw down the entire EUR 130  million  ($124
million at current exchange rates),  which funds will be used in their entirety,
along with  another $6 million  of other  Company  funds,  to pay off the entire
outstanding balance EUR 128 million  (approximately $128 million at December 31,
1999 exchange rates) of the Postabank Bridge Loan Agreement which will result in
the  termination of the Postabank  Bridge Loan which matures on May 12, 2000, as
well as fees associated  with the Debt  Agreement.  The borrowers under the Debt
Agreement are the Operating Companies who were the borrowers under the Postabank
Bridge Loan Agreement.

         The Debt  Agreement has two  facilities.  Facility A is a floating rate
term loan in the amount of EUR 125 million (the "Term Facility") which principal
is repayable semi-annually on each June 30 and December 31 beginning on June 30,
2001 and ending on December 31, 2007. The amount of the principal  repayments on
the Term Facility are to be an  escalating  percentage of the amounts drawn down
(EUR 125 million). Any amounts borrowed under the Term Facility have to be drawn
down within thirty days of the  execution of the Debt  Agreement in either euros
or, if funded by the banking syndicate,  Hungarian forints.  The Company intends
to borrow the full EUR 125 million,  or its  equivalent  in euros and  Hungarian
forints.  Any amounts  borrowed in Hungarian  forints are repayable in Hungarian
forints.  The Term Facility loans  denominated  in euros accrue  interest at the
rate of the  Applicable  Margin  (defined  below) plus the EURIBOR  rate for the
applicable  interest  period.  The EURIBOR rate is the percentage rate per annum
determined by the Banking  Federation of the European  Union for the  applicable
interest period. The Term Facility loans denominated in Hungarian forints accrue
interest at the rate of the  Applicable  Margin  (defined  below) plus the BUBOR
rate for the applicable  interest period.  The BUBOR rate is the percentage rate
per annum determined  according to the rules  established by the Hungarian Forex
Association  and  published by the National  Bank of Hungary for the  applicable
interest  period.  The  applicable  interest  period  for  Term  Facility  Loans
denominated  in euros is, at the Company's  option in one,  three or six months.
The Company  intends to choose six months.  The applicable  interest  period for
Term Facility Loans denominated in Hungarian forints is, at the Company's option
in one or three months. The Company intends to choose three months.  Interest is
payable at the end of each interest period.  The Applicable  Margin is initially
1.75%. The Applicable Margin may be adjusted downward incrementally to a minimum
of 1.15% subject to the financial  performance of the Company as measured by the
ratio of the  Company's  senior debt to its  earnings  before  interest,  taxes,
depreciation and amortization.

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

         Facility B is a  floating  rate  revolving  loan in the amount of EUR 5
million (the "Revolving  Facility")  which can only be drawn down in euros.  The
Revolving  Facility will be reduced to EUR 2.5 million on December 31, 2005. The
Revolving  Facility is available until December 31, 2007. The Company intends to
borrow the full amount of the  Revolving  Facility to pay off the balance of the
Postabank  Bridge Loan Agreement and fees associated with the  transaction.  The
principal amount borrowed under the Revolving Facility is due at the end of each
interest period at which point the Company can,  subject to certain  conditions,
roll over the amount of principal  borrowed.  The applicable interest period for
the Revolving  Facility is, at the Company's option,  one, three, or six months.
The Company intends to choose six months. Interest is payable at the end of each
interest  period  calculated  similar to Term  Facility A loans  denominated  in
euros.

         As a part of the Debt  Agreement,  the  Company is required to hedge at
least 50% of the euro  borrowings  until a minimum of 50% of Facility A has been
cancelled,  prepaid or repaid.  Dependent on its cash flow,  commencing in 2001,
the Company will be required to prepay the equivalent of $25 million on Facility
A until such time as $25 million has been prepaid.  The amount of the prepayment
in any year shall be at least 50% of the Company's excess cash flow, if any, for
the previous  financial  year as defined in the Debt  Agreement.  The prepayment
amount is due within 15 days of the publication of each annual Form 10-K filing.

         The Company is obligated to pay a commitment  fee equal to the lower of
0.75% or 50% of the Applicable Margin on any available unused commitment.  Since
the Company intends to borrow the full amount of the Debt Agreement soon,  there
will be no commitment  fee payable at the present time.  The Company will pay an
arrangement fee in the amount of EUR 2,665,000 (approximately $2,500,000) and an
agency  fee in the amount of  $60,000.  HTCC and one of its  subsidiaries,  HTCC
Consulting  Rt., are guarantors for the HTCC  operating  subsidiaries  under the
Debt  Agreement.  The Company has pledged  all of its  intangible  and  tangible
assets,  including HTCC's ownership interests in its subsidiaries,  and its real
property to secure all of the obligations under the Debt Agreement.  The Company
and Citibank  Rt.(as  security  agent)  entered into a series of  agreements  to
secure  all of the  Company's  obligations  under the Debt  Agreement.  The Debt
Agreement  contains  customary  representation  and  warranties.  The Company is
subject to some  restrictive  covenants  including  restrictions  regarding  the
ability of the Company to pay dividends,  borrow funds, merge and dispose of its
assets. The Debt Agreement contains the customary events of default, which would
trigger early  repayment of the balance on the Debt  Agreement  including  those
related to a change of control.  If prior to the later of the  December 31, 2001
or the Trigger Date (as defined below),  Tele Danmark sells any of the shares of
Common  Stock  that it  currently  owns or Tele  Danmark  and the  Danish  Fund,
together,  no longer own 30.1% of the outstanding Common Stock, then an event of
default  shall have  occurred.  Tele Danmark and the Danish Fund  currently  own
32.1% of the outstanding  Common Stock.  The Trigger Date is defined as the date
on which for the prior two fiscal quarters the Company's debt to EBITDA ratio is
less than 3.5 to 1.  Following the Trigger Date,  Tele Danmark can only transfer
its shares with the prior written consent of banks holding at least 66.7% of the
Company's outstanding debt under the Debt Facility.

         In 1995, the Company  applied for network  construction  subsidies from
the  Hungarian   government.   In  December  1995,   certain  of  the  Company's
applications were approved, subject to certain conditions, which resulted in the
Company being awarded subsidies  aggregating $0.9 million.  The Company received
such  subsidies  in  installments  in the  fourth  quarter of 1996 and the first
quarter of 1997. One-half of such funds were received in the form of a grant and
one-half in the form of a non-interest  bearing loan repayable over a three year
period beginning in 1997.

         Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $18.5 million for the
year ended  December  31,  1999  compared  to $11.1  million  for the year ended
December 31, 1998.  For the years ended  December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company
used $9.9 million and $15.6  million,  respectively,  in  investing  activities,
which  was   primarily   used  to  fund  the   construction   of  the  Company's
telecommunications  networks.  Financing  activities  provided  net cash of $1.0
million  and $9.3  million  for the  years  ended  December  31,  1999 and 1998,
respectively.

Inflation and Foreign Currency

         For the  year  ended  December  31,  1999,  inflation  in  Hungary  was
approximately  10% on an annualized  basis.  It is the stated policy goal of the
Hungarian government to keep inflation from exceeding  approximately 7% in 2000.
Due to the  strengthening of the U.S. dollar on  international  currency markets
during the year,  the Hungarian  forint/U.S.  dollar  exchange rate increased to
252.52 as of December 31, 1999, an effective devaluation during 1999 of 14.3%.

         The  Company's  Hungarian  operations  generate  revenues in  Hungarian
forints and incur operating and other expenses,  including capital expenditures,
predominately  in  Hungarian  forints but also in U.S.  dollars.  The  Company's
resulting foreign currency exposure is difficult to hedge due to the significant
costs involved and the lack of a market for such hedging.  In addition,  certain
of the  Company's  balance sheet  accounts are  expressed in foreign  currencies
other than the Hungarian forint, the Company's Hungarian subsidiaries functional
currency.  Accordingly, when such accounts are converted into Hungarian forints,
the Company is subject to foreign  exchange gains and losses which are reflected
as a  component  of  net  income  or  loss.  When  the  Company's  subsidiaries'
forint-denominated  accounts  are  translated  into U.S.  dollars for  financial
reporting  purposes,  the  Company is subject to  translation  adjustments,  the
effect of which is reflected as a component of stockholders' deficiency.

         While the Company has the ability to increase the prices it charges for
its services  commensurate with increases in the Hungarian  Consumer Price Index
("CPI")  pursuant to its licenses from the Hungarian  government,  it may choose
not to implement the full amount of the increase  permitted  due to  competitive
and other concerns.  In addition,  the rate of increase in the Hungarian CPI may
be less than the rate at which the Hungarian forint devalues.  As a result,  the
Company may be unable to generate cash flows to the degree necessary to meet its
obligation in currencies other than the Hungarian forint.

Year 2000

         The Company  initiated a project designed to identify and mitigate Year
2000 computer  deficiencies  in 1998.  The Company formed a Year 2K project team
consisting of Company  employees and  representatives  of systems  vendors.  The
Company also formed an oversight  committee  comprised of senior  management  to
oversee the Y2K issue.

         The Company originally estimated the total costs of remediation,  which
included  the  replacement   and/or  upgrade  of  certain   equipment  would  be
approximately  $785,000.  However,  due to  agreements  with its switch  vendors
during 1999, the Company was able to obtain Y2K switching  upgrades for no cost.
For the year  ended  December  31,  1999,  the  Company  expensed  approximately
$162,000 for remediation of the Y2K problem,  which is included in the Company's
Consolidated Statement of Operations.

                                      -44-
<PAGE>


         From December 31, 1999, to March 15, 2000,  the Company  operated a Y2K
information  center to monitor  the  Company's  facilities  and  operations.  No
material problems were reported in any of the Company's facilities or operations
during  this  period.  As of the  date  of  this  filing,  the  Company  had not
experienced any material Year 2000 problems with its IT or non-IT  systems,  nor
had the Company  experienced any material problems with any of its key customers
or suppliers.  The Company will continue to monitor its systems for possible Y2K
related problems,  but based on its experience since December 31, 1999, does not
expect that any material Y2K problems will emerge.

Prospective Accounting Pronouncements

         In June 1998,  Statement of Financial  Account Standards No. 133 ("SFAS
133"),  "Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging  Activities",  was
issued.  SFAS 133 established  accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments and for hedging  activities.  SFAS requires that an entity recognize
all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at
fair value.  The Statement,  as amended by SFAS 137, is effective for all fiscal
quarters of fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15,  2000.  The Company has not
purchased  derivative  instruments or entered into hedging activities during the
three years ended  December 31, 1999. The Company will be required to enter into
hedging  transactions  under the terms of the Company's  EUR 130 million  Senior
Secured Debt Facility,  which was entered into on April 11, 2000. The Company is
currently  evaluating  the effect,  if any, the  pronouncement  will have on its
consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Market Risk Exposure

         The Company is exposed to various types of risk in the normal course of
its  business,   including  the  impact  of  foreign   currency   exchange  rate
fluctuations  and interest  rate  changes.  Company  operations,  including  all
revenues and  approximately  75% of operational costs are Hungarian forint based
and are  therefore  subject to exchange rate  variability  between the Hungarian
forint and U.S.  dollar.  This  variability  is  mitigated  by several  factors,
including  the Hungarian  National Bank policy to peg the Hungarian  forint to a
currency  basket and the  telecommunications  pricing  law. The  "crawling  peg"
policy of the National Bank of Hungary  maintained a scheduled daily devaluation
of the Hungarian  forint through a currency  basket  consisting of 70% euros and
30% U.S.  dollars for 1999.  Effective  January 1, 2000, the Hungarian forint is
pegged 100% to the Euro.  The Hungarian  forint is allowed to trade within 2.25%
of the  mid-point  of its  trading  band.  For the first  quarter  of 2000,  the
Hungarian government devaluation policy was 0.4% per month. As of April 1, 2000,
the Hungarian  government  announced the monthly  planned  devaluation  rate was
decreased to 0.3% per month for the Hungarian forint, which totals approximately
3.9% for 2000. The  telecommunications  pricing law allows prices to increase by
the Consumer  Price Index (CPI)  adjusted for an efficiency  factor of up to 2%.
Thus, to the extent that adjusted CPI follows devaluation, revenues are somewhat
insulated from exchange rate risk.

         The debt obligations of the Company are Hungarian forint, euro and U.S.
dollar  denominated.  The interest rate on the Hungarian forint debt obligations
is based on the Budapest Interbank Offer Rate (BUBOR). The interest rates on the
euro and U.S. dollar denominated obligations are based on LIBOR. Over the medium
to long term,  the BUBOR rate is expected to follow  inflation  and  devaluation

                                      -45-
<PAGE>

trends and the Company does not currently  believe it has any material  interest
rate risk on any of its Hungarian forint  denominated debt obligations.  If a 1%
change in the BUBOR interest rate were to occur, the Company's  interest expense
would  increase  or  decrease  by  approximately  $1.0  million  based  upon the
Company's year-end debt level. If a 1% change in the LIBOR interest rate were to
occur,   the  Company's   interest   expense  would   increase  or  decrease  by
approximately $500,000.

         The  Company  is also  exposed to  exchange  rate risk in so far as the
Company  has debt  obligations  in other  than the  functional  currency  of its
majority owned  Hungarian  subsidiaries.  Given the Company's debt  obligations,
which include euro and U.S. dollar denominated debt, if a 1% change in Hungarian
forint/euro exchange rates were to occur, the Company's exchange rate risk would
increase or  decrease by  approximately  $252,000.  If a 1% change in  Hungarian
forint/U.S.  dollar  exchange rates were to occur,  the Company's  exchange rate
risk would increase or decrease by approximately $250,000.

International, assumed responsibility for the issue of the independent auditors'
report on the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the
three year period ended December 31, 1999. The New York, New York office of KPMG
LLP was  responsible for the issue of the  independent  auditors'  report on the
consolidated  financial  statements of the Company as of and for the three years
ended  December 31, 1998.  The report issued thereon by KPMG LLP dated March 24,
1999 contained a "going concern" explanatory  paragraph concerning the Company's
ability  to  continue  as a going  concern.  The  independent  auditors'  report
contained herein does not have a "going concern" explanatory paragraph.

          Independent Auditors' Report


          The Board of Directors and Stockholders
          Hungarian Telephone and Cable Corp.

          We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of
          Hungarian  Telephone and Cable Corp. and  subsidiaries  as of December
          31,  1999  and  1998,  and  the  related  consolidated  statements  of
          operations and comprehensive income (loss),  stockholders'  deficiency
          and cash flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period  ended
          December 31, 1999.  These  consolidated  financial  statements are the
          responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to
          express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on
          our audits.

          We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
          standards in the United  States of America.  Those  standards  require
          that we plan and  perform  the  audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance
          about   whether  the  financial   statements   are  free  of  material
          misstatement.  An audit includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence
          supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
          audit also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used and
          significant  estimates made by  management,  as well as evaluating the
          overall financial statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits
          provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

          In our opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  referred to
          above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
          of Hungarian Telephone and Cable Corp. and subsidiaries as of December
          31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their  operations and their cash
          flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period ended  December
          31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles
          in the United States of America.

              HUNGARIAN TELEPHONE AND CABLE CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997


(1)    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

       (a)    Description of Business and Other Related Matters

              Hungarian  Telephone  and Cable Corp.  was  organized on March 23,
              1992 to own and manage  telecommunications  companies  in Hungary.
              Four  subsidiaries of the Company ("the Operating  Companies") are
              presently  engaged  in  the  ownership  and  operation  of  public
              switched telephone service.

              The Company, through two of its subsidiaries, commenced operations
              in  two   concession   regions  in  1995  and  through  two  other
              subsidiaries,  commenced operations in three additional concession
              areas effective January 1, 1996. Accordingly,  the Company devoted
              substantially  all of its efforts  through 1994 and a considerable
              portion  of  1995  to  obtaining  concession  rights,  negotiating
              acquisitions,  raising  capital in the form of debt and equity and
              preparing  to  commence  operations.  As  a  result,  the  Company
              recognized no revenues until 1995.

              From 1995 through  1998,  the  Company's  activities  involved the
              acquisition of the  concessions  and  telecommunications  networks
              from Magyar  Tavkozlesi Rt.  ("Matav") and the subsequent  design,
              development  and  construction  of the  modern  telecommunications
              infrastructure  that the Company now has in service. By the end of
              1998,  the Company's  networks had the capacity,  with only normal
              capital  expenditure  requirements in the future, to provide basic
              telephone  services to virtually all of the potential  subscribers
              within its operating areas. The Company earns substantially all of
              its telecommunications revenue from measured service fees, monthly
              line rental fees,  connection fees, public pay telephone  services
              and ancillary services  (including charges for additional services
              purchased  at the  customer's  discretion).  The Company  paid the
              Ministry  $11.5  million (at  historical  exchange  rates) for its
              concessions,  spent  approximately  $23.2  million (at  historical
              exchange rates) to acquire the existing  telecommunications assets
              in its  Operating  Areas from  Matav,  and has spent $181  million
              through  December 31, 1999 (at historical  exchange  rates) on the
              development   and    construction   of   its    telecommunications
              infrastructure. The Company funded these costs and working capital
              needs  primarily  through  a $170  million  Credit  Facility  with
              Postabank Rt. (the  "Original  Postabank  Credit  Facility") and a
              $47.5 million contractor  financing facility.  The Company and the
              Hungarian   contractor  which  granted  the  contractor  financing
              facility  have a  disagreement  with  respect  to  several  issues
              relating  to the  quality  and  quantity  of the work  done by the
              contractor.  In addition,  on March 31, 1999,  the Company did not
              have sufficient funds on hand to pay the first  installment due on
              the Original Postabank Credit Facility.  Due to this fact, as well
              as the disagreement the Company has with the Hungarian contractor,
              on March 30, 1999,  and May 12, 1999,  the Company  entered into a
              series  of  transactions  (see  notes  4, 5,  6, 8 and  11)  which
              restructured  the  Company's  debt and capital  structure.  As the
              final step in the Company's debt and capital  restructuring  which
              started in 1999, on April 11, 2000, the Company entered into a EUR
              130 million Senior  Secured Debt Facility with a European  banking
              syndicate (see note 19).

       (b)    Principles of Consolidation and the Use of Estimates

              The  consolidated   financial   statements   include the financial
              statements  of the Hungarian  Telephone and Cable  Corp.  and  its
              majority  owned   subsidiaries;   Kelet-Nograd  Com  Rt.,  "KNC"),
              Raba-Com   Rt.,    ("Raba-Com"),     Hungarotel   Tavkozlesi   Rt.
              ("Hungarotel"),    Papa   es   Tersege  Telefon   Koncesszios  Rt.
              ("Papatel"),    HTCC   Consulting   Rt.  ("HTCC  Consulting")  and
              Pilistav  Rt.  ("Pilistav").   All  material intercompany balances
              and transactions have been eliminated.

            HUNGARIAN TELEPHONE AND CABLE CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997


              The consolidated  financial  statements are prepared in accordance
              with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). In
              preparing  financial  statements  in  conformity  with U.S.  GAAP,
              management  is required to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that
              affect  reported   amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  the
              disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
              financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting
              period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

       (c)    Revenue Recognition

              Telephone  service  revenues  are  recognized  when earned and are
              primarily  derived  from  usage of the  Company's  local  exchange
              networks and facilities or under revenue  sharing  agreements with
              Matav, the international  and national long distance  interconnect
              service provider.

              Advance  subscriber  payments  represent  advance  connection fees
              received from telephone  subscribers  and are recognized as income
              when the subscriber is connected to the telephone network. Advance
              fees  received  are  required  to be repaid  with  interest if the
              subscriber is not connected to the local telephone network.

        (d)   Foreign Currency Translation

              The statutory accounts of the Company's consolidated  subsidiaries
              and affiliates are maintained in accordance with local  accounting
              regulations and are stated in local  currencies.  Local statements
              are adjusted to U.S. GAAP and then translated into U.S. dollars in
              accordance  with Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No.
              52, "Accounting for Foreign Currency Translation" ("SFAS 52").

              Since commencement of revenue generating  activities,  the Company
              has used the Hungarian  forint ("HUF") as the functional  currency
              for  its  majority  owned  Hungarian  subsidiaries.   Accordingly,
              foreign  currency assets and liabilities are translated  using the
              exchange  rates in effect at the balance  sheet  date.  Results of
              operations  are generally  translated  using the average  exchange
              rates prevailing throughout the year. The effects of exchange rate
              fluctuations   on   translating   foreign   currency   assets  and
              liabilities  into U.S.  dollars are  accumulated  as part of other
              comprehensive  income in  stockholders'  equity.  Foreign exchange
              fluctuations  related to  intercompany  balances  are  included in
              equity if such balances are intended to be long-term in nature. At
              the time the Company settles such balances,  the resulting gain or
              loss is reflected  in the  consolidated  statement of  operations.
              Gains and losses from foreign  currency  transactions are included
              in operations in the period in which they occur.

       (e)    Cash Equivalents

              For the purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the
              Company  considers  all highly liquid debt  instruments  purchased
              with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997




       (f)    Inventories

              Inventories  consist  primarily of telephones for resale and spare
              parts,  are valued  using the FIFO  method,  and are stated at the
              lower of cost or market.

       (g)    Property, Plant and Equipment

              Property,  plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
              computed using the straight-line  method over the estimated useful
              lives of the respective assets.

       (h)    Intangible Assets

              Intangible  assets are comprised of  concession  fees paid and the
              excess of cost over net assets  acquired.  The concession fees are
              being  amortized  over the  25-year  concession  period  using the
              straight-line method. The excess of cost over net assets acquired,
              goodwill,  is also amortized over 25 years using the straight-line
              method.

       (i)    Stock Based Compensation

              The Company accounts for its stock option plans in accordance with
              Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123 which
              allows  entities to continue to apply the provisions of Accounting
              Principles  Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net
              income (loss) and pro forma earnings (loss) per share  disclosures
              for employee  stock option grants made in 1995 and future years as
              if the  fair-value-based  method,  as defined in SFAS No. 123, had
              been applied.  The Company has elected to apply the  provisions of
              APB Opinion No. 25 and provide the pro forma  disclosure  required
              by SFAS No. 123. See Note 12.

       (j)    Income Taxes

              Deferred tax assets and liabilities,  net of appropriate valuation
              allowances,   are  recognized  for  the  future  tax  consequences
              attributable  to  differences   between  the  financial  statement
              carrying  amounts of  existing  assets and  liabilities  and their
              respective   tax  bases  and   operating   loss  and  tax   credit
              carry-forwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities,  if any, are
              measured  using  enacted  tax rates  expected  to apply to taxable
              income  in the  years in which  those  temporary  differences  are
              expected to be  recovered  or settled.  The effect on deferred tax
              assets and  liabilities  of a change in tax rates is recognized in
              operations in the period that includes the enactment date.

              The Company's  Hungarian  operating  subsidiaries  are 100% exempt
              from  Hungarian  income tax for a period of five  years  beginning
              from January 1, 1994 and 60% exempt for the subsequent  five years
              as  long  as  (1)   capitalization   stays  above  50,000,000  HUF
              (approximately  $198,000 at December 31, 1999 exchange rates), (2)
              foreign ownership exceeds 30% of the registered  capital,  and (3)
              more than 50% of the revenue earned arises from  telecommunication
              services.

       (k)    Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share

              Basic  earnings  (loss) per share  ("EPS") is computed by dividing
              income or loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted
              average  number  of  common  shares  outstanding  for the  period.
              Diluted EPS reflects the  potential  dilution from the exercise or
              conversion of securities into common stock.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997


              Net earnings (loss) and weighted  average shares  outstanding used
              for computing  diluted loss per common share were the same as that
              used for  computing  basic loss per  common  share for each of the
              years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997.

              The Company had potentially  dilutive common stock  equivalents of
              8,237,059,  7,474,915 and  7,200,859 for the years ended  December
              31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively,  which were not included in
              the  computation of diluted net loss per common share because they
              were  antidilutive  for  the  periods  presented.  The  basis  for
              determining  whether  common stock  equivalents  were  potentially
              dilutive was loss before extraordinary items.

       (l)    Impairment  of  Long-Lived  Assets  and  Long-Lived  Assets  to Be
              Disposed Of

              The Company  evaluates the carrying value of long-lived  assets to
              be held and used,  including goodwill,  whenever events or changes
              in  circumstances  indicate  that the  carrying  amount may not be
              recoverable.  The carrying value of a long-lived asset,  including
              goodwill,  is considered impaired when the projected  undiscounted
              future cash flows  related to the asset are less than its carrying
              value.  The  Company  measures  impairment  based on the amount by
              which the  carrying  value  exceeds  the fair market  value.  Fair
              market value is determined  primarily  using the projected  future
              cash  flows  discounted  at a  rate  commensurate  with  the  risk
              involved.  Losses  on  long-lived  assets  to be  disposed  of are
              determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are
              reduced for the cost to dispose.

 (2)   Cash and Restricted Cash

       (a)    Concentration

              At December 31, 1999, cash of $16,622,000 ($374,000 denominated in
              U.S.  dollars and the  equivalent of  $16,248,000  denominated  in
              Hungarian  Forints)  was on  deposit  with  banks in  Hungary.  In
              addition,  cash of  $575,000  denominated  in U.S.  dollars was on
              deposit with two major banks in the United States.

       (b)    Restriction

              At December 31, 1999,  $22,000 of cash denominated in U.S. dollars
              was  deposited  in escrow  accounts  under  terms of  construction
              contracts. In addition, $89,000 was restricted pursuant to certain
              arrangements with other parties.

       On May 12, 1999, as a part of the  restructuring  of its debt and capital
       structure,  see Notes 5 and 11, the Company  borrowed  from  Postabank es
       Takarekpenztar  ("Postabank"),  a Hungarian commercial bank, $138 million
       ($128 million at December 31, 1999 exchange  rates) under a one-year dual
       currency bridge loan agreement in Hungarian forints and euros. The bridge
       loan is repayable  on May 12, 2000 and bears  interest at an initial rate
       of 2.25% (the "Margin") plus the Budapest Interbank Offering Rate or Euro
       LIBOR Rate  (14.64% and 3.47%,  respectively  at December 31, 1999) which
       Margin increases  incrementally  to 4.25%, in quarterly  increments of 1%
       during the loan term.  At December  31,  1999,  the Margin was 3.25%.  On
       April 11, 2000, the Company signed a 130 million Euro senior secured debt
       facility agreement with a syndicate of Hungarian and non-Hungarian banks,
       the proceeds of which will be used to repay the existing  bridge loan. As
       a result of this refinancing,  the Company has classified $123 million of
       its short-term loans at December 31, 1999, as long-term debt. See Note 19
       for further explanation of this subsequent event.

       On October 15, 1996, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into a $170
       million  10-year  Multi-Currency  Credit  Facility  with  Postabank  (the
       "Original  Postabank Credit Facility").  The Company utilized the funding
       provided  by  the  Original   Postabank   Credit   Facility  to  continue
       construction of its telecommunications networks, provide working capital,
       and repay other debt  obligations  during 1997 and 1998.  The Company did
       not have  sufficient  funds to meet the  required  repayment  obligations
       under the Original Postabank Credit Facility as of March 31, 1999. On May
       12, 1999,  the Company  entered into  various  agreements  as part of the
       restructuring  of its  capital  structure  with  the  following  parties:
       Postabank;  Tele Danmark A/S ("Tele Danmark");  and the Danish Investment

       Fund for Central and Eastern  Europe (the "Danish Fund") (see Notes 8 and
       11). As a result of such agreements,  the Company extinguished all of its
       obligations to Postabank under the Original  Postabank Credit Facility in
       the amount of  approximately  $193 million and the $16.4 million borrowed
       in settlement of the amount due under the contractor  financing  facility
       described  below.  On the same day, the Company  borrowed from  Postabank
       $138 million ($128  million at December 31, 1999 exchange  rates) under a
       one-year dual  currency  bridge loan  agreement in Hungarian  forints and
       euros and $25 million  pursuant to certain  unsecured  notes payable (the
       "Notes") (see Note 6).

       As a  result  of the  extinguishment  of the  Original  Postabank  Credit
       Facility,  the Company recorded an extraordinary  loss of HUF 1.5 billion
       (approximately  $6.2 million at  historical  exchange  rates)  during the
       second quarter of 1999 which  represented  the write-off of the remaining
       unamortized  deferred  financing  costs,  included  in other  assets  and
       deferred  credits  at  December  31,  1998,  pertaining  to the  Original
       Postabank Credit Facility.

        During  1996 and 1997,  Hungarotel  entered  into  several  construction
        contracts  with a Hungarian  contractor  which totalled $59.0 million in
        the aggregate (at historical exchange rates), $47.5 million of which was
        financed by a contractor financing facility.  The financing was provided
        by the  contractor.  The  contractor  financed  the  financing  facility
        through a facility  provided by Postabank.  As of December 31, 1998, the
        balance owed under the contractor  financing facility was $36.6 million.
        On March 30, 1999, Postabank assumed HUF 7 billion plus accrued interest
        of HUF 348 million  (approximately  $30.9 million at historical exchange
        rates)  of  the  Company's  liability  under  the  contractor  financing
        facility  from  the  contractor,   due  to  the  contractor's  financial
        difficulties,  and sold this debt back to the  Company for HUF 3 billion
        (approximately $12.6 million at historical exchange rates). The purchase
        of the debt was  financed  by  Postabank.  On the same day,  the Company
        purchased  HUF 4 billion  (approximately  $16.8  million  at  historical
        exchange  rates) of loans the  contractor had with Postabank for HUF 900
        million  (approximately  $3.8 million at historical  exchange rates) and
        subsequently  offset the booked value of the loans  purchased of HUF 900
        million  (approximately  $3.8  million  at  historical  exchange  rates)
        against the outstanding amounts owed to the contractor.  The purchase of
        these  loans was also  financed by  Postabank.  As a result of the above
        transactions,  the  Company  recorded an  extraordinary  gain of HUF 4.3
        billion  (approximately  $18.1  million at  historical  exchange  rates)
        during the second quarter of 1999 which reflected the  extinguishment of
        all amounts due under the contractor financing facility.

       In 1995, the Company was awarded subsidies from the Ministry  aggregating
       HUF  118,720,000  (approximately  $850,000 at December 31, 1995  exchange
       rates). The required conditions were satisfied in 1996 and the funds were
       received  one-half  in the form of a grant and  one-half in the form of a
       non-interest  bearing  loan  repayable  over a three year  period.  As of
       December 31, 1999, the loan had been fully repaid.

(6)    Long-term Notes Payable

       As described in Notes 4 and 5 above, on May 12, 1999, the Company entered
       into  various  agreements  as part of the  restructuring  of its debt and
       capital structure. As one part of this overall restructuring, the Company
       issued  notes to  Postabank  in an  aggregate  amount of $25 million with
       detachable warrants (the "Warrants"). The Notes accrue interest, which is
       payable  semi-annually,  at the LIBOR rate  applicable  for the six month
       interest  period plus 4%. On April 11, 2000,  the Notes were amended such
       that the  interest  rate was  changed to six month  LIBOR plus 3.5%.  The
       Notes  which  mature  in 2007  are  transferable  subject  to  applicable
       security laws.

       The Warrants which were issued pursuant to a series of Warrant Agreements
       between the Company and Postabank enable Postabank to purchase  2,500,000
       shares of the  Company's  common  stock at an  exercise  price of $10 per
       share. The exercise period commences on January 1, 2004 and terminates on
       March 31, 2007.  The fair value of the warrants  amounted to $8.8 million

       and has been charged  directly to additional  paid-in  capital.  The fair
       value of the  warrants was  determined  using the Black  Scholes  Warrant
       Option valuation model. The unamortized discount on the notes at December
       31, 1999 was  approximately  $8.3  million.  The Company has the right to
       terminate  the  Warrants in full or  proportionately  prior to January 1,
       2004 provided that the Company repays a proportionate amount of the Notes
       and an amount equal to 7-1/2% of the  aggregate  principal  amount of the
       Notes repaid, concurrently with the termination of the Warrants.

(7)    Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities

       During  1999, one of the Company's subsidiaries, Papatel, entered into an
       agreement    with   the    Hungarian    Ministry    of    Transportation,
       Telecommunications   and  Water  Management  (the  "Ministry")  for   the
       relinquishment  of the subsidiary's right to use a broadcasting frequency
       previously  granted  by the  Ministry.  The frequency was used to provide
       telephone  services to  certain  customers.  In return for the subsidiary
       agreeing to  relinquish  the  use of the  frequency,  the Ministry paid a
       total of 308 MHUF  ($1,220,000  at December 31, 1999 exchange rates) as a
       contribution  towards  the  costs  of  purchasing  and  installing  fixed
       network  equipment  to  replace  the   parts  of the  network  using  the
       frequency.  The new fixed  network equipment  was  placed into service on
       December 31, 1999,  and the  compensation  received  from  the  Ministry,
       which is included in deferred credits and other  liabilities  at December
       31, 1999,  will be  recognized  over the  new fixed  network  equipment's
       depreciable life as a reduction  in depreciation  expense over the future
       depreciable periods.

       During 1999, another of the Company's subsidiaries,  Hungarotel,  entered
       into an agreement with the Ministry for the  relinquishment  by July 2000
       of the  subsidiary's  right to use a  broadcasting  frequency  previously
       granted by the  Ministry.  The  frequency  is used to  provide  telephone
       services to certain  customers.  For  relinquishing  the right to use the
       frequency,  the  Ministry  has paid a total of 557  MHUF  ($2,205,000  at
       December 31, 1999  exchange  rates) which is  equivalent to the September
       30,  1999 net book value of the assets  utilizing  the  frequency,  which
       amount is included in deferred credits and other  liabilities at December
       31, 1999. In addition,  the Ministry also granted Hungarotel the right to
       an interest free loan in the amount of 334 MHUF  ($1,323,000  at December
       31, 1999 exchange  rates).  No amounts have been drawn under this loan as
       of December 31, 1999.  The 557 MHUF  deferred  credit will be  recognized
       over the remaining  life of the assets  utilizing the frequency to offset
       depreciation expense on such assets. Any gain, as a result of selling the
       equipment utilizing the frequency, will be recognized at such time as the
       equipment is sold.

(8)    Transactions  with  Tele  Danmark A/S and the Danish Fund for Central and
       Eastern Europe

       On July 1, 1997, the Company  entered into an agreement with Tele Danmark
       A/S ("TDI")  pursuant to which TDI agreed to exchange its 20% interest in
       each of two operating  subsidiaries  for 420,908  shares of the Company's
       common  stock.  The  value  of  shares  on the  date  of  issue  totalled
       $3,630,000.  Under the agreement, TDI was granted the preemptive right to
       maintain its equity  ownership  percentage and the right, if TDI acquired
       the 4.8% stake in each of the operating  subsidiaries owned by the Danish
       Fund for Central and Eastern  Europe  ("the Danish  Fund"),  to sell such
       shares to the Company on similar terms.

       On September 30, 1997, TDI exercised its right and agreed to exchange the
       4.8% interest in each of two operating  subsidiaries  purchased  from the
       Danish Fund for 101,018 shares of the Company's  common stock.  The value
       of shares on the date of issue totalled $1,301,000.

                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997


       The total value of shares issued relating to these two  transactions  has
       been  recorded  as an  increase  to  goodwill  and to  Common  Stock  and
       additional paid-in capital.

       On  September  30,  1997,  the Company and TDI entered  into an agreement
       whereby  TDI agreed to  exchange  loans and  accrued  interest  totalling
       $5,534,000  to two  operating  subsidiaries  for  447,232  shares  of the
       Company's common stock.

       On May 12,  1999,  the  Company  and TDI  entered  into a Stock  Purchase
       Agreement  (the "TD  Stock  Purchase  Agreement")  pursuant  to which the
       Company issued 1,571,429 shares of the Company's common stock in exchange
       for $11  million.  The  Company  applied the  proceeds  from the TD Stock
       Purchase  Agreement to the  repayment of the  Original  Postabank  Credit
       Facility (see Note 5). TDI agreed not to transfer the shares to any party
       prior to May 11, 2000 without the prior written consent of the Company.

       As a result of these  transactions,  TDI's share ownership in the Company
       is 21.4% of the shares  outstanding  at December 31,  1999.  TDI has been
       granted preemptive rights to maintain its ownership percentage.

       On May 12,  1999,  the Company and the Danish Fund  entered  into a Stock
       Purchase Agreement (the "Danish Fund Stock Purchase  Agreement") pursuant
       to which the Company  issued  1,285,714  shares of the  Company's  common
       stock in exchange for $9 million.  The Company  applied the proceeds from
       the Danish Fund Stock Purchase Agreement to the repayment of the Original
       Postabank  Credit  Facility  (see Note 5). The Danish  Fund agreed not to
       transfer the shares to any party except for Tele Danmark prior to May 11,
       2000 without the prior  written  consent of the  Company.  As a result of
       this  transaction,  the Danish  Fund's share  ownership in the Company is
       10.7% of the shares outstanding at December 31, 1999.

(9)    Income Taxes

       The  statutory  U.S.  Federal tax rate for the years ended  December  31,
       1999, 1998 and 1997 was 35% and the Hungarian  corporate  income tax rate
       for the  years  ended  December  31,  1999,  1998 and  1997 was 18%.  For
       Hungarian  corporate  income tax purposes,  the operating  companies were
       entitled  to a 100%  reduction  in income  taxes for the five year period
       ending  December  31,  1998 and are now  entitled to a 60%  reduction  in
       income  taxes for the  subsequent  five year period  ending  December 31,
       2003.  The effective  tax rate was zero for the years ended  December 31,
       1999, 1998 and 1997 due to the Company incurring net operating losses for
       which no tax benefit was recorded.

       For U.S.  Federal  income  tax  purposes,  the  Company  has  unused  net
       operating  loss  carryforwards  at  December  31,  1999 of  approximately
       $16,760,000  which  expire  in  2007,  $142,000;  2008,  $422,000;  2009,
       $950,000;  2010, $6,507,000;  2011, $6,328,000;  2012, $1,906,000;  2018,
       $14,000;  and  2019,  $491,000.  As a result  of  various  recent  equity
       transactions,  management  believes the Company experienced an "ownership
       change" in 1999,  as defined by Section 382 of the Internal  Revenue Code
       which limits the annual  utilization of net operating loss  carryforwards
       incurred prior to the ownership change.

                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

       For Hungarian corporate income tax purposes,  the Hungarian  subsidiaries
       have unused net  operating  loss  carryforwards  at December 31, 1999, at
       current  exchange rates, of  approximately  $62,972,000.  Of this amount,
       $12,437,000 may be carried forward  indefinitely  while $1,383,000 may be
       carried  forward until 2000,  $7,760,000  until 2001,  $11,741,000  until
       2002, $19,532,000 until 2003 and $10,119,000 until 2004.

       The tax effect of  temporary  differences  that give rise to  significant
       portions of deferred tax assets are as follows:

</TABLE>

       In  assessing  the  realizability  of  deferred  tax  assets,  management
       considers  whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
       the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of
       deferred tax assets is dependent  upon the  generation of future  taxable
       income  during the periods in which those  temporary  differences  become
       deductible.  Management considers projected future taxable income and tax
       planning  in  making  these  assessments.   During  1999,  the  valuation
       allowance  decreased  by  $2,451,000,  while  in  1998  it  increased  by
       $5,011,000.

(10)   Commitments and Contingencies

       (a)    Concession Agreements

              Certain  subsidiaries of the Company have been awarded  concession
              rights   by   the    Hungarian    Ministry   of    Transportation,
              Telecommunications  and Water  Management  ("the Ministry") to own
              and operate  local  public  telephone  networks in five regions of
              Hungary.  Each of the  concession  agreements are for a term of 25
              years and provide for an eight-year exclusivity period.

              Agreements   providing   concession   rights  in  two  regions  to
              Hungarotel  and one region to Papatel  were  entered into prior to
              their  acquisition  by the  Company and were  renegotiated  by the
              Company.  The renegotiated  concession  agreements provided for an
              initial payment to the Ministry of HUF 938,250,000  (approximately
              $6.7 at  December  31,  1995  exchange  rates)  which  was paid in
              November 1995, and for annual  concession fees based upon 2.3% and
              0.3% of net telephone service revenues for the regions operated by
              Hungarotel  and 2.3% of net  telephone  service  revenues  for the
              region operated by Papatel.

              HUNGARIAN TELEPHONE AND CABLE CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

              In 1994, the Ministry awarded concession rights to own and operate
              local  public  telephone   networks  to  KNC  and  Raba-Com  under
              agreements  which  provide for annual  concession  fees based upon
              0.1%  and  1.5% of net  telephone  service  revenues  for  regions
              operated by KNC and Raba-Com, respectively.

              The concession  agreements  provide for,  among other things,  the
              subsidiaries to provide  telephone  service to specific numbers of
              customers  by specified  dates or be subject to possible  monetary
              penalties and possibly reduction in the period of exclusivity.  As
              of December 31, 1999, the Company  believes it has fulfilled these
              service  requirements  in their  concession  areas in all material
              respects, and has not provided for any potential liability.

              The activities of the subsidiaries which own concession rights are
              regulated  by the  Ministry  and by the terms of their  respective
              concession  agreements.  The Ministry  regulates the construction,
              operation and sale of local telephone exchanges and has been given
              the authority to regulate the industry.  This  authority  includes
              approving  local,  long  distance  and  international  rates,  the
              sharing of revenues  between  concession  companies and Matav, the
              equipment  that  can be  used  in the  public  switched  telephone
              network and requiring local companies to meet specified  standards
              as to growth and services.

              The  Ministry  has  stipulated  in the  Concession  Contracts  for
              Hungarotel and Papatel,  as amended in June 1996, that each of the
              Operating   Companies  must  meet  certain   Hungarian   ownership
              requirements  so  that  by the end of the  seventh  year of  their
              Concession  Contracts Hungarian ownership must consist of 25% plus
              one share of the relevant  Operating  Company.  For the seven-year
              period  following the date or amendment of a Concession  Contract,
              as the  case may be,  Hungarian  ownership  must be at least  10%,
              except that during such period,  such  ownership may be reduced to
              as  low  as 1%  for a  period  of up to  two  years.  During  such
              seven-year period, while the Hungarian ownership block is required
              to be at least  10%,  such  Hungarian  ownership  of a 10%  equity
              holding in an Operating Company must have voting power of at least
              25% plus one share,  thus providing  Hungarian owners the right to
              block certain  transactions  which, under Hungarian corporate law,
              require  a  supermajority  (75%)  of  stockholders  voting  on the
              matter,  such as mergers and  consolidations,  increases  in share
              capital and winding-up.

               For these  purposes,  Hungarian  ownership of shares means shares
               owned by Hungarian  citizens.  Shares owned by a corporation  are
               considered  Hungarian  owned only in  proportion to the Hungarian
               ownership of such corporation.  The LTOs can also fulfill the 25%
               plus one share  Hungarian  ownership  requirement by listing such
               shares on the Budapest Stock Exchange.

               The equity ownership  requirements and exceptions described above
               are contained in the June 1996 amended  Concession  Contracts for
               Hungarotel  and  Papatel.   The  equity  ownership   requirements
               expressly set forth in KNC's and Raba-Com's  Concession Contracts
               call  for a  strict  25%  plus  one  share  Hungarian  ownership.
               However,  the  Ministry  has stated,  pursuant to a letter  dated
               September  18, 1996,  that it intends  that all of the  Operating
               Companies  be treated  equally  with  respect  to such  ownership
               requirements.

               Following a capital  transaction  with Postabank in May 1999 (see
               note 11) each of the Operating  Companies is deemed in compliance
               with the 10% ownership requirement, however none of the Companies

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

               the end of the  seven-year  period might be  considered a serious
               breach of a Concession  Contract,  giving the Ministry the right,
               among other things, to terminate the Concession  Contract.  There
               can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase the
               Hungarian  ownership  in  the  Operating  Companies  in a  manner
               sufficient to comply with such requirements in the future.

               The  Hungarian  ownership  requirements  would  effectively  give
               minority  Hungarian  stockholders in the Operating  Companies the
               ability to block  certain  corporate  transactions  requiring the
               approval of 75% of stockholders  voting on the matter,  including
               mergers  and  consolidations,  increases  in  share  capital  and
               winding-up.   In  addition,   unless  the   Hungarian   ownership
               requirements are formally  changed,  compliance would result in a
               reduction in the Company's ownership in the Operating  Companies,
               and, consequently, the Company's share of income, if any, or loss
               of the Operating Companies may be reduced proportionately.

       (b)    Construction Commitments

              KNC has a long-term frame contract with Siemens which provides for
              the continued  construction of a local  telephone  network and the
              addition of new subscribers in its service area.  During the year,
              the contract was amended to expand the number of  subscribers  the
              contractor  must connect in order to complete the  contract.  This
              contract  totals,  with the amendment  during 1999,  approximately
              $20.0 million, $2.6 million of which remains to be spent.

        (c)   Leases

              The Company leases office facilities in Connecticut, which require
              minimum annual rentals. Certain of the Company's subsidiaries also
              rent office space and other facilities. Rent expense for the years
              ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, was $395,000, $199,000 and
              $160,000,   respectively,   and  is  included  in  operating   and
              maintenance  expenses.  Lease  obligations for the subsequent five
              years are as follows (at current exchange rates):  2000, $307,000;
              2001,  $280,000;   2002,  $269,000;   2003,  $270,000;  and  2004,
              $290,000.

       (d)    Legal Proceedings

              Hungarotel  is a defendant  in a lawsuit  brought in Hungary  that
              alleges  breach of contract.  The plaintiff is seeking  payment of
              approximately HUF 222 million (approximately  $879,000 at December
              31, 1999 exchange  rates) plus interest.  The Company  believes it
              has  meritorious  defenses to the claim and does not believe there
              will be any  material  adverse  effect  from the  outcome  of this
              proceeding.

              Raba-Com  is a  defendant  in a  lawsuit  seeking  refund  of  the
              connection  fee  paid by a  residential  customer  due to delay in
              providing   telephone  service.   Management  believes  there  are
              meritorious defenses to the claim and expects to prevail.  Should,
              however,  the  legal  proceedings  result  in a final  unfavorable
              outcome,  the Company  could be subject to  additional  claims for
              refunds of connection fees received.

              HTCC Consulting and Papatel are involved in several  disputes with
              the Hungarian  taxing  authorities  (the "APEH") pursuant to which
              the APEH alleges  Consulting  owes HUF 105 million  (approximately
              $416,000 at December 31, 1999 exchange rates) and Papatel owes HUF
              26 million  (approximately  $103,000 at December 31, 1999 exchange
              rates) for various reasons.  The Operating  Companies believe that
              the APEH claims are  without  merit and are  vigorously  defending
              themselves against such claims.

              HUNGARIAN TELEPHONE AND CABLE CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

              During  1996  and  1997,   the  Company   entered   into   several
              construction  contracts with a Hungarian  contractor which totaled
              $59.0  million  in the  aggregate,  $47.5  million  of  which  was
              financed by a contractor financing facility. At December 31, 1998,
              the  balance  on  the  contractor  financing  facility  was  $36.6
              million.  The Company and the contractor have a disagreement  with
              respect to several issues  relating to the quality and quantity of
              the work done by the contractor. The Company has rejected invoices
              of approximately  HUF 700 million  (approximately  $2.8 million at
              December  31,  1999  exchange   rates).   Following  a  series  of
              transactions with the contractor's major creditor, the Company was
              able to settle the  contractor's  claims arising from the accepted
              but unpaid  invoices.  During 1998 the Company and the  contractor
              engaged in settlement discussions in order to resolve these issues
              but were unable to reach a settlement. In addition, in March 1999,
              Hungarotel acquired a HUF 4 billion  (approximately  $15.8 million
              at December 31, 1999 exchange  rates) claim against the contractor
              in order to strengthen  its position in any  potential  procedures
              initiated by the contractor. The contractor is now seeking payment
              under separate invoices in the amount of approximately $24 million
              for work which the  Company is  disputing  because of quality  and
              quantity  issues.   The  Company  still  has  claims  against  the
              contractor  of  approximately  $31 million  which is more than the
              contractor's  claim.  The Company believes that it will prevail on
              the  merits  such  that it will  not be  responsible  for the full
              payment on the aggregate  contractual amount.  There can, however,
              be no  assurances  as to the final  outcome or course of action of
              such dispute.

              The Company and its  subsidiaries  are  involved in various  other
              claims  and  legal  actions  arising  in the  ordinary  course  of
              business.  In the opinion of management,  the ultimate disposition
              of these  matters will not have a material  adverse  effect on the
              Company's consolidated  financial position,  results of operations
              or liquidity.

       (e)    Agreements with Lucent Technologies

              In October 1997, the Company entered into an agreement with Lucent
              Technologies to become the exclusive distributor of Lucent PBX and
              Key System  products in  Hungary.  As part of the  agreement,  the
              Company  purchased  fixed assets and inventory  valued at $470,000
              and agreed to purchase commitments starting at $6 million for each
              of the next three years. The agreement provided for the imposition
              of  penalties  of up to $500,000  annually for failure to meet the
              purchase requirements.  The Company also assumed the employment of
              36  employees.  During  the first  quarter  of 1998,  the  Company
              amended  the  original  agreement  with  Lucent.  Under  the first
              amended  agreement,  the Company became the exclusive  supplier of
              PBX and Key System products in its Operating Areas while retaining
              non-exclusive  rights to service other Hungarian customers outside
              its Operating Areas. In addition, the Company was entitled to sell
              large call centers on a commission  basis.  The Company's  minimum
              purchase  commitments,  under the first  amended  agreement,  were
              reduced to $2 million  annually  with  potential  penalties  being
              reduced to a maximum of $200,000  annually for failure to meet the
              purchase  requirements.  As a part of the first amended agreement,
              the Company transferred back $400,000 of assets to Lucent and paid
              $150,000 to Lucent.  In  addition,  the Company  transferred  to a
              third  party  subcontractor,  28 of  the 36  employees  originally
              assumed.  For 1998,  the Company  negotiated a penalty  payment of
              approximately $24,000 towards Lucent for non-performance under the
              first amended  agreement,  and this was settled during 1999 in the
              form  of  marketing  and  sales  promotions  expenses.   Effective
              February  1999,  Lucent and the  Company  agreed  that the Company

                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

              would give up its right of exclusivity in its Operating  Areas. In
              addition,  as a part of this agreement,  the Company no longer has
              any minimum purchase commitments towards Lucent, nor are there any
              potential  penalty fees payable.  At the present  time,  Lucent is
              changing its distribution  channels in Europe and has informed the
              Company  that once they have their new  distribution  channels  in
              place, the second amended agreement with Lucent will be terminated
              and the Company  will be able to enter into a new  agreement  with
              Lucent.  No  details  of the  proposed  new  agreement  have  been
              presented to the Company at the present time.

       (f)    Local Tax

              Hungarotel's  Concession  Contracts  require  Hungarotel to pay an
              amount  equal to 10 times the local  occupational  excise tax. The
              applicability and enforceability of such obligation is not certain
              at this time, however, the Ministry has clearly stated in a letter
              to Hungarotel that it will not enforce this  particular  provision
              of the  Concession  Contract.  It is not  possible to predict with
              certainty  the effect,  if any,  such  provision  will have on the
              Company.  The Company has not accrued any amounts  related to such
              tax.

       (g)    Subsidiary Capital Requirements

              In July 1998, Hungary adopted a law requiring corrective action by
              certain  Hungarian  companies  which have  negative net equity for
              more than two years.  Each of the  Operating  Companies  currently
              have negative net equity.  The effective date of the applicability
              of the law to the Operating Companies is not certain at this time.
              The  Company's  debt and  equity  restructuring  which  took place
              during  1999,  was the first step in several to remedy the capital
              structure in each of the  Operating  Companies  and the Company is
              continuing  to work on the  matter  in order to bring  each of the
              Operating  Companies  into  compliance  with  the law.  While  the
              Company believes that each of the Operating Companies will be able
              to  comply  with  the law if and  when it  affects  the  Operating
              Companies,  there can be no assurance that the Operating Companies
              will be able to comply with such law.

 (11)  Common and Preferred Stock

       In  connection  with a 1992 private  placement  and public  offering,  in
       addition to a 1994  private  placement,  the Company  issued  warrants to
       purchase  141,950  shares of Common Stock at prices ranging from $3.60 to
       $14.00 per share.  During  1998,  warrants  to purchase  4,650  shares of
       Common Stock at $3.60 were exercised. Proceeds from the exercise of these
       warrants totaled $17,000 in 1998.

       During 1998, a former officer exercised options to purchase 51,750 shares
       of Common Stock at $4.00 per share.  Proceeds  from the exercise of these
       options totaled $207,000.

       During 1997,  options to purchase 70,000 shares of Common Stock at prices
       ranging  from $7.00 to $10.00 per share and  warrants to purchase  11,586
       shares of Common Stock at $10.15 per share were exercised.  Proceeds from
       the  exercise of these  options and  warrants  amounted to  approximately
       $635,000.  In  addition,  the  company  issued  options to purchase up to
       70,000 shares of Common Stock at below market prices to three officers as
       compensation,  resulting  in a $70,000  increase  to  additional  paid-in
       capital.

                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997


       During the third  quarter  of 1997,  the  Company  entered  into  various
       agreements  with TDI  pursuant  to  which  TDI  agreed  to  exchange  its
       ownership  interest  and  outstanding  loans  in  each  of two  operating
       subsidiaries for a total of 969,158 shares of the Company's Common Stock.
       The value of shares on the dates of issue totaled  $10,689,000  which was
       recorded as an increase to Common Stock and additional paid-in capital.

       During 1999, the Company issued  1,571,429 shares and 1,285,714 shares to
       TDI and the Danish Fund, respectively, as part of its overall capital and
       debt restructuring during the period (see Note 8).

       During the third  quarter  of 1998,  the  Company  entered  into  certain
       agreements with certain  wholly-owned  subsidiaries of Citizens Utilities
       Company (Citizens  Utilities Company and its subsidiaries are hereinafter
       referred to as  "Citizens")  pursuant  to which the  Company  settled its
       disagreements  with Citizens regarding certain issues with respect to (i)
       2.1 million  shares of the  Company's  common stock  subject to Citizens'
       accrued  preemptive  rights and (ii) the  Company's  management  services
       agreement  with  Citizens  dated  as of May  31,  1995  as  amended  (the
       "Management  Services  Agreement").  As  part  of the  settlement  of the
       Management  Services  Agreement  with Citizens (see note 15), the Company
       issued  100,000  shares of Common  Stock.  The value of the shares on the
       date of issue  totaled  $513,000  which was  recorded  as an  increase to
       Common Stock and additional paid-in capital.

       On May 12, 1999,  the Company and Citizens  entered into a Stock Purchase
       Agreement (the "Citizens Stock Purchase Agreement') pursuant to which the
       Company issued to Citizens 1,300,000 shares of the Company's common stock
       and 30,000 shares of the Company's  Series A Preferred  Stock,  par value
       $0.001 (the "Preferred  Shares") in consideration for the  extinguishment
       of liabilities  the Company had with Citizens (see note 15). The value of
       the  common  stock on the  date of issue  totaled  $9,100,000  which  was
       recorded as an increase to Common Stock and additional  paid-in  capital.
       The value of the preferred shares on the date of issue totaled $2,100,000
       which was  recorded  as an  increase to  Preferred  Stock and  additional
       paid-in  capital.  Citizens,  as the holder of the Preferred  Shares,  is
       entitled to receive  cumulative  cash  dividends at an annual rate of 5%,
       compounded  annually  on the  liquidation  value  of $70 per  share.  The
       Company may redeem the Preferred Shares at any time. Citizens can convert
       each of the Preferred Shares into shares of the Company's common stock on
       a one for ten basis.

       On May 12,  1999,  the  Company and  Postabank  entered into a Securities
       Purchase  Agreement (the "Securities  Purchase  Agreement")  pursuant  to
       which Postabank purchased 2,428,572 shares of the Company's common  stock
       for an  aggregate purchase price of $34 million.  The Securities Purchase
       Agreement  provides  for  one  person  designated  by  Postabank  to   be
       nominated  for  election to the Company's  Board of Directors.  Postabank
       cannot  transfer  its  shares  until the earlier of (x) the  repayment in
       full of all the  obligations  under the  Bridge Loan Agreement or (y) May
       10, 2000, and then Postabank can only transfer  such shares incrementally
       through  2003  subject  to the  Company's  right  of first  refusal.  The
       Company's  right  of  first  refusal  expires  in  January  2003  and  is
       assignable by the Company to any  beneficial  holder of more  than 10% of
       the Company's outstanding common stock. The Company applied  the proceeds
       from the stock  issuance  to  the  repayment  of the  Original  Postabank
       Credit  Facility  (see  Note 5).  Pursuant  to  the  Securities  Purchase
       Agreement,  the Company issued notes to Postabank  in an aggregate amount
       of $25 million  (see Note 6) with  detachable  warrants.   As a result of
       this  transaction,  Postabank's share ownership in the Company  was 20.3%
       of the Company's outstanding common stock as of December 31, 1999.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997


       During  1998,  the  Company  issued  18,469  shares  of  Common  Stock as
       contingent  consideration  related to the  acquisition  of Hungarotel and
       Papatel in 1995, per the acquisition agreement.

       The Company has  reserved  8,237,059  shares as of December  31, 1999 for
       issuance under stock option plans and agreements and warrants.

 (12)  Stock Based Compensation

       Stock Option Plans

       The Company  adopted a stock option plan (the "Plan") in April 1992 which
       provided for the issuance of an aggregate of 90,000 stock  options  which
       was increased to 250,000 at the 1994 Annual Meeting of  Stockholders.  In
       1996, the  stockholders of the Company approved an increase in the number
       of shares available under the plan from 250,000 to 750,000.  In 1998, the
       stockholders of the Company  approved an increase in the number of shares
       available  under  the plan from  750,000  to  1,000,000.  Under the Plan,
       incentive and non-qualified options may be granted to officers, directors
       and consultants to the Company.  The plan is administered by the Board of
       Directors,   which   may   designate   a   committee   to   fulfill   its
       responsibilities.  Options  granted under the Plan are exercisable for up
       to 10 years from the date of grant.  As of  December  31,  1999,  820,990
       options  provided for by the Plan had been issued,  of which 167,500 were
       exercised and 653,490 remained outstanding.

       In  1997,  the  Company   adopted  a  director  stock  option  plan  (the
       "Directors'  Plan")  which  provides  for the issuance of an aggregate of
       250,000 stock  options.  Options  granted under the  Directors'  Plan are
       exercisable for up to 10 years from the date of grant. As of December 31,
       1999, 80,000 options provided for by the Directors' Plan had been issued,
       of which 5,000 were exercised and 75,000 remained outstanding.

       The Company  applies APB  Opinion No. 25 and related  interpretations  in
       accounting  for stock  options  issued under the Plan and the  Directors'
       Plan.  Had the Company  determined  compensation  cost for options issued
       under the plans  based on the fair value at the grant date  according  to
       SFAS No. 123, the  Company's  net pro forma income and Earnings Per Share
       would have been as follows:

</TABLE>

       For purposes of the pro forma  calculation under SFAS 123, the fair value
       of each option  grant has been  estimated  on the date of grant using the
       Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  (1) a
       risk free rate of 5.03% in 1999,  5.58% in 1998 and 6.56% in 1997, (2) an
       expected life of 5 years for 1999, 6 years for 1998 and 7 years for 1997,
       and (3)  volatility of  approximately  81% for 1999, 84% for 1998 and 33%
       for 1997.

       Pro forma net loss reflects  only options  granted since January 1, 1995.
       Therefore,  the full impact of  calculating  compensation  cost for stock
       under SFAS 123 is not reflected in the pro forma net loss amounts because
       compensation  cost is  reflected  over the  options'  vesting  period and
       compensation  cost for  options  granted  prior to January 1, 1995 is not
       considered.

       Stock Grants

       During the second  quarter of 1998,  the Company  issued 10,625 shares of
       Common  Stock to two  former  officers  as  compensation.  An  amount  of
       $93,000,  representing  the fair market value of the stock on the date of
       grant,  has been recorded as  compensation  expense and as an increase in
       Common Stock and additional paid-in-capital.

                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997


       In March 1997,  the Company  issued 5,000  shares to a former  officer as
       compensation. An amount of $51,875, representing the fair market value of
       the stock on the date of grant, has been recorded as compensation expense
       and as an increase in Common Stock and additional paid-in-capital.

       In October  1996,  the Board of  Directors  of the  Company  amended  and
       restated employment  agreements with three executive officers. As part of
       these agreements, in March 1997, based on performance in 1996, options to
       purchase  70,000  shares  of stock  at an  exercise  price of $8.75  were
       granted which became effective April 1, 1997.

       In December 1995, the Company  entered into  employment  agreements  with
       three executives which provided for, among other things,  the granting of
       a total of 102,500  shares of Common Stock.  The Common Stock grants vest
       over a four year period from the effective date of each  agreement.  As a
       result of these  employment  agreements,  in 1995 the Company recorded an
       increase in additional paid-in-capital of $1,050,000, and a corresponding
       increase  in deferred  compensation  which was being  amortized  over the
       vesting  period.  During 1998, the Company  canceled 25,000 shares of the
       total  102,500  shares  granted  in  December  1995.  As a result  of the
       cancellation,   the   Company   recorded   a   decrease   in   additional
       paid-in-capital  of $256,000,  and a  corresponding  decrease in deferred
       compensation.

       In November  1999,  the Company  cancelled  30,000 fully vested  employee
       stock options  previously issued with an original exercise price of $8.00
       per share and an  expiration  date of March 31, 2003,  and issued  30,000
       options with like terms  except that the newly  issued  options have been
       granted with an exercise price of $5.46 per share, the fair value of such
       options  at  the  date  of  modification.   The  Company  has  recognized
       approximately  $54,000 of compensation expense in 1999 as a result of the
       modification.

(15)   Agreements with Citizens

       During 1995,  the Company and certain  subsidiaries  of Citizens  entered
       into a Master Agreement,  a Loan Agreement and related Promissory Note, a
       Warrant to Purchase  Shares of Common Stock to Citizens (the Warrant),  a
       Stock Pledge Agreement,  a Stock Option Agreement and second Stock Option
       Agreement,  a Registration  Agreement and a Management Services Agreement
       (the "Citizens Agreements"). Simultaneously, Citizens entered into voting
       agreements  with three  affiliates  of the  Company and  consummated  the
       purchase of 300,000  shares of Common  Stock of the Company from the then
       President,  Chief  Executive  Officer  and Chief  Financial  Officer  and
       Director of the Company.  Certain of these  agreements were  subsequently
       amended  in  connection  with  Citizens  providing  additional  financial
       support  to  the   Company  and   expanding   its   management   services
       responsibilities  as a result of the Company's  acquisition of additional
       concession companies.

       The  Citizens  Agreements,  as amended,  resulted  in  and  provided  for
       among  other  matters  the following:

o    The nomination by Citizens of one  representative to the Company's board of
     directors  (out of a minimum of six directors) for as long as Citizens owns
     at least 300,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company.

o    Citizen's  receipt of options  and a warrant to purchase  an  aggregate  of
     3,635,472  (as adjusted for items  described  below)  additional  shares of
     Common Stock of the Company at exercise  prices ranging from $13 to $18 per
     share  under the Stock  Option  Agreement  and  Warrant,  as  amended  (the
     "Citizens  Options and  Warrant").  The  Citizens  Options and Warrant were
     originally  due to expire at various  dates from May 31, 1997 to  September
     12, 2000. Expiration dates of the warrant and certain options were extended
     as  discussed  below.  All of the  options  were  subject to  anti-dilution
     provisions.

o    Certain  corporate,  financial,  technical,  construction,   marketing  and
     operational  services  were to be provided by Citizens to the Company under
     the terms of the Management Services Agreement.  Such services commenced on
     July 1, 1995 and were to continue  through  December 31, 2007. All services
     rendered  by  Citizens  were  subject  to the  oversight,  supervision  and
     approval of the  Company.  The  management  fee payable to Citizens was the
     greater of 5% of Adjusted  Gross  Revenues,  as defined,  or a fixed amount
     ranging from $100,000 to $395,800 per month from July 1995 through December
     31, 1996, and $416,600 per month for each month commencing January 1997 for
     the remainder of the term, subject to adjustment for inflation.  Management
     fees payable to Citizens  during 1998  amounted to  $2,500,000,  while 1997
     fees amounted to $5,000,000 plus reimbursable costs of $691,000. There were
     no fees payable in 1999 as a result of the  September  30, 1998  settlement
     with Citizens described below.

                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

o    The right for Citizens to purchase  additional  shares of Common Stock,  if
     the Company  issues,  in  connection  with any public or private  offering,
     shares  of Common  Stock,  other  stock of the  Company  or any  securities
     convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock
     or other stock of the Company at the  applicable  offering price the number
     of shares as is necessary to maintain  Citizens'  then existing  percentage
     ownership on a fully diluted basis.

o    On October 18,  1996,  the Company  entered into  certain  agreements  with
     Citizens in  consideration  for, among other things,  Citizens'  support in
     fulfilling all terms under a Citicorp  Credit Facility and in obtaining the
     Original Postabank Credit Facility (see note 5). Under such agreements, the
     Company agreed to (i) extend to September 12, 2000 the exercise  periods of
     a warrant and certain  stock  options to purchase  approximately  2,139,801
     shares of Common  Stock (as  adjusted),  (ii) grant  Citizens the option to
     purchase an additional  875,850 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price
     of $12.75  exercisable  through  September 12, 2000, and (iii) pay Citizens
     $750,000  in  cash.  The  cost  of  this   consideration   to  the  Company
     representing the increase in fair value of the options previously  granted,
     the fair value of the newly granted  options and the cash payment  amounted
     to $11.97 million.  The fair value of the options was determined  using the
     Black Scholes option pricing  model.  The Company  reflected the portion of
     the cost related to the financial  support in  fulfilling  the terms of the
     Citicorp Credit Facility,  $5.7 million, as a charge in 1996. The remaining
     $6.27 million had been  capitalized in other assets with other direct costs
     incurred in obtaining the Postabank Credit Facility and was being amortized
     over  the term of the  related  debt.  As  discussed  in note 5 above,  the
     Company extinguished the Original Postabank Credit Facility during 1999 and
     as a result,  wrote-off the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs,
     which  included   the  $6.27  million  mentioned  above,  pertaining to the
     Original Postabank Credit Facility.

o    On September 30, 1998,  the Company  entered into certain  agreements  with
     Citizens pursuant to which the Company settled  disagreements with Citizens
     regarding  certain  issues with  respect to (i) 2.1  million  shares of the
     Company's common stock subject to Citizens'  accrued  preemptive rights and
     (ii) the Company's  management services agreement with Citizens dated as of
     May 31, 1995, as amended (the "Management Services Agreement").

o    Such  agreements  provided  for, among other things, (i) the termination of
     the  Master  Agreement  dated  as  of  May 31, 1995 between the Company and
     Citizens;  (ii) the  issuance  by  the  Company  to  Citizens  of   100,000
     shares  of  the  Company's  common  stock  and  a  promissory  note  in the
     principal  amount  of   $8,374,498  (the "Note")  in  settlement  of   $9.6
     million  accrued  fees and expenses  due  and  payable  to  Citizens  under
     the Management  Services Agreement; (iii) the termination of the Management
     Services  Agreement;   (iv)  payments  by  the  Company  to Citizens in the
     aggregate  amount of $21,000,000 payable in 28 quarterly installments  from
     2004 through and including 2010 in  part  as  consideration  for  Citizens'
     agreement  to  terminate  the Management  Services  Agreement  and in  part
     as  consideration  for  certain  consulting  services  to  be  provided  by
     Citizens  to the Company  from 2004 through  and  including  2010;  (v) the
     grant  by  the  Company  to  Citizens  of  certain  preemptive  rights   in
     connection   with  any  public  or  private  issuances  by  the  Company of
     shares of its common  stock to purchase within 30 days for cash such number
     of  shares of the Company's common stock sufficient to  maintain  Citizens'
     then  existing  percentage   ownership  interest  of  the Company's  common
     stock  on  a  fully  diluted  basis;   and  (vi)  the right of one Citizens
     designee to  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  to  be  renominated  for
     reelection to the Company's Board of Directors for so long as Citizens owns
     at least  300,000  shares of the  Company's  common stock.

o    The  principal on the promissory  note was payable in full on September 15,
     2004 and bore  interest  at  a varying  rate per annum which was 2-1/2% per
     annum  above the  one-year  LIBOR  rate with  monthly  adjustments  in such
     varying rate. Accrued interest was to be paid annually.

o    The  Company  recorded a charge totaling $11.1 million in 1998 representing
     the present value of the $21 million aggregate amount  payable to  Citizens
     beginning  in 2004 in part as  consideration  for  Citizens'  agreement  to
     terminate the Management  Services  Agreement and in part as  consideration
     for certain  consulting  services to be provided by Citizens to the Company
     from 2004 through and including 2010.

o    The agreements included an Amended, Restated and Consolidated  Stock Option
     Agreement (the  "Restated  Stock Option  Agreement")  pursuant to which the
     Company  granted  Citizens  an option to purchase  2,110,896  shares of the
     Company's  common  stock at a price of $13.00 per share with an  expiration
     date of July 1, 1999 in settlement of Citizens' accrued  preemptive rights.
     The Restated Stock Option  agreement also  acknowledged  Citizens  existing
     options  to date to  purchase  an  aggregate  of  4,511,322  shares  of the
     Company's common stock at exercise prices ranging from $12.75 to $18.00 per
     share with an  expiration  date of  September  12,  2000.  The cost of this
     consideration  to the  Company  representing  the fair  value of the  newly
     granted  options in  settlement  of  Citizen's  accrued  preemptive  rights
     amounted  to  $121,000.  The fair value of the newly  granted  options  was
     determined  using the Black  Scholes  option  pricing  model.  The  Company
     reflected this cost as a charge in 1998.

o    On May 12,  1999,  the Company and Citizens  entered into a Stock  Purchase
     Agreement (the "Citizens Stock Purchase  Agreement')  pursuant to which the
     Company issued to Citizens  1,300,000  shares of the Company's common stock
     and 30,000  shares of the  Company's  Series A Preferred  Stock,  par value
     $0.01 (the "Preferred Shares"). In consideration for such shares,  Citizens
     (i) transferred to the Company for cancellation  the $8,374,000  promissory
     note issued by the Company to  Citizens  which was to mature in 2004,  (ii)
     forgave half of the accrued interest due on the promissory note through May
     15, 1999 and (iii) agreed to renounce and forego any rights  whatsoever  to
     any payment of the $21 million which was payable by the Company to Citizens
     in quarterly  installments of $750,000 each from 2004 through and including
     2010.  Citizens,  as the holder of the  Preferred  Shares,  is  entitled to
     receive  cumulative  cash  dividends  at an annual  rate of 5%,  compounded
     annually on the liquidation  value of $70 per share. The Company may redeem
     the  Preferred  Shares  at any  time.  Citizens  can  convert  each  of the
     Preferred Shares into shares of the Company's common stock on a one for ten
     basis. The Citizens Stock Purchase  Agreement  provided that if the average
     closing  price of the  Company's  common  stock for the twenty (20) trading
     days ending  March 31,  2000 is less than $7.00 per share,  then HTCC shall
     issue such number of HTCC Preferred  Shares (with a value of $70 per share)
     equal in value to (i) 1,600,000  times (ii) $7.00 less the average  closing
     price of HTCC common  stock for such twenty  (20)  trading day period.  The
     average closing price of the Company's common stock for the above mentioned
     period was more than $7.00 per share and as a result,  no additional shares
     of HTCC  preferred  stock have been issued to Citizens.  The Citizens Stock
     Purchase  Agreement  also  requires  Citizens not to transfer any shares of
     HTCC common stock which it may hold prior to May 15, 2000 without the prior

     written consent of the Company and Postabank.  Citizens also waived any and
     all preemptive and anti-dilution rights in connection with the transactions
     described in Notes 6, 8 and 11. As a result of the Stock Purchase Agreement
     with Citizens,  the Company recorded  extraordinary  income of $9.0 million
     during  the  second  quarter  of 1999  which  represented  the  gain on the
     extinguishment of the liabilities the Company had with Citizens.

       Additionally,  the   Company   is   also   obligated  to bear the cost of
       registering shares it has issued to Citizens, including  shares  issuable
       under  the Citizens Options.  As a result of the above  transactions,  on
       December 31, 1999  Citizens  held  19.2%  of  the  Company's  outstanding
       Common Stock and 4,511,322  options to purchase  Common  Stock.  Citizens
       ownership of the Company's outstanding  shares on a fully  diluted  basis
       is  approximately 35.2% at December 31, 1999.

(16)   Employee Benefit Plan

       Effective December 1996, the Company established a 401(k) salary deferral
       plan (the "401(k) Plan") on behalf of its U.S. employees. The 401(k) Plan
       is  a  qualified  defined  contribution  plan  and  allows  participating
       employees  to defer up to 15% of their  compensation,  subject to certain
       limitations.  Under the 401(k) Plan,  the Company has the  discretion  to
       match contributions made by the employee. No matching  contributions were
       made by the Company in 1999, 1998 or 1997.


(17)   Segment Disclosures

       The  Company  operates  in  a  single  industry  segment,  communications
       services.  The Company's operations involve developing and constructing a
       modern telecommunications infrastructure in order to provide a full range
       of the Company's  products and services in its five  concession  areas in

(19)     Subsequent Events

        On April 11, 2000,  the Company  entered  into a EUR 130 million  Senior
        Secured Debt Facility  Agreement (the "Debt  Agreement") with a European
        banking  syndicate.  The Company intends to draw down the entire EUR 130
        million ($124 million at current  exchange  rates),  which funds will be
        used in their  entirety,  along with another $6 million of other Company
        funds,  to pay off  the  entire  outstanding  balance  EUR  128  million
        (approximately  $128 million at December 31, 1999 exchange rates) of the
        Postabank  Bridge Loan Agreement which will result in the termination of
        the Postabank Bridge Loan which matures on May 12, 2000, as well as fees
        associated  with  the  Debt  Agreement.  The  borrowers  under  the Debt
        Agreement are the Operating  Companies who were the borrowers  under the
        Postabank Bridge Loan Agreement.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997


        The Debt  Agreement  has two  facilities.  Facility A is a floating rate
        term loan in the amount of EUR 125 million (the "Term  Facility")  which
        principal  is  repayable  semi-annually  on each June 30 and December 31
        beginning on June 30, 2001 and ending on December  31, 2007.  The amount
        of the principal repayments on the Term Facility are to be an escalating
        percentage  of the  amounts  drawn down (EUR 125  million).  Any amounts
        borrowed  under the Term  Facility  have to be drawn down within  thirty
        days of the  execution  of the Debt  Agreement  in  either  euros or, if
        funded by the banking syndicate,  Hungarian forints. The Company intends
        to  borrow  the full EUR 125  million,  or its  equivalent  in euros and
        Hungarian  forints.  Any  amounts  borrowed  in  Hungarian  forints  are
        repayable in Hungarian  forints.  The Term Facility loans denominated in
        euros  accrue  interest at the rate of the  Applicable  Margin  (defined
        below) plus the EURIBOR rate for the  applicable  interest  period.  The
        EURIBOR rate is the percentage rate per annum  determined by the Banking
        Federation of the European Union for the applicable interest period. The
        Term Facility loans  denominated in Hungarian forints accrue interest at
        the rate of the Applicable  Margin  (defined  below) plus the BUBOR rate
        for the  applicable  interest  period.  The BUBOR rate is the percentage
        rate per annum  determined  according  to the rules  established  by the
        Hungarian  Forex  Association  and  published  by the  National  Bank of
        Hungary for the applicable  interest  period.  The  applicable  interest
        period for Term Facility Loans denominated in euros is, at the Company's
        option in one,  three or six months.  The Company  intends to choose six
        months.   The  applicable   interest  period  for  Term  Facility  Loans
        denominated in Hungarian  forints is, at the Company's  option in one or
        three months.  The Company  intends to choose three months.  Interest is
        payable at the end of each interest  period.  The  Applicable  Margin is
        initially  1.75%.  The  Applicable   Margin  may  be  adjusted  downward
        incrementally to a minimum of 1.15% subject to the financial performance
        of the Company as measured by the ratio of the Company's  senior debt to
        its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

        Facility  B is a  floating  rate  revolving  loan in the amount of EUR 5
        million  (the  "Revolving  Facility")  which  can only be drawn  down in
        euros.  The  Revolving  Facility  will be reduced to EUR 2.5  million on
        December 31, 2005.  The Revolving  Facility is available  until December
        31, 2007. The Company intends to borrow the full amount of the Revolving
        Facility to pay off the balance of the Postabank  Bridge Loan  Agreement
        and fees associated with the transaction.  The principal amount borrowed
        under the Revolving  Facility is due at the end of each interest  period
        at which point the Company can, subject to certain conditions, roll over
        the amount of principal borrowed. The applicable interest period for the
        Revolving  Facility is, at the  Company's  option,  one,  three,  or six
        months. The Company intends to choose six months. Interest is payable at
        the end of each interest  period  calculated  similar to Term Facility A
        loans denominated in euros.

        As a part of the Debt  Agreement,  the  Company is  required to hedge at
        least 50% of the euro  borrowings  until a minimum of 50% of  Facility A
        has been  cancelled,  prepaid  or  repaid.  Dependent  on its cash flow,
        commencing  in  2001,  the  Company  will  be  required  to  prepay  the
        equivalent  of $25  million on Facility A until such time as $25 million
        has been prepaid.  The amount of the  prepayment in any year shall be at
        least 50% of the  Company's  excess cash flow,  if any, for the previous
        financial year as defined in the Debt Agreement.  The prepayment  amount
        is due  within  15 days of the  publication  of each  annual  Form  10-K
        filing.

                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997


        The Company is obligated  to pay a commitment  fee equal to the lower of
        0.75%  or  50%  of  the  Applicable   Margin  on  any  available  unused
        commitment.  Since the Company  intends to borrow the full amount of the
        Debt  Agreement  soon,  there will be no  commitment  fee payable at the
        present time. The Company will pay an  arrangement  fee in the amount of
        EUR 2,665,000 (approximately $2,500,000) and an agency fee in the amount
        of $60,000.  HTCC and one of its subsidiaries,  HTCC Consulting Rt., are
        guarantors for the HTCC operating subsidiaries under the Debt Agreement.
        The  Company  has pledged all of its  intangible  and  tangible  assets,
        including HTCC's ownership  interests in its subsidiaries,  and its real
        property to secure all of the obligations under the Debt Agreement.  The
        Company and Citibank  Rt.(as  security  agent)  entered into a series of
        agreements  to secure all of the  Company's  obligations  under the Debt
        Agreement.  The Debt Agreement  contains  customary  representation  and
        warranties.  The  Company  is  subject  to  some  restrictive  covenants
        including  restrictions  regarding  the  ability  of the  Company to pay
        dividends,  borrow  funds,  merge and  dispose of its  assets.  The Debt
        Agreement contains the customary events of default,  which would trigger
        early  repayment of the balance on the Debt  Agreement  including  those
        related to a change of  control.  If prior to the later of the  December
        31, 2001 or the Trigger Date (as defined below),  Tele Danmark sells any
        of the shares of Common Stock that it currently owns or Tele Danmark and
        the Danish Fund, together, no longer own 30.1% of the outstanding Common
        Stock,  then an event of default shall have  occurred.  Tele Danmark and
        the Danish Fund currently own 32.1% of the outstanding Common Stock. The
        Trigger  Date is  defined  as the date on which for the prior two fiscal
        quarters  the  Company's  debt to  EBITDA  ratio is less  than 3.5 to 1.
        Following  the Trigger  Date,  Tele Danmark can only transfer its shares
        with the prior  written  consent of banks  holding at least 66.7% of the
        Company's outstanding debt under the Debt Agreement.

         participate in the Facility A Loan in the Base Currency (in an amount
         equal to that Lender's proportion of the Base Currency Amount of that
         Facility A Loan) and its participation will be treated as a separate
         Loan denominated in the Base Currency during that Interest Period.

         shall not be repaid on the last day of the Interest Period for that
         Facility B Loan, but shall continue to be utilised as a Rollover Loan

         that Borrower for a longer Interest Period in the relevant Utilisation
         Request and in any event subject to the other provisions of this
         Agreement) one (1) Month and if on the last day of such subsequent one
         (1) Month Interest Period a Default is still continuing, that Facility
         B Loan shall be repaid on the last day of such subsequent one (1) Month
         Interest Period.

                  becoming aware of that event;

         (b)      upon the Facility Agent notifying the relevant Obligor, the
                  Commitment of that Lender will be immediately cancelled; and

         (c)      each Borrower shall repay that Lender's participation in the
                  Loans made to that Borrower on the last day of the Interest
                  Period for each Loan occurring after the Facility Agent has
                  notified the relevant Obligor or, if earlier, the date
                  specified by the Lender in the notice delivered to the
                  Facility Agent (being no earlier than the last day of any
                  applicable grace period permitted by Applicable Law).

8.2      Mandatory prepayment
         During the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending
         at such time as at which an aggregate amount (aggregating amounts or
         their equivalents which are, in relation to each respective prepayment
         made pursuant to this Clause 8.2, determined by reference to the date
         on which such prepayment is actually received by the Lenders)
         equivalent to twenty five million dollars (USD 25,000,000) of the
         aggregate amount of the Facility A Loans (outstanding following the
         making of the Facility A Loans pursuant to this Agreement) has been
         pre-paid, the Obligors shall procure and ensure that, within fifteen

         at least fifty per cent. (50%) of the Group's Excess Cashflow in each
         such financial year to which each such 10K Document relates, is applied
         towards prepayment of the Facility A Loans. Provided that for the
         avoidance of doubt, such amount(s) so repaid will be applied
         proportionately between the Facility A Loans denominated in euro and
         any Facility A Loans denominated in HUF, in each case by reference to
         the amounts of such Facility A Loans, converted into the Base Currency

         mandatory prepayment. Repayments made pursuant to this Clause 8.2 shall
         be made in inverse order of maturity.

         requirement or indemnification continues, give the Facility Agent

         Borrower's intention to procure the repayment of that Lender's
         participation in the Loans.

         Loan is outstanding shall repay that Lender's participation in that
         Loan.

                        SECTION 5 - COSTS OF UTILISATION

9.       INTEREST

9.1      Calculation of interest
(a)      The rate of interest on each Loan for each Interest Period is the
         percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of:

         (i)      the Applicable Margin;

         (ii)     in relation to any Loan denominated in forint, BUBOR or, in
                  relation to any Loan denominated in euro, EURIBOR; and

         (iii)    the Associated Costs, if any.

(b)      Subject to Clause 9.3 (Default interest), the rate of interest on each
         Unpaid Sum for each Interest Period is the percentage rate per annum
         which is the aggregate of:

         (i)      the Applicable Margin;

         (ii)     in relation to any Unpaid Sum denominated in forint, BUBOR, in
                  relation to any Unpaid Sum denominated in euro, EURIBOR or, in
                  relation to any Unpaid Sum denominated in any other currency,
                  LIBOR; and

         (iii)    the Associated Costs, if any.

9.2      Payment of interest
         The Borrower to which a Loan has been made shall pay accrued interest
         on that Loan on the last day of each Interest Period.

9.3      Default interest
(a)      If an Obligor fails to pay any amount payable by it under a Finance
         Document on its due date, interest shall accrue on the overdue amount
         from the due date up to the date of actual payment (both before and
         after judgment) at a rate two per cent. (2%) higher than the rate which
         would have been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of
         non-payment, constituted a Loan in the currency of the overdue amount
         for successive Interest Periods, each of a duration selected by the
         Facility Agent (acting reasonably). Any interest accruing under this
         Clause 9.3 shall be immediately payable by the Obligor on demand by the
         Facility Agent.

(b)      Default interest (if unpaid) arising on an overdue amount will be
         compounded with the overdue amount at the end of each Interest Period
         applicable to that overdue amount but will remain immediately due and
         payable.

9.4      Notification of rates of interest
         The Facility Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders and the relevant
         Borrower(s) in writing of the determination of a rate of interest under
         this Agreement. Without prejudice to Clause 30.1 (Communications in
         writing), such notification may be made by the Facility Agent by e-mail
         to a Lender or Borrower where such Lender or Borrower, as appropriate,
         has expressly agreed, by written notice to the Facility Agent, to
         receive such notification by e-mail and has informed the Facility Agent
         of an e-mail address pursuant to Clause 30.2 (Addresses) or, to the
         extent that it becomes common practice in the syndicated euroloan
         markets to do so and such Lender or Borrower, as appropriate, has
         expressly agreed, by written notice to the Facility Agent (in each


                                       38
<PAGE>


         case, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), by
         reference to rates quoted on a web site, the address of which (and the
         location of the relevant rates at such web site) has been confirmed to
         such Lender or Borrower, as appropriate, in accordance with Clause 30
         (Notices).

9.5      Applicable Margin
         The margin from time to time applicable to Interest Periods (the
         "Applicable Margin") shall be:

         (a)      for any Interest Period which begins on the first Utilisation
                  or during the twelve (12) Month period following such first
                  Utilisation, one point seven five per cent. per annum (1.75%
                  p.a.); and

         (b)      for any Interest Period which begins on or after the date
                  which falls twelve (12) Months after the date of first
                  Utilisation, one point seven five per cent. per annum (1.75%
                  p.a.) subject to adjustment in accordance with Clause 9.6
                  (Adjustments to Margin).

9.6      Adjustments to Margin
(a)      If, in respect of any Interest Period which commences on or after the
         date falling twelve (12) Months after the date of first Utilisation,
         the Group's Senior Debt to EBITDA Ratio calculated in accordance with
         Clause 20.1 (Financial Condition of the Group) and following the
         delivery of Hungarian Telephone and Cable Corp.'s then most recent 10K
         Document or 10Q Document, as applicable, together with the supporting
         calculations and workings of such calculations:

         (i)      is equal to or less than four point zero to one (4.0:1) and on
                  such date no Default or Event of Default is continuing then
                  the Applicable Margin on the Loan to which such Interest
                  Period relates will be set at one point six zero per cent. per
                  annum (1.60% p.a.) for the period up to the earlier of:

                  (A)      the commencement of a subsequent Interest Period
                           following a change in the Group's Senior Debt to
                           EBITDA Ratio; and

                  (B)      the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default;

         (ii)     is equal to or less than three point zero to one (3.0:1) and
                  on such date no Default or Event of Default is continuing then
                  the Applicable Margin on the Loan to which such Interest
                  Period relates will be set at one point three five per cent.
                  per annum (1.35% p.a.) for the period up to the earlier of:

                  (A)      the commencement of a subsequent Interest Period
                           following a change in the Group's Senior Debt to

                  (B)      the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default;  or

         (iii)    is equal to or less than two point zero to one (2.0:1) and on
                  such date no Default or Event of Default is continuing then
                  the Applicable Margin on the Loan to which such Interest
                  Period relates will be set at one point five per cent. per
                  annum (1.15% p.a.) for the period up to the earlier of:

                  (A)      the commencement of a subsequent Interest Period
                           following a change in the Group's Senior Debt to

                  (B)      the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default,


                                       39
<PAGE>

         Provided that, and notwithstanding this Clause 9.6 no more than one
         downward adjustment of Applicable Margin may take place in any three
         (3) Month period.

(b)      if the Applicable Margin applicable to a Loan is reduced by operation
         of the provisions of paragraph (a) above and:

         (i)      it is subsequently established that the relevant 10K
                  Document(s) and/or 10Q Document(s) used for the purposes of
                  calculating the Group's Senior Debt to EBITDA Ratio before the
                  relevant Interest Period(s) did not in all material respects
                  reflect the actual financial position of Hungarian Telephone
                  and Cable Corp. and/or the Group during the relevant
                  period(s); and/or

         (ii)     the relevant 10K Document(s) and/or 10Q Document(s) used for
                  the purposes of calculating the Group's Senior Debt to EBITDA
                  Ratio are (with the involvement of the Auditors or otherwise)
                  re-calculated and/or re-stated and as a result the Applicable
                  Margin should not have been fixed at the reduced rate, then:

                  (A)      if the reduced Applicable Margin applies to a Loan,
                           in respect of which the Interest Period has not yet
                           ended, the Facility Agent may revoke the reduced
                           Applicable Margin in respect of the entire Interest
                           Period by notice in writing to the relevant Borrower
                           and the appropriate rate set out in the definition of
                           Applicable Margin in Clause 9.5 (Applicable Margin)

                           Margin), as appropriate, shall apply; and/or

                  (B)      if the reduced Applicable Margin applies to a Loan,
                           in respect of which one or more Interest Period(s)
                           have already ended, the relevant Borrower shall
                           promptly on demand by the Facility Agent pay to the
                           Facility Agent, by way of additional interest, the
                           amount determined by the Facility Agent to be equal
                           to that by which the amount of interest that would
                           have been payable in respect of the relevant Interest
                           Period(s) calculated in accordance with the
                           appropriate rate set out in the definition of
                           Applicable Margin in Clause 9.5 (Applicable Margin)
                           or paragraph (a) of this Clause 9.6, as appropriate,
                           exceeds the amount(s) actually paid in respect of the
                           relevant Interest Period(s).

10.      INTEREST PERIODS

10.1     Selection of Interest Periods
(a)      The Borrowers may select an Interest Period for their respective
         Facility A Loan(s) in the Utilisation Request for Facility A Loan(s) or
         (if such Facility A Loan(s) has/have already been borrowed) in a
         Selection Notice Provided that (and subject to the provisions of this
         Agreement), unless agreed otherwise in advance in writing by the
         Facility Agent, acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders,
         each of the Facility A Loans denominated in forint shall have Interest
         Periods commencing on the same date and of the same duration and each
         of the Facility A Loans denominated in euro shall have Interest Periods
         commencing on the same date and of the same duration.

(b)      Each Selection Notice in respect of the Facility A Loan(s) then
         outstanding is irrevocable and must be delivered to the Facility Agent
         by the Borrower(s) to which such Facility A Loan(s) was/were made not
         later than the Specified Time Provided that in respect of any such
         Facility A Loan denominated in forint, the Borrowers may select from

<PAGE>


         three (3) and six (6) Months and in respect of any Facility B Loan, the
         Borrower(s) may select from one (1), three (3) and six (6) Months.

(c)      If the Borrowers fail to deliver a Selection Notice to the Facility
         Agent in accordance with paragraph (b) above, the relevant Interest
         Period will, subject to Clause 10.2 (Changes to Interest Periods), be
         three (3) Months.

(d)      Subject to this Clause 10, the Borrowers may select an Interest Period
         of any other period agreed between the Borrowers and the Facility
         Agent, acting on the instructions of all the Lenders.

(e)      An Interest Period for a Facility A Loan shall not extend beyond a
         Repayment Date applicable to Facility A.

         Interest Period.

(g)      A Facility B Loan has one (1) Interest Period only.

10.2     Changes to Interest Periods
(a)      Prior to determining the interest rate for any Facility A Loan(s), the
         Facility Agent may shorten an Interest Period for any Facility A Loan
         to ensure the Interest Periods for such Facility A Loan does not extend
         beyond a Repayment Date.

(b)      Prior to determining the interest rate for a Facility B Loan, the
         Facility Agent may shorten an Interest Period for any Facility B Loan
         to ensure that, when aggregated with the Available Facility for
         Facility B, there are sufficient Facility B Loans with an Interest
         Period ending on the Reduction Date for the Reduction Instalment to be
         made on the Reduction Date.

(c)      If the Facility Agent makes any of the changes to an Interest Period
         referred to in this Clause 10.2, it shall promptly notify the Obligors
         and the Lenders in writing.

10.3     Non-Business Days
         Subject to paragraph (e) of Clause 10.1 (Selection of Interest
         Periods), if an Interest Period would otherwise end on a day which is
         not a Business Day, that Interest Period will instead end on the
         preceding Business Day.

11.      CHANGES TO THE CALCULATION OF INTEREST

11.1     Absence of quotations
         Subject to Clause 11.2 (Market disruption), if a Relevant Interbank
         Market Rate is to be determined by reference to the Relevant Reference
         Banks but a Relevant Reference Bank does not supply a quotation by the
         Specified Time on the Quotation Day, the Relevant Interbank Market Rate
         shall be determined on the basis of the quotations of the remaining
         Relevant Reference Banks.

11.2     Market disruption
(a)      If a Market Disruption Event occurs in relation to a Loan for any
         Interest Period, then the rate of interest on each Lender's share of
         that Loan for that Interest Period shall be the rate per annum which is
         the sum of:

         (i)      the Applicable Margin;


                                       41
<PAGE>

         (ii)     the rate notified to the Facility Agent by that Lender as soon
                  as practicable and in any event before interest is due to be
                  paid in respect of that Interest Period, to be that which
                  expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to that
                  Lender of funding its participation in that Loan from whatever
                  source it may reasonably select; and

         (iii)    the Associated Costs, if any, applicable to that Lender's
                  participation in the Loan.

                  only one of the Relevant Reference Banks supplies a rate to
                  the Facility Agent to determine the Relevant Interbank Market
                  Rate for the relevant currency and period; or

         (ii)     before close of business in London on the Quotation Day for
                  the relevant Interest Period, the Facility Agent receives
                  notifications from a Lender or Lenders (whose participations
                  in a Loan exceed in aggregate thirty five per cent. (35%) of
                  that Loan) that the cost to it of obtaining matching deposits
                  in the Relevant Interbank Market would be in excess of the
                  Relevant Interbank Market Rate.

11.3     Alternative basis of interest or funding
(a)      If a Market Disruption Event occurs in respect of an Interest Period
         and the Facility Agent or the Obligors so require(s), the Facility
         Agent and the Obligors shall enter into negotiations (for a period of
         not more than thirty (30) days) with a view to agreeing a substitute
         basis for determining the rate of interest for that Interest Period.

(b)      Any alternative basis agreed pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall,
         with the prior consent of all the Lenders and the Obligors, be binding
         on all Parties.

11.4     Break Costs
(a)      Each Borrower shall, within three (3) Business Days of demand by a
         Finance Party, pay to that Finance Party such Finance Party's Break
         Costs attributable to all or any part of a Loan or Unpaid Sum being
         paid by that Borrower on a day other than the last day of an Interest
         Period for that Loan or Unpaid Sum.

(b)      Each Lender shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after a demand by
         the Facility Agent, provide a certificate confirming the amount of its
         Break Costs for any Interest Period in which they accrue.

12.1     Commitment fee
(a)      The Borrowers shall, on the basis of joint and several liability, pay
         to the Facility Agent (for the account of each Lender) a fee in the
         Base Currency computed at the rate of:

         (i)      the lower of zero point seven five per cent. per annum (0.75%
                  p.a.) or fifty per cent. (50%) of the Applicable Margin at

                           respect of amounts received or receivable in that
                           jurisdiction,

                           if that Tax is imposed on or calculated by reference
                           to the net income received or receivable (but not any
                           sum deemed to be received or receivable) by that

13.4     Tax Credit
         If an Obligor makes a Tax Payment and the relevant Finance Party
         determines that:

         (a)      a Tax Credit is attributable to that Tax Payment; and

         (b)      that Finance Party has obtained, utilised and retained that
                  Tax Credit,

         the Finance Party shall pay an amount to the Obligor which the Finance
         Party, in (for the avoidance of doubt and without otherwise affecting,
         qualifying or limiting the determination rights of any Finance Party
         provided for in the Finance Documents) that Finance Party's sole and
         absolute discretion, determines will leave it (after that payment) in
         the same after-Tax position (the after-Tax position of the Finance
         Party as consolidated with its Affiliates, Holding Company (or Holding
         Companies, as appropriate) and with any Related Party of such Finance
         Party) as would have been the case had the Tax Payment not been made by
         the Obligor. Each Finance Party and each of its Affiliates, Holding
         Company (or Holding Companies, as appropriate) and each Related Party
         of such Finance Party, have sole and absolute discretion as to how they
         organise their respective tax affairs and none of them are under any
         obligation to utilise any amount of the Tax Payment as a Tax Credit.
         The Finance Party and each of its Affiliates, Holding Company (or
         Holding Companies, as appropriate) and each Related Party of such
         Finance Party, will have no obligation to disclose any information
         whatsoever regarding their tax affairs to the Obligor or to any other
         Party or to any other person.

13.5     Stamp taxes
         The Obligors shall, on the basis of joint and several liability, pay
         and, within three (3) Business Days of demand, indemnify each Finance
         Party against any cost, loss or liability that Finance Party incurs in
         relation to all stamp duty, registration and other similar Taxes
         payable in respect of any Finance Document.

13.6     Value added tax
(a)      All consideration payable under a Finance Document by an Obligor to a
         Finance Party shall be deemed to be exclusive of any VAT. If VAT is
         chargeable, the Obligor shall pay to the Finance Party (in addition to
         and at the same time as paying the consideration) an amount equal to
         the amount of the VAT.

(b)      Where a Finance Document requires an Obligor to reimburse a Finance
         Party for any costs or expenses, that Obligor shall also at the same
         time pay and indemnify that Finance Party against all VAT incurred by
         that Finance Party in respect of the costs or expenses save to the
         extent that that Finance Party is entitled to repayment or credit in
         respect of the VAT.

14.      INCREASED COSTS

14.1     Increased costs
(a)      Subject to Clause 14.3 (Exceptions) the Obligors shall, on the basis of
         joint and several liability, within three (3) Business Days of a demand
         by the Facility Agent, pay for the account of a Finance Party the
         amount of any Increased Costs incurred by that Finance Party or any of
         its Affiliates as a result of: (i) the introduction of or any change in
         (or in the interpretation or application of) any Applicable Law; or
         (ii) compliance with any Applicable Law made after the date of this
         Agreement.


                                       46
<PAGE>

(b)      In this Agreement "Increased Costs" means:

         (i)      a reduction in the rate of return from the Facility or on a
                  Finance Party's (or its Affiliate's) overall capital;

         (ii)     an additional or increased cost; or

         (iii)    a reduction of any amount due and payable under any Finance
                  Document,

         which is incurred or suffered by a Finance Party or any of its
         Affiliates to the extent that it is attributable to that Finance Party
         having entered into its Commitment or funding or performing its
         obligations under any Finance Document.

14.2     Increased cost claims
(a)      A Finance Party intending to make a claim pursuant to Clause 14.1

         Facility Agent, provide a certificate confirming the amount of its
         Increased Costs.

14.3     Exceptions
(a)      Clause 14.1 (Increased costs) does not apply to the extent any
         Increased Cost is:

         (i)      attributable to a Tax Deduction required by law to be made by
                  an Obligor;

         (ii)     compensated for by Clause 13.3 (Tax indemnity) (or would have
                  been compensated for under Clause 13.3 (Tax indemnity) but was
                  not so compensated solely because one of the exclusions in
                  paragraph (b) of Clause 13.3 (Tax indemnity) applied);

         (iii)    compensated for by the payment of the Associated Costs; or

         (iv)     attributable to the wilful breach by the relevant Finance
                  Party or its Affiliates of any law or regulation.

(b)      In this Clause 14.3, a reference to a "Tax Deduction" has the same
         meaning given to the term in Clause 13.1 (Definitions).

15.      OTHER INDEMNITIES

15.1     Currency indemnity
(a)      If any sum due from an Obligor under the Finance Documents (a "Sum"),
         or any order, judgment or award given or made in relation to a Sum, has
         to be converted from the currency (the "First Currency") in which that
         Sum is payable into another currency (the "Second Currency") for the
         purpose of:

         (i)      making or filing a claim or proof against that Obligor;

         (ii)     obtaining or enforcing an order, judgment or award in relation
                  to any litigation or arbitration proceedings,

         that Obligor shall as an independent obligation, within three (3)
         Business Days of demand, indemnify each Finance Party to whom that Sum
         is due against any cost, loss or liability arising out of or as a
         result of the conversion including any discrepancy between: (A) the
         rate of


                                       47
<PAGE>


         exchange used to convert that Sum from the First Currency into the
         Second Currency; and (B) the rate or rates of exchange available to
         that person at the time of its receipt of that Sum.

(b)      Each Obligor waives any right it may have in any jurisdiction to pay

         (b)      a failure by an Obligor to pay any amount due under a Finance
                  Document on its due date, including without limitation, any
                  cost, loss or liability arising as a result of Clause 27
                  (Sharing Among the Lenders) Provided that if, at any time
                  where no Event of Default is continuing, such cost, loss or
                  liability is incurred in respect any failure to pay which is
                  caused by administrative or technical error and payment is
                  made within three (3) Business Days of its due date, the
                  indemnity provided for pursuant to this sub-clause (ii) shall
                  only be in respect of any reasonable such cost, loss or
                  liability incurred during such cure period;

         (c)      funding, or making arrangements to fund, its participation in
                  a Loan requested by a Borrower in a Utilisation Request but

         The Obligors shall promptly indemnify the Facility Agent against any
         cost, loss or liability incurred by the Facility Agent (acting
         reasonably) as a result of:

         (a)      investigating any event which it reasonably believes is a
                  Default; or

         (b)      acting or relying on any notice, request or instruction which
                  it reasonably believes to be genuine, correct and
                  appropriately authorised.

(a)      Each Obligor shall take out and maintain insurances on and in relation

         Rights Agreements, as appropriate, if the Facility Agent (acting on the
         instructions of the Majority Lenders, acting reasonably) so requires.
         Each Obligor shall also not act or fail to act in any way which could
         by such action or failure to act cause any material adverse effect on
         the validity and enforceability of such insurances.

(c)      In the event that fact(s), event(s) and/or circumstance(s) arise(s)
         whereby an Obligor intends to make a material claim under such

         Agent in writing of such fact(s), event(s) and/or circumstance(s),
         together with an estimate of the amount of the damage or loss and an
         estimate of the likely amount of such claim and, at any time when: (i)
         a Default or Event of Default is continuing; and/or (ii) when the
         amount of such claim, when aggregated with all other claims of the

         occurrence of any fact(s), event(s) and/or circumstance(s) which
         result(s) in or which would reasonably be expected to result in any of

         upon becoming aware of such occurrence, inform the Facility Agent of
         the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, howsoever described
         under any of the Finance Documents, or of the receipt of any
         correspondence from any person relating to the obligations of any
         Borrower under the relevant Concession Contract which gives rise to a
         Material Adverse Effect and, upon receipt of a written request to that
         effect from the Facility Agent, confirm to the Facility Agent that,
         save as previously notified to the Facility Agent or as notified in
         such confirmation, no Default or Event of Default, howsoever described
         under any of the Finance Documents, has, to the best of its knowledge
         and belief, having made all reasonable enquiries thereto, occurred and
         no such correspondence has been received by any Obligor.

         which it is a party rank at least pari passu with the claims of all its
         other unsecured and unsubordinated creditors save those whose claims
         are preferred by the operation of mandatory Applicable Law applying to
         companies generally.

         Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) change or propose

         Borrower), to which a loan has been extended by another Borrower, may

         Document) to or for the benefit of any person whatsoever or otherwise
         voluntarily assume any liability whatsoever, whether actual or
         contingent, in respect of any obligation of any other person, other
         than such loans granted to the Borrowers as are disclosed in the Letter
         of Borrowings and Encumbrances.

(c)      Each of Hungarian Telephone and Cable Corp. and HTCC Tanacsado

         from the issue of the Notes) which are outstanding at such time are
         duly converted into registered paid-up share capital in the Borrowers,
         and such other member of the Group will provide Hungarian Telephone and
         Cable Corp. and HTCC Tanacsado Reszvenytarsasag with all assistance
         necessary to procure and complete such conversion.

         subordinated to any indebtedness and/or other obligations of each such
         Borrower owing or expressed to be in favour of any Finance Party. Each
         Obligor will enter into the Subordination and Trust Deed and any other
         agreement, contract or arrangement deemed necessary or desirable by the
         Facility Agent, acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders, to
         give full effect to such subordination.

         (e) Subject to there being no Default or Event of Default which is
         continuing at such time, the Borrowers shall, notwithstanding paragraph
         (d) above, be entitled to pay interest on the loans provided for in
         paragraph (c) above which arose directly from the funds resulting from
         the issue of the Notes (including, to the extent that such Borrower is
         able to do so from Net Cumulative Excess Cash Flow, represented by
         cash-at-bank, any such interest accruing during any period in which an
         Event of Default or Default is continuing, with such payment to be made
         only following receipt by such Borrower of a written waiver in respect
         of such Event of Default or Default from the Facility Agent, acting on
         the instructions of the Majority Lenders), with such rate of interest
         to be no higher than the rate of interest accruing pursuant to the

         the prior written consent of the Facility Agent, acting on the
         instructions of the Majority Lenders, make any payment of any interest
         on any indebtedness owed to another member of the Group (save, where
         such interest is at an arm's length open-market rate, in respect of
         inter-Borrower loans expressly permitted pursuant to paragraph (a)
         above).

21.14    Shares
         No Obligor shall, without the prior written consent of the Facility
         Agent, acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders, alter any
         rights attaching to its issued ordinary shares, Preference Shares
         and/or Warrants in existence at the date of this Agreement. No Obligor

         Facility Agent, acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders or
         Lenders, as appropriate, the Facility Agent may, and shall if so
         directed by the Majority Lenders, by notice (by the Facility Agent or
         any person on the Facility Agent's behalf) to the Obligors:


                                       80

         (a)      cancel the Total Commitments whereupon they shall immediately
                  be cancelled;

         (b)      declare that all or part of the Loans, together with accrued
                  interest, and all other amounts accrued under the Finance
                  Documents be immediately due and payable, whereupon they shall
                  become immediately due and payable; and/or

         (c)      declare that all or part of the Loans be payable on demand,
                  whereupon they shall immediately become payable on demand by
                  the Facility Agent on the instructions of the Majority
                  Lenders.

22.29    Loans Due on demand
         If, pursuant to Clause 22.28 (Acceleration and cancellation), the
         Facility Agent declares the Loan(s) to be due and payable on demand of
         the Facility Agent, then, and at any time thereafter, the Facility
         Agent may (and, if so instructed by the Majority Lenders, shall) by

         Agent's behalf) to the Borrowers:

         (a)      require repayment of the Loan(s) on such date as it may
                  specify in such notice (whereupon the same shall become due

                  thereon and any other sums then owed by the Borrowers under
                  this Agreement) or withdraw its declaration with effect from
                  such date as it may specify in such notice; and/or

         (b)      select as the duration of any Interest Period which begins
                  whilst such declaration remains in effect a period of three
                  (3) Months or less; and/or

         (c)      without prejudice to the provisions of any other Finance
                  Documents, declare that the Security Agreements (or any of
                  them) shall have become enforceable and enforce any or all of
                  the same.

                         SECTION 8 - CHANGES TO PARTIES

23.      CHANGES TO THE LENDERS

23.1     Assignments and transfers by the Lenders
         Subject to this Clause 23, a Lender (the "Existing Lender") may:

         (a)      assign any of its rights; or

         (b)      transfer by novation any of its rights and obligations,

         to another bank or financial institution (the "New Lender").

23.2     Conditions of assignment or transfer
(a)      The consent of the Obligors is required for an assignment or transfer
         by a Lender, unless the assignment or transfer is to another Lender or
         an Affiliate of a Lender and/or an Event of Default at such time is
         continuing.

(b)      The consent of the Obligors to an assignment or transfer must not be
         unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Obligors will be deemed to have
         given their consent five (5) Business Days after the Lender has
         requested it unless consent is expressly refused by the Obligors within
         that time.

(c)      The consent of the Obligors to an assignment or transfer must not be
         withheld solely because the assignment or transfer may result in an
         increase to the Associated Costs.

(d)      An assignment will only be effective on receipt by the Facility Agent
         of written confirmation from the New Lender (in form and substance
         satisfactory to the Facility Agent) that the New Lender will assume the
         same obligations to the other Finance Parties as it would have been
         under if it was an Original Lender.

(e)      A transfer will only be effective if the procedure set out in Clause
         23.5 (Procedure for transfer) is complied with.

(f)      Any assignment or transfer by an Existing Lender to a New Lender shall
         only be effective if it transfers or assigns the Existing Lender's
         share of each Facility pro rata.

(g)      If:

         (i)      a Lender assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations
                  under the Finance Documents or changes its Facility Office;
                  and

         (ii)     as a result of circumstances existing at the date the
                  assignment, transfer or change occurs, an Obligor would be
                  obliged to make a payment to the New Lender or Lender acting
                  through its new Facility Office under Clause 13 (Tax Gross-up
                  and Indemnities) or Clause 14 (Increased Costs),

         then the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office is
         only entitled to receive payment under those Clauses to the same extent
         as the Existing Lender or Lender acting through its previous Facility
         Office would have been if the assignment, transfer or change had not
         occurred.


                                       82
<PAGE>


23.3     Assignment or transfer fee
         In respect of any assignment or transfer which takes place after the
         period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on the
         earlier of date on which the Arrangers notify the Facility Agent in
         writing that the syndication of the Facility has been completed and the
         date falling thirty (30)] days after the date of this Agreement, the
         New Lender shall, on the date upon which an assignment or transfer
         takes effect, pay to the Facility Agent (for the Facility Agent's own
         account) a fee of one thousand euro (EUR 1,000).

23.4     Limitation of responsibility of Existing Lenders
(a)      Unless expressly agreed to the contrary, an Existing Lender makes no
         representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility to a New
         Lender for:

         (i)      the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or
                  enforceability of the Finance Documents or any other
                  documents;

         (ii)     the financial condition of any Obligor;

         (iii)    the performance and observance by any Obligor of such
                  Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents or any other
                  documents; or

         (iv)     the accuracy of any statements (whether written or oral) made
                  in or in connection with any Finance Document or any other
                  document,

         and any representations or warranties implied by Applicable Law are
         excluded.

(b)      Each New Lender confirms to the Existing Lender and the other Finance
         Parties that such New Lender:

         (i)      has made (and shall continue to make) such New Lender's own
                  independent investigation and assessment of the financial
                  condition and affairs of each Obligor and such Obligor's
                  related entities in connection with such New Lender's
                  participation in this Agreement and has not relied exclusively
                  on any information provided to such New Lender by the Existing
                  Lender in connection with any Finance Document; and

         (ii)     will continue to make such New Lender's own independent
                  appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Obligor and such
                  Obligor's related entities whilst any amount is or may be
                  outstanding under the Finance Documents or any Commitment is
                  in force.

(c)      Nothing in any Finance Document obliges an Existing Lender to:

         (i)      accept a re-transfer from a New Lender of any of the rights
                  and obligations assigned or transferred under this Clause 23;
                  or

         (ii)     support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New
                  Lender by reason of the non-performance by any Obligor of such
                  Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents or
                  otherwise.

23.5     Procedure for transfer
(a)      Subject to the conditions set out in Clause 23.2 (Conditions of
         assignment or transfer) a transfer is effected in accordance with
         paragraph (b) below when the Facility Agent executes an otherwise duly
         completed Transfer Certificate delivered to the Facility Agent by the
         Existing Lender and the New Lender. The Facility Agent shall, as soon
         as reasonably practicable after receipt by the Facility Agent of a duly
         completed Transfer Certificate appearing on such Transfer Certificate's


                                       83
<PAGE>


         face to comply with the terms of this Agreement and delivered in
         accordance with the terms of this Agreement, execute that Transfer
         Certificate.

(b)      On the Transfer Date:

         (i)      to the extent that in the Transfer Certificate the Existing
                  Lender seeks to transfer by novation such Existing Lender's
                  rights and obligations under the Finance Documents each of the
                  Obligors and the Existing Lender shall be released from
                  further obligations towards one another under the Finance
                  Documents and their respective rights against one another
                  shall be cancelled (being the "Discharged Rights and
                  Obligations");

         (ii)     each of the Obligors and the New Lender shall assume
                  obligations towards one another and/or acquire rights against
                  one another which differ from the Discharged Rights and
                  Obligations only insofar as that Obligor and the New Lender
                  have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of that Obligor
                  and the Existing Lender;

         (iii)    each Agent, each Arranger, the New Lender and other Lenders
                  shall acquire the same rights and assume the same obligations
                  between themselves as they would have acquired and assumed had
                  the New Lender been an Original Lender with the rights and/or
                  obligations acquired or assumed by such New Lender as a result
                  of the transfer and to that extent each Agent, each Arranger
                  and the Existing Lender shall each be released from further
                  obligations to each other under this Agreement; and

         (iv)     the New Lender shall become a Party as a "Lender".

(c)      At the same time as any Transfer Certificate is delivered to the
         Facility Agent in accordance with this Agreement, the New Lender will
         simultaneously deliver or procure the delivery of a duly completed
         power of attorney in favour of the Security Agent in respect of the
         Security Agreements, such power of attorney to be substantially in the
         form set out in Part II (Form of the power of attorney to be provided
         by the New Lender in favour of the Security Agent) of Schedule 4 (Form
         of Transfer Certificate).

23.6     Disclosure of information
         Any Lender may disclose to any of its Affiliates and any other person
         (subject to such other person agreeing to enter into a Confidentiality
         Agreement):

         (a)      to (or through) whom that Lender assigns or transfers (or may
                  potentially assign or transfer) all or any of such Lender's
                  rights and obligations under this Agreement;

         (b)      with (or through) whom that Lender enters into (or may
                  potentially enter into) any sub-participation in relation to,
                  or any other transaction under which payments are to be made
                  by reference to, this Agreement or any Obligor;

         (c)      to whom, and to the extent that, information is required to be
                  disclosed by any applicable law or regulation,

         (d)      with whom it does share data, information and similar matters;

         any information about any Obligor, the Group and the Finance Documents
         as that Lender shall consider appropriate.

24.      CHANGES TO THE OBLIGORS

24.1     Assignments and transfer by Obligors
         No Obligor may assign any of its rights or transfer any of its rights

         in the case of any such transfer to a legal successor arising pursuant
         to a transaction contemplated by and in accordance with paragraph (a)

         document supplied to it pursuant to Clause 19 (Information
         Undertakings) by sending such document to a relevant Party by e-mail
         where such relevant Party has informed such Agent of an e-mail address

         such Agent has previously informed a relevant Party of the address of
         such web site and the location of the relevant document on such web
         site pursuant to Clause 30.2 (Addresses).

         (ii)     any statement made by a director, authorised signatory or
                  employee of any person regarding any matters which may

         with such an instruction of the Majority Lenders.

(b)      Unless a contrary indication appears in a Finance Document, any
         instructions given by the Majority Lenders will be binding on all the
         Lenders and all the Arrangers.

(c)      Each Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with the instructions
         of the Majority Lenders (or, if appropriate, the Lenders) until such
         Agent has received such security as such Agent may require for any
         cost, loss or liability (together with any associated VAT) which such
         Agent may incur in complying with the instructions.

(d)      In the absence of instructions from the Majority Lenders, (or, if
         appropriate, the Lenders) each Agent may act (or refrain from taking
         action) as such Agent considers to be in the best interest of the
         Lenders.

(e)      Each Agent is not authorised to act on behalf of a Lender (without

         proceedings relating to any Finance Document.

                  or in connection with any Finance Document or the Information
                  Memorandum; or

         accordance with paragraph (b) above.

25.12    Confidentiality
(a)      In acting as agent for the Finance Parties, each Agent shall be
         regarded as acting through its agency division which shall be treated
         as a separate entity from any other of its divisions or departments.

(b)      If information is received by another division or department of an
         Agent, such information may be treated as confidential to that division
         or department and such Agent shall not be deemed to have notice of such
         information.

(c)      Notwithstanding any other provision of any Finance Document to the
         contrary, neither the Agent nor the Arranger are obliged to disclose to
         any other person (i) any confidential information or (ii) any other

         Arranger that such Finance Party has been, and will continue to be,
         solely responsible for making such Finance Party's own independent
         appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection
         with any Finance Document including, but not limited to:

                  assets under or in connection with any Finance Document, the
                  transactions contemplated by the Finance Documents or any
                  other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or

25.15    Lenders' tax status confirmation
(a)      Each Original Lender confirms in favour of the Facility Agent on the
         date of this Agreement that either:

                  is beneficially entitled to its share of the Loan and
                  associated interest; or

         (ii)     it is a bank as defined for the purposes of section 349 of the
                  Taxes Act and is beneficially entitled to its share of the
                  Loan and associated interest,

         and each Lender shall promptly notify the Facility Agent in writing if

25.16    Relevant Reference Banks
         If a Relevant Reference Bank (or, if a Relevant Reference Bank is not a
         Lender, the Lender of which it is an Affiliate) ceases to be a Lender,

                                       90
<PAGE>


         Obligors) appoint another Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender to replace
         that Relevant Reference Bank.

25.17    Agent's management time
         In the event that any Agent, acting reasonably, determines that, as a
         result of the occurrence or existence, as appropriate, of any event(s),
         fact(s) and/or circumstance(s), the scope and/or extent of such Agent's
         management time or other resources necessary and/or desirable to enable
         and facilitate such Agent to properly discharge and perform such
         Agent's obligations under the Finance Documents is significantly
         greater than that originally contemplated (in the context of the
         relevant Fee Letter(s)), such Agent shall confirm such determination in
         writing to the Obligors and the Lenders, following which any amount
         payable to an Agent under Clause 15.3 (Indemnity to each Agent), Clause
         17 (Costs and expenses) and Clause 25.10 (Lenders' indemnity to each

         (a)      interfere with the right of any Finance Party to arrange its
                  affairs (tax or otherwise) in whatever manner such Finance
                  Party thinks fit;

         (b)      oblige any Finance Party to investigate or claim any credit,
                  relief, remission or repayment available to such Finance Party
                  or the extent, order and manner of any claim; or

         (c)      oblige any Finance Party to disclose any information relating
                  to its affairs (tax or otherwise) or any computations in
                  respect of Tax.

27.      SHARING AMONG THE LENDERS

27.1     Payments to Lenders
         If a Lender (a "Recovering Lender") receives or recovers any amount
         from an Obligor other than in accordance with Clause 28 (Payment
         Mechanics) and applies that amount to a payment due under the Finance
         Documents then:

         (a)      the Recovering Lender shall, within three (3) Business Days,
                  notify details of the receipt or recovery, to the Facility
                  Agent;

         (b)      the Facility Agent shall determine whether the receipt or
                  recovery is in excess of the amount the Recovering Lender
                  would have been paid had the receipt or recovery been received
                  or made by the Facility Agent and distributed in accordance
                  with Clause 28 (Payment Mechanics), without taking account of
                  any Tax which would be imposed on such Facility Agent in
                  relation to the receipt, recovery or distribution; and

         (c)      the Recovering Lender shall, within three (3) Business Days of
                  demand by the Facility Agent, pay to the Facility Agent an
                  amount (the "Sharing Payment") equal to such receipt or
                  recovery less any amount which the Facility Agent determines
                  may be retained by the Recovering Lender as such Recovering
                  Bank's share of any payment to be made, in accordance with
                  Clause 28.5 (Partial payments).


                                       91
<PAGE>


27.2     Redistribution of payments
         The Facility Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been
         paid by the relevant Obligor and distribute such Sharing Payment
         between the Finance Parties (other than the Recovering Lender) in
         accordance with Clause 28.5 (Partial payments).

27.3     Recovering Lender's rights
(a)      On a distribution by the Facility Agent under Clause 27.2
         (Redistribution of payments), the Recovering Lender will be subrogated
         to the rights of the Finance Parties which have shared in the
         redistribution.

(b)      If and to the extent that the Recovering Lender is not able to rely on
         its rights under paragraph (a) above, the relevant Obligor shall be
         liable to the Recovering Lender for a debt equal to the Sharing Payment
         which is immediately due and payable.

27.4     Reversal of redistribution
         If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a
         Recovering Lender becomes repayable and is repaid by that Recovering
         Lender, then:

(a)      each Lender which has received a share of the relevant Sharing Payment
         pursuant to Clause 27.2 (Redistribution of payments) shall, upon
         request of the Facility Agent, pay to the Facility Agent for account of
         that Recovering Lender an amount equal to its share of the Sharing
         Payment (together with an amount as is necessary to reimburse that
         Recovering Lender for its proportion of any interest on the Sharing
         Payment which that Recovering Lender is required to pay); and

(b)      that Recovering Lender's rights of subrogation in respect of any
         reimbursement shall be cancelled and the relevant Obligor will be
         liable to the reimbursing Lender for the amount so reimbursed.

27.5     Exceptions
(a)      This Clause 27 shall not apply to the extent that the Recovering Lender
         would not, after making any payment pursuant to this Clause, have a
         valid and enforceable claim against the relevant Obligor.

(b)      A Recovering Lender is not obliged to share with any other Lender any
         amount which the Recovering Lender has received or recovered as a
         result of taking legal or arbitration proceedings, if:

         (i)      it notified the other Lenders of the legal or arbitration
                  proceedings; and

         (ii)     the other Lender had an opportunity to participate in those
                  legal or arbitration proceedings but did not do so as soon as
                  reasonably practicable having received notice or did not take
                  separate legal or arbitration proceedings.

28.      PAYMENT MECHANICS

28.1     Payments to the Facility Agent
(a)      On each date on which an Obligor or a Lender is required to make a
         payment under a Finance Document, that Obligor or Lender shall make the
         same available to the Facility Agent (unless a contrary indication
         appears in a Finance Document) for value on the due date at the time
         and in such funds specified by the Facility Agent as being customary at
         the time for settlement of transactions in the relevant currency in the
         place of payment.

(b)      Payment shall be made to such account in the principal financial centre
         of the country of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in a
         principal financial centre in a Participating Member State or London)
         with such bank as the Facility Agent specifies.

28.2     Distributions by the Facility Agent
         Each payment received by the Facility Agent under the Finance Documents
         for another Party shall, subject to Clause 28.3 (Distributions to an
         Obligor) and Clause 28.4 (Clawback) be made available by the Facility
         Agent as soon as practicable after receipt to the Party entitled to
         receive payment in accordance with this Agreement (in the case of a
         Lender, for the account of its Facility Office), to such account as
         that Party may notify to the Facility Agent by not less than five (5)
         Business Days' written notice with a bank in the principal financial
         centre of the country of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in the
         principal financial centre of a Participating Member State or London).

28.3     Distributions to an Obligor
         The Facility Agent may (with the consent of an Obligor or in accordance
         with Clause 29 (Set-Off)) apply any amount received by it for that
         Obligor in or towards payment (on the date and in the currency and
         funds of receipt) of any amount due from that Obligor under the Finance
         Documents or in or towards purchase of any amount of any currency to be
         so applied.

28.4     Clawback
(a)      Where a sum is to be paid to the Facility Agent under the Finance
         Documents for another Party, the Facility Agent is not obliged to pay
         that sum to that other Party (or to enter into or perform any related
         exchange contract) until it has been able to establish to its
         satisfaction that it has actually received that sum.

(b)      If the Facility Agent pays an amount to another Party and it proves to
         be the case that the Facility Agent had not actually received that
         amount, then the Party to whom that amount (or the proceeds of any
         related exchange contract) was paid by the Facility Agent shall on
         demand refund the same to the Facility Agent together with interest on
         that amount from the date of payment to the date of receipt by the
         Facility Agent, calculated by the Facility Agent to reflect its cost of
         funds.

28.5     Partial payments
(a)      If the Facility Agent receives a payment that is insufficient to
         discharge all the amounts then due and payable by an Obligor under the
         Finance Documents, the Facility Agent shall apply that payment towards
         the obligations of that Obligor under the Finance Documents in the
         following order:

         (i)      first, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid fees,
                  costs and expenses of the Agents under the Finance Documents;


                                       93

         (ii)     secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of any accrued
                  interest or commission due but unpaid under this Agreement;

         (iii)    thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any principal due
                  but unpaid under this Agreement; and

         (iv)     fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other sum due
                  but unpaid under the Finance Documents.

(b)      The Facility Agent shall, if so directed by the Majority Lenders, vary
         the order set out in paragraphs (a)(ii) to (iv) above.

(c)      Paragraphs (a) and (b) above will override any appropriation made by an
         Obligor.

28.6     No set-off by Obligors
         All payments to be made by an Obligor under the Finance Documents shall
         be calculated and be made without (and free and clear of any deduction
         for) set-off or counterclaim.

28.7     Business Days
(a)      Any payment which is due to be made on a day that is not a Business Day
         shall, subject to the terms of this Agreement be made on the preceding
         Business Day.

(b)      During any extension of the due date for payment of any principal or an
         Unpaid Sum under this Agreement interest is payable on the principal at
         the rate payable on the original due date.

28.8     Currency of account
(a)      Subject to paragraphs (b) to (e) below, the Base Currency is the
         currency of account and payment for any sum due from an Obligor under
         any Finance Document.

(b)      A repayment of a Loan or Unpaid Sum or a part of a Loan or Unpaid Sum
         shall be made in the currency in which that Loan or Unpaid Sum is
         denominated on its due date.

(c)      Each payment of interest shall be made in the currency in which the sum
         in respect of which the interest is payable was denominated when that
         interest accrued.

(d)      Each payment in respect of costs, expenses or Taxes shall be made in
         the currency in which the costs, expenses or Taxes are incurred.

(e)      Any amount expressed to be payable in a currency other than the Base
         Currency shall be paid in that other currency.

28.9     Change of currency
(a)      Unless otherwise prohibited by Applicable Law, if more than one
         currency or currency unit are at the same time recognised by the
         central bank of any country as the lawful currency of that country,
         then:

         (i)      any reference in the Finance Documents to, and any obligations
                  arising under the Finance Documents in, the currency of that
                  country shall be translated into, or paid in, the currency or
                  currency unit of that country designated by the Facility Agent
                  (after consultation with the Obligors); and


                                       94
<PAGE>

         (ii)     any translation from one currency or currency unit to another
                  shall be at the official rate of exchange recognised by the
                  central bank for the conversion of that currency or currency
                  unit into the other, rounded up or down by the Facility Agent
                  (acting reasonably).

(b)      If a change in any currency of a country occurs, this Agreement will,
         to the extent the Facility Agent (acting reasonably and after
         consultation with the Obligors) specifies to be necessary, be amended
         to comply with any generally accepted conventions and market practice
         in the Relevant Interbank Market and otherwise to reflect the change in
         currency.

29.      SET-OFF
         A Finance Party may set off any matured obligation due from an Obligor
         under the Finance Documents (to the extent beneficially owned by that
         Finance Party) against any matured obligation owed by that Finance

36.      GOVERNING LAW
         This Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with
         English law.

37.      ENFORCEMENT

37.1     English courts
         Subject to Clause 37.7 (Facility Agent's option to refer disputes to
         arbitration) and Clause 37.3 (Non-exclusive jurisdiction), each of the
         Parties irrevocably agrees for the benefit of each of the Finance
         Parties that the courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
         hear and determine any suit, action or proceeding, and to settle any
         disputes, which may arise out of or in connection with this Agreement
         and, for such purposes, irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such
         courts.

37.2     Convenient forum
         Each Obligor irrevocably waives any objection which it might now or
         hereafter have to the courts referred to in Clause 37.1 (English
         courts) above being nominated as the forum to hear and determine any
         suit, action or proceeding, and to settle any disputes, which may arise
         out of or in connection with this Agreement and agrees not to claim
         that any such court is not a convenient or appropriate forum.

37.3     Non-exclusive jurisdiction
         This Clause 37.3 and Clause 37.1 (English courts) are for the benefit
         of the Finance Parties and nothing in Clause 37.1 (English courts)
         shall prevent any Finance Party from taking proceedings relating to a
         Dispute in any other courts with jurisdiction. To the extent allowed by
         law, the Finance Parties may take concurrent proceedings in any number
         of jurisdictions.

37.4     Service of process
         Each Obligor agrees that the documents which start any court

         offices of Clifford Chance Secretaries Limited, 200 Aldersgate Street,
         London EC1A 4JJ, England, United Kingdom. If the appointment of the
         person mentioned in this Clause 37.4 ceases to be effective, each
         Obligor shall immediately appoint another person in England to accept
         service of process on its behalf in England. If any Obligor fails to do
         so (and such failure continues for a period of not less than fourteen
         (14) days), the Facility Agent shall be entitled to appoint on behalf
         of such Obligor(s) such a person to accept service of proceedings by
         notice to the relevant Obligor(s). Nothing contained in this Agreement
         shall restrict the right of the Finance Parties to serve process in any
         other manner allowed by law. This Clause 37.4 applies to Proceedings in
         England and to Proceedings elsewhere. Each Obligor agrees that failure
         by a process agent to notify such Obligor of the process will not
         invalidate the proceedings concerned.

37.5     Waiver of immunity
         To the extent that any Obligor may in any jurisdiction claim for itself
         or its assets immunity from suit, execution, attachment (whether in
         respect of execution, before judgment or otherwise) or other legal
         process and to the extent that in any such jurisdiction there may be
         attributed to such Obligor or its assets such immunity (whether or not
         claimed), such Obligor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees
         not to claim and hereby irrevocably waives such immunity to the full
         extent permitted by the Applicable Law of such jurisdiction.

         limitation, the making, enforcement or execution against any property
         whatsoever (irrespective of its use or intended use) of any order or
         judgment whether final, interim or otherwise, which may be made or
         given in such action or proceeding.

37.7     Facility Agent's option to refer disputes to arbitration
         Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 37.1 (English courts), if any
         dispute or difference arises out of or in connection with this

         take account of the views of the Parties and shall give effect to any
         agreement of the Parties in relation to the appointment of the
         arbitrators unless the LCIA determines in the LCIA's absolute
         discretion that it is not appropriate to do so.

                  one (21) days of receipt of such notice of arbitration. For
                  the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the LCIA may
                  take note of any such representations, but shall otherwise be
                  free in the LCIA's discretion to appoint whomsoever the LCIA
                  consider appropriate as the three (3) arbitrators.

         context otherwise requires, words denoting the singular shall include
         the plural and vice versa.

2.       The Notes

         The Notes having an aggregate principal amount of twenty-five million
         U.S. dollars (U.S.$ 25,000,000) have been issued in twenty-five (25)
         Notes of equal value.

3.       Purpose

3.1      The proceeds of the Notes have been used by the Issuer for the making
         of various loans to members of the HTCC Group.

4.       Constitution of the Notes

4.1      The Issuer hereby covenants in favor of the Noteholders and each
         Noteholder that it will duly perform and comply with the obligations
         expressed to be undertaken by it in the Conditions (and for this
         purpose any reference in the Conditions to any obligation or payment
         under or in respect of any Note shall be construed to include a
         reference to any obligation or payment under or pursuant to this
         provision). The Issuer hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
         acknowledges the right of every Noteholder to the prompt production of
         a copy of the Securities Purchase Agreement.

4.2      The covenant set out in Clause 4.1 shall inure to the benefit of the
         Noteholders and each Noteholder and its/their (and any subsequent)
         successors and permitted transferees, each of which shall be entitled
         severally to enforce the covenant set out in Clause 4.1.

4.3      Each Noteholder shall be entitled to transfer or assign all or any of
         its rights, benefits and obligations in respect of this Clause 4 solely
         in accordance with Clause 6 (Transfers of Notes).

5.       Form and Title

5.1      The Notes are issued in registered form. The Issuer will maintain a
         register (the "Register") in respect of the Notes.

5.2      In these Conditions, the "holder" of a Note means the person in whose
         name such Note is for the time being registered in the Register (or, in
         the case of a joint holding, the first named thereof) and "Noteholder"
         shall be construed accordingly. The holder of a Note shall (except as
         otherwise required by law) be treated as the absolute owner of such
         Note for all purposes (whether or not it is overdue and regardless of
         any notice of ownership, trust or any other interest therein, any
         writing on any Note (other than the endorsed form of transfer) or any


                                       11

<PAGE>


         notice of any previous loss or theft of such Note) and no person shall
         be liable for so treating such holder.

6.       Transfers of Notes

6.1      Subject to Article XI of the Securities Purchase Agreement, Clause 6.3
         and Clause 19, a Note may be transferred in whole (but not in part)
         upon surrender of such Note, with the endorsed form of transfer duly
         completed, at the office of the Issuer specified in Clause 21.1,
         together with such evidence as the Issuer may reasonably require to
         prove:

         (a)  the title of the transferor; and

         (b)  the authority of the individuals who have executed the form of
              transfer.

         The transfer of a Note will be effected without charge.

6.2      Within five (5) Business Days of the surrender of a Note in accordance
         with Clause 6.1 above, the Issuer will register the transfer in
         question and deliver a new Note to the relevant holder at its specified
         office or (at the request and risk of such relevant holder) by
         uninsured first class mail (airmail if overseas) to the address
         specified for the purpose by such relevant holder.

6.3      No Noteholder may require transfers to be registered during the period
         of five (5) Business Days prior to the due date for any payment of
         principal in respect of any Note.

7.       Status

         The Notes constitute direct, general and unconditional obligations of
         the Issuer which will at all times rank subordinated to the Senior
         Obligations and pari passu with all other present and future unsecured
         obligations of the Issuer.

8.       Conditions Precedent to Issuance of the Notes

         The conditions precedent for the issuance of the Notes have been duly
         satisfied.

9.       Representations and Warranties of the Issuer

         The Issuer hereby repeats and on the Issue Date of any Note is deemed
         to repeat, in favor of the Noteholders and each Noteholder, each of the
         representations and warranties set out in Article III (Representations
         and Warranties of the Company) of the Securities Purchase Agreement, as
         if each such representation and warranty were set out herein, by
         reference to the then existing facts and circumstances.

10.      Covenants of the Issuer

10.1     The Issuer covenants with the Noteholders and each Noteholder that it
         shall provide them with such financial and other information regarding
         the Issuer, its business and assets as any Noteholder may from time to
         time reasonably require.

10.2     The Issuer covenants with and undertakes to the Noteholders and to each
         Noteholder:

         (a)  to inform each Noteholder promptly upon any of the representations
              and warranties given or to be given by the Issuer in Article III
              of the Securities Purchase Agreement becoming materially untrue or
              inaccurate, by reference to the then existing facts and
              circumstances;

         (b)  that it shall not issue or incur any bond, note, indebtedness,
              debenture or debenture stock, except (i) pursuant to, or permitted
              under the terms of, the Securities Purchase Agreement or the
              Senior Loan Agreements, and (ii) for the purpose of redeeming any
              Note issued hereunder;

         (c)  to supply the Noteholders and each Noteholder with the financial
              information as set out in Article VI (Affirmative Covenants of the
              Issuer) of the Securities Purchase Agreement; and

         (d)  to promptly notify the Noteholders and each Noteholder of the
              occurrence of a Mandatory Prepayment Event or a potential
              Mandatory Prepayment Event.

11.      Redemption

11.1     Subject to the subordination provisions set forth in Clause 19, each
         Note will be redeemed at its face amount on the Expiration Date,
         together with all accrued interest and any other amount payable under
         the Notes. Redeemed Notes will be cancelled and may not be reissued or
         resold.

11.2     The Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, prior to the
         Expiration Date

         Provided that:

         (a)  the Issuer shall give to the Noteholders not less than ten (10)
              Business Days prior written notice of its intention to make any
              such prepayment;

         (b)  on the redemption of the whole of the Notes, the Issuer shall pay
              to the Noteholders the face amount of the Notes, together with all
              accrued interest and any other amount payable under the Notes;

         (c)  the Issuer shall pay to the Noteholder on demand a sum equal to
              the reasonable breakage costs incurred by the Noteholder as a
              result of


                                       13

<PAGE>


              redemption of the Note prior to the end of the applicable Interest
              Period (as determined by the Noteholder);

         (d)  any redemption of part of the Notes will be subject to the minimum
              prepayment of five million U.S. dollars (U.S.$ 5,000,000) and
              integral multiples of one million U.S. dollars (U.S.$ 1,000,000),
              and any such prepayment shall be applied by the Issuer pro rata
              towards the prepayment of the amounts of principal of each of the
              Notes then outstanding; and

         (e)  such redemption is expressly permitted by the terms of the Senior
              Secured Credit Agreement and Clause 19 hereof.

12.      Payments

12.1     On each date on which these Conditions require an amount to be paid by
         the Issuer, the Issuer shall make the same available to Noteholders at
         the opening of business on the due date for such payment by payment in
         U.S. dollars and in immediately available cleared funds to a bank
         account of each Noteholder in New York City or Budapest specified from
         time to time to the Issuer by such Noteholder for this purpose.

12.2     If the date on which any payment is to be made under the Conditions is
         not a Business Day then the Noteholders shall not be entitled to
         payment of such amount until the next following Business Day and shall
         not be entitled to any further interest or other payment in respect of
         any such delay.

12.3     All payments required to be made by the Issuer hereunder shall be made
         in U.S. dollars and shall be calculated without reference to any
         set-off or counterclaim and shall be made free and clear of any without
         any deduction for or on account of any set-off or counterdown save as
         required by mandatory provisions of law.

13.      Taxes and Tax Credits

13.1     All sums payable in respect of the Notes shall be made free and clear
         of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any tax
         unless the Issuer is required by law to make such a payment subject to
         the withholding or deduction of tax, in which case to the extent that
         the Noteholder is the Noteholder the sum payable by the Issuer in
         respect of which such withholding or deduction is required to be made
         shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the
         making of such withholding or deduction, each Noteholder receives and
         retains (free from any liability in respect of any such withholding or
         deduction) a net sum equal to the sum which it would have received and
         so retained had no such withholding or deduction been made or required
         to be made.


                                       14
<PAGE>


13.2     If, at any time, the Issuer is required by law to make any withholding
         or deduction from any sum payable by it hereunder (or if thereafter
         there is any change in the rates at which or the manner in which such
         withholdings or deductions are calculated), the Issuer shall promptly
         notify the Noteholder.

13.3     If, following the making of any increased payment by the Issuer
         pursuant to Clause 13.1, a Noteholder receives or is granted a credit
         against, remission for or repayment of any tax payable or suffered by
         it which is referable to such deduction or withholding or such
         increased payment and which confers a genuine benefit on such
         Noteholder, such Noteholder shall, to the extent that the auditors of
         such Noteholder (acting as experts and not as arbitrators) are
         reasonably satisfied that it can do so without prejudice to the
         retention of such credit, remission or repayment, promptly reimburse
         the Issuer with such amount as the auditors of such Noteholder (acting
         as experts and not as arbitrators) shall reasonably determine and
         certify (substantiating in reasonably sufficient detail the amount
         concerned but not including any matters which such Noteholder fairly
         regards as confidential) to the Issuer to be such proportion of such
         credit, remission or repayment as will leave such Noteholder (after
         such reimbursement) in no better position (after tax) than would have
         been the case had no such deduction or withholding been required to be
         made.

13.4     Reimbursement shall be made under Clause 13.3 above within seven (7)
         days after a Noteholder has actually received the benefit of such
         exemption, credit, emission or repayment, but any reimbursement shall
         include an amount in respect of interest or repayment supplement on or
         in respect of tax actually received or credited to such Noteholder in
         respect of such exemption, credit, remission or repayment and such
         Noteholder shall not unreasonably delay the obtaining of such benefit.

13.5     If a Noteholder is obliged to pay to the Issuer any sum under a Note
         and:

         (a)  any such exemption, credit, remission or repayment as is referred
              to in Clause 13.3 is subsequently withdrawn in whole or in part;
              or

         (b)  such sum is paid on the basis that it would be allowed to such
              Noteholder as a deduction or offset for taxation purposes in the
              accounting period of such Noteholder and such assumption
              subsequently proves to be incorrect,

         then the Issuer shall repay to such Noteholder promptly on demand such
         amount as the auditors of such Noteholder (acting as experts and not as
         arbitrators) shall reasonably determine and certify (substantiating in
         reasonably sufficient detail the amount concerned and not including any
         matters which such Noteholder fairly regards as confidential) to the
         Issuer to be such amount as will leave such Noteholder (after such
         repayment) in no better position (after tax) than would have been the
         case had no such circumstances mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b)
         above existed.

14.      Interest

14.1     The rate of interest on the Notes for each Interest Period shall be the
         aggregate of the applicable:

         (a)  Fixed Margin; and

         (b)  Interbank Rate.

14.2     Except as otherwise provided herein in Clause 19 or otherwise, interest
         shall be payable by the Issuer in U.S. dollars in advance on the first
         day of each Interest Period (each such day, an "Interest Payment
         Date").

14.3     The first Interest Period in respect of the Notes will commence on May
         12, 2000 with the next Interest Payment Date being six (6) months
         thereafter.

14.4     Interest shall accrue from day to day from and including the last day
         of the immediately preceding Interest Period to but excluding the last
         day of the current Interest Period and shall be calculated at the rate
         specified in Clause 14.1.

15.      Default Interest and Indemnity

15.1     If interest in respect of any Note which is due and payable by the
         Issuer hereunder is not paid on the due date therefor or if any sum due
         and payable by the Issuer under any judgment of any court in connection
         herewith is not paid on the date of such judgment, such sum (the
         balance thereof for the time being unpaid being herein referred to as
         an "unpaid sum") shall bear interest at the rate specified in Clause
         14.1 beginning on such due date or, as the case may be, the date of
         such judgment and ending on the date upon which the obligation of the
         Issuer to pay is discharged.

15.2     Any interest which shall have accrued under Clause 15.1 in respect of
         an unpaid sum shall be due and payable and shall be paid by the Issuer
         to the relevant Noteholder(s) at the end of the period by reference to
         which it is calculated or on such other date or dates as such
         Noteholder(s) may specify by written notice to the Issuer, provided,
         however that any such interest which shall have accrued as a result of
         an event which, but for the payment of such accrued interest as
         provided in the proviso set forth in the definition of "Interest
         Payment Default", would become an Interest Payment Default, shall be
         payable on the date upon which the obligation of the Issuer to pay such
         accrued interest is discharged, whether in accordance with the
         definition of "Interest Payment Default" or as otherwise provided
         herein.

15.3     The Issuer undertakes to indemnify each Noteholder against any cost,
         claim, loss, expense (including legal fees) or liability, which it may
         sustain or incur as a


                                       16
<PAGE>


         consequence of the occurrence of any default by the Issuer in the
         performance of any of the obligations expressed to be assumed by it in
         respect of the Notes.

16.      Mandatory Prepayment Event

         Upon the occurrence of any Mandatory Payment Event, the Issuer will,
         subject to the provisions of Clause 19, immediately prepay to the
         Noteholders all the outstanding principal and all interest and all
         other amounts payable under the Notes.

17.      Replacement of Note

         Subject to Article X of the Securities Purchase Agreement, if any Note
         is lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed, it may be replaced at
         the specified office of the Issuer, subject to all applicable laws,
         upon payment by the claimant of the expenses incurred in connection
         with such replacement and on such terms as to evidence, security,
         indemnity and otherwise as the Issuer may reasonably require. Mutilated
         or defaced Notes must be surrendered before replacements will be
         issued.

18.      Modification and Noteholders' Resolutions

18.1     Any modification to these Conditions shall be agreed in writing between
         the Issuer and Noteholders holding at least eighty per cent (80%) of
         the face amount of the Notes and any such modifications so agreed shall
         be binding on all further Noteholders, provided that no amendment,
         supplement or modification to, or waiver of, any provision set forth in
         this Clause 18, Clause 16, Clause 19, Clause 22 or Clause 23 may be
         effected without the prior written consent of the Facility Agent (with
         the consent of the "Majority Lenders", as defined in the Senior Secured
         Credit Agreement), and any such amendment, supplement, modification or
         waiver entered into without the prior written consent of the Facility
         Agent shall be null and void and without any force and effect
         whatsoever.

18.2     Any resolution of Noteholders in relation to these Conditions may be
         made in writing signed by or on behalf such Noteholders holding the
         relevant face amount of Notes upon delivery to the Issuer by each such
         Noteholder of such evidence as to its identity and its capacity as
         Noteholder as the Issuer may reasonably require.

19.      Subordination

19.1     The Issuer covenants and agrees, and the Noteholder by its acceptance
         hereof likewise covenants and agrees, that all payments of the
         principal of and interest and premium, if any, on the Notes and all
         other obligations of the Issuer now or hereafter existing under or in
         respect of the Notes (including, without limitation, amounts payable on
         account of the redemption provisions set forth herein) (collectively,
         the "Subordinated Debt") shall be subordinated in accordance with


                                       17
<PAGE>


         the provisions of this Clause 19 to the prior payment in full of all
         Senior Obligations. For purposes hereof, the Senior Obligations shall
         not be deemed to have been paid in full until the Finance Parties shall
         have received payment of the Senior Obligations in full in cash. In
         furtherance of the foregoing, the Issuer and the Noteholder, by its
         acceptance hereof, agrees as follows:

19.2     Upon payment or distribution of assets or securities of the Issuer of
         any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, upon
         any dissolution or winding up or total or partial liquidation or
         reorganization of the Issuer, whether voluntary or involuntary, or in
         bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceedings or upon an
         assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of the
         assets and liabilities of the Issuer, all Senior Obligations shall
         first be paid in full in cash, or payment provided for in cash or cash
         equivalents in a manner satisfactory to the Finance Parties, before any
         direct or indirect payment or distribution, including, without
         limitation, by exercise of set-off, of any cash, property or securities
         on account of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest or any
         other amounts on or in respect of the Notes and to that end the Finance
         Parties shall be entitled to receive directly, for application to the
         payment of the Senior Obligations (to the extent necessary to pay all
         Senior Obligations in full after giving effect to any substantially
         concurrent payment or distribution to or provision for payment to the
         Finance Parties), any payment or distribution of any kind or character,
         whether in cash, property or securities, in respect of the Subordinated
         Debt. The Facility Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized and empowered
         (in its own name or in the name of the Noteholders or otherwise), but
         shall have no obligation, to demand, sue for, collect and receive
         payment or distribution referred to herein and to file a claim and
         proofs of claim and take such other action (including without
         limitation, voting the Subordinated Debt) as it may deem necessary or
         advisable for the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights or
         interests of the Noteholders hereunder.

19.3     No direct or indirect payment by or on behalf of the Issuer of
         principal of (premium, if any), or interest on, or any other amount
         with respect to, the Subordinated Debt, and no repurchase, redemption
         or other retirement of any Note, whether pursuant to the terms of the
         Note, upon acceleration or otherwise, shall be made if at the time of
         such payment, repurchase, redemption or retirement, a Subordination
         Event has occurred for so long as such Subordination Event shall not
         have been cured or waived in writing by all applicable parties;
         provided, that the payment of accrued interest specified in the proviso
         in the definition of "Interest Payment Default" may be paid in
         accordance with such proviso; and provided, further, that on and after
         the Standstill Termination Date, the Issuer may resume payments on
         account of the principal of (premium, if any), and interest (including
         interest pursuant to Clause 15.1) and any other amounts on the Note,
         subject to the provisions of Clause 19.1 and Clause 19.2 hereof;

19.4     (a) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
         prohibiting such payment or distribution, the Noteholders shall have
         received any payment on


                                       18
<PAGE>


         account of the Subordinated Debt at a time when such payment is
         prohibited by such provisions before the Senior Obligations are paid in
         full, then and in such event, such payment or distribution shall be
         received and held in trust by the Noteholders apart from their other
         assets and forthwith paid over or delivered to the Facility Agent in
         the same form as so received (with any necessary indorsement) to be
         applied (in the case of cash) to, or held as collateral (in the case of
         non-cash property or securities) for, the payment or prepayment of the
         Senior Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Senior Loan
         Agreements.

         (b) Nothing contained in this Clause 19 will limit the right of the
         Noteholders to take any action provided herein with respect to the
         Subordinated Debt; provided that all Senior Obligations then due or
         thereafter declared to be due shall first be paid in full before the
         Noteholders are entitled to receive any payment from the Issuer of
         principal of, or interest on, or any other amounts under any Note.

         (c) Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities referred
         to in this Clause 19, the Noteholders shall be entitled to rely upon
         any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which such
         dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings are
         pending, and upon a certificate of the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy,
         liquidating trustee, agent or other person making any such payment or
         distribution, delivered to the Noteholders for the purpose of
         ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution,
         the holders of the Senior Obligations and other indebtedness of the
         Issuer, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts
         paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to
         this Clause 19.

         (d) No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Obligations
         to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any
         way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act by any such
         holder, or by any noncompliance by the Issuer or any Noteholder with
         the terms and provisions and covenants herein regardless of any
         knowledge thereof such holder may have or otherwise be charged with.

         (e) The provisions of this Clause 19 are intended to be for the benefit
         of, and shall be enforceable directly by, the holders of the Senior
         Obligations. The Issuer and each Noteholder, by its acceptance hereof,
         each acknowledge that the Finance Parties are relying upon the
         provisions of this Clause 19 in extending such Senior Obligations.

19.5     Any payment or distribution to the Facility Agent, on behalf of the
         holders of the Senior Obligations, pursuant to the provisions of this
         Clause 19 shall entitle the Noteholder to a right of subrogation in
         respect thereof; provided, however that all such subrogation rights are
         not exercisable until the Senior Obligations shall have been paid in
         full.

         intended to or shall impair, as between the Issuer and the Noteholder,
         the obligations of the Issuer, which are absolute and unconditional, to
         pay to the Noteholder the principal of (premium, if any), and interest
         on, the Note as and when the same shall become due and payable in
         accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the
         relative rights of the Noteholder and creditors of the Issuer other

         therein prevent any Noteholder from exercising all remedies otherwise
         permitted by applicable law upon the occurrence of a Mandatory
         Prepayment Event under this Note, subject to the rights, if any, under
         this Clause 19 of the holders of the Senior Obligations in respect of
         cash, property or securities of the Issuer received upon the exercise
         of any such remedy.

         indirectly cause the Issuer to commence or assist the Issuer in
         commencing, any proceeding referred to in Clause 19.2.

19.8     All rights and interests hereunder of the holders of the Senior
         Obligations, and all agreements and obligations of the Noteholders and
         the Issuer under this Clause 19, shall remain in full force and effect

         (a) the lack of validity or enforceability of any provision under any
         Senior Loan Agreement or any other agreement or instrument relating
         thereto;

         (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any
         other term of, all or any of the Senior Obligations, or any other
         amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Senior
         Loan Agreements, including, without limitation, any increase in the
         Senior Obligations resulting from the extension of additional credit to
         the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise;

         (c) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any other
         collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent
         to departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the Senior
         Obligations;

         (d) any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds thereof, to
         all or any of the Senior Obligations, or any manner of sale or other
         disposition of any collateral for all or any of the Senior Obligations
         or any other assets of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries;

         (e) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure
         or existence of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries; or

         (f) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense
         available to, or a discharge of, the Issuer or a subordinated creditor.

         be reinstated, and the Senior Obligations shall not be deemed to be

3.       THE SECURITY DEPOSIT

3.1      Security Deposit
         For the purpose of securing the Secured Liabilities the Depositor
         hereby irrevocably and unconditionally creates a Security Deposit over
         each registered share comprising the Deposited Shares. The Deposited
         Shares shall be blank endorsed. The Security Deposit is made in favour
         of the Depositee acting on its own behalf and in its capacity as
         Security Agent acting on behalf of each Finance Party and any
         transferees or assignees or replacements or successors of the Depositee
         or any such Finance Party, for the full amount of the Secured
         Liabilities.

3.2      Joint and several security
         The Security Deposit established by this Agreement is joint and
         several. Each Deposited Share serves as Encumbrance for the whole of
         the Secured Liabilities. The Depositee shall be entitled to select any
         one or more of the


                                       9

         Deposited Shares as the Depositee, in the Depositee's absolute
         discretion sees fit, against which to enforce the Security Deposit.

3.3      Additional security
         The rights constituted by this Agreement are in addition to and are not
         in any way prejudiced or affected by any other Encumbrance, security,
         guarantee, indemnity or other right whatsoever now or subsequently held
         by the Depositee and/or any Finance Party for any of the Secured
         Liabilities. The powers conferred on the Depositee by this Agreement in
         relation to the Secured Liabilities and the Deposited Shares, shall be
         in addition to and not in substitution for the rights conferred on
         Depositee and the Finance Parties by laws and regulations of Hungary or
         other Applicable Law except in so far as they are expressly excluded in
         this Agreement and, where there is any ambiguity or conflict between
         such rights contained in any such laws and regulations of Hungary or
         other Applicable Law and those conferred by this Agreement, then the
         terms of this Agreement shall, to the extent permitted by such laws and
         regulations of Hungary or other Applicable Law, prevail.

3.4      Continuing security

         a party to the Senior Secured Debt Facility Agreement pursuant to
         Clause 23 (Changes to the Lenders) of such Senior Secured Debt Facility
         Agreement as a Lender or any other person otherwise becoming a party to
         the Senior Secured Debt Facility Agreement as an assignee or transferee
         or replacement or successor of a Finance Party shall thereupon become
         entitled to the benefit of the provisions contained in this Agreement
         as if such transferee or person had originally been and had been named
         as a party to this Agreement (subject to compliance with Clause 11
         (Release notice)).

(b)      The Security Deposit constituted by this Agreement shall:

         (i)  be a continuing Encumbrance for the due payment, satisfaction and
              discharge in full of the Secured Liabilities and such Encumbrance
              shall not be considered as satisfied or discharged or prejudiced
              by any intermediate payment, satisfaction or settlement of any
              part of the Secured Liabilities or any other matter or thing
              whatsoever; and

         (ii) not be prejudiced by any time or indulgence granted to any person,
              or any abstention or delay by the Depositee or any Finance Party
              in perfecting or enforcing any Encumbrance, securities,
              guarantees, or rights or remedies whatsoever.

         upon the execution of this Agreement.

5.       NOTATION IN THE SHARE REGISTRY
         Each of the Countersignors hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
         undertakes to enter and maintain in its share registry notations
         reflecting the fact that the Deposited Shares have been deposited in
         favour of the Depositee in its own capacity and in its capacity as
         Security Agent, in form and substance acceptable to the Depositee. The
         Depositor shall deliver to the Depositee a certified copy of each

         shares; or (ii) sub-divide its outstanding shares; or (iii) reclassify
         any of its shares into other securities of the respective
         Countersignor; or (iv) grant, issue or offer to shareholders of the
         respective Countersignor options, rights or warrants entitling them to:
         (1) subscribe for or purchase shares; or (2) subscribe for or purchase
         securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or which carry rights
         to subscribe or purchase shares; or (v) make or do any similar or
         analogous action or deed, then any such shares or securities so granted
         offered or issued to the Depositor shall become security in favour of
         the Depositee, and shall immediately be deposited by the Depositor in

6.1      The priority of the Security Deposit
         No other Encumbrance whatsoever shall be created over the Deposited

         mandatory provisions of laws and regulations of Hungary.

6.2      Delegation of rights
         The Depositee may, at any time and from time to time, delegate to any
         person all or any of the rights and benefits which are at such time,

         this Agreement in relation to the Deposited Shares or any part thereof.

              any acknowledgement whatsoever been given to any person in respect
              of the Deposited Shares;

         (f)  this Agreement creates a valid and perfected first priority
              Encumbrance over the Deposited Shares and each and every part
              thereof, which secures the payment of the Secured Liabilities,
              and which is enforceable as such against all creditors and
              purchasers of the Depositor; and

         The Contracting Parties acknowledge that such restrictions of dealing

         cancellation of the Cancelled Shares), the Depositor shall as quickly
         as practicable deposit such Cancelled Shares with Depositee. The

         entitled at any time to take any such action as the Depositee, in its
         reasonable discretion, thinks fit for the purpose of protecting the
         Encumbrance constituted by this Agreement. The Depositor hereby
         unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to


                                       13


<PAGE>

         indemnify the Depositee on demand against any losses, liabilities,
         fees, costs and expenses, properly and duly incurred or expended by the

         constituted by this Agreement.

10.      DEPOSITEE'S RIGHT OF SATISFACTION

10.1     Sale
         The Contracting Parties irrevocably and unconditionally agree that the
         Depositee may exercise its right to satisfaction under this Agreement
         by transfer, sale or other disposal of the Deposited Shares following
         the occurrence of an Event of Default on its own behalf and on behalf
         of each and every Finance Party.

10.2     Procedure
         The Contracting Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree
         that notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 10.1 (Sale), once the
         right to seek satisfaction under this Agreement from the Security
         Deposit or any part thereof has arisen, the Depositee shall be entitled
         and the Depositor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably authorises the
         Depositee, pursuant to the power of attorney, the form of which is set
         out in Schedule 5 (Form of the Power of Attorney from a Depositor to
         the Depositee to exercise shareholder's rights), until the earlier of:
         (i) the Secured Liabilities being duly paid, satisfied and discharged
         in full; and (ii) the transfer, sale or other disposal of the Deposited
         Shares, to exercise for and on behalf of the Depositor and without any

         the relevant Countersignor.

         The Depositor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to renew
         the power of attorney, issued on the date of this Agreement
         substantially in the form of Schedule 5 (Form of the Power of Attorney

         In addition to the above, the Depositee shall be entitled to transfer,
         sell or otherwise dispose for value the Deposited Shares. In the event
         that the Depositee, in exercising its rights under this Agreement,
         shall decide to transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of all or part of
         the Deposited Shares, the Depositee shall use reasonable endeavours to
         transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of the Deposited Shares through an
         independent, internationally recognised auction house appointed by the
         Depositee. The Deposited Shares shall be initially offered at the
         market value as determined by an independent, internationally
         recognised accounting firm appointed jointly by the Depositee, the
         Depositor and the relevant Countersignor (the "Valuation Price").
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Depositor may solicit potential
         offers for the Deposited Shares, and the Depositee agrees to consider
         any offers so solicited. In the event that no offers are received at or
         above the Valuation Price within sixty (60) days of appointment of the
         aforementioned accounting

         the right of any Finance Party to recover any and all shortfall(s)

3.       THE SECURITY DEPOSIT

3.1      Security Deposit
         For the purpose of securing the Secured Liabilities the Depositor
         hereby irrevocably and unconditionally creates a Security Deposit over
         each registered share comprising the Deposited Shares. The Deposited
         Shares shall be blank endorsed. The Security Deposit is made in favour
         of the Depositee acting on its own behalf and in its capacity as
         Security Agent acting on behalf of each Finance Party and any
         transferees or assignees or replacements or successors of the Depositee
         or any such Finance Party, for the full amount of the Secured
         Liabilities.

3.2      Joint and several security
         The Security Deposit established by this Agreement is joint and
         several. Each Deposited Share serves as Encumbrance for the whole of
         the Secured Liabilities. The Depositee shall be entitled to select any
         one or more of the Deposited Shares as the Depositee, in the
         Depositee's absolute discretion sees fit, against which to enforce the
         Security Deposit.

3.3      Additional security
         The rights constituted by this Agreement are in addition to and are not

         guarantee, indemnity or other right whatsoever now or subsequently held
         by the Depositee and/or any Finance Party for any of the Secured
         Liabilities. The powers conferred on the Depositee by this Agreement in
         relation to the Secured Liabilities and the Deposited Shares, shall be
         in addition to and not in substitution for the rights conferred on
         Depositee and the Finance Parties by laws and regulations of Hungary or
         other Applicable Law except in so far as they are expressly excluded in
         this Agreement and, where there is any ambiguity or conflict between
         such rights contained in any such laws and regulations of Hungary or
         other Applicable Law and those conferred by this Agreement, then the
         terms of this Agreement shall, to the extent permitted by such laws and
         regulations of Hungary or other Applicable Law, prevail.

3.4      Continuing security
(a)      The Contracting Parties agree and confirm that any transferee becoming
         a party to the Senior Secured Debt Facility Agreement pursuant to
         Clause 23 (Changes to the Lenders) of such Senior Secured Debt Facility
         Agreement as a Lender or any other person otherwise becoming a party to
         the Senior Secured

         Debt Facility Agreement as an assignee or transferee or replacement or
         successor of a Finance Party shall thereupon become entitled to the
         benefit of the provisions contained in this Agreement as if such
         transferee or person had originally been and had been named as a party
         to this Agreement (subject to compliance with Clause 11 (Release
         notice)).

(b)      The Security Deposit constituted by this Agreement shall:

         (i)  be a continuing Encumbrance for the due payment, satisfaction and
              discharge in full of the Secured Liabilities and such Encumbrance
              shall not be considered as satisfied or discharged or prejudiced
              by any intermediate payment, satisfaction or settlement of any
              part of the Secured Liabilities or any other matter or thing
              whatsoever; and

         (ii) not be prejudiced by any time or indulgence granted to any person,
              or any abstention or delay by the Depositee or any Finance Party
              in perfecting or enforcing any Encumbrance, securities,
              guarantees, or rights or remedies whatsoever.

4.       CONSTITUTION OF THE SECURITY DEPOSIT
         The Security Deposit established by this Agreement shall be constituted
         upon the execution of this Agreement.

5.       NOTATION IN THE SHARE REGISTRY
         Each of the Countersignors hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
         undertakes to enter and maintain in its share registry notations
         reflecting the fact that the Deposited Shares have been deposited in
         favour of the Depositee in its own capacity and in its capacity as
         Security Agent, in form and substance acceptable to the Depositee. The
         Depositor shall deliver to the Depositee a certified copy of each
         Countersignor's share registry showing the notations referred to above
         simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement.

         Until the Secured Liabilities are duly paid, satisfied and discharged
         in full, if each of the Countersignors shall: (i) make a bonus issue of
         shares; or (ii) sub-divide its outstanding shares; or (iii) reclassify
         any of its shares into other securities of the respective
         Countersignor; or (iv) grant, issue or offer to shareholders of the
         respective Countersignor options, rights or warrants entitling them to:
         (1) subscribe for or purchase shares; or (2) subscribe for or purchase
         securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or which carry rights
         to subscribe or purchase shares; or (v) make or do any similar or
         analogous action or deed, then any such shares or securities so granted
         offered or issued to the Depositor shall become security in favour of
         the Depositee, and shall immediately be deposited by the Depositor in
         accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

6.1      The priority of the Security Deposit
         No other Encumbrance whatsoever shall be created over the Deposited

         mandatory provisions of laws and regulations of Hungary.

6.2      Delegation of rights
         The Depositee may, at any time and from time to time, delegate to any
         person all or any of the rights and benefits which are at such time,

         The Contracting Parties acknowledge that such restrictions of dealing
         may not be registered in the share registers of the Countersignors and

         of emergency or extreme circumstance(s), the Depositee shall be

         Encumbrance constituted by this Agreement. The Depositor hereby
         unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to indemnify the Depositee on
         demand against any losses, liabilities, fees, costs and expenses,

         Deposit or any part thereof has arisen, the Depositee shall be entitled
         and the Depositor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably authorises the
         Depositee, pursuant to the power of attorney, the form of which is set
         out in Schedule 5 (Form of the Power of Attorney from a Depositor to
         the Depositee to exercise shareholder's rights), until the earlier of:
         (i) the Secured Liabilities being duly paid, satisfied and discharged
         in full; and (ii) the transfer, sale or other disposal of the Deposited
         Shares, to exercise for and on behalf of the Depositor and without any
         limitation, all or any of their shareholders' rights, as shareholder of
         the relevant Countersignor.

         The Depositor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to renew
         the power of attorney, issued on the date of this Agreement
         substantially in the form of Schedule 5 (Form of the Power of Attorney
         from a Depositor to the Depositee to exercise shareholders' rights)
         every twelve (12) months after the date of this Agreement throughout
         the Deposit Period.

         In addition to the above, the Depositee shall be entitled to transfer,
         sell or otherwise dispose for value the Deposited Shares. In the event
         that the Depositee, in exercising its rights under this Agreement,
         shall decide to transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of all or part of
         the Deposited Shares, the Depositee shall use reasonable endeavours to
         transfer, sell or otherwise

         dispose of the Deposited Shares through an independent, internationally
         recognised auction house appointed by the Depositee. The Deposited
         Shares shall be initially offered at the market value as determined by
         an independent, internationally recognised accounting firm appointed
         jointly by the Depositee, the Depositor and the relevant Countersignor
         (the "Valuation Price"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Depositor
         may solicit potential offers for the Deposited Shares, and the
         Depositee agrees to consider any offers so solicited. In the event that
         no offers are received at or above the Valuation Price within sixty
         (60) days of appointment of the aforementioned accounting firm, then
         the Depositee shall be free to accept any third party offer(s) made for
         the transfer, sale or other disposal of the Deposited Shares.

10.3     Application of proceeds
         Any moneys received by the Depositee after the Security Deposit created
         by this Agreement has been enforced pursuant to this Agreement shall be
         applied in the following order of priority (but without prejudice to
         the right of any Finance Party to recover any and all shortfall(s)
         arising under the Senior Finance Documents from the Depositor and/or
         any Countersignor) by the Depositee:

         (a)  in satisfaction of, or provision, for all fees, costs and expenses
              incurred by the Depositee in connection with the enforcement of
              this Agreement;

         (b)  in or towards payment of the Secured Liabilities; and

         (c)  in payment of the surplus (if any) to the relevant Depositor.

11.      RELEASE NOTICE
         The Depositee undertakes at the end of the Deposit Period to issue to
         the Depositor the Depositee's Declaration, which is required for the
         deletion of the Security Deposit from the share registry of the
         relevant Countersignor at the end of the Deposit Period.

12.      FURTHER ASSURANCES
         By executing this Agreement, the Depositor hereby unconditionally and
         irrevocably consents to the Depositee taking whatever actions the
         Depositee may reasonably and practicably require at the Depositor's own
         expense, for:

         (a)  registering or protecting the rights created by this Agreement
              over any of the Deposited Shares; and/or

         (b)  facilitating the enforcement against any Deposited Share or the
              exercise of any right, power or discretion exercisable, by the
              Depositee or any of its or their delegates or agents in respect of
              any of the Deposited Shares; and/or

              case, the Depositee may reasonably think expedient.

         do pursuant to the provisions contained in this Agreement in relation
         to the Deposited Shares and generally in the name of the Depositor and

         consequences of its nullity) shall be referred to and finally settled
         by arbitration under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration (the

         parties to such proceedings, or failing such agreement, as the
         Depositee may in its sole discretion elect. Any judgement or

         thereto and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction or
         application may be made to such court for an order of enforcement as

         registered office for the time beings or on the person duly appointed
         by the Depositor as its agent for service of process in Hungary and so
         notified in writing to the Depositee. If the appointment of the
         person(s) mentioned in this Clause 18.4 ceases to be effective the
         Depositor and/or the relevant Countersignor shall immediately appoint a
         further person in Hungary to act on its behalf in Hungary as agent for

         execution, attachment or other legal process, the Depositor and/or the
         relevant Countersignor waive immunity in respect of:

         (a)  the giving of any relief by way of injunction or order for
              specific performance or for the recovery of assets or revenues;
              and/or

         (b)  the issue of any process against its assets for the enforcement of
              a judgement or, in an action in rem, for the arrest, detention or
              sale of any of its assets and revenues.

18.7     Partial invalidity
         If, at any time, any provision of this Agreement is or becomes illegal,
         invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the law of any
         jurisdiction, neither the legality, validity or enforceability of the
         remaining provisions of this Agreement nor the legality, validity or
         enforceability of such provision under the law of any other
