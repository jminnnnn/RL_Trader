ITEM  1.  BUSINESS.

                                     General

     MathSoft,  Inc.  is  now  doing  business  as  Insightful  Corporation
     ("Insightful"  or  the  "Company").

     The  Company  was  originally incorporated in Massachusetts in October 1984
     under  the name Engineering Specific Products Corp. and changed its name to
     MathSoft,  Inc.  in  January  1986.  Following  the closing of its internet
     business  FreeScholarships.com  in  September  2000  and  the  sale  of its
     Engineering and Education Products Division in January 2001, MathSoft, Inc.
     will  now  do  business  as  Insightful  Corporation  (NASDAQ:  IFUL).  The
     Company's  principal executive offices are located at 1700 Westlake Ave. N,
     Suite  500,  Seattle,  Washington  98109, and its telephone number is (206)
     283-8802.

     As  of December 31, 1999 the company operated three divisions consisting of
     its  Data  Analysis  Products  Division  (DADP),  Engineering and Education
     Products  Division  (EEPD),  and  FreeScholarships.com  (FSC). In September
     2000,  the Company discontinued operations of its internet business FSC. In
     October  2000, the Company signed a letter of intent to sell the operations
     of  its  technical  calculation  software business, EEPD, to a third party.
     Consistent  with  this letter of intent, the Company sold the EEPD division
     on January 23, 2001. Accordingly the Company has recorded the operations of
     FSC  and  EEPD  as  discontinued  operations. The accompanying consolidated
     financial  statements and selected data contain certain accounts which have
     been  reclassified  to  reflect  these  dispositions.

     The  Company's  continuing  operations  and  primary  focus  are to provide
     software  and  consulting  solutions for statistical analysis, data mining,
     and  analytic  Customer-Relations-Management (CRM). The Company's principal
     location  has  shifted  to  Seattle,  Washington,  where  the Data Analysis
     Products  Division  ("DAPD")  is  located.  This  business  was acquired by
     Mathsoft  in  June  1993  through  the acquisition of substantially all the
     assets  of  Statistical  Sciences,  Inc.  The  Company's  current solutions
     facilitate  mining, analyzing, viewing, and predicting critical information
     for  faster,  intelligent,  and  more  efficient  management  decisions.

     The  market  for  analytic  applications  is expanding rapidly according to
     industry  sources.  The  company's  solutions serve a variety of industries
     including  financial  institutions,  pharmaceutical,  biotechnology,
     telecommunications,  GIS,  government  agencies  and  others.

     The  Company's  goals are to become a leading provider in its market domain
     by  expanding  :

     -    Its  user  base  from  primarily  technical  specialists to mainstream
          business  users.

     -    Its  products  from  desktop  applications  to  server  applications

     -    Its  data  scale  from  moderate  size  to   large  scale

     -    Its  market  from  primarily  domestic  to  worldwide  coverage

     S-Plus is a registered trademark of the Company. Insightful, StatServer and
     FreeScholarships  are  trademarks  of the Company. All other trademarks are
     the  property  of  their  respective  owners.

                                    Products

DATA  ANALYSIS  SOFTWARE  PRODUCTS

     S-PLUS

     On  June  30,  1993,  the  Company  acquired  Statistical Sciences, Inc., a
     software  company  located  in Seattle, Washington. The Company's principal
     product,  S-PLUS, is an advanced, exploratory data analysis and statistical
     data  mining  solution  for  technical  and business professionals who need
     sophisticated  analysis  and  visualization  capabilities.  Based  on  the
     object-oriented  "S" programming language licensed from Lucent Technologies
     Inc.,  S-PLUS enables users to perform exploratory data analysis, graphics,
     statistics,  visualization  and  mathematical  computing in the Windows and
     UNIX  environments.  The  primary  advantage  of S-PLUS lies within the "S"
     language.  The  "S"  language  is  one  of  the only modern object-oriented
     language  created  specifically  for  data  visualization  and exploration,
     statistical  modeling  and programming with data. This interactive language
     environment  gives  users  immediate  feedback  at  every  stage  of  their
     analysis.

     Services

     The  Company  believes  that  providing  a  high  level  of  support to its
     customers  is  a  critical  requirement  for  customer satisfaction and the
     long-term success of the Company. The Company believes it has established a
     strong  history  of  responsiveness  to  customer requirements. The Company
     delivers  this  support  for  its  data  analysis  products  through  its
     maintenance,  consulting,  and  training  services.

     The  Company provides product updates and enhancements and customer support
     services  under  an  annual maintenance agreement offered to its customers.
     Maintenance fees are based on a percentage of the current list price of the
     licensed  software  products.  The  consulting  and  training  organization
     provides  fee-based  services, including implementation assistance, project
     management,  application  extension  or  customization,  integration  with
     existing  customer  applications  and  similar  services  to  the Company's
     customers.  The Company offers a comprehensive series of fee-based training
     courses  to  its  customers.  Courses can be taken at the Company's Seattle
     location,  at  the  customer's  site, at other prearranged sites for larger
     customer  groups,  or  online  via  the  internet.

     Modules

     To  complement  S-PLUS,  the  Company  offers add-on modules that work with
     S-PLUS  and  provide additional "S" language functions for specialized data
     analysis  purposes.

     StatServer

     In  April  1997,  the  Company  expanded  its data analysis product line by
     introducing  StatServer.  StatServer  enables  corporations  to  leverage
     existing  client/server  and  internet/intranet  technologies  and  deploy
     statistical  expertise  throughout  an  organization.  StatServer  is  data
     warehouse-independent  and integrates seamlessly with all standard database
     and  data warehouse formats. The robust database support provides the tools
     for advanced analysis and data visualization of the most popular relational
     databases. With StatServer, basic statistical models and data visualization
     capabilities  are  built  and  stored  in  a  central  server for access by
     non-technical  users,  who  can  apply  these  analytical techniques from a
     single  and familiar client to understand or interpret key data sets. Using
     StatServer,  professionals  in  diverse fields such as finance, biomedicine
     and  manufacturing can use familiar tools such as Excel , Internet Explorer
     or  Powerbuilder  to  access  corporate  data  resources  and  perform data
     analysis  without  becoming  experts  in statistics or users of statistical
     tools.  StatServer  moves  beyond  the  capabilities  of  report  writers,
     spreadsheet  applications  and  stand-alone  data  analysis  software,
     representing  a significant advancement in decision support and data mining
     technology.

MARKETING  AND  SALES

     The Company's market for Statistical Analysis, Data Mining and Analytic CRM
     is  serving  a  variety  of  industries  including  Financial Institutions,
     Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical, Telecommunications and other industries. The
     Company's  solutions are used in a variety of functions including research,
     engineering,  production,  marketing,  finance,  and  investments.

     The  Company  reaches  domestic  customers  of  its products and consulting
     services  both  through  its domestic telesales organization and an outside
     sales  team.  Leads  are  generated  from  advertising,  public  relations,
     seminars  and tradeshows and then pursued by telesales and the direct sales
     force.

     Internationally,  the  Company  reaches  customers  of  its  products  and
     consulting  services  primarily  through  a  network  of  resellers  and
     distributors.  In the United Kingdom, the Company utilizes its direct sales
     force  to  sell  directly  to  end-users.

CUSTOMER  TECHNICAL  SUPPORT

     Technical  support  for  the  S-PLUS  product  line is provided to domestic
     customers  by  a  staff  of  engineers  located in Seattle. Support is only
     available  to  customers  who  purchase an annual maintenance and technical
     support  plan.

     International  customers  who  purchase  products from distributors receive
     first  line  technical  support  from their respective local distributor. A
     technical  support  staff  of  engineers,  located  in the Company's United
     Kingdom  sales  and  marketing  office,  is  available  to  support  the
     distributors  as  well  as  the  Company's  direct  customers in the United
     Kingdom.

MANUFACTURING  AND  DISTRIBUTION

     The  Company  utilizes  several  third  party  vendors  to  manufacture and
     distribute  its  products.  This permits the Company to manage peak volumes
     customary  in  the  software  industry and to avoid having to maintain high
     fixed  costs  while  experiencing  daily fluctuations in order and customer
     contacts.

     The  Company's  practice  is  to ship its products promptly upon receipt of
     orders  from  its  customers  and,  as  a  result,  product  backlog is not
     significant.

     The  Company  subcontracts  with  a  third  party vendor, located in Salem,
     Oregon,  to manufacture all of its S-PLUS product line updates. The Company
     warehouses  inventory,  processes,  and fulfills domestic orders internally
     out  of  its  Seattle  office.  All  international orders are processed and
     fulfilled  by  third  party vendors located in the United Kingdom that also
     provide  warehousing  and  fulfillment  services.

PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT

     Insightful's  software  products  research  and development organization is
     responsible  for  software  development, product documentation, and quality
     assurance.  Their priorities are to continue technical innovation for power
     and  performance  and to respond to market feedback by continuing to design
     products  for  ease-of-use.

     Insightful's  development team consists of experts in software engineering,
     quality  assurance, mathematics, statistics, engineering and documentation.
     In  software  engineering, Insightful's professional staff has expertise in
     computer  graphics,  compiler  design,  user  interface design and advanced
     Windows  and  Internet  technologies.

     During  the  fiscal  years  ended  December  31,  2000,  1999 and 1998, net
     research  and  development  costs  charged  to  operations were $2,310,000,
     $1,669,000,  and  $2,301,000,  respectively. The Company did not capitalize
     any  software research and development costs during the twelve months ended
     December  31,  2000  as  software  research  and development costs incurred
     between  technological  feasibility  and general release were not material.

COMPETITION

     The  market  for data analysis software products is highly competitive. The
     Company considers its principal competition to include statistical software
     products from such companies as SAS and SPSS, and alternative data analysis
     programming languages, specifically "R". The Company also faces competition
     from companies providing competing software solutions, such as spreadsheets
     (Excel  from Microsoft) and mathematical calculation tools (Matlab from The
     MathWorks).  The  Company  may  also  face  new  competition from potential
     entrants  into  the data analysis software markets, as well as more focused
     competition  from  companies  in related markets. For example, providers of
     spreadsheet  programs  could  add  to  or  improve  the  data  analysis
     functionality  of their existing products. Some of these companies may have
     significant  name  recognition,  as  well  as substantially greater capital
     resources,  marketing  experience,  research  and  development  staffs, and
     production  facilities  than  the Company. Although the Company believes it
     has  certain  technological advantages over existing competitors in the the
     data  analysis  software markets, maintaining these advantages will require
     continued  investment by the Company in research and development. There can
     be  no  assurance  that  the Company will have sufficient resources to make
     such  investment or that the Company will be able to make the technological
     advances  necessary  to  maintain  its  competitive  position.

INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY  RIGHTS  AND  LICENSES

     Insightful's software is proprietary and the Company attempts to protect it
     with  copyrights,  patents,  trade  secret  laws and internal nondisclosure
     safeguards,  as  well  as  restrictions  on  copying,  disclosure  and
     transferability that are incorporated into its software license agreements.
     Generally,  the  Company's  products  are not physically copy-protected. In
     order  to  retain  exclusive  ownership rights to all software developed by
     Insightful, the Company licenses all software and provides it in executable
     code  only,  with  contractual  restrictions  on  copying,  disclosure  and
     transferability.  As  is customary in the industry, Insightful licenses its
     products  to  end-users  by use of a 'shrink-wrap' license. The source code
     for  all  of  the  Company's products is protected as a trade secret and as
     unpublished  copyrighted  work.  In  addition, the Company has entered into
     nondisclosure  and  inventions  agreements  with key employees. However, in
     those  areas  where  the  Company  has  no  patent  protection,  judicial
     enforcement  of  copyright  laws  may  be  uncertain.


                                        5
<PAGE>
     The  Company  is  a  worldwide  licensee  until February 18, 2002 of Lucent
     Technologies  Inc. for the "S" programming language. Under the license, the
     Company  has  the  right to use, sublicense and support the "S" programming
     language  from  Lucent  Technologies  in  exchange  for  royalties.  Any
     modifications,  enhancements,  adaptations  or  derivations  of  the  "S"
     programming  language  are  the property of the Company. After February 18,
     2002,  the  Company, at its election, may extend this license for five-year
     terms in perpetuity, provided that the Company continues to comply with its
     obligations  under  the license. Although termination of this license could
     have  a  material adverse effect on the Company's operations because Lucent
     Technologies  is  the  sole  licensor  of the "S" programming language, the
     Company  is not presently aware of any circumstances which would prevent it
     from  fulfilling  its  obligations  under  the  license.

     Due to the rapid pace of technological change in the software industry, the
     Company  believes  that  patent,  trade secret and copyright protection are
     less  significant  to  its  competitive  position  than factors such as the
     knowledge,  ability  and experience of the Company's personnel, new product
     development,  frequent  product enhancements, name recognition, and ongoing
     reliable  product  maintenance  and  support.

     The  Company believes that its products and other proprietary rights do not
     infringe  the  proprietary  rights  of  third  parties.  There  can  be  no
     assurance,  however, that third parties will not assert infringement claims
     in  the  future.

EMPLOYEES

     As  of  December  31,  2000,  the  Company's continuing operations employed
     approximately  140  regular  full-time  and part-time employees, of whom 15
     were  outside  the United States. As necessary, the Company supplements its
     regular  employees  with temporary and contract personnel in its continuing
     operations.  As  of December 31, 2000, the Company employed 8 temporary and
     contract  personnel  in  its continuing operations, of whom one was located
     outside  the  United  States.  None  of the Company's regular employees are
     represented  by  a  labor  union  or are subject to a collective bargaining
     agreement.  The  Company has never experienced a work stoppage and believes
     that  its  employee  relations  are  good.

CAUTIONARY  STATEMENTS

     In  addition  to  the  other  information  in  this  report,  the following
     cautionary  statements  should  be  considered  carefully in evaluating the
     Company  and its business. Information provided by the Company from time to
     time  may  contain  certain  "forward-looking" information, as that term is
     defined  by  (i)  the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the
     "Act")  and (ii) in releases made by the Securities and Exchange Commission
     (the  "SEC").  These  cautionary  statements are being made pursuant to the
     provisions  of  the Act and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of
     the  "safe  harbor"  provisions  of  the  Act.

     Variability  of  Quarterly  Operating  Results.  The  Company's  quarterly
     operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, depending
     upon factors such as the introduction and market acceptance of new products
     and  new versions of existing products, the ability to reduce expenses, and
     the  activities  of competitors. Because a high percentage of the Company's
     expenses  are  relatively  fixed  in the near term, minor variations in the
     timing  of  orders  and  shipments  can  cause  significant  variations  in
     quarterly operating results. The Company operates with little or no backlog
     and  has  no long-term contracts. Substantially all of its product revenues
     in each quarter result from software licenses issued in that quarter making
     the Company's ability to accurately forecast future revenues and income for
     any  period  necessarily  limited. Any forward-looking information provided
     from  time  to  time  by the Company represents only management's then-best
     current estimate of future results or trends, and actual results may differ
     materially  from  those  contained  in  the  Company's  estimates.

     Potential  Volatility of Stock Price. There has been significant volatility
     in  the  market  price  of  securities of technology companies. The Company
     believes  factors  such  as announcements of new products by the Company or
     its  competitors, quarterly fluctuations in the Company's financial results
     or other software companies' financial results, shortfalls in the Company's
     actual financial results compared to results previously forecasted by stock
     market  analysts,  and  general  conditions  in  the  software and internet
     industries  and  conditions in the financial markets could cause the market
     price  of  the  common  stock  to  fluctuate  substantially.  These  market
     fluctuations  may adversely affect the price of the Company's common stock.

     Risks  Associated  with  Acquisitions.  The  Company  has  made a number of
     acquisitions  and will continue to review future acquisition opportunities.
     No  assurances can be given that acquisition candidates will continue to be
     available  on  terms and conditions acceptable to the Company. Acquisitions
     involve numerous risks, including, among other things, possible dilution to
     existing  shareholders,  difficulties  and  expenses incurred in connection
     with the acquisitions and the subsequent assimilation of the operations and
     services or products of the acquired companies, the difficulty of operating
     new  (albeit  related)  businesses, the diversion of management's attention
     from other business concerns and the potential loss of key employees of the
     acquired  company. In the event that the operations of an acquired business
     do  not live up to expectations, the Company may be required to restructure
     the  acquired  business or write-off the value of some or all of the assets
     of  the  acquired  business. There can be no assurance that any acquisition
     will  be  successfully  integrated  into  the  Company's  operations.

     Limited  Operating  History  in  the  Internet  Market.  Historically,  the
     Company's  revenues  have  come from licenses related to the Company's core
     product families. Although the Company anticipates that the majority of its
     revenue  will  continue  to  come from licenses related to its core product
     families, these moves toward increased focus on the Internet have required,
     and  will continue to require, changes in personnel and business processes.

     Internet-Related  Risks.  The Company's online store and its online courses
     available  through  the  World  Wide  Web,  such  as  its  S-PLUS Knowledge
     Discovery Series, rely on the continued growth of the Internet. The Company
     expects  that  continued consumer concerns regarding security, reliability,
     privacy,  ease  of use, and the changing regulatory environment will affect
     the  development  of the Company's products and services connected with the
     Internet.

     Security.  If  the  Company's  web  site  security fails, it may damage the
     Company's  ability  to sell products through its online store. In addition,
     the  Company may be liable if security on its web sites is breached and the
     Company  is  the  victim  of  credit  card  fraud.

     Privacy.  Visitors  to  the  Company's  online  store are asked for certain
     personally  identifying  information,  which is then used to ship products,
     and  for  marketing  and  data  collection.  No  personally  identifiable
     information  is  sold  or conveyed to third parties. As attitudes regarding
     online  privacy  continue  to  evolve,  there  can be no assurance that the
     Company's  needs  for  personally  identifiable information will be in line
     with  public  attitudes  or  government  regulations  regarding  privacy.

     Ease  of Use. If, for reasons such as failure of the Company's web servers,
     slow  modem  connections,  or  poor web site design, users of the Company's
     products  and  services, including the online store and the online courses,
     find it difficult to use the Company's products and services, the Company's
     revenues  could  decrease  and  its  brands  could  be  damaged.

     Changing Regulatory Environment. Laws and regulation regarding the internet
     are  becoming  more  common.  Changes  in  laws regarding privacy, internet
     access  taxes  or  other areas may require the Company to change the way it
     does business over the Internet. The laws governing the use of the internet
     are  generally  unsettled.  There  is  no  way to predict the ways in which
     existing  and  new  laws  will  apply  to  internet  commerce,  services or
     products.

     Risks  Associated  with  Divestitures.  Following the sale of the Company's
     EEPD  unit  in  January  of 2001, the Company is now functioning with fewer
     employees while at the same time concentrating on a single market. The lack
     of  diversification  of  product lines may make the Company more subject to
     market  fluctuations.


                                        7
<PAGE>
     Risks  Associated  with  Distribution  Channels.  The  Company  markets and
     distributes its S-PLUS products in the U.S. through the Company's telesales
     and  outside  sales force and internationally through third party resellers
     and distributors and its own salesforce. There can be no assurance that the
     Company  will  be able to retain its current resellers and distributors, or
     expand  its  distribution  channels  by entering into arrangements with new
     resellers  and  distributors  in  the  Company's  current markets or in new
     markets.

     Risks Associated with International Operations. Sales outside North America
     accounted  for  approximately  24%  of  the Company's total revenues in the
     fiscal  year  ended December 31, 2000, and approximately 26% and 28% of the
     Company's  total  revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 1999, and
     1998,  and may continue to represent a significant portion of the Company's
     product  revenues.  Any  decrease in sales outside North America may have a
     materially adverse effect on the Company's operating results. The Company's
     international  business  and  financial  performance  may  be  affected  by
     fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  and  by  trade  regulations.

     Reliance on Third Party Licensors. The S programming language, the language
     on  which  all  of  the  Company's  products  are based, and other software
     licenses incorporated in the Company's products are currently licensed from
     a  single  source  or  limited  source  suppliers.  If  such  licenses  are
     discontinued,  there  can  be no assurance that the Company will be able to
     independently  develop  substitutes or to obtain alternative sources or, if
     able to be developed or obtained as needed in the future, that such efforts
     would  not  result  in  delays  or  reductions in product shipments or cost
     increases  that  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect on the Company's
     consolidated  business  operations.

     Rapid  Technological Change; Competition. The data analysis software market
     is  subject  to rapid and substantial technological change, similar to that
     affecting  the  software  industry  generally.  The  Company,  to  remain
     successful,  must  be  responsive  to new developments in hardware and chip
     technology,  operating systems, programming technology, internet technology
     and  multimedia  capabilities.  In  addition,  the Company competes against
     numerous  other companies, some of which have significant name recognition,
     as  well  as substantially greater capital resources, marketing experience,
     research and development staffs and production facilities than the Company.
     Moreover,  the  Company  has  recently encountered competition from an open
     source  data  analysis  programming  language  called  "R"  which is freely
     available  and  provides  a  number  of  the  features and functions of the
     Company's  technology.  The  Company's  financial results may be negatively
     impacted  by  the  failure  of  new  or  existing  products to be favorably
     received  by  retailers and consumers due to price, availability, features,
     other  product  choices or the necessity of promotions to increase sales of
     the  Company's  products.

     Uncertainties Regarding Protection of Proprietary Technology; Uncertainties
     Regarding  Patents.  The  Company's  success  will  depend, in part, on its
     ability  to  protect  the  proprietary aspects of its products. The Company
     seeks  to  protect  these  proprietary  aspects of its products principally
     through  a  combination  of  contract  provisions  and  copyright,  patent,
     trademark  and  trade secret laws. There can be no assurance that the steps
     taken  by the Company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to
     prevent  misappropriation  of its technology. Although the Company believes
     that  its  products and technology do not infringe any existing proprietary
     rights  of others, the use of patents to protect software has increased and
     there  may  be  pending or issued patents of which the Company is not aware
     that  the  Company may need to license or challenge at significant expense.
     There  can  be  no  assurance  that  any such license would be available on
     acceptable  terms, if at all, or that the Company would prevail in any such
     challenge.

     Reliance on Attracting and Retaining Key Employees. The Company's continued
     success  will  depend  in  large  part on its ability to attract and retain
     highly  qualified  technical,  managerial,  sales  and  marketing and other
     personnel. Competition for such personnel in the Pacific Northwest area  of
     the United States and in Europe is intense. The Company has non-competition
     agreements with its key management and technical personnel. There can be no
     assurance  that  the  Company will be able to continue to attract or retain
     such  personnel.

     Risks  Associated  with  New  Products  or  Services.  The Company's future
     revenue growth rate and earnings performance depend on a number of factors,
     including  the  continued  success  of  its  existing  products and service
     offerings  and  the  development  of  one or more new products or services.
     These  investments  may adversely affect the Company's quarterly and annual
     financial  results  until  such  time  that  they begin to return a profit.
     Furthermore,  there  can  be  no assurance that these investments will ever
     achieve  the  desired  financial  results.

ITEM  2.  PROPERTIES.

     The  Company  leases  26,804  square  feet of office space at 1700 Westlake
     Avenue  North, Seattle, Washington. This lease expires in September 2004. A
     third  party  vendor  provides  warehousing  services to meet the Company's
     needs.  The  Company  also  leases 2,931 square feet of office space in the
     United  Kingdom. The term of the lease for this office space was renewed in
     March  2000  and  is  scheduled  to  expire  in  March  2005.

     The  Company  believes  that its facilities are adequate for its needs. The
     Company  does  not  consider  the  specific  location  of its offices to be
     material  to  its  business.

ITEM  3.  LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS.

     The  Company  is  not  involved in any legal proceedings which could have a
     material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company.

     The  Company has never paid any cash dividends on its Common Stock and does
     not  anticipate  paying  any  cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The
     Company currently intends to retain future earnings to fund the development
     and  growth  of  its  business.

ITEM  6.  SELECTED  FINANCIAL  DATA.

The  selected  consolidated financial data set forth below has been derived from
the  audited  financial  statements of the Company, except for the twelve months
ended  December  31, 1997 which has been presented for comparison purposes only.
The  information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and
notes  thereto  set  forth  elsewhere  herein.  The  Company closed its Internet
division  in  September  2000 and sold its EEPD division in the first quarter of
2001.  All selected data has been restated to reflect the discontinuance of both
of  those  operations,  however  none  of the data reflects the $ 7 million cash
received  or the $ 3.5 to $4.0 million estimated gain on the sale of EEPD in the
first  quarter  of  2001.

Twelve  Months  Ended  December  31,  2000  Compared  to the Twelve Months Ended
December  31,  1999

     Total  revenues  increased  24.8%,  from  $12,212,000 for the twelve months
     ended December 31, 1999 to $15,246,000 for the twelve months ended December
     31,  2000.  The  increase  in  total revenues was primarily attributable to
     worldwide new license and service revenue generated by the Company's S-PLUS
     product  line.

     The  increase  in S-PLUS product line revenue was primarily attributable to
     an  increase in service revenues, which included maintenance, training, and
     consulting.  S-PLUS  license  revenue was $6,505,000 and $6,811,000 for the
     twelve months ended 1999 and 2000, respectively. S-PLUS service revenue was
     $5,707,000  and  $8,435,000  for  the  twelve  months  ended 1999 and 2000,
     respectively.  The  increase  in  both  service  and  license  revenues was
     directly attributable to the June 1999 release of S-PLUS 2000 and increased
     headcount  additions  to  the  consulting  department.

     International  revenues  increased  15.0%,  from  $3,196,000  in  1999  to
     $3,676,000  in  2000,  respectively.

     Total  cost  of  revenues  increased  37.6%, from $3,277,000 for the twelve
     months  ended  December  31, 1999 to $4,507,000 for the twelve months ended
     December  31, 2000, respectively. The increase in total cost of revenues as
     a  percentage  of  total  revenues  was  primarily  attributable to a 24.8%
     increase  in  sales  as  well  as  a  product mix shift toward lower margin
     products  such  as  consulting  due  to  its  service  component.

     Sales  and  marketing  expenses  increased  20.5%,  from $4,033,000 for the
     twelve-months  ended  December 31, 1999 to $4,861,000 for the twelve months
     ended  December  31, 2000. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was
     attributable  to  an  increase  in  variable  marketing  expenditures  and
     headcount  additions  to  the  marketing  department  and  sales  force.

     Net  research and development expenses increased 38.4%, from $1,669,000 for
     the  twelve  months  ended  December  31, 1999 to $2,310,000 for the twelve
     months  ended  December  31,  2000,  and increased as a percentage of total
     revenues  from  13.7%  to  15.1%, respectively. The overall increase in net
     research  and  development expenses was primarily attributable to increased
     investment  in  the  S-Plus  product  lines,  and  offset  partially by the
     increase  in  research  funding.  Funded  research  increased  2.4%,  from
     $4,567,000  for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 to $4,678,000 for
     the  twelve months ended December 31, 2000. The increase in funded research
     is  attributable  to  an  increase  in  awarded  contracts  and the related
     increase  in personnel costs to fulfill those contracts. The Company's Data
     Analysis  Products  Division  research  department's  headcount  remained
     consistent  at  46  as  of  December  31,  1999  and  2000,  respectively.

     General and administrative expenses increased slightly, from $2,388,000 for
     the  twelve  months  ended  December  31, 1999 to $2,402,000 for the twelve
     months  ended  December  31,  2000,  and decreased as a percentage of total
     revenues  from  19.5%  to  15.8%,  respectively.

     Net  income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December
     31,  2000  was  $1,307,000 compared to $875,000 for the twelve months ended
     December  31,  1999.  Fiscal year 2000 reflected solid profit growth in the
     Company's  core  products,  particularly  its  consulting  services.

     Net  income  for  the  twelve  months ended December 31, 2000 was a loss of
     $6,000,000  compared  to a profit of $1,453,000 for the twelve months ended
     December  31,  1999.  Fiscal  year  2000  reflected  profit  growth  in the
     Company's  continuing  operations, substantially  offset by the significant
     loss  of  $7,306,000 from discontinued operations primarily attributable to
     the  Company's  internet  business,  FreeScholarships.com.

Twelve  Months  Ended  December  31,  1999  Compared  to the Twelve Months Ended
December  31,  1998

     Worldwide  S-PLUS  license  and  service  revenue  increased  38.1%,  from
     $8,843,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998 to $12,212,000 for
     the  twelve  months ended December 31, 1999. The increase in S-PLUS product
     line revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in service revenues,
     which  includes  maintenance,  training,  and  consulting.  S-PLUS  license
     revenue  was $5,165,000 and $6,505,000 for the twelve months ended 1998 and
     1999,  respectively.  S-PLUS  service revenue was $3,678,000 and $5,706,000
     for  the  twelve  months ended 1998 and 1999, respectively. The increase in
     both  service  and  license  revenues was directly attributable to the June
     1999  release  of  S-PLUS  2000 as well as to the product line's stability,
     quality,  maturing  sales  and  marketing  model.

     Total  international  revenues  increased 28.1%, from $2,495,000 in 1998 to
     $3,196,000  in  1999,  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from
     28.2%  to  26.2%,  respectively.

     Total  cost  of  revenues  increased  37.6%, from $2,380,000 for the twelve
     months  ended  December  31, 1998 to $3,277,000 for the twelve months ended
     December  31,  1999,  corresponding  with  the  38.1% growth in revenue and
     decreased  slightly  as a percentage of total revenues from 26.9% to 26.8%,
     respectively.

     Sales  and  marketing  expenses  increased  31.4%,  from $3,069,000 for the
     twelve-months  ended  December 31, 1998 to $4,033,000 for the twelve months
     ended  December  31,  1999, and decreased slightly as a percentage of total
     revenues  from  34.7%  to  33.0%,  respectively.  The increase in sales and
     marketing  expenses  was  attributable to an increase in variable marketing
     expenditures  and headcount additions to the marketing department and sales
     force.

     Net  research and development expenses decreased 27.5%, from $2,301,000 for
     the  twelve  months  ended  December  31, 1998 to $1,669,000 for the twelve
     months  ended  December  31,  1999,  and decreased as a percentage of total
     revenues  from  26.0%  to  13.7%, respectively. The overall decrease in net
     research and development expenses was primarily attributable to an increase
     in  research  funding. Funded research increased 61.3%, from $2,831,000 for
     the  twelve  months  ended  December  31, 1998 to $4,567,000 for the twelve
     months  ended  December  31,  1999.  The  increase  in  funded  research is
     attributable  to  an increase in awarded contracts and the related increase
     in  personnel  to  fulfill  those  contracts.  The  Company's Data Analysis
     Products  Division  research department's headcount increased from 32 to 46
     as  of  December  31,  1998  and  1999,  respectively.

     General  and  administrative  expenses increased 31.4%, from $1,817,000 for
     the  twelve  months  ended  December  31, 1998 to $2,388,000 for the twelve
     months  ended  December 31, 1999, and decreased slightly as a percentage of
     total  revenues  from 20.6% to 19.5%, respectively. The increase in overall
     general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased
     compensation  costs,  higher  facilities  costs,  and  increases  in  other
     miscellaneous  expenses.

     Net  income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December
     31,  1999  consisted of a profit of $875,000 compared to a loss of $591,000
     for  the  twelve months ended December 31, 1998. Fiscal year 1999 reflected
     profit  growth  in  the  Company's  core  products.

     Net  income  for  the  twelve  months  ended December 31, 1999 was $578,000
     compared  to  $2,812,000  for  the  twelve  months ended December 31, 1998.
     Fiscal  Year  1999  reflected  profit growth in the Company's core products
     offset by the reduced profits from discontinued operations. Net income from
     discontinued  operations  was  $578,000  in  1999 compared to $2,812,000 in
     1998.  The  reduction  was primarily attributable to losses incurred by the
     Company's  internet  business, FreeScholarships.com. FreeScholarships.com's
     net  loss  totaled  $1,842,000  in  1999.

Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources

     Cash  and  cash  equivalents,  totaling  $3,745,000  at  December 31, 2000,
     decreased  $3,468,000  during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, from
     $7,213,000  at  December  31,  1999.  The  cash  and cash equivalents as of
     December  31,  2000  does  not  include  the $7 million of cash received on
     January  23,  2001  arising out of the sale of the Company's EEPD unit. The
     negative  cash  flow for the year 2000 resulted primarily from cash used by
     discontinued  operations of $6,198,000, purchases of property and equipment
     of  $635,000,  and  payments on capital lease obligations of $307,000 which
     were offset by cash provided by continuing operations of $2,558,000 and net
     proceeds  from  the  exercise  of  stock  options  of  $1,148,000.

     The  Company  generated $2,558,000 in cash from operating activities during
     the  fiscal  year  ended December 31, 2000. The cash generated by operating
     activities  was  primarily  attributable  to  net  income  of approximately
     $1,307,000, non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, and an increase
     in deferred revenue, offset by an increase in accounts receivable. Accounts
     receivable  and  deferred  revenue increased primarily due to the growth in
     the  Company's  business. The Company used $624,000 in investing activities
     primarily  due  to  the  purchase  of  property  and equipment. The Company
     provided  $841,000  in financing activities primarily from the net proceeds
     generated  from the exercise of stock options offset by payments on capital
     lease  obligations.

     The  Company's  financial  reserves  are  represented  by  cash  and  cash
     equivalents  as  of  December  31,  2000.

     As of December 31, 2000 the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of
     $17.8  million  and  research  and development credit carryforwards of $4.2
     million.  The  net  operating  loss and credit carryforwards will expire at
     various  dates  through  2020,  if  not  used.  Under the provisions of the
     Internal  Revenue  Code, substantial changes in the Company's ownership may
     limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized
     annually in the future to offset taxable income. A full valuation allowance
     has been established in our financial statements to reflect the uncertainty
     of  the Company's ability to use available tax loss carryforwards and other
     deferred  tax  assets.

     Based  on  its closing of FreeScholarships.com in the third quarter of 2000
     and  its  sale  of  its  Engineering and Education Products Division for $7
     million  cash  in  the  first  quarter  of  2001,  the Company believes its
     financial reserves and cash flows from future operations will be sufficient
     to meet its liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. The
     cash  activity described above excludes the cash generated from the sale of
     its  Engineering  and  Education Products Division since it occurred in the
     first  quarter  of 2001. This transaction is a significant subsequent event
     and  is  directly  attributable to the Company having a $9.8 million dollar
     cash  balance  as  of  March  23,  2001.  The  foregoing  statement  is
     forward-looking  and  involves  risks  and uncertainties, many of which are
     outside  the  Company's control. The Company's actual experience may differ
     materially  from  that  discussed  above.  Factors  that might cause such a
     difference  include, but are not limited to, those discussed in "Cautionary
     Statements"  in  this Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000
     as  well  as  future  events that have the effect of reducing the Company's
     available  cash balances, such as unanticipated operating losses or capital
     expenditures, cash expenditures related to possible future acquisitions, or
     investment  in  new products or services. The Company may be presented from
     time  to  time  with  acquisition  opportunities  that  require  additional
     external  financing,  and  the Company may from time to time seek to obtain
     additional  funds  from  public  or  private  issuance  of  equity  or debt
     securities.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that any such financing will be
     available  at  all  or  on  terms  favorable  to  the  Company.

Recent  Accounting  Pronouncements

     In  March  2000,  the  FASB  issued  Interpretation  No. 44, Accounting for
     Certain  Transactions Involving Stock Compensation-an Interpretation of APB
     Opinion No. 25. This interpretation provides guidance on the application of
     APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, including (i)
     the  definition of an employee, (ii) the criteria for determining whether a
     plan  qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, (iii) the accounting consequence
     of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or
     award  and (iv) the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards
     in a business combination. The interpretation is effective July 1, 2000 and
     the  effects of applying the interpretation are recognized on a prospective
     basis.  The  adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact
     on  the  Company's  results  of  operations  or  financial  condition.

     In  September  2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers
     and  Servicing  of  Financial  Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, a
     replacement  of  SFAS  No.  125.  This  statement  provides  accounting and
     reporting  standards  for  transfers  and servicing of financial assets and
     extinguishments of liabilities. The statement provides consistent standards
     for  distinguishing  transfers  of  financial  assets  that  are sales from
     transfers  that  are  secured  borrowings.  The  statement is effective for
     transfers  and  servicing  of  financial  assets  and  extinguishments  of
     liabilities  occurring after March 31, 2001. The statement is effective for
     recognition and reclassification of collateral and for disclosures relating
     to securitization transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after
     December 15, 2000. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 140
     to  have  a  material  impact on the results of its operations or financial
     position.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE  AND  QUALITATIVE  DISCLOSURES  ABOUT  MARKET  RISK

     The  Company  develops  products  in  the  United  States  and  sells  them
     worldwide.  As  a result, the Company's financial results could be affected
     by  factors  such  as  changes  in  foreign currency exchange rates or weak
     economic  conditions  in  foreign  markets.  Since  the Company's sales are
     currently  priced  in  U.S.  dollars  and  translated  into  local currency
     amounts,  a  strengthening  of the dollar could make the Company's products
     less  competitive  in foreign markets. The Company operates a subsidiary in
     the United Kingdom which incurs expenses denominated in its local currency.
     However, the Company believes that these operating expenses will not have a
     material  adverse  effect on its results of operations. Interest income and
     expense  are  sensitive  to  changes  in the general level of U.S. interest
     rates,  particularly  since  the  company's  investments  are in short-term
     instruments.  Based  on  the  nature  and  current  levels of the Company's
     investments  and  debt,  however,  the  Company  believes  that there is no
     material  market  risk  or  exposure.

     The  Company's  general  investing policy is to limit the risk of principal
     loss  and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting credit and market
     risk.  The  Company currently places its investments in highly liquid money
     market  accounts  and short-term investments. All highly liquid investments
     with  original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash
     equivalents.

REPORT  OF  INDEPENDENT  PUBLIC  ACCOUNTANTS


To  Insightful  Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MathSoft, Inc. a
Massachusetts corporation presently doing business as Insightful Corporation and
subsidiaries  as  of  December  31,  2000  and 1999 and the related consolidated
statements  of  operations,  stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
three  years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These consolidated financial
statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements  based  on  our  audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in  the  United  States.  Those  standards  require that we plan and perform the
audit  to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free  of  material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit  also  includes  assessing  the accounting principles used and significant
estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating the overall financial
statement  presentation.  We  believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for  our  opinion.

In  our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  Insightful
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the results of
their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended  December  31,  2000,  in  conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted  in  the  United  States.

     INSIGHTFUL  CORPORATION  AND  SUBSIDIARIES

     Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
     December  31,  2000

(1)  OPERATIONS

     MathSoft,  Inc.,  presently  doing  business as Insightful Corporation (the
     Company)  provides  software  and  consulting  solutions  for  statistical
     analysis, data mining and analytic Customer Relations Management (CRM).

     The  Company  is  subject to a number of risks and uncertainties similar to
     those  of  other companies of the same size within its industry, including,
     without  limitation,  rapid  technological  change, competition and need to
     attract  and  retain  key  employees.

     On  June 1, 1999, the Company incorporated FreeScholarships.com, Inc. (FSC)
     as  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary. FSC was originated as an Internet company
     which  provided  information  and  assistance  to  a  broad consumer market
     focused  on  funding  the  costs  of  education.

     During  the  third  quarter of 2000, the Company discontinued operations of
     FSC, which began Web operations in February 2000. Operating losses from the
     discontinued  operation  were $9,000,623 and $1,841,762 for the years ended
     December  31,  2000  and  1999,  respectively.  In  connection  with  this
     discontinuation,  the  Company  recorded  a $1.9 million charge for various
     costs related to closing this operation. This charge is included in the net
     loss  for  2000.  During  the  fourth  quarter  $850,000 of this charge was
     reversed  as  a  result of certain favorable negotiations in winding-up its
     operations.

     In  October  2000,  the  Company  signed  a  letter  of  intent to sell the
     operations  of  the  Company's  Engineering and Education Products Division
     (EEPD)  to a third party. Consistent with this letter of intent, on January
     23, 2001, the Company sold all of the outstanding stock of its wholly-owned
     subsidiary,  Mathsoft  Engineering  &  Education,  Inc. (MEEI), to Mathsoft
     Corporate  Holdings,  Inc. As a result of this transaction, the Company has
     recorded  the  operations  of  EEPD  as  discontinued operations during the
     fourth quarter of 2000, which is reflected in the accompanying consolidated
     financial  statements.  The  net gain for this transaction will be reported
     during  the  first  quarter  of  2001 within discontinued operations and is
     presently  expected  to  range  between  $3.5  and  $4.0  million.

     The accompanying consolidated financial statements contain certain accounts
     that  have  been  reclassified  in each of the periods presented to reflect
     these  dispositions.  Reported  revenue,  costs  and  expenses  exclude the
     operating  results  of  FSC  and  EEPD.  The  results  of  FSC and EEPD are
     presented  on  a  net basis in the consolidated statements of operations as
     (loss)  income from operations of discontinued operations. Operating (loss)
     income  from  operations  of  discontinued operations were $(7,306,144) and
     $578,076  for  the  years  ended  December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

          the  resulting  receivable  is  probable,  the  fee  is  fixed  or
          determinable,  and  vendor-specific  objective evidence exists for all
          undelivered  elements  to  allow  allocation  of  the total fee to all
          delivered  and undelivered elements of the arrangement. Revenues under
          such  arrangements,  which  may  include  several  different  software
          products  and  services  sold  together, are allocated to each element
          based  on  the  residual  method in accordance with SOP 98-9, Software
          Revenue  Recognition,  with Respect to Certain Transactions. Under the
          residual  method,  the  fair  value  of  the  undelivered  elements is
          deferred  and  subsequently  recognized  when  earned. The Company has
          established  sufficient  vendor  specific  objective  evidence  for
          professional  services, training and maintenance and support services.

          Accordingly, software license revenue is recognized under the residual
          method in arrangements in which software is licensed with professional
          services,  training  and  maintenance  and  support  services.

          The  Company  provides for estimated returns and warranty costs at the
          time of sale. The Company offers maintenance contracts and training on
          certain  of  its  products.  Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably
          over the term of the related contracts generally for one year or less.
          Training  and  consulting  revenue  is  recognized  as  services  are
          performed.  Amounts received in advance for maintenance agreements are
          recorded  as deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated balance
          sheets.

     (b)  CASH  AND  CASH  EQUIVALENTS

          Cash  and  cash  equivalents  are  stated  at cost, which approximates
          market,  and  consist  of  short-term,  highly liquid investments with
          original  maturities  of less than three months. Cash equivalents were
          approximately  $3,745,000  and  $7,213,000 as of December 31, 2000 and
          1999,  respectively,  and  consisted  primarily  of  investments  in
          commercial  paper.

     (c)  INVENTORIES

          Inventories  are  stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or
          market  and  consist  entirely  of  raw  materials.

     (d)  DEPRECIATION  AND  AMORTIZATION

          The  Company  provides for depreciation and amortization by charges to
          operations  on a straight-line basis, in amounts estimated to allocate
          the  cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives, as follows:


                 ASSET CLASSIFICATION                   USEFUL LIVES
            Computer equipment and software               3 years
            Furniture and fixtures                      3-5 years
            Leasehold improvements                     Life of lease


          Property  and  equipment  under  capital leases are amortized over the
          shorter  of  the  estimated  useful life of three to five years or the
          term  of  the  lease.

     (e)  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT

          The  Company  accounts for its software research and development costs
          in  accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
          No.  86,  Accounting  for  the  Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold,
          Leased  or  Otherwise  Marketed.  During  the years ended December 31,
          2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company expensed all research and development
          costs, as those costs incurred from technological feasibility (defined
          as  a  working  model)  to  general  release  were  not  material.

     (f)  FUNDED  RESEARCH

          Funded  Research  amounts  represent  funding  received primarily from
          federal  government  agencies  for  work  performed  by  the Company's
          research  and  development department under cost-sharing arrangements.
          These amounts are recognized as the work is performed and are recorded
          as  an  offset  against  the  Company's total research and development
          costs.

     (g)  NET  INCOME  (LOSS)  PER  SHARE

          The  Company  reports  earnings  per share in accordance with SFAS No.
          128,  Earnings  per Share. Under SFAS No. 128, basic net income (loss)
          per  common  share is computed based on net income (loss) available to
          common  stockholders  and the weighted average number of common shares
          outstanding  during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is
          computed  based  on  the number of additional common shares that would
          have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been
          issued.

          A  reconciliation  of  basic  and  diluted  shares  outstanding  is as
          follows:

     (h)  FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATION

          Assets  and liabilities of the Company's foreign branch are translated
          to  U.S.  dollars  using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date.
          Income  and  expense  accounts are translated using an average rate of
          exchange  during  the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments
          are  accumulated  as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The
          effect of aggregate transaction losses are recognized currently in the
          statements  of  operations  included  in  general  and  administrative
          expense  and  were  approximately  $109,000, $9,000 and $8,000 for the
          years  ended  December  31,  2000,  1999  and  1998,  respectively.

     (i)  OTHER  ASSETS

          Other  assets, consisting primarily of purchased technology, long-term
          deposits  and  capitalized  legal  patent  fees,  totaled $201,688 and
          $268,950,  net  of accumulated amortization of $127,698 and $71,030 as
          of  December  31,  2000  and  1999,  respectively.

          The  Company  assesses  the  realizability of its long-lived assets in
          accordance  with  SFAS  No.  121,  Accounting  for  the  Impairment of
          Long-Lived  Assets  and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. Under
          SFAS  No.  121, the Company is required to assess the valuation of its
          long-lived assets, including intangible assets, based on the estimated
          cash  flows  to  be generated by such assets. Based on its most recent
          analysis,  the  Company  believes  that  no  material  impairment  of
          intangible  assets  exists  as  of  December  31,  2000.

     (j)  CONCENTRATION  OF  CREDIT  RISK

          SFAS  No.  105,  Disclosure of Information about Financial Instruments
          with  Off-Balance-Sheet  Risk  and  Financial  Instruments  with
          Concentrations  of Credit Risk, requires disclosure of any significant
          off-balance-sheet  and  credit  risk  concentrations.  The  Company's
          financial  instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist
          primarily  of  cash  and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The
          Company maintains the majority of its cash balances with one financial
          institution.  The  Company  has  not  experienced  significant  losses
          related to accounts receivable from any individual customers or groups
          of  customers  in  any  specific  industry  or  geographic  area.

          During  the  years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company
          did  not  have any one customer that accounted for greater than 10% of
          net  revenues. As of December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company did
          not  have  any  one  customer  that  accounted  for  10%  of  accounts
          receivable.

     (k)  USE  OF  ESTIMATES

          The  preparation  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements  in
          conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles requires
          management  to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
          amounts  of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
          and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial statements and the
          reported  amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period.
          Actual  results  could  differ  from  those  estimates.

     (l)  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS

          SFAS  No.  107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,
          requires  disclosure  about  fair  value  of  financial  instruments
          consisting  of  cash,  accounts  receivable,  equipment  financing and
          capital  leases.  The  estimated  fair  value  of  these  financial
          instruments  approximates  their  carrying  value  in the accompanying
          financial  statements.

     (m)  DERIVATIVES

          SFAS  No.  137,  Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging
          Activities-Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133-An
          Amendment  of  FASB Statement No. 133, which defers the effective date
          of  SFAS  No. 133 to all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning
          after  June  15,  2000.  SFAS  No.  133,  Accounting  for  Derivative
          Instruments  and  Hedging Activities, issued in June 1998, establishes
          accounting  and  reporting  standards  for  derivative  instruments,
          including  certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts,
          and  hedging  activities.  It  requires  an  entity  to  recognize all
          derivatives  as  either  assets  or  liabilities  in  the statement of
          financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. As the
          Company  does  not  currently  engage  in  derivatives  or  hedging
          transactions,  there  is  no  impact  to  the  Company's  results  of
          operations, financial position or cash flows upon the adoption of SFAS
          No.  133.

     (n)  RECENT  ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS

          In  March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
          Interpretation  No.  44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving
          Stock  Compensation-an  Interpretation  of  APB  Opinion  No. 25. This
          interpretation provides guidance on the application of APB Opinion No.
          25,  Accounting  for  Stock Issued to Employees. The interpretation is
          effective July 1, 2000. Its adoption did not have a material impact on
          the  Company's  results  of  operations  or  financial  condition.

          In  September  2000,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No. 140, Accounting for
          Transfers  and  Servicing  of  Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
          Liabilities,  a  replacement  of SFAS No. 125. This statement provides
          accounting  and  reporting  standards  for  transfers and servicing of
          financial  assets and extinguishments of liabilities. The Company does
          not  expect  the adoption of SFAS No. 140 to have a material impact on
          the  results  of  its  operations  or  financial  position.

(3)  INCOME  TAXES

     The  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
     Accounting  for  Income  Taxes.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and
     liabilities  are  determined  based on the difference between the financial
     statement  and  tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted
     tax  rates.

     Due  to  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the realization of its deferred tax

     carryforwards  of approximately $17,775,000 and tax credit carryforwards of
     approximately  $4,240,000.  The  net  operating  loss  and  tax  credit
     carryforwards  may  be  used  to  offset  future federal taxable income and
     federal  income  taxes,  respectively, through the year ending December 31,
     2020.  The  Internal  Revenue  Code  contains provisions that limit the net
     operating  loss  and credit carryforwards available to be used in any given
     year  upon  the occurrence of certain events, including significant changes
     in  ownership  interests.

(4)  EQUIPMENT  FINANCING

     During  2000,  the  Company entered into several financing arrangements for
     the purchase of fixed assets totaling $167,788, all of which were equipment
     lease financing arrangements. All of the financings are payable in 24 equal
     monthly  payments  of  principal plus interest ranging from 10.9% to 11.3%.

(5)  COMMITMENTS

     The  Company  has  operating  leases for its various facilities and certain
     office  equipment.  One lease provides for uneven payments during the lease
     term; however, rent expense is charged to operations evenly over the leased
     period.

     The future lease payments under the Company's operating lease arrangements,
     exclusive  of  operating  costs and net of sublease revenue through October
     2005  are  approximately  as  follows:

(6)  STOCKHOLDERS'  EQUITY

     (A)  STOCK  OPTION  PLANS

          The Company has a stock option plan that was adopted in 1992 (the 1992
          Plan) whereby the Board of Directors may grant incentive stock options
          (ISOs),  nonqualified  stock  options,  awards  of  common  stock  and
          authorizations  to  make  direct purchases of common stock to eligible
          employees  and  others, as defined. A total of 4,650,000 shares may be
          issued  under the 1992 Plan. ISOs are granted at a price not less than
          fair  market  value  at  the date of grant. The options typically vest
          over  a five-year period. At December 31, 2000 the Company had 666,135
          options  available  for  future  grant  under  the  1992  Plan.

          The  Company  also  has  a Nonemployee Director Stock Option Plan (the
          1992 Director's Plan) pursuant to which directors who are not officers
          or  employees  of  the  Company  annually  receive options to purchase
          shares  of  the  Company's  common stock. A total of 400,000 shares of
          common  stock  may  be  issued  under  the  1992  Director's Plan. The
          exercise  price  of  each  option  equals the fair market value of the
          stock  on  the  date  of  grant.  The options are exercisable upon the
          earlier  of  one  year  from  the  date  of grant, or the first annual
          meeting  of  stockholders following the date of grant at which members
          of  the  Board  are  elected.  At  December  31, 2000, the Company had
          230,416  options  available for future grant under the 1992 Director's
          Plan.

          The Board of Directors granted Key Officer Stock Options to members of
          senior  management  of  the  Company  in  1992.  The Key Officer Stock
          Options  are  nonqualified,  nonplan  stock options exercisable for an
          aggregate  of  907,556  shares of common stock at an exercise price of
          $1.08 per share, the fair market value of the common stock on the date
          of  grant.  Each  such option expires 11 years from the date of grant,
          subject  to  earlier  termination  if the optionee ceases to serve the
          Company  other than by reason of death or disability. Each Key Officer
          Stock  Option  became  exercisable  upon  the closing of the Company's
          initial  public  offering.

          The  Company  has  a Non-Qualified, Non-Officer Stock Option Plan (the
          1996  Non-Officer  Plan)  under which employees and consultants to the
          Company  are  granted  nonqualified  options  to purchase stock in the
          Company. A total of 200,000 shares of common stock may be issued under
          the  1996  Non-Officer  Plan. The vesting of options granted under the
          1996  Non-Officer Plan is determined at the date of grant. Each option
          expires  10  years  from  the  date  of  grant,  subject  to  earlier
          termination  if the optionee ceases to serve the Company other than by
          reason  of  death  or disability, and is not transferable. At December
          31,  2000,  the Company had 165,000 options available for future grant
          under  the  1996  Non-Officer  Plan.

          As  of  December 31, 2000, a total of 6,157,556 shares of common stock
          were  reserved  for  issuance under the 1992 Plan, the 1992 Director's
          Plan,  the  Key  Officer  Stock  Option Plan, and the 1996 Non-Officer
          Plan.

          The  Company  accounts  for  its  stock-based compensation plans under
          Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion  No.  25,  Accounting for Stock
          Issued  to  Employees, and has adopted the disclosure-only alternative
          under SFAS No. 123 for employees, which requires disclosure of the pro
          forma  effects  on  earnings and earnings per share as if SFAS No. 123
          had  been  adopted,  as well as certain other information. The Company
          has computed the pro forma disclosures required under SFAS No. 123 for
          all  stock  options  granted  during fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
          including  the  Employee  Stock Purchase Plan, using the Black-Scholes
          option  pricing  model  prescribed  by SFAS No. 123. For nonemployees,
          SFAS  No.  123 requires that the compensation expense calculated using
          the  Black-Scholes option pricing model be charged to the statement of
          operations.  There  were no grants to nonemployees for the years ended

          stock  in semiannual offerings over a 10-year period. Shares of common
          stock  are  sold  at  85% of fair market value, as defined. During the

          to  its  CEO  for the exercise of common stock options. The note bears
          interest  of  8%  in  the first two years, and the prime rate in years
          thereafter  (9.5% at December 31, 2000). The principal and any accrued
          but  unpaid  interest  is payable on demand at any time after June 19,
          2002,  or  earlier upon the occurrence of certain specific events. The
