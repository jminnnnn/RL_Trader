                                     PART I

ITEM 1. Business

     The Company. Kontron Mobile Computing, Inc. ("Kontron Mobile Computing" or
"the Company"), was incorporated in Minnesota in 1992 under its former name of
FieldWorks, Incorporated and is dedicated to the development and sale of rugged
portable computing solutions. The Company is part of the worldwide group of
Kontron companies, owned or principally owned by Kontron Embedded Computers AG
(Kontron). Over the past several years, the Company has evolved its strategy to
focus on designing and providing industry-specific field technology solutions.
The Company believes that this strategy represents the strongest opportunity for
growth and differentiation.

     The Company has had a history of designing and delivering hardware
platforms for extreme environments and will continue to capitalize on its strong
product reputation and value added reseller network. The Company's focus will
continue to target military, public safety, automation and transportation
markets where users rely on the features of Kontron Mobile Computing computers
to do their jobs.

     Kontron Mobile Computing computer platforms are designed for demanding
field environments, meeting military test standards for shock, vibration,
moisture and temperature extremes. Features include outdoor-readable
high-resolution color displays, sealed pointing devices and integrated
technology protected for use in extended temperatures and isolated for shock and
vibration. The Company also offers a high level of expandability and
upgradability within each product platform. Expansion paths include desktop-like
ISA/PCI computer card expansion slots, PC card slots, serial ports, universal
serial bus and custom modules. As a result, all platforms are flexible
"electronic toolboxes" that integrate the user's application-specific tools and
technologies into one custom, rugged mobile solution. Upgrade paths include
central processing units (CPU), random access memory (RAM), hard drive
capacities, display technologies and peripheral technologies, such as wireless
communication. Such upgradability contributes to a longer useful life which
reduces the total cost of ownership for the end-customer. It sets Kontron Mobile
Computing products and solutions higher on the value scale with our customers as
their initial investment is in many ways "protected" by technology enhancements
or improvements over a period of time.

     The Rugged Computing Market. Technological advances have increased
customers' dependence on mobile computing and communications devices, such as
portable computers, pagers and cellular telephones, to enhance workforce
productivity. The rugged computing market has increasing needs for reliability,
operability in extreme conditions, portability, security and compatibility with
a variety of communication interfaces and standard desktop computer technology.
Organizations are increasingly seeking to connect field personnel through
computerization. Such computerization can provide sophisticated field diagnostic
and analytic capabilities, enhance field access to data and on-line information,
eliminate paperwork and improve communication.

     The markets for the Company's products consist of those businesses and
other entities that are seeking effective mobile computing for field personnel
and functions. The Company's rugged mobile computing platforms are used in a
variety of industries whose demands vary widely, and include: (i) public service
for improved productivity, efficiency and real time, remote data access (ii)
military and government contractors for situational awareness, flight-line
communications and real time, highly reliable data acquisition in extreme
conditions and (iii) transportation OEMs and full-solution integrators for
wireless data transfer, maintenance and diagnostic testing.

     Strategy. The Company's vision continues to be to become "the worldwide
rugged, mobile computing solutions provider." The Company's strategy consists of
the following key components:

     Further Penetration of Key Vertical Markets. The Company continues to
target key vertical markets including government, military, public services, and
utilities. The Company develops product features and functions to address the
needs of a particular vertical market and provides application-engineering
services to support the specific requirements of those customers when necessary.
The Company's strategy is to be a key provider of tools and services to
facilitate field data acquisition, test and measurement, telemetry, and mobile
communication applications. Custom applications addressed by the Company are
typically characterized by the opportunity to sell a significant quantity of
units over a period of time based on a single application solution.

     Continued Reduction in Product Costs and Time to Market. The Company has
taken advantage of its relationship with the other worldwide Kontron companies
by outsourcing the design and manufacturing of some of its products. This is
consistent with our strategy of maintaining rugged mobile design strength at the
architectural level, while utilizing intra-company resources to reduce costs and
add incremental expertise. This change has been well received by the Company's
customers and value-added resellers. Additionally, the Company continues to be
focused on further cost reductions through on-going product re-design
initiatives through Kontron worldwide mobile design teams.

                                       2
<PAGE>

     Products. The Company's products are rugged mobile computers designed and
manufactured for field applications including data acquisition, mobile data
communications and test and measurement. Part of the Company's growth strategy
is to introduce new products that will further penetrate existing markets as
well as penetrate new and growing markets. In 2001, the Company introduced four
new products, the EnVoy, Power Lite, 2000 Series III and the Field Lite.
Additional new products will replace older products and allow for growth through
2002.

     FieldWorks 8000 Series Platform: The FieldWorks 8000 Series is targeted at
the high end of the rugged field computing platform market and offers
significant expansion capability. Targeted at test and measurement, telemetry
and data acquisition applications, the FieldWorks 8000 Series is sold primarily
within field technology / military markets.

     The structure of the rugged, portable, FieldWorks 8000 Series is based on a
high-strength cast magnesium alloy external housing. Internal components that
are sensitive to shock and vibration are contained within this housing and
isolated with special tuned shock absorbing polymers, while a shock absorbing
bushing system suspends all drives and the CPU. The FieldWorks 8000 Series
incorporates the Company's backplane/card cage design, which provides up to six
ISA/PCI expansion card slots within the housing permitting the integration of
instrumentation, data acquisition, test and measurement and communications
capabilities. Also contained within the housing is a PCMCIA expansion card
reader, integrated AC/DC power supply, uninterruptable power supply capability,
full-length desktop ISA/PCI expansion card slots, integrated CD-ROM and floppy
diskette drives, and several optional features such as dual removable hard
drives, Sun-Light Readable display and XGA display options. The FieldWorks 8000
Series is the Company's flagship product.

     Power Lite: The Power Lite is similar to the FieldWorks 8000 Series, with
less rugged features and less expansion capability. The Power Lite is intended
for light industrial applications like manufacturing plant floors,
telecommunications test and in-plant data collection. The Power Lite offers a
single ISA/PCI expansion card capability with a 14.1" XGA display. It is ideally
suited for applications that display schematics and graphical information
databases.

     EnVoy Mobile Data Server (MDS): The EnVoy is a three-piece onboard vehicle
computer system that includes a Server component, a high-bright Display and a
backlit Keyboard. The EnVoy can be customized by adding wireless technology,
Global Positioning (GPS) technology, data radios and other devices through two
embedded PC card slots, USB ports and three open serial ports. The floppy and
CD-ROM devices can be connected to the Server by cables that can then be mounted
in a remote location such as the vehicle trunk. A wide variety of standard
vehicle mounting systems are available to meet specific customer needs. The
EnVoy is ideally suited for fixed in-vehicle computing and communication
applications including logistics management, computer-aided dispatch and
Geographic Information Systems/Global Positioning System mapping. The primary
market for Envoy is public services (Police, Fire, EMS and Utility) markets.

     FieldWorks 2000 Series Mobile Data Server (MDS): The FieldWorks 2000 Series
was developed for mission critical communication applications. The FieldWorks
2000 Series is the communication interface to deployed personnel in remote
locations in all types of vehicles. The Graphical Information System (GIS)
allows personnel to graphically and numerically identify precisely where they
are on a map and provide the same visual and data information for superiors in a
real-time secure basis. Real time reliable communication of logistical, mission
status, location and movement is paramount to the success of the application for
which this product was designed and is used.

     Field Lite: The Field Lite handheld computer provides users full PC
performance and connectivity in a small lightweight, rugged package. The Field
Lite is used by field communication personnel for sending and receiving secure
text messages, maps and collecting critical data. When connected to a GPS
receiver, the Field Lite can identify location points and communicate that
information wirelessly to assist in safe, expeditious navigation of mission
objectives. The Field Lite is used in a variety of logistical and data
collection applications where rugged, daylight readable and full PC technology
is required by users.

     The Field Lite and Power Lite are products of Kontron, and are marketed and
sold exclusively in North America by the Company. Both of these products began
shipping in the second quarter of 2001.

     Professional Services. The Company provides Professional Services along
with its products to gain a competitive advantage in the rugged mobile computing
market. Programs offered by the Company include consulting services relating to
product application, technical support, project management, product
implementation and troubleshooting on post-installation questions. The Company
provides a one-year warranty program including free telephone technical support
as well as warranty extensions and custom hardware and software service/support
offerings. The Company offers optional, advance exchange, replacement unit pools
for large volume customers to maximize performance. Software integration
services, including loading and testing of multiple software applications, can
be provided to relieve end users of the burden of installing software. On-site
product training and consultation services tailored to customer requirements can
also be provided.

                                       3

     Manufacturing. The Company initiated the outsourcing of some of its
manufacturing activities to Kontron subsidiaries during fiscal year 2001. This
has improved inventory management, reduced product and production costs, and
enhanced product quality. Further outsourcing within the Kontron group of
companies will occur as opportunities to reduce costs and improve product
quality are identified. The FieldWorks 8000 Series assembly, all platform repair
and final integration work continue to be performed at the Company. Parts for
the EnVoy MDS and the FieldWorks 2000 Series MDS are manufactured by Kontron in
Germany with final assembly performed at the Company. The Power Lite, Field Lite
and IN Rave are manufactured by Kontron in Germany.

     Quality Management. The Company employs comprehensive quality control
systems. The Company received ISO 9001 quality assurance certification in March
1996 and was re-certified in May 2001.

     Sales and Marketing / Customers. The Company's direct sales force focuses
its efforts on establishing and maintaining relationships with key and strategic
accounts. Specific territories have been assigned to the sales force located
throughout the United States. Other segments of the market are addressed by
sales through value-added resellers and systems integrators that typically sell
systems that have been configured for specific end-user applications through the
addition of hardware, software or services. Resellers and integrators generally
target large- to mid-size accounts, with the exception of military integrators,
or prime contractors, which target large military accounts. Additionally, the
Company sells platforms to the United States Government via the General Services
Administration (GSA) schedule.

     Since late 2000, the Company has been distributing its products in Europe,
Middle East and Africa (EMEA) through the Kontron direct sales channel. As of
midyear 2001, the Company has extended the direct sales channel to include Asia
by utilizing the sales staff of Kontron Asia, a subsidiary of Kontron Embedded
Computers AG, located in Taiwan. Sales in EMEA and Asia showed quarter over
quarter growth during 2001. See Note 10 to the Financial Statements attached
hereto for a breakdown of export sales by geographic location.

     For the year ended December 30, 2001, sales to the United States Army
represented 28% of net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2000, sales to
John Deere Information Systems represented 11% of net sales. For the year ended
January 2, 2000, sales to Ryder Transportation Services represented 26% of net
sales. The amount of revenue contributed by each product line is set forth under
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operation" below.

     Backlog. The Company believes that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of
its future business prospects due to the potentially long customer sales cycle
and significant variations in the size and delivery schedules of orders received
by the Company. As a result, the Company does not believe that backlog at any
particular date is necessarily indicative of future results.

     Competition. The Company's products face direct competition from companies
producing portable computers intended for field use such as Dolch Computer
Systems; Getac Corp.; Itronix Corp.; Paravant Computer Systems, Inc.; Motorola,
Inc.; Data 911, Litton Industries, Inc., and Panasonic Personal Computer
Company. The Company believes its primary competitive factors relate to product
design and feature differentiation, product pricing, functionality, product
dimensions and technology enhancements. The mobile computer market continues to
mature. To the extent the Company and its direct competitors expand and develop
this market niche, other manufacturers may turn their attention to this niche
and begin to develop products and services directly competitive with those
offered by the Company. The Company's computing platforms also face indirect
competition from a variety of different companies and products, including
consumer portable personal computers, customized portable personal computers and
single-purpose diagnostic and data collection instruments.

     Research and Development. In conjunction with Kontron engineering teams
from around the world, the Company designs mobile computer systems, subsystems
and application specific custom systems. The Company believes that its efforts
in this area have improved time to market and reduced development costs. The
Company intends to continue to expand its products and services by providing a
greater range of expandability and features in existing products. The Company
has successfully developed new products with the Kontron companies maximizing
the technological expertise within all companies. Through the use of these
resources, the Company has access to a wide variety of specialized and/or
lower-cost design talent, and gained new relationships with key technology
suppliers. The use of non-Kontron design contractors was significantly reduced
in 2001 resulting in reduced R&D costs. Research and development expenses were
$1.2 million in 2001, $4.2 million in 2000 and $3.4 million in 1999.

     Intellectual Property. The Company uses the following marks in connection
with its products: Field MousePad, Field Workstation, Technology Module, EnVoy,
Field Lite, Power Lite, IN Rave, Kontron and the Kontron Logo. FieldWorks,
Incorporated has federal trademark registrations with respect to Field MousePad,
Field WorkStation and Technology Module. These registrations are registered on

<PAGE>

registration, the registrant's ownership of the mark, or the registrant's
exclusive right to use the mark. In addition, the filing date of the application
does not confer any right of priority. The Company is aware that there are third
parties that have claimed and may claim superior rights, in certain territories
in the United States, to the use of certain of the marks in which the Company
claims rights. Kontron and Kontron Logo are registered trademarks of Kontron

Electronik GmbH has filed a federal trademark application with respect to the
Field Lite Mark. Power Lite and IN Rave are unregistered trademarks of Kontron
Electronik GmbH. Kontron Mobile Computing has full unconditional licenses to use
the Field Lite, Power Lite, IN Rave, Kontron and Kontron Logo trademarks in all
sales and marketing activities.

     Employees. As of December 30, 2001, the Company employed 47 full-time
employees and 1 part-time employee, of whom 20 were engaged primarily in
operations, 13 were engaged primarily in sales and marketing, 8 were engaged
primarily in engineering and research and development, and 7 were engaged
primarily in administration. The Company also employs temporary employees and
contract employees, as necessary. No employees are represented by any labor
union or other collective bargaining unit. The Company believes that its
relations with its employees are good.

     Assets. All of the Company's long-lived assets are located in the United
States.

ITEM 2. Description of Property

     The Company's main operations are conducted in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, at
a leased site of approximately 53,000 square feet. The lease term is November
1998 through November 2004. The Company has subleased two portions of the site:
12,422 square feet of office space has been subleased for the period of
September 1, 2000 to November 30, 2004 and 4,728 square feet of warehouse space
has been subleased with an original ending date of June 30, 2001 that has now
become month-to-month and is cancelable by either party with a 60-day notice.
The Company intends to continue to pursue potential subleasing of its facility,
as appropriate, to minimize operating expenses.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

     On April 28, 2000, the Company entered into an Engagement Agreement with
Goldsmith, Agio, Helms & Lynner, Ltd. ("GAH") to act as its agent to assist with
a merger, sale or similar transaction, for a minimum period of six months. The
Company cancelled the agreement with GAH after being approached by Kontron about
the transaction that eventually closed in December 2000. GAH pursued legal
proceedings against the Company and in September 2001, an arbitrator found that
the Company was required to pay damages of $792,000 to GAH. These costs have
been classified as "other expense" in the Company's 2001 and 2000 statements of
operations. For comparative purposes, payments made to GAH prior to the date of
the award by the arbitrator have been reclassified to reflect this change.

     The Company is involved in legal actions in the ordinary course of its
business. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of any such legal
actions, management believes that there is no pending legal proceeding against
or involving the Company for which the outcome is likely to have a material
adverse effect upon the Company's financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

ITEM 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

     There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the
Company's fourth quarter ended December 30, 2001.

ITEM 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters

     Market Trends. The demand for rugged mobile computers continues to expand
on a worldwide basis. The availability of high-powered portable computer
technology coupled with application specific technologies and the proliferation
of wireless communications contributes to the increased demand. The Company
expects increased requirements to improve the efficiency in field based work
forces and link field workers into corporate information systems.

     The Company targets markets requiring portable computing platforms that can
perform multiple functions including diagnostics, data acquisition and
electronic testing, communication and monitoring.

     Critical Accounting Policies. Financial Reporting Release (FRR) No. 60,
"Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies,"
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies
or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. The discussion and
analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are
based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of its financial statements. Actual results may
differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Note 2 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of the
significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the
Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

                                       7
<PAGE>

     Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of
significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially
different results under different assumptions and conditions. The accounting
policies which the Company believes are the most critical to aid in fully
understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue
recognition, inventories and warranties.

     Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC
     -------------------
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements"
(SAB 101), as amended by SAB 101A and 101B. SAB 101 requires that four basic
criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (3)
the fee is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured.
Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in
connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. Material
differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if
our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.

     The Company's revenue recognition policy is significant because the
Company's revenue is a key component of its results of operations. The Company
recognizes revenue upon shipment of its products. Accruals for sales returns and
other allowances are provided at the time of shipment based on experience.
Service revenue, including non-warranty work and related parts sales, is
recognized as earned. Extended warranty contracts are offered, generally as a
separately priced arrangement with the customer. Revenues related to extended
warranties are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the term
of the related agreements. The Company has concluded that its revenue
recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and SAB 101.

     Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value,
     -----------
as determined by the first-in, first-out cost method. New inventory monitoring
controls were put in place in 2001 to reduce the future write-downs of inventory
due to obsolescence and to better manage inventory due to the resumption of
in-house manufacturing. All inventory is now coded to reflect the product for
which it is primarily used, allowing the Company to better manage its inventory
and to assist in making bi-weekly forecast updates. This change has also allowed
for improved analysis of the Company's inventory reserve.

     The Company reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a
provision for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon
assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market
conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional
inventory write-downs may be required.

     Warranties. The Company warrants its products against defects in materials
     ----------
and workmanship under normal use and service for one year from the date of
purchase. Warranty costs for existing products, including parts and labor, are
estimated based on actual historical experience. Management uses that historical
data to accrue reserves to cover estimated costs based on units in the field.
Management reviews the estimated warranty liability on a quarterly basis to
determine its adequacy. While the Company's warranty costs have historically
been within its expectations and the provisions established, the Company cannot
guarantee that it will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or
repair costs it has in the past.

     While the Company engages in product quality programs and processes, the
Company's warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material
usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure.
Should actual failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ
from the Company's estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability
would be required.

     Related Party Transactions. The Company sells certain products to Kontron
and the Kontron group of companies for further resale outside North America.
These sales were approximately $1.3 million in 2001. The Company also buys
products from these related entities for further resale within North America.
These purchases were approximately $0.8 million in 2001. The Company and the
Kontron group of companies are operating under agreements regarding the sales
and purchases from each other. Such transactions are in the normal course of
business at negotiated prices comparable to similar transactions with other
customers and suppliers. Management believes the transactions with Kontron and
the Kontron group of companies are at arms length and are under terms no less
favorable to the Company than those with other customers or suppliers.

     Included in the financial statements are approximately $118,500 of related
party receivables and approximately $210,100 of related party payables as of
December 30, 2001.

     The Company has a credit line agreement with Kontron to provide up to 8.5
million Euros for operations ($7.7 million based on December 30, 2001 exchange
rate). Borrowings under this agreement bear interest at 11% per annum (payable
monthly), with no stated maturity date. Outstanding borrowings under this line
of credit were $6.9 million at December 30, 2001. Refer to the Liquidity and
Capital Resources section for further discussion.

after June 15, 2000. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 effective January 1, 2001.
SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every
derivative instrument, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts, be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or
liability measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the
derivative's fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific
hedge accounting criteria are met and requires that a company must formally
document, designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive
hedge accounting. SFAS No. 133 did not have a material impact on the Company's
financial position or results of operations at adoption; see discussion below
regarding foreign currency forward contracts utilized later in 2001.

COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2001 AND DECEMBER 31, 2000

     Net Sales. Net sales for 2001 were $17.3 million, an increase of $1.6
million or 10% from fiscal year 2000 net sales of $15.7 million. The increase
was primarily attributable to a large order from the United States Army for the
2000 Series Embedded Vehicle Server that shipped in the first two quarters of
2001.

     Unit volumes of the 8000 Series represented 45% of total units in 2001
compared to 34% in fiscal year 2000. Production of the 8000 Series began in
fiscal year 2000, therefore the increase in sales in 2001 was attributable to
only a partial year's production in fiscal year 2000. Sales of the 2000 Series
Mobile Data Server represented 34% of total units in 2001 compared to 30% in
fiscal year 2000. The increase in sales was attributable to the large United
States Army order. Unit volumes of the EnVoy product represented 13% in 2001.
Production of the EnVoy product began in 2001 and, therefore, there were no
comparable sales in fiscal year 2000. Unit volumes of the 5000 Series decreased
to 6% of total unit sales in 2001 from 24% in fiscal year 2000. The decrease in
sales was attributable to the discontinuation of the 5000 Series product that
began in fiscal year 2000.

     Sales by product line were as follows:

- ----------
(1)  The 8000 Series product was introduced in fiscal year 2000.
(2)  The EnVoy product was introduced in 2001.
(3)  The Field Lite, IN Rave and Power Lite are Kontron products. The Company
     began marketing these products in 2001.
(4)  The 7000 Series product was discontinued and replaced with the 8000 Series
     product in fiscal year 2000.
(5)  The 5000 Series product was discontinued in 2001.

     International sales increased to $2.4 million, or 14% of sales in 2001 from
$2.3 million, or 15% of net sales in fiscal year 2000. The majority of
international sales are in Europe, including $1.9 million in 2001 and $1.5
million in fiscal year 2000. The Company believes that international sales as a
percentage of net sales for the year 2002 will be in the mid-teen to 20% range
with little impact on the Company's results of operations and liquidity.

     Gross Margin. Gross margin (deficit) increased to $7.8 million in 2001 from
$(1.7) million in fiscal year 2000. Gross margins, as a percentage of net sales,
increased to 45% in 2001 as compared to (11)% in fiscal year 2000. The 2001
gross margin was positively impacted by increased average selling prices,
reduced direct material costs due to outsourcing within the Kontron group and
improved management of inventory. The fiscal year 2000 gross margin was
significantly impacted by $3.1 million of inventory write-downs which resulted
from product line close-outs, changes in outsourcing arrangements and other
technological and market developments. Excluding the $3.1 million of
write-downs, the gross margin in fiscal year 2000 would have been $1.4 million
and 9.0% of net sales. The Company's gross margin will fluctuate as a result of
a number of factors, including mix of products sold, inventory obsolescence, the
proportion of international sales, large customer contracts (with the associated
volume discounts) and other manufacturing expenses.

                                       9

     Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses include salaries,
incentive compensation, commissions, travel, trade shows, technical support and
professional services personnel and general advertising and promotion. These
expenses also include the labor and material costs related to maintaining the
Company's standard one-year warranty program. Sales and marketing expenses were
$2.7 million in 2001, a decrease of $1.7 million as compared to $4.4 million in
fiscal year 2000. As a percentage of net sales, sales and marketing expenses
decreased to 16% in 2001 as compared to 28% in fiscal year 2000. The decrease in
expenses was primarily due to a workforce reduction in fiscal year 2000. The
Company anticipates growth of sales and marketing expenses to be less than the
growth of sales in the future.

     General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include the
Company's executive, finance, information services and human resources
departments. These expenses decreased to $1.7 million in 2001 compared to $3.9
million in fiscal year 2000. As a percentage of net sales, general and
administrative expenses decreased to 10% in 2001 compared to 25% in fiscal year
2000. The decrease is due to the management workforce reduction that occurred in
August 2000, in addition to a reduction in consulting fees. The Company
anticipates growth of general and administrative expenses to be less than the
growth of sales in the future.

     Research and Development. Research and development expenses are incurred in
the design, development and testing of new or enhanced products, services and
customized computing platforms. All research and development costs are expensed
as incurred. These expenses decreased to $1.2 million in 2001 from $4.2 million
in fiscal year 2000. As a percentage of net sales, research and development
expenses decreased to 7% in 2001 from 27% in fiscal year 2000. The decrease is
due to sharing research and development costs with Kontron and the synergy
gained by the combined efforts, in addition to a workforce reduction in fiscal
year 2000. The Company anticipates growth of research and development expenses
to be less than the growth of sales in the future.

     Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs were $0.5 million, or 3% of net
sales in fiscal year 2000. These costs were primarily severance charges due to
changes in the Company's management team at the time of the Kontron investment.

     Gain on Currency Conversion. The Company's credit agreements with Kontron
allow for borrowings which are payable in Euros.

     In the second quarter of 2001, the Company began utilizing foreign currency
forward contracts to protect against significant fluctuations in net income
(loss) caused by changes in Euro exchange rates. The Company's practice is to
enter into a forward contract at the beginning of each quarter and settle the
contract at the end of the quarter. The Company records gains and losses on
these derivative contracts (which are not designated as hedging instruments for
accounting purposes) in net income (loss) in accordance with the requirements of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Derivatives and
Hedging Activities," and also marks the related debt instrument to market under
SFAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation." These gain (loss) amounts are
included in the net foreign currency gain of $207,664 recorded in 2001. As of
December 30, 2001, the Company's forward contract arrangements allowed the
Company to hedge up to 8.0 million Euros.

     Interest Income (Expense), Net. Net interest expense of $1.3 million was
recorded in 2001 compared to $1.7 million in fiscal year 2000. The decrease in
interest expense is due to the repayment of the subordinated notes in September
2001. Additionally, financing costs of $882,000 related to warrants issued in
September 1999 were amortized over the two-year term of the subordinated notes.
The Company anticipates net interest expense will decrease in 2002 due to the
repayment of the subordinated notes. In addition, the Company anticipates a
reduction in interest expense in 2002 as a result of the planned repayment of
its borrowings from Kontron.

     Other Income (Expense), Net. Other expense of approximately $119,700 was
recorded in 2001 compared to approximately $641,900 in fiscal year 2000. The
majority of the costs are related to the payments that were required to be made
to GAH.

COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND JANUARY 2, 2000

     Net Sales. Net sales for fiscal year 2000 were $15.7 million, a decrease of
$9.6 million or 38% from 1999 net sales of $25.3 million. The decrease in sales
was primarily attributable to the delay of the introduction of the 8000 Series
Workstation as a result of development and testing delays. Unit volumes of the
5000 Series decreased to 24% of total unit sales in fiscal year 2000 from 42% in
1999. The decrease in sales was attributable to no large customer orders in
fiscal year 2000, compared to the large order from Ryder Transportation Services
in 1999. Sales of the 2000 Series Mobile Data Server represented 30% of total
units in fiscal year 2000. Production of the 2000 Series began in mid-1999 so
data is not comparable. Unit volumes of the 8000 Series represented 34% of total
units in fiscal year 2000. Production of the 8000 Series began in mid-fiscal
year 2000 and, therefore,

                                       10
<PAGE>

there were no comparable sales in 1999. Unit volumes of the 7000 Series
decreased to 12% in fiscal year 2000 from 39% in 1999 due to the replacement of
the 7000 Series product with the 8000 Series product.

     Sales by product line were as follows:

(1)  The 7000 Series product was discontinued and replaced with the 8000 Series
     product in fiscal year 2000.
(2)  The 5000 Series product was discontinued in 2001.
(3)  The 2000 Series product was introduced in 1998.
(4)  The 8000 Series product was introduced in fiscal year 2000.

     International sales decreased to $2.3 million, or 15% of sales in fiscal
year 2000 from $3.7 million, or 14% of net sales in 1999. The reduction was due
to the delayed introduction of the 8000 Series Workstation. The majority of
international sales are in Europe, including $1.5 million in fiscal year 2000
and $2.8 million in 1999.

     Gross Margin. Gross margin (deficit) decreased to $(1.7) million in fiscal
year 2000 from $7.4 million in 1999. Gross margins, as a percentage of net
sales, decreased to (11)% in fiscal year 2000 as compared to 29% in 1999. Gross
margin was significantly impacted by $3.1 million of write-downs which resulted
from product line close-outs, changes in outsourcing arrangements and other
technological and market developments. Without the $3.1 million of write-downs,
gross margin in fiscal year 2000 would have been $1.4 million and 9.0% of net
sales.

     The Company outsourced certain manufacturing activities during the first
quarter of fiscal year 2000.

     Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses include salaries,
incentive compensation, commissions, travel, trade shows, technical support and
professional services personnel and general advertising and promotion. These
expenses also include the labor and material costs related to maintaining the
Company's standard one-year warranty program. Sales and marketing expenses were
$4.4 million in fiscal year 2000, a decrease of $1.2 million as compared to $5.6
million in 1999. As a percentage of net sales, sales and marketing expenses
increased to 28% in fiscal year 2000 as compared to 22% in 1999. The decrease in
expenses was primarily due to reductions in advertising, promotions and trade
show expenditures as well as a reduction in commissions and incentive
compensation due to the reduction in sales.

     General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include the
Company's executive, finance, information services and human resources
departments. These expenses increased to $3.9 million in fiscal year 2000
compared to $3.0 million in 1999. As a percentage of net sales, general and
administrative expenses increased to 25% in fiscal year 2000 compared to 12% in
1999. The increase is primarily due to fees associated with the management
services agreement related to the investment by IWHC, and recruitment expenses
due to changes in the management team during the first half of the year.

     Research and Development. Research and development expenses are incurred in
the design, development and testing of new or enhanced products, services and
customized computing platforms. All research and development costs are expensed
as incurred. These expenses increased to $4.2 million in fiscal year 2000 from
$3.4 million in 1999. As a percentage of net sales, research and development
expenses increased to 27% in fiscal year 2000 from 13% in 1999. The increase was
primarily due to the development of the 8000 Series Workstation, and re-design
effort on the Series 2000 and Series 5000 workstations.

     Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs were $0.5 million in fiscal year
2000, or 3% of net sales, as compared to $0.4 million, or 2% of net sales in
1999. In fiscal year 2000, these costs were primarily severance charges due to
changes in the Company's management team at the time of the Kontron investment.
In 1999, these costs were due to severance charges from reorganization efforts
related to outsourcing the manufacturing and design of products.

     Interest Expense and Other, Net. Net interest and other expense of $2.4
million was recorded in fiscal year 2000 as compared to $314,000 in 1999. The
increase in interest expense is due to borrowings on the Company's line of
credit, interest payments on its subordinated notes, interest payments to
Kontron for the operational cash credit line and payments made to GAH under the
legal proceeding described in Item 3. In addition, financing costs of $882,000
related to warrants issued in September

                                       11
<PAGE>

1999 are being amortized over the two-year term of the subordinated notes.
Financing costs of $437,500 related to warrants issued to Kontron in June 2000
were amortized from July 2000 through December 2000, the time of the closing of
the Kontron equity investment.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     The relationship with Kontron has brought new resources, products, capital
and a global sales force. During 2001, the Company began integrating global
distribution channels, augmenting go-to-market strategies and reinventing
product development and positioning plans. The Company's 2001 focus was to
stabilize and reach profitability by reducing overhead and operating costs,
increasing the average selling price on products and reducing product direct
material costs.

     In 2001, the Company had a positive cash flow from operations of $622,641,
the first positive operating cash flow in the Company's history, compared to
negative cash flows from operations of $11,025,746 and $5,168,905 in fiscal
years 2000 and 1999, respectively. While the Company achieved profitability in
three of the four quarters in 2001, the Company realizes that continuous
management of sales, gross margin and cash is necessary to improve liquidity.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in achieving these
measures and increasing its liquidity. Circumstances that are reasonably likely
to affect liquidity include changes in technology, dependence on key customers,
decrease in demand for the Company's products and reliance on Kontron for
financing and research and development support.

     The Company intends to fund its own cash needs in 2002 without assistance
from Kontron. To be successful, the Company will focus on increased sales and
profitability, in addition to improved working capital management. The Company
has finalized a line of credit with an existing bank and if necessary, intends
to use this line of credit to fund potential cash requirements in excess of its
current cash flow projection.

     On January 29, 2002, Kontron agreed to provide financial support to enable
the Company to meet its cash flow needs and obligations as and when they become
due through December 31, 2002. On September 28, 2000 (revised November 9, 2000),
the Company entered into credit line agreements with Kontron to provide up to $5
million of cash for operations. Borrowings under these agreements bear interest
at 11% per annum (payable monthly), and were due on December 15, 2000. The
agreement was revised on December 16, 2000 for Kontron to provide up to DM 10
million and further revised on April 1, 2001 to provide up to DM 14 million for
operations. On September 1, 2001 and December 28, 2001, the agreement was
revised to provide up to 8.5 million Euros for operations ($7.7 million based on
December 30, 2001 exchange rate). Borrowings under this agreement bear interest
at 11% per annum (payable monthly), with no stated maturity date. Outstanding
borrowings under this line of credit were $6.9 million at December 30, 2001.

     The operating line with Kontron increased $3.9 million in 2001, mostly
early in the year, to fund increased inventory purchases for large sales in the
first and second quarters. As the year progressed, the Company was able to fund
its own operations, including the $3 million payoff of subordinated notes in
September 2001, without borrowing the equivalent additional funds from Kontron.
The Company also anticipates partial repayment of the operating line borrowings
with Kontron in 2002.

     On June 29, 2000, the Company entered into a Purchase and Option Agreement
with FWRKS Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Kontron Embedded
Computers AG. The agreement was amended on August 16, 2000. Under the amended
agreement, Kontron acquired 6 million shares of common stock of the Company for
a purchase price of $5.4 million. In addition, the option Kontron previously
granted to Industrial-Works Holding Co., LLC, (IWHC), a wholly owned subsidiary
of Glenmount International was amended. As amended, IWHC was granted an option
to acquire 62,000 shares of Kontron in exchange for preferred shares of the
Company that were convertible into 3.4 million shares of the Company common
stock. Both of these matters were approved at a special shareholders meeting
held on October 18, 2000 and adjourned to October 27, 2000 and the transactions
were closed in December 2000.

     In addition, the Company received $2.5 million from FWRKS Acquisition Corp.
on June 30, 2000 in the form of a subordinated note bearing interest at 11% per
annum with an original maturity date of September 2001. FWRKS Acquisition Corp.
also received warrants to purchase 1.25 million shares of common stock
exercisable at $1.00 per share. The warrants were exercisable until November 15,
2000, and were recorded at their estimated fair value of $437,500 at the date of
issuance. These warrants were cancelled and the subordinated notes were forgiven
under the terms of the amended agreement described above.

     On March 31, 2000, the Company issued 500,000 shares of the Company's
Series C Convertible Preferred Stock to IWHC. The Company recorded a $250,000
charge relating to the beneficial conversion feature associated with this
preferred stock. The Company issued a warrant to IWHC to purchase 100,000 shares
of common stock with an exercise price of $2.00 per share in connection with
this transaction. Subsequent to March 31, 2000, the conversion rate was adjusted
to such that the holders have the

                                       12
<PAGE>

right to receive a total of 1,041,666 shares of common stock upon conversion of
the Series C Convertible Participating Preferred Stock. In connection with this
conversion rate adjustment, an additional beneficial conversion feature of
$270,833 was recorded.

     On February 22, 2000, the Company completed a $4.25 million equity
investment by IWHC. In exchange for the $4.25 million investment, the Company
issued 4,250,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (each share of
which was initially convertible into one share of Common Stock). Subsequent to
February 22, 2000, the conversion rate was adjusted to such that the holders
have the right to receive a total of 4,427,083 shares of common stock upon
conversion of the Series B Convertible Participating Preferred Stock. IWHC
received 500,000 warrants exercisable at $1.00 per share. The Company used the
net proceeds for market expansion and new product development as well as for
working capital and general corporate purposes. In December 2000, IWHC tendered
all of its shares of Series B and Series C Convertible Preferred Stock to
Kontron in exchange for shares of Kontron Common Stock.

     In September 1999, the Company completed a private placement of $3.0
million in 11% subordinated notes. The notes were repaid at the September 2001
maturity date. Noteholders also received warrants to purchase 1.5 million shares
of common stock exercisable at $1.00 per share. The warrants are exercisable for
five years, and were recorded at their estimated fair value of $882,000 at the
date of issuance.

     The Company's cash balance as of December 30, 2001 was $2.1 million as
compared to the December 31, 2000 balance of $0.6 million and the January 2,
2000 balance of $0.1 million. This change from 2001 to fiscal year 2000 was due
to cash provided by operations. Cash provided by operating activities totaled
$0.6 million in 2001, compared to cash used for operating activities of $11.0
million in fiscal year 2000 and $5.2 million in 1999. The Company's accounts
receivable was $3.0 million at December 30, 2001, $3.1 million at December 31,
2000 and $5.1 million at January 2, 2000. Net inventories decreased to $1.2
million at December 30, 2001 from $2.5 million at December 31, 2000 and $4.5
million at January 2, 2000. This change from 2001 to fiscal year 2000 was due to
purchases for anticipated sales on the United States Army order that shipped in
early 2001. Deferred revenue was $1.3 million at December 30, 2001, $0.7 million
at December 31, 2000 and $1.0 million at January 2, 2000. The change from 2001
to fiscal year 2000 was attributable to increased sales of extended warranties.
Accounts payable was $1.3 million at December 30, 2001, $3.2 million at December
31, 2000 and $3.8 million at January 2, 2000. Fiscal year 2000 and 1999 balances
were high due to purchasing inventory for customer orders in the fourth quarter
for anticipated sales in the first quarter with no comparable orders for sales
in the first quarter of 2002. Other accrued liabilities decreased to $0.8
million at December 30, 2001 from $1.8 million at December 31, 2000 and $0.5
million at January 2, 2000. The change from 2001 to fiscal year 2000 was due to
a $1.2 million liability in fiscal year 2000 with one of the Company's
outsourced partners to buy back Series 5000 parts as part of the product
discontinuance.

     The Company purchased approximately $24,000 of property, plant and
equipment in 2001 as compared to $0.3 million in fiscal year 2000 and $0.6
million in 1999. The Company anticipates purchases of property, plant and
equipment in 2002 will remain consistent with 2001.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

     As of December 30, 2001 the Company had $6.9 million outstanding on its
line of credit from Kontron. This loan bears interest at 11% per annum, payable
monthly. Both the principal amount borrowed under the line of credit and
interest payable thereunder are payable in Euros. See the earlier discussion
under "Foreign Currency Transactions" for a description of the foreign currency
forward contract in effect. All remaining transactions of the Company are
conducted and accounts are denominated in United States dollars. Based on its
overall foreign currency rate exposure at December 30, 2001, the Company does
not believe that a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates would
materially adversely affect its financial position or results of operations.

     The Company has no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity
instruments in its cash and cash equivalents. The Company had $2.1 million in
cash and cash equivalents at December 30, 2001. Based on analysis, shifts in
money market rates would have an immaterial impact on the Company.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   Nature of Business

     Operating Activities. Kontron Mobile Computing, Inc. ("Kontron Mobile
Computing" or "the Company"), was incorporated in Minnesota in 1992 under its
former name of FieldWorks, Incorporated and is dedicated to the development and
sale of rugged portable computing solutions. The Company's computer platforms
are designed for demanding field environments, meeting military standards for
shock, vibration, moisture and temperature extremes. The Company's products have
been designed with a modular system configuration that allows expansion paths
including desktop-like ISA/PCI computer card expansion slots, PC card slots,
serial ports, universal serial bus and custom modules. As a result, all
platforms are flexible "electronic toolboxes" that integrate the user's
application-specific tools and technologies into one custom, rugged mobile
solution.

     Kontron Mobile Computing's focus is providing workstations data
acquisition, mobile data communications and test and measurement applications in
its targeted vertical markets. The Company provides professional services
including consulting services relating to product application, technical
support, project management, product implementation and troubleshooting on
post-installation questions. Software integration services, including loading
and testing of multiple software applications, can be provided to relieve end
users of the burden of installing software. On-site product training and
consultation services tailored to customer requirements can also be provided.

     Kontron Embedded Computers AG Equity Investment. On June 29, 2000, the
Company entered into a Purchase and Option Agreement with FWRKS Acquisition
Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Kontron Embedded Computers AG (Kontron). The
agreement was amended on August 16, 2000. Under the amended agreement, Kontron
acquired 6 million shares of common stock of the Company for a purchase price of
$5.4 million. In addition, the option Kontron previously granted to
Industrial-Works Holding Co., LLC, (IWHC), a wholly owned subsidiary of
Glenmount International was amended. As amended, IWHC was granted an option to
acquire 62,000 shares of Kontron in exchange for preferred shares of the Company
that were convertible into 3.4 million shares of the Company common stock. Both
of these matters were approved at a special shareholders meeting held on October
18, 2000 and adjourned to October 27, 2000 and the transactions were closed in
December 2000. As a result, Kontron and its affiliates control approximately 65%
of Kontron Mobile Computing through 7,694,492 shares of common stock and
4,750,000 shares of Series B and C Preferred Convertible Stock convertible into
5,468,750 shares of common stock of Kontron Mobile Computing.

     Significant Risks and Uncertainties. The relationship with Kontron has
brought new resources, products, capital and a global sales force. During 2001,
the Company began integrating global distribution channels, augmenting
go-to-market strategies and reinventing product development and positioning
plans. The Company's 2001 focus was to stabilize and reach profitability by
reducing overhead and operating costs, increasing the average selling price on
products and reducing product direct material costs.

     In 2001, the Company had a positive cash flow from operations of $622,641,
the first positive operating cash flow in the Company's history, compared to
negative cash flows from operations of $11,025,746 and $5,168,905 in fiscal
years 2000 and 1999, respectively. While the Company achieved profitability in
three of the four quarters in 2001, the Company realizes that continuous
management of sales, gross margin and cash is necessary to improve liquidity.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in achieving these
measures and increasing its liquidity. Circumstances that are reasonably likely
to affect liquidity include changes in technology, dependence on key customers,
decrease in demand for the Company's products and reliance on Kontron for
financing and research and development support.

     The Company intends to fund its own cash needs in 2002 without assistance
from Kontron. To be successful, the Company will focus on increased sales and
profitability, in addition to improved working capital management. The Company
has finalized a line of credit with an existing bank and if necessary, intends
to use this line of credit to fund potential cash requirements in excess of its
current cash flow projection.

     On January 29, 2002, Kontron agreed to provide financial support to enable
the Company to meet its cash flow needs and obligations as and when they become
due through December 31, 2002. On September 28, 2000 (revised November 9, 2000),
the Company entered into credit line agreements with Kontron to provide up to $5
million of cash for operations. Borrowings under these agreements bear interest
at 11% per annum (payable monthly), and were due on December 15, 2000. The
agreement was revised on December 16, 2000 for Kontron to provide up to DM 10
million and further revised on April 1, 2001 to provide up to DM 14 million for
operations. On September 1, 2001 and December 28, 2001, the agreement was
revised to provide up to 8.5 million Euros for operations ($7.7 million based on
December 30, 2001 exchange rate.) Borrowings under this agreement bear interest
at 11% per annum (payable monthly), with no stated maturity date. Outstanding
borrowings under this line of credit were $6.9 million at December 30, 2001.

2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

     Fiscal Year. Fiscal years end on the Sunday closest to December 31st. All
references herein to "2001", "2000" and "1999" represent the fiscal years ended
December 30, 2001, December 31, 2000 and January 2, 2000 respectively, each of
which were 52 week years.

     In 2002, the Company will change to a fiscal year ending on December 31.
The Company believes that this change will not significantly affect the
comparability of the financial statements.

     Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is
computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the fiscal year. Diluted earnings (loss) per
share is computed under the treasury stock method and is calculated to compute
the dilutive effect of potential common shares.

     A reconciliation of these amounts is as follows:

</TABLE>

     Potential common shares of 10,212,604, 10,473,854 and 9,557,603 related to
options, warrants and convertible preferred stock were excluded from the
computation of diluted loss per share for 2001, 2000 and 1999 as inclusion of
these shares would have been antidilutive.

     Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts
held in the Company's checking accounts and money market funds with original
maturities of 90 days or less. The carrying value of these instruments
approximates fair value.

     Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value,
as determined by the first-in, first-out cost method.

     The components of inventories were:

                                           December 30, 2001   December 31, 2000

                                              ===========         ===========

     Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Repair
and maintenance costs which do not significantly extend the lives of the
respective assets are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the related assets' useful lives, ranging from two to
seven years.

     Warranties. The Company warrants its products against defects in materials
and workmanship under normal use and service for one year from the date of
purchase. Warranty costs for existing products, including parts and labor, are
estimated based on actual historical experience. Management uses that historical
data to accrue reserves to cover estimated costs based on units in the field.
Management reviews the estimated warranty liability on a quarterly basis to
determine its adequacy.

     Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes sales upon shipment of its
products. Accruals for sales returns and other allowances are provided at the
time of shipment based on experience. Service revenue, including non-warranty
work and related parts sales, is recognized as earned. Extended warranty
contracts are offered, generally as a separately priced arrangement with the
customer. Revenues related to extended warranties are recorded as deferred
revenue and recognized ratably over the term of the related agreements.

     Significant Customers. Sales to the United States Army represented 28% of
net sales in 2001. Sales to John Deere Information Systems represented 11% of
net sales in fiscal year 2000. Sales to Ryder Transportation Services
represented 26% of net sales in 1999.

                                       25
<PAGE>

     Research and Development. Research and development costs are charged to
expense as incurred.

     Concentrations of Credit Risk. At December 30, 2001, there was not a
significant portion of outstanding receivables attributable to any one customer.
The Company's exposure to concentrations of credit risk relates primarily to
trade receivables. This exposure is limited due to the large number of customers
and their dispersion across several vertical markets and geographies. The
Company controls potential credit risk by performing credit evaluations for all
customers and requires letters of credit, bank guarantees and advance payments,
if deemed necessary.

     Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as
of the date of the financial statements. Estimates also affect the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Estimates are
used for such items as allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves,
useful lives of property and equipment and warranty costs. Ultimate results
could differ from those estimates.

     Accounting Pronouncements. SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities", became effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2000. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 effective January 1, 2001.
SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every
derivative instrument, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts, be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or
liability measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the
derivative's fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific
hedge accounting criteria are met and requires that a company must formally
document, designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive
hedge accounting. SFAS No. 133 did not have a material impact on the Company's
financial position or results of operations at adoption; see discussion below
regarding foreign currency forward contracts utilized later in 2001.

     Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements" was issued in December 1999 and provides further guidance on the
recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company adopted SAB No.
101 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000, as required. The adoption did not
have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

     Foreign Currency Transactions. As described in Note 5, the Company's credit
agreements with Kontron allow for borrowings which are payable in Euros.

     In the second quarter of 2001, the Company began utilizing foreign currency
forward contracts to protect against significant fluctuations in net income
(loss) caused by changes in Euro exchange rates. The Company's practice is to
enter into a forward contract at the beginning of each quarter and settle the
contract at the end of the quarter. The Company records gains and losses on
these derivative contracts (which are not designated as hedging instruments for
accounting purposes) in net income (loss) in accordance with the requirements of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Derivatives and
Hedging Activities," and also marks the related debt instrument to market under
SFAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation." These gain (loss) amounts are
included in the net foreign currency gain of $207,664 recorded in 2001. As of
December 30, 2001, the Company's forward contract arrangements allowed the
Company to hedge up to 8.0 million Euros.

     Related Party Transactions. The Company sells certain products to Kontron
and the Kontron group of companies for further resale outside North America.
These sales were approximately $1.3 million in 2001. The Company also buys
products from these related entities for further resale within North America.
These purchases were approximately $0.8 million in 2001. The Company and the
Kontron group of companies are operating under agreements regarding the sales
and purchases from each other. Such transactions are in the normal course of
business at negotiated prices comparable to similar transactions with other
customers and suppliers. Management believes the transactions with Kontron and
the Kontron group of companies are at arms length and are under terms no less
favorable to the Company than those with other customers or suppliers.

     Included in the financial statements are approximately $118,500 of related
party receivables and approximately $210,100 of related party payables as of
December 30, 2001.

3.   Restructuring Costs

     During fiscal year 2000, the Company announced certain organizational
restructuring changes related to the Kontron transaction. The management
reorganization was designed to reduce ongoing administrative and operating
expenses, and further streamline the organization in preparation for Kontron's
increased involvement with the Company. During 1999, the Company

                                       26
<PAGE>

incurred restructuring costs due to severance charges from reorganization
efforts related to outsourcing certain aspects of the manufacturing and design
of products.

     The reserves remaining at December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000 were $0
and $44,300, respectively.

4.   Income Taxes

     The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, which
requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future income tax consequences under enacted tax laws of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities.

     A reconciliation of the Company's statutory tax rate to the effective rate
is as follows:

                                                      2001      2000      1999

Valuation allowance ..............................     (38)%     (38)%     (38)%
                                                       ---       ---       ---
     Total .......................................      --%       --%       --%

     As of December 30, 2001, the Company had approximately $29 million of net
operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes that are available
to offset future taxable income through the year 2021. These carryforwards will
be subject to an annual limitation as a result of a deemed change in ownership
under the tax regulations at the time of the Kontron transaction in December
2000.

     The components of the Company's deferred tax asset are as follows:

5.   Line of Credit and Subordinated Notes Payable

     Kontron Embedded Computers AG Line of Credit. On January 29, 2002, Kontron
agreed to provide financial support to enable the Company to meet its cash flow
needs and obligations as and when they become due through the period ending
December 31, 2002. On September 28, 2000 (revised November 9, 2000), the Company
entered into credit line agreements with Kontron to provide up to $5 million of
cash for operations. Borrowings under these agreements bear interest at 11% per
annum (payable monthly), and were due on December 15, 2000. The agreement was
revised on December 16, 2000 for Kontron to provide up to DM 10 million and
further revised on April 1, 2001 to provide up to DM 14 million for operations.
On September 1, 2001 and December 28, 2001, the agreement was revised to provide
up to 8.5 million Euros for operations ($7.7 million based on December 30, 2001
exchange rate.) Borrowings under this agreement bear interest at 11% per annum
(payable monthly), with no stated maturity date. Outstanding borrowings under
this line of credit were $6.9 million at December 30, 2001.

     Subordinated Notes Payable. In September 1999, the Company completed a
private placement of $3.0 million in 11% subordinated notes. The notes were
repaid at the September 2001 maturity date. Noteholders also received warrants
to purchase 1.5 million shares of common stock exercisable at $1.00 per share.
The warrants are exercisable for five years, and were recorded at their
estimated fair value of $882,000 at the date of issuance.

6.   Shareholders' Equity

     On June 30, 2000, the Company issued warrants to purchase 1.25 million
shares of common stock to FWRKS Acquisition Corp., (a wholly owned subsidiary of
Kontron), exercisable at $1.00 per share. The warrants were exercisable until
November 15, 2000, and were recorded at their estimated fair value of $437,500
at the date of issuance. These warrants were cancelled upon closing of the
Kontron investment. See Note 1 for additional discussion.

     Warrants to purchase 2,852,405 shares of the Company's common stock were
outstanding at December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000. The warrants are
exercisable at various times through February 2007 at prices ranging from $1.00
to $7.80.

     On March 31, 2000, the Company issued 500,000 shares of Series C
Convertible Preferred Stock to IWHC. The Company recorded a $250,000 charge
relating to the beneficial conversion feature associated with this preferred
stock. The Company issued a warrant to IWHC to purchase 100,000 shares of common
stock with an exercise price of $2.00 per share in connection with this
transaction. Subsequent to March 31, 2000, the conversion rate was adjusted to
such that the holders have the right to receive a total of 1,041,666 shares of
common stock upon conversion of the Series C Convertible Participating Preferred
Stock. In connection with this conversion rate adjustment, an additional
beneficial conversion feature of $270,833 was recorded.

     On February 22, 2000, the Company completed a $4.25 million equity
investment by IWHC. In exchange for the $4.25 million investment, the Company
issued 4,250,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (each share of
which was initially convertible into one share of Common Stock). Subsequent to
February 22, 2000, the conversion rate was adjusted to such that the holders
have the right to receive a total of 4,427,083 shares of common stock upon
conversion of the Series B Convertible Participating Preferred Stock. IWHC
received 500,000 warrants exercisable at $1.00 per share. The Company used the
net proceeds for market expansion and new product development as well as for
working capital and general corporate purposes. In December 2000, IWHC tendered
all of its shares of Series B and Series C Convertible Preferred Stock to
Kontron for shares of Kontron Common Stock.

     In the event of liquidation of the Company, the liquidation preference
would first be to shareholders of Series B Convertible Participating Preferred
Stock, followed by shareholders of Series C Convertible Participating Preferred
Stock, followed by shareholders of Common Stock. Voting rights of both the
Series B and Series C Convertible Participating Stock are equal to that of the
Common Stock shareholders, on an as if converted basis.

7.   Stock Option and 401(k) Plans

     Stock Option Plan. The Company has a Long-Term Incentive and Stock Option
Plan (the Plan). Under the Plan, options are granted at an exercise price equal
to the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant. Incentive
stock options are granted to employees, and vest over varying periods not to
exceed ten years. The Plan is authorized to issue up to 2,500,000 shares of
common stock for such options. At December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000,
610,127 and 313,877 shares were available for future grants.

     The Company also has a Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan (the
Directors' Plan). Under the Directors' Plan, each non-employee director receives
25,000 nonqualified options upon election and 10,000 options at each reelection
date. At December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, 137,500 and 231,000 shares
were available for future grants.

     On August 4, 1999, the Board of Directors approved the repricing of all
outstanding incentive stock options for non-director employees with an exercise
price greater than $1.25. The new exercise price of such options is $1.25, an
amount greater than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on that
date. A total of 819,050 options with exercise prices of $1.53 to $6.40 were
cancelled and reissued under the terms described above. The Company is required
to account for these repriced options under variable plan accounting. No
compensation charge was recognized in 2001, 2000 or 1999, as the market value of
the Company's common stock was less than the exercise price for these options.

     The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees," and related Interpretations in accounting for
its stock option plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized in
the accompanying statements of operations. Had compensation cost been recognized
based on the fair values of options at the grant dates consistent with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," the
Company's net income (loss) and net income (loss) per common share would have
been increased to the following pro forma amounts:

                                           2001         2000           1999

     401(k) Profit-Sharing Plan. The Company has a 401(k) profit-sharing plan
(the 401(k) Plan) covering substantially all employees. Eligible employees may
elect to defer up to 15% of their eligible compensation. The Company accrues
matching contributions of 50% on the first 4% of each plan participant's
eligible contributions. The Company's matching contributions were $40,500,
$51,600 and $83,100 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

8.   Commitments and Contingencies

     Leases. The Company leases its current headquarters office facilities under
an operating lease which expires November 30, 2004. The Company has subleased
two portions of the site: 12,422 square feet of office space has been subleased
for the period of September 1, 2000 to November 30, 2004 and 4,728 square feet
of warehouse space has been subleased with an original ending date of June 30,
2001 that has now become month-to-month and is cancelable by either party with a
60-day notice. Total rental payments to be received over the term of the
non-cancelable sublease agreement will be $742,000. The Company subleased its
previous office facilities under an operating lease that expired in June 1999.
Rent expense associated with operating leases was $496,600, $485,400 and
$469,700 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company does not have any
capital leases as of December 30, 2001.

     The following is a schedule of future minimum operating lease payments as
of December 30, 2001:

2002 ........................................   $512,000
2003 ........................................    501,000
2004 ........................................    449,000

     Legal Proceedings. On April 28, 2000, the Company entered into an
Engagement Agreement with Goldsmith, Agio, Helms & Lynner, Ltd. ("GAH") to act
as its agent to assist with a merger, sale or similar transaction, for a minimum
period of six months. The Company cancelled the agreement with GAH after being
approached by Kontron about the transaction that eventually closed in December
2000. GAH pursued legal proceedings against the Company and in September 2001,
an arbitrator found that the Company was required to pay damages of $792,000 to
GAH. These costs have been classified as "other expense" in the Company's 2001
and 2000 statements of operations. For comparative purposes, payments made to
GAH prior to the date of the award by the arbitrator have been reclassified to
reflect this change.

     The Company is involved in legal actions in the ordinary course of its
business. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of any such legal
actions, management believes that there is no pending legal proceeding against
or involving the Company for which the outcome is likely to have a material
adverse effect upon the Company's financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

Report of independent public accountants

To Kontron Mobile Computing, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Kontron Mobile Computing,
Inc. (a Minnesota corporation, formerly known as FieldWorks, Incorporated) as of
December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, and the related statements of
operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 30, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Kontron Mobile Computing, Inc.
as of December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30,
2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial
statements taken as a whole. Schedule II is presented for purposes of complying
with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic
financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our
opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to
be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole.

     .    If more than $600K, butless than $900K, then $10,000/Qtr.
     .    If more than $900K, then $15,000/Qtr.

A "year end" bonus of $20,000 will be paid to you if the 2002 Annual Operating
                                                              ----------------
Profit for KMC exceeds $2.0 million.
- ------

A "year end" bonus will be paid to you based on the following 2002 annual
Revenue results:
- -------

     .    If at least $18.5 million, then $7,500.
     .    If between $18.5 million and $21.5 million, then an additional
          $12,500, prorated.

<PAGE>

                                                                    Exhibit 99.1

                              CAUTIONARY STATEMENT

     Kontron Mobile Computing, Inc. ("we" or "us"), or persons acting on our
behalf, or outside reviewers we have retained who are making statements on our
behalf, or underwriters, from time to time, may make, in writing or orally,
"forward-looking statements" as defined under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act") and incorporated in Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. This Cautionary Statement is for the purpose of qualifying for the
"safe harbor" provisions of the Act and is intended to be a readily available
written document that contains factors which could cause results to differ
materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. These factors
are in addition to any other cautionary statements, written or oral, which may
be made or referred to in connection with any forward-looking statement.

     The following matters, among others, may have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or
prospects, financial or otherwise. Reference to this Cautionary Statement in the
context of a forward-looking statement shall be deemed to be a statement that
any one or more of the following factors may cause actual results to differ
materially from those that we have projected, forecast, estimated or budgeted in
any forward-looking statement or statements:

                         Risks Related to Our Operations

We have a history of losses

     As of December 30, 2001, we had an accumulated deficit of $36.6 million.
Although we achieved net income and a positive operating cash flow in 2001 for
the first time in our history, we expect to continue to incur significant
operating expenses and, as a result, will need to generate significant revenues
to sustain profitability, which may not occur. Even if we do sustain
profitability, we may be unable to increase profitability on a quarterly or
annual basis in the future.

We cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient sales to allow us to
continue to operate profitably

     The market for the kind of computing platforms and solutions we sell is
relatively new and limited. The rugged computing platforms that we use are both
heavier and more expensive than most consumer portable personal computers. Our
success will depend upon our ability to expand the tools and services we offer,
penetrate our key vertical markets of government, military, public services, and
utilities, and continue our reduction in product costs and time to market. We
cannot assure you that our current or new products will gain widespread
acceptance or that we will generate sufficient sales to allow us to continue to
operate profitably. We will in particular suffer adverse effects if the market
for the kind of computing solutions and products we sell declines.

Our ability to develop solutions around our rugged platforms will influence our
ability to compete in the marketplace

     We have had a history of designing and delivering hardware platforms for
extreme environments and will continue to capitalize on this strategy. Our
strategy is to be a key provider of tools and services to facilitate field data
acquisition, test and measurement, telemetry, and mobile communication
applications in the government, military, public services, and utilities markets
worldwide. To produce these solutions, we combine appropriate hardware, software
and peripherals and also provide service and support. To succeed with this
approach, we will need to design, develop, conceptualize and support computing
solutions that address the needs of these vertical markets. We cannot guarantee
that we will be able to do this in a timely, cost-effective manner or that our
target markets will accept the solutions that we do introduce.

We depend on third-party manufacturers to produce some of our products

                                       1
<PAGE>

     We depend on third-party manufacturers to manufacture and assemble some of
our products. This results in dependence on the timely delivery of high quality
products from these manufacturers and may leave us with less flexibility and
control over the manufacturing process than if we conducted all of these
operations internally. These manufacturers (including the manufacturers of
subassemblies included in our final products) may not timely deliver the items
they are expected to produce. Any occurrence of this sort could compromise our
ability to deliver our products and solutions in a timely fashion. It could also
require us to make alternative arrangements, which might not be available on
acceptable terms or on a timely basis. If we were unable to make alternative
arrangements, our business and financial condition could suffer.

Our failure to anticipate or rapidly respond to changing customer demands could
adversely affect our market position

     Both the computer industry and the diagnostic and data collection
instrument industry are characterized by rapid technological change, including
changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and
enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Our success will depend in part
on our ability to keep pace with technological developments and emerging
industry standards and to respond to customer requirements by enhancing our
current products and developing and introducing new solutions and products. Our
market position will be adversely affected if we do not adequately anticipate or
rapidly respond to changes of this type. Technological advances may also
increase the level of competition in our market niche.

Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial
performance

     We occupy a niche in the portable computer market. In this niche, our
products face direct competition from companies producing portable computers
intended for field use such as Dolch Computer Systems; Getac Corp.; Itronix
Corp.; Paravant Computer Systems, Inc.; Motorola, Inc.; Data 911, Litton
Industries, Inc., and Panasonic Personal Computer Company. Our computing
platforms also face indirect competition from a variety of different companies
and products, including consumer portable personal computers, customized
portable personal computers and single-purpose diagnostic and data collection
instruments.

     Both the computer industry and the diagnostic and data collection
instrument industry are intensely competitive. To the extent that we and our
current direct competitors expand and develop the market niche that we currently
service, other manufacturers may turn their attention to it and begin to produce
products directly competitive with those we offer. Many of the companies that
produce or may produce devices that compete or may compete, directly or
indirectly, with ours have greater name recognition, larger client bases and
substantially more financial, technological and marketing resources than we do.
These factors may provide them with significant advantages over us. Among other
things, these factors may allow them to adapt more rapidly and effectively to
changes in technology or in the market or to develop or market products that
will be more widely accepted. Competitive pressures could result in reduced
market share, price reductions, reduced margins and increased spending on
marketing and product development, any of which could adversely affect our
business.

If we do not adequately manage our inventory we may be required to make
write-offs in the future

     In the past, we have written off portions of our parts inventory that have
become obsolete. If our current policies aimed at preventing a recurrence prove
ineffective, we may be required to do so again. Any significant future
write-offs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.

We may not succeed in attracting and retaining the personnel we need for our
business

     Our future success depends substantially on our ability to attract and
retain the personnel we need for our business. Our personnel needs include
highly trained personnel for management, sales and engineering. Qualified
individuals in these areas are in high demand and are often subject to competing
employment opportunities. In recent years there has been great demand for
qualified employees in the Minneapolis area, where our headquarters are located.
We may not succeed in attracting and retaining the personnel we need for our
business.

Adverse events with respect to our international sales could have an adverse
effect on our business and financial condition

                                       2
<PAGE>

     In the year ended December 30, 2001, international sales represented
approximately 14% of our net sales. All of our export sales are currently
denominated in United States dollars. An increase in the value of the United
States dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more
expensive and, therefore, potentially less competitive in foreign markets. In
the future, if we were to denominate our export sales in foreign currencies, our
financial condition and results of operations would become subject to foreign
currency translations and the possibility of currency exchange or price controls
or other restrictions on foreign currencies. If any of these events occurred, it
could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

We depend on resellers for our product distribution

     We distribute a substantial portion of our products through independent
sales representatives and distributors. We also sell our products to
value-added-resellers (known as VARs) and systems integrators. Our success
depends in large part upon the performance of these resellers and on our ability
to attract new resellers. Many of our resellers also carry -- and may have
incentives to encourage purchase of -- competitive products. Most of our
resellers may terminate their written agreements with us with or without cause
by giving us 30 days' written notice. The loss of any of our major resellers or
a failure to make acceptable arrangements with resellers in new markets could
have a material adverse effect on us.

We obtain a number of our components from single sources

     Our rugged computing platforms employ a number of components not generally
used in off-the-shelf personal computers, such as special hard disk drives,
CD-ROM drives, floppy disk drives, displays and power supplies. We currently
obtain a number of these components from single sources. It could create
uncertainty and be costly and time-consuming if we had to change suppliers. If
we could not obtain adequate or timely quantities of necessary components from
our current suppliers, we might not be able to identify or access alternative
sources within a reasonable period of time, on acceptable terms, or at all. Some
of our current vendors use tools that have been designed for us and are our
property. If we were required to change suppliers for these components, we would
need either to move the necessary tools or to obtain new tools, either of which
could entail significant cost and delay. Moreover, our buying power may be
limited by our small volume and we may receive less favorable allocations and
other terms such as price, timing or other factors than larger companies buying
from the same suppliers. Any of these factors or a significant increase in the
price of components could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
manufacture and market our products.

Potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial results make financial
forecasting difficult

     Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future
as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control.
These factors include:

     .    long customer sales cycles (especially for customers that are
          government agencies or large corporations);

     .    changes in customer buying patterns;

     .    orders from significant customers in one quarter that are
          disproportionate in size or value compared to our other orders;

     .    the timing and nature of customer returns;

     .    the timing of the introduction of new products by us or our
          competitors;

     .    our competitors' tactics;

     .    technological developments; and

     .    the overall strength of the economy.

                                       3
<PAGE>

     All of these factors, along with the uncertainties associated with the
introduction of any new product or product enhancement, in gauging ultimate
customer demand, and in predicting general trends in the market for our tools
and services, may limit our ability to plan for production and to forecast
quarterly results of operations accurately. We believe that quarter-to-quarter
comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future
performance. Stockholders should not rely on our operating results for any
particular quarter as an indication of our future operating results.

                     Risks Related to Intellectual Property

Failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our brand and our
ability to compete effectively

     We rely on a combination of unpatented trade secrets and know-how and on
the expertise of our employees. We do not rely on patented processes or
technologies. The protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter
misappropriation of our proprietary information. We may be unable to detect the
unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual
property rights. Effective trade secret protection may not be available in every
country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services.
Likewise, others may independently develop or otherwise acquire unpatented
and/or patented technologies or products similar or superior to ours. We claim
trademark rights in three marks we use in connection with our products in the
United States. We are aware that there are third parties that have claimed or
may claim superior rights, in some U.S. territories, to use marks in which we
claim rights. One or more of these third parties may contest our right to use or
register our trademarks. We do not know whether any of the trademarks covered by
our applications for registration will be found registrable, that registrations
will issue, or that we can support the cost of defense of our trademarks.
Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our brand and
affect our ability to compete effectively. Defending our intellectual property
rights could also result in the expenditure of significant financial and
managerial resources, which could materially adversely affect our business.

Loss of software licenses could have an adverse effect on us

     We license some of the software that we include in our products from third
parties. If any licensor terminated any of these licenses, we might not be able
to license similar software from another party in a timely fashion, on
acceptable terms, or at all.

We may have to defend against intellectual property infringement claims, which
could have an adverse effect on us whether or not we prevailed

     Disputes over intellectual property are frequent in the high technology
area. Although we believe that our business activities do not infringe the
intellectual property rights of others, other parties may assert infringement
claims against us or claim that we have violated a patent or other proprietary
right belonging to them. Likewise, disputes may arise in the future with respect
to ownership of technology developed by employees who were previously employed
by other companies. Infringement claims, even if not meritorious, could result
in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. An adverse
determination could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek
licenses from or pay royalties to third parties or require us to develop
appropriate alternative technology. We might not be able to do any of these
things on acceptable terms, at an acceptable price, or at all. Any of these
results could materially adversely affect our business.

                    Risks Related to Our Financial Condition

Our Common Stock was delisted by Nasdaq and currently is traded on the Over The
Counter Bulletin Board

     In August 2000, our Common Stock was delisted from the Nasdaq SmallCap
Market for failure to demonstrate sustained compliance with the net tangible
assets listing requirement, and began trading on the Over The Counter Bulletin
Board. There can be no assurance that our Common Stock will continue to meet the

                                       4
<PAGE>

requirements required for listing on the Over The Counter Bulletin Board or that
our Common Stock will continue to be publicly traded.

We may need to raise additional cash during 2002 but may not be able to do so

     On January 29, 2002, Kontron Embedded Computers AG (Kontron) agreed to
provide us financial support to enable us to meet our cash flow needs and
obligations as and when they become due through the period ended December 31,
2002. We are also in the process of finalizing a line of credit with an existing
bank. Nevertheless, we may need to raise additional capital. We may not be able
to access sufficient capital when required on favorable terms, if at all. If we
raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, existing shareholders may
experience dilution in their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds by
issuing debt securities, we may incur significant interest expense and become
subject to covenants that could limit our ability to operate and fund our
business. If we cannot obtain additional funds when required, we may be unable
to realize our current plans and may even be forced to cease operations.

Our loan agreements with Kontron are valued in Euros and our foreign currency
forward contract may negatively impact our cash flow

     In 2001, we began utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to protect
against significant fluctuations in net income (loss) caused by the valuation of
our loan agreement with Kontron. Our practice is to enter into a forward
contract at the beginning of each quarter and settle the contract at the end of
the quarter. Depending on the currency fluctuation of the Euro, we either pay
out cash or receive cash when we mark-to-market each quarter. The uncertainty of
the fluctuation of the Euro could cause cash flow problems.

                    Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure

One of our shareholders, together with its affiliates, owns a significant
percentage of our outstanding stock and by virtue of that ownership and various
contractual rights has significant influence over our operations and strategic
direction

     Kontron, together with certain of its affiliates, owns approximately 65% of
our Common Stock, assuming conversion of the shares of preferred stock owned by
them. In addition, two designees of Kontron currently serve on our Board of
Directors. Kontron's majority ownership stake gives Kontron the ability to
control the outcome of votes of our shareholders, and therefore results in
Kontron having significant influence on our operations and strategic direction.
Kontron's ownership may also have the effect of delaying, deterring or
preventing a change in control or a change in the composition of our Board of
Directors.

Our charter documents and Minnesota law may discourage a takeover of our company

     Provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Minnesota law could
make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would
be beneficial to our shareholders.

We do not intend to pay dividends

     We currently intend to retain any earnings for use in the operation and
expansion of our business and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash
dividends in the foreseeable future.
