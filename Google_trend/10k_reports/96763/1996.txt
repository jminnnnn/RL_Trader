                                    ------

ITEM I  BUSINESS
- ----------------
     Technitrol, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively the
"Company") segments its business into three industry areas: Electronic
Components, Metallurgical Products and Test & Measurement Products.  The
industry segments are described in further detail below.
     Additional information on the Company's foreign operations is shown in
the geographic segment information immediately following the industry segment
information below.

Industry Segment Information
- ----------------------------
     * The Electronic Components Segment includes Pulse Engineering, Inc.
("Pulse"), the Fil-Mag Group ("Fil-Mag") and the Components Division of the
Company.  Pulse was acquired by the Company on September 29, 1995 and
significantly increased the size of this segment.  The Electronic Components
Segment designs, manufactures and markets electronic components and modules
primarily for manufacturers of local area networks and telecommunications
systems.

     * The Metallurgical Products Segment includes the operations of Advanced
Metallurgy, Inc. ("AMI") and Chace Precision Metals, Inc. ("Chace").  AMI
manufactures electrical contacts and assemblies for a wide range of industrial
customers.  Separately, Chace produces thermostatic and clad metal products
for a broad market of industrial and consumer product manufacturers.

     * The Test & Measurement Products Segment includes Lloyd Instruments,
Ltd. ("Lloyd Instruments"), John Chatillon & Sons, Inc. ("Chatillon") and the
Products Division.  Lloyd Instruments manufactures a comprehensive range of
material testing systems and markets its products throughout the world.
Chatillon manufactures force measurement products and weighing devices and in
each case markets these products both domestically and internationally.  Until
its sale in February 1996, the Products Division manufactured document
counters and dispensers, and marketed its products internationally through
distributors and on an OEM basis.  (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.)  This Segment was previously called the End
User/Finished Products Segment.

     Identifiable assets are those assets that are utilized in each Segment to
provide the respective products.  Corporate assets are principally cash and
cash equivalents.

     The Company's products are sold primarily to industrial customers through
the three Segments described above.  All business Segments' revenues are
generally recognized when products are shipped.  The majority of the Company's
sales are subject to credit terms prevalent in the industries it serves.
Receivables are written off when an account is considered to be doubtful of
collection.  Management believes there are no significant concentrations of
credit risk.

     In 1995 and in 1994, one customer accounted for slightly more than 10%
of consolidated sales.  The customer is a Fortune 150 entity principally
doing business with the Metallurgical Products Segment.  Another customer,
then a Fortune 50 entity principally doing business with the Metallurgical
Products Segment, produced revenues slightly exceeding 10% of total sales
in 1993.  Sales to the Company's ten largest customers accounted for 38% of
sales in both 1995 and 1994 and 42% in 1993.

     Export sales from the United States totalled $15.3 million in 1995,
$14.0 million in 1994 and $11.5 million in 1993.  There has been no
concentration of sales to any particular domestic or international
geographic area.  The Company's operations are divided into three
geographic areas: North America, Far East, and Europe.

Global Activities
- -----------------
     As a diversified global enterprise engaged in manufacturing
activities, certain risks are inherent to the Company's business.  One such
risk is its operations in developing countries.  The majority of the
Electronic Components Segment's manufacturing is performed in the People's
Republic of China (the "PRC"), Taiwan and the Philippines.  Although the
PRC is one of the world's fastest growing economies, its potential
economic, political and labor developments provide a number of
uncertainties and risks.  While the current Philippine government has been
quite receptive to foreign investment for manufacturing, there are no
assurances that these receptive policies will continue and, if they do not
continue, that they will not be replaced by economic, tax and/or labor
policies which are less favorable to a foreign manufacturing presence than
are the current policies.  If the government of a country noted above (or
any other country in which the Company has significant operations) should
adopt economic, legal, or trading policies harmful to private industry or
foreign investment, or, if a country should take any other action that
would jeopardize the value of foreign investments, it could have a material
adverse effect on the Company. The current tension between the PRC and
Taiwan, if escalated, could lead to such action or to an American response
which makes importation of product from the region difficult.

Sales and Marketing
- -------------------
     Sales and marketing are accomplished by sales management, district
managers, direct salesmen, representatives, agents, dealers and
distributors.  Within the Electronic Components Segment, the Company's
products are sold primarily by the Company's field sales force to customers
in the computer, local area network (LAN) and telecommunication markets.
The field sales personnel are technically trained and actively involved in
product development.  Customers of the Metallurgical Products Segment,
which include manufacturers of circuit protection, power control and power
distribution equipment, purchase the Company's products primarily through
sales personnel employed by the Company.  Customers of the Company's Test &
Measurement Products Segment include virtually every industry in performing
inspection and in-process testing.  The Company's Test & Measurement
Products are sold through independent agents, dealers and distributors.

Competition
- -----------
     The business of the Company is highly competitive, and with respect to
each of its products, it faces competition from numerous firms, some of
which are larger and possess greater financial resources.

                               Page 4 of 38

Backlog
- -------
     As of December 31, 1995, the Company's backlog of orders was $55.9
million compared to  $28.7 million at the end of 1994.   Substantially all
of the current backlog is scheduled for completion during the first six
months of 1996.  Most orders are subject to cancellation upon payment of
normal cancellation charges.  Normal delivery time for the Company's
products is less than thirteen weeks.  No material portion of the Company's
business is seasonal in nature.

Raw Materials
- -------------
     In its diverse manufacturing operations, the Company is not dependent
upon any particular source of supply.  However, there are relatively few
suppliers of ferrite materials used in electronic components, powder metals
used in electrical contacts, and specialty steel used in metal laminates.
     The Company has not encountered any significant difficulties in
obtaining adequate supplies of these raw materials for manufacture of its
products.  During the second half of 1996, some significant price changes
occurred relative to certain nonprecious metals used by the Company.  Sales
prices for many products that include these materials have been adjusted to
include metal factors which reflect changes in these metals markets.  One
of the Company's subsidiaries engages in a business which utilizes silver
as a raw material component.  This material has been readily available and
is anticipated to remain so.

Patents and Licenses
- --------------------
     Although the Company possesses several patents and many trademarks and
tradenames which are used in the conduct of its businesses, the Company
does not consider its consolidated earnings to be materially dependent upon
any one patent, trademark or license.

Research and Development
- ------------------------
     The Company does not engage in any basic research activities.
Development activity is conducted principally by the Company's engineering
personnel and is directed primarily toward the development of new products
related to its current product lines and the improvement and enhancement of
existing products.

Environment
- ----------
     Expenditures required for the Company to meet or exceed Federal, state
and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment,
are not expected to have any material effect on capital expenditures,
earnings or competitive position.
     The Company is involved in several matters relating to superfund
sites.  The Company's involvement has generally arisen from the alleged
disposal by licensed waste haulers of small amounts of waste material many
years ago at these sites.  The Company has established reserves which it
believes to be sufficient to cover the aggregate amount of the ultimate
liability, if any, which the Company believes to be reasonably probable at
this time.

Employees
- ---------
     At December 31, 1995, the Company had approximately 9,300 full time
employees compared with 3,100 at the end of 1994.  Certain operations of
the Company, particularly in the Far East, are labor intensive.

Energy
- ------
     The Company did not experience any curtailment of supplies of
electricity, gas or oil in 1995, and does not expect any curtailment in
1996.

Products
- --------
     The Company's business is grouped into three industry segments and,
within each segment, the primary products sold are similar in design,
material content, application and customer base.  Each Segment is
continually changing its individual product offerings in response to
customer needs and changes within the markets served.  Further delineation
of its product lines is not meaningful in gaining an understanding of the
Company's business

                               Page 5 of 38

risks and opportunities.  The Electronic Components Segment primarily
produces magnetic-based electronic components for use in local area
networks and communication applications.  The Metallurgical Products
Segment's main product offerings are electrical contacts and contact

ITEM 7  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
        ----------------------------------------------------------------

Liquidity and Capital Resources
- -------------------------------

     Cash and cash equivalents totalled $13.9 million at December 31, 1995,
compared to $8.7 million a year earlier.  Working capital was $43.2 million,
compared to $32.7 million at December 31, 1994.  The financial performance
during the fourth quarter of 1995, which included the operations of Pulse
Engineering, Inc. ("Pulse"), contributed to the year-to-year increase in
working capital.  Pulse was acquired at the end of September 1995 and the
large increases in consolidated accounts receivable and inventory were due
primarily to the Pulse balances acquired.  Pulse had a favorable working
capital ratio prior to the acquisition and it remained strong subsequent to
the acquisition.  Additional information regarding the Pulse acquisition is
included in Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Cash provided by 1995 operating activities was $18.2 million.  The
positive cash flow was composed mainly of net earnings of $9.3 million,
depreciation and amortization of $6.2 million, and increases in accounts
payable and accrued expenses of $1.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
Depreciation and amortization amounts included three months of depreciation on
the Pulse assets and three months of amortization of the goodwill resulting
from the Pulse acquisition.  Significant decreases in prepaid expenses and
other assets (excluding amounts acquired from Pulse) also provided cash during
the year. Cash was provided by a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.3
million while cash of $2.8 million was consumed by an increase in inventories.
The increase in inventories includes amounts produced by the Electronic
Components Segment, which includes Pulse, in anticipation of the Chinese
New Year holiday in February 1996.  The Company's production operations in
the Peoples Republic of China (the "PRC") and in Taiwan are typically closed
for one to two weeks for this holiday and inventory is built in anticipation
of the lost production time.

     Investing activities consumed $11.6 million during 1995.  Capital
expenditures constituted $5.9 million, excluding acquisitions. Separately,
cash of $5.9 million was paid for the capital stock of Pulse stockholders, net
of cash acquired.  The cash portion of the purchase price, including the cash
paid to the former stockholders of Pulse and related acquisition costs, was
approximately $27.6 million.  Cash acquired from Pulse and used to partially
fund the acquisition was approximately $21.7 million.  Additional financing
for the acquisition was provided by bank borrowings as described below.
Projected 1996 capital expenditures are expected to be financed by internally
generated funds.

     Cash used in financing activities was a net $1.3 million.  Cash consumed
by financing activities was due to combined debt reduction of $7.8 million and
$2.5 million of dividend payments. It is expected that dividends will continue
to be paid on a quarterly basis during 1996.  Proceeds from long-term
borrowings were $9.0 million.  The proceeds included $5.0 million which was
used to finance the May 1995 purchase of warrants for Pulse common stock.  In
connection with the September 1995 closing of the Pulse acquisition, an
additional $4.0 million was borrowed under a bank syndicated credit facility
which authorized Technitrol to borrow up to $50 million on an unsecured basis.
Technitrol used approximately $18.0 million of this credit facility to
refinance existing indebtedness (including the $5.0 million which had been
borrowed to fund the Pulse warrant purchase in May 1995) and, separately,
approximately $4.0 million of the credit facility to partially fund the
acquisition costs and cash payments to former shareholders of Pulse.  On
December 29, 1995, the credit facility was amended in conjunction with a
partial repayment and the total facility was reduced to $45.0 million.
Further payments in advance of the due date were made in February and March of
1996 in amounts of $6.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively.  Approximately
$3.6 million (before payment of related transaction expenses and costs) was
received at the end of February 1996 from the sale of the Products Division as
explained in Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  A
portion of these funds were applied in March, as aforementioined, to pay off
all amounts outstanding under the line of credit.  The balance of the funds
received will be used for general working capital purposes.

                                 Page 9 of 38

     The Company's foreign sales are conducted primarily through its foreign
subsidiaries, principally in the Far East and Europe.  In the Far East, the
Company's sales are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars.  In Europe, sales
are denominated in local currencies (consisting mainly of English pounds and
French francs) and in U.S. dollars.  Since a very significant portion of the
Company's foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, the Company does not
believe that its potential exposure to currency fluctuations is material to
its business.  During 1994, the Company did not purchase any currency exchange
forward contracts or similar instruments generally utilized to reduce the risk
of currency fluctuations. During 1995, a limited number of short-term forward
contracts were purchased by a Pulse subsidiary in Europe.  All such contracts
were closed prior to the end of the year.  These contracts are purchased in
order to guarantee a predetermined currency exchange rate at the time the
contract is purchased by transferring the risk or benefit of currency
fluctuations to a third party.

     Slightly more than one-quarter of the Company's identifiable assets are
located in the Far East and significant sales and operating profits are
generated in that region.  (See the geographic segment data included in Note
13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)  The Company's
operations in the region include manufacturing plants in the PRC, Taiwan and
the Philippines.  If unfavorable political, economic or other events occur in
that region, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
liquidity and capital resources.  Management monitors events in the region and
takes steps to reduce the risk of uncertainty when possible.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------

1995 and 1994
- -------------

Revenues
- --------
     Consolidated sales for the Company were $176.4 million in 1995, an
increase of 20.5% from 1994.  The increase was largely due to the sales of
Pulse, acquired at the end of September 1995.  The Pulse sales included in
the consolidated results of the Company were approximately $25.4 million.
The sales increases of the Electronic Components Segment (which includes
Pulse) and the Test & Measurement Products Segment exceeded a sales
decrease experienced by the Metallurgical Products Segment.  The Company's
backlog at December 31, 1995 was $55.9 million, including $28.2 million for
Pulse.

                               Page 10 of 38

     The sales of the Electronic Components Segment increased from $41.2
million in 1994 to $68.4 million in 1995.  The Fil-Mag Group and Pulse,
along with the Components Division of the Company, have been combined into
one world-wide operation serving the needs of the local area network (LAN)
and telecommunications marketplaces.  In addition to the Pulse sales noted
above, sales of the Fil-Mag Group increased during the year.  The lower
sales level of the Components Division, which was caused by a decline in
domestic demand for that Division's products, was more than offset by
increased demand for products manufactured by Fil-Mag and Pulse.  The strong
demand of these markets for products produced by Pulse and the Fil-Mag Group
continued into the beginning of 1996, as evidenced by solid backlog and order
levels at the end of 1995.  Operating profits for the Segment in 1995 were
$10.7 million compared to $5.0 million in 1994. The sales and operating
profits of the Segment included three months of Pulse activity.

     The Metallurgical Products Segment experienced a number of challenges
during 1995 and the sales and operating profits of this Segment were lower
than the 1994 levels.  Sales in 1995 were $75.3 million, down from $76.5
million in 1994.  A sales decrease at Advanced Metallurgy, Inc. ("AMI")
exceeded a sales increase at Chace Precision Metals, Inc. ("Chace").  The
sales of AMI and, to a lesser extent, Chace are affected by general trends
in the domestic economy, particularly those in housing, automotive,
appliances and capital equipment markets.  During the second half of 1995,
there was a softening in demand for the products of this Segment.  In
addition, the Segment's operating profits were negatively impacted by increased
price competition and rapidly escalating raw material costs, particularly in
the nonprecious metals markets.  Management has focused significant
attention on attaining increased manufacturing efficiencies and has
implemented a partial pass-through of the raw material price changes by
way of both a price increase and a metals factor. Operating profits of the
Segment were $1.8 million in 1995, down from $4.8 million in 1994.

     In the Test & Measurement Products Segment, sales increases at John
Chatillon & Sons, Inc. ("Chatillon") and Lloyd Instruments, Inc. ("Lloyd")
exceeded a sales decrease at the Products Division.  That sales decrease
was primarily caused by weak domestic demand for the currency counters and
dispensers manufactured by the Products Division.  The February 1996 sale of
the Products Division evidenced management's intention to focus on the test and
measurement product lines within this Segment.  Relative to the 1995
results, Lloyd in particular contributed to the higher sales and operating
profits of the Segment.  The 1995 Lloyd sales included a full year of the
sales of Erichsen, a German subsidiary acquired late in 1994.  Chatillon's
sales benefited from recent product development efforts. Sales for the Segment
increased from $28.7 million in 1994 to $32.8 million in 1995 while operating
profits increased from $2.7 million to $2.9 million.

Cost of Sales
- -------------
     In 1995, the Company's gross margin increased by 6%, from 29.6% of sales
in 1994 to 31.5% in 1995. This margin increase was driven primarily by the
strong product demand and increased manufacturing efficiencies within the
Electronic Components Segment.  These gains offset the lower gross profits
of the Metallurgical Products Segment which experienced significant decreases
in gross profits versus the prior year, with the majority of the gross profit
decline occurring at AMI.  The softer demand, increased price competition and
rising metal costs noted above caused this decline.

Operating Expenses
- ------------------
     The Company's selling, general and administrative expenses increased
to $40.2 million in 1995 from $30.8 million in 1994.  This represented
22.8% of sales in 1995 and 21.0% of sales in 1994.  The increase was
primarily caused by the addition of Pulse for the fourth quarter.

Interest
- --------
     Interest expense increased from $1.1 million in 1994 to $1.4 million
in 1995 reflecting the incremental borrowing related to the Pulse acquisition.

                               Page 11 of 38
Income Taxes
- ------------
     The Company's effective income tax rate declined to 36% in 1995 from
39% in 1994.  During 1995, proportionately higher taxable income was earned
by the Company's foreign operations, which generally have lower tax rates
than the domestic operations.

     During 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial
Accounting Standard No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
("FAS123").  Under the new standard, companies have the option of including
certain stock-based compensation in the company's statement of earnings or,
alternately, providing disclosure of the related compensation amounts in a
note to the financial statements.  The new disclosures apply to financial
statements for years beginning after December 15, 1995.   The Company
intends to adopt the disclosure alternative and does not expect FAS123 to
have a material impact on its pro forma results of operations.  During
1995, the Company did not grant incentive stock options to employees.
However, in connection with the acquisition of Pulse on September 29, 1995
(see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements), outstanding options to
purchase Pulse common stock were assumed by the Company and converted into
options to purchase Technitrol common stock.  The difference between the
exercise price and the market value of Technitrol stock at the date of
acquisition was capitalized as part of the purchase price.  No additional
options are expected to be issued under the assumed plans.  See Note 11 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding
stock-based compensation provided by the Company.

     The Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed of, is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1995.  The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company.

1994 and 1993
- -------------

Revenues
- --------
     In 1994, consolidated sales were $146.4 million compared to $100.5
million in 1993. The 45.7% increase was due to the $30.8 million sales of
the Fil-Mag Group, acquired in January 1994, and a combined sales increase
of $15.1 million realized by the other businesses of the Company.  All
three of the Company's segments experienced increased sales in 1994 from
1993.

     The December 31 backlog was $28.7 million in 1994 and $14.9 million in
1993.  Contributing to the increase was the Fil-Mag Group's backlog.

     The increase in sales of the Electronic Components Segment to $41.2
million included the sales of the Fil-Mag Group as noted above.  Operating
profit of the Electronics Components Segment increased to $5.0 million in 1994,
compared to $1.7 million in the prior year.  The increase reflected the
fifty weeks of profits of the Fil-Mag Group since its acquisition in
January 1994.  As a percentage of sales, this segment's annual operating
profits equaled 12.2% which was the highest of the Company's three product
segments. Year end backlog and order volumes indicated a softening in the
segment's domestic markets, while offshore demand remained relatively
strong.

     The Metallurgical Products Segment produced increased sales, operating
profit and operating profit as a function of sales in 1994 as compared to
1993. AMI experienced its largest sales and profit improvements to the
product line which was acquired from Engelhard Corporation in 1991.
Housing starts continued to have an eventual impact on demand for various
AMI products.  Management monitored the indirect effect that interest rate
increases had on AMI backlog levels which were stable entering the first
quarter of 1995.  Separately, Chace sales and operating profits also grew
year-to-year.  On-going efforts aimed at cost containment and quality
improvements contributed to the growth in sales volume and profits. Chace's
proven ability to compete in a demanding industrial market was reflected by
a strong backlog position as it began 1995.

                               Page 12 of 38

     Two of the three operating units within the Test & Measurement
Products Segment experienced an increase in sales and operating profits.
Chatillon sales volume and profitability improved in its primary product
families, as the improved economic climate contributed to more favorable
market conditions.  Lloyd's year-to-year sales increase reflected
incremental unit sales and the absence of the unfavorable currency
translation which negatively impacted 1993 results.  Lower sales and
operating profit occurred at the Company's Products Division.  Domestic
demand for currency counters and dispensers decreased during 1994, which
was also the first full year subsequent to the Division withdrawing as a
provider of engineering services on a prime contract basis to an agency of
the U.S. Government.

Cost of Sales
- -------------
     In 1994, the Company's overall gross margin increased to 29.6% of
sales from 26.9% in 1993.  Improvements were made in each of the Company's
three business segments.  The addition of the Fil-Mag Group within the
Electronic Components Segment, cost containment and quality improvements
within the Metallurgical Products Segment and the higher sales of Chatillon
and Lloyd included in the Test & Measurement Products Segment all
contributed to a higher gross margin in 1994.

Operating Expense
- -----------------
     The Company's selling, general and administrative expenses increased to
$30.8 million in 1994 from $21.6 million in 1993. The key reason for the
increase was the addition of the Fil-Mag Group.

Interest
- --------
     Interest expense grew to $1.1 million, caused by the $10 million
increase in outstanding debt to fund the Fil-Mag Group acquisition and
rising interest rates during the year.

Income Taxes
- ------------
     1994 income tax expenses increased as a function of pre-tax earnings.
The 1994 effective income tax rate rose to 39% from 35% in 1993 as a result
of proportionately higher taxable income being earned by the Company's
domestic operations. Effective income tax rates of the domestic operations
generally exceed those of the Company's offshore operations.

                       Independent Auditors' Report



The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Technitrol, Inc.:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Technitrol, Inc.
and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. In connection with
our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited
the financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index. These
consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Technitrol, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 1995 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes in 1993 to adopt
the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

                Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
     ------------------------------------------

Principles of Consolidation
- ---------------------------
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Technitrol,
Inc. (the "Company") and all of its subsidiaries.  All material
intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
- -------------------------
     Cash and cash equivalents include funds invested in a variety of liquid
short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less.

Inventories
- -----------
     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined
by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.  In addition to the inventories
included in the accompanying balance sheets, the Company has custody of
inventories on consignment from suppliers ($11,118,000 at December 31, 1995
and $14,063,000 at December 31, 1994).  This inventory consists primarily
of silver which is used in the Company's metal contact manufacturing
business.

Property, Plant and Equipment
- -----------------------------
     Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is based
upon the estimated useful life of the assets and has been provided for on
both the accelerated and the straight line methods.  The estimated useful
lives range from 5 to 30 years for buildings and improvements and from 3 to
10 years for machinery and equipment.  Expenditures for maintenance and
repairs are charged to operations as incurred, and major renewals and
betterments are capitalized.  Upon sale or retirement, the cost of the
asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance
sheet, and any resulting gains or losses are included in earnings.

Excess of Cost over Net Assets
- ------------------------------
     Excess of cost over net assets acquired (which the Company believes has
continuing value) is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 15
years. The recoverability of its carrying value is evaluated on a recurring
basis by determining whether the amortization of its remaining balance can
be recovered through future operating cash flows of the acquired operation.

Earnings per Share
- ------------------
     Earnings per share are calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the year, including
common share equivalents.  Common share equivalents are incremental shares
attributed to outstanding options to purchase common stock.  Relevant
earnings per share amounts have been restated to reflect a 200% stock
dividend recorded on September 18, 1994.

Foreign Currency Translation
- ----------------------------
     Most foreign subsidiaries' functional currency is the U.S. dollar; those
entities translate monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange
rates while nonmonetary items are translated at historical rates.  Income
and expense accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during
the year, except for depreciation and cost of sales which are translated at
historical rates.  Gains or losses from changes in exchange rates are
recognized in earnings in the year of occurrence.  The remaining entities
use the local currency as the functional currency and translate net assets
at year-end rates while income and expense accounts are translated at
average exchange rates.  Adjustments resulting from these translations are
reflected in the shareholders' equity section titled "Cumulative
translation adjustment."

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
- -----------------------------------
     The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, other current
assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value
because of the short maturity of those instruments.  The carrying value of
long term debt approximates fair value after taking into consideration
current rates offered to the Company for similar debt instruments of
comparable maturities.

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued
    ------------------------------------------
Estimates
- ---------
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions.  These estimates and assumptions may affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications
- -----------------
     Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

(2)  Acquisitions
     ------------
     On September 29, 1995, the Company completed the acquisition of Pulse
Engineering, Inc. ("Pulse"), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger
dated May 23, 1995.  As a result of the merger, Pulse became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company.  Pulse, headquartered in San Diego, California,
and with operations in Hong Kong, the People's Republic of China and
Ireland, designs, manufactures and markets electronic components and
modules primarily for manufacturers of local area networks and
telecommunications systems.

     The total purchase price approximated $61.5 million and consisted of cash
paid to the former Pulse stockholders, stock issued to the former Pulse
stockholders, stock options assumed, and related acquisition costs.  The
fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed approximated
$66.5 million and $14.0 million, respectively.  The excess of cost over net
assets acquired approximated $9.0 million.

     Approximately 1,785,000 shares of Technitrol common stock at a fair market
value of $16.375 per share were issued to former holders of Pulse common
stock.  The cash portion of the purchase price, including cash paid to the
former stockholders of Pulse and related acquisition costs, was
approximately $27.6 million.  In addition, all outstanding options to
purchase Pulse common stock were assumed by the Company.  At the date of
acquisition, approximately 269,000 shares of Technitrol common stock were
issuable upon exercise of such options and, except for approximately 33,000
options which were not yet vested, all assumed options were exercisable
immediately at prices ranging from $1.73 to $15.61.  The options have
various expiration dates, the latest of which is in April 2001.  The shares
issued and the options outstanding were included in the weighted average
shares outstanding used for calculating earnings per share for the quarter
and the year ended December 31, 1995.

     In conjunction with the Pulse acquisition, Technitrol established a credit
facility with a group of banks which authorized Technitrol to borrow up to
$50 million on an unsecured basis.  Technitrol initially used approximately
$18 million of this credit facility to refinance existing indebtedness and,
separately, approximately $4 million of the credit facility to partially
fund the cash portion of the merger consideration.  On December 29, 1995,
the credit facility was amended in conjunction with a partial repayment and
the total facility was reduced to $45 million.



                                                                (continued)

           Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued

(2)  Acquisitions, continued
     ------------
     Since the shares issued to the former holders of Pulse common stock and the
options assumed in connection with the acquisition were outstanding for the
entire fourth quarter (but only for a portion of the entire year), the
weighted average shares outstanding were considerably different for the
year than for the fourth quarter alone.  As a result, the earnings per
share for the year will not equal the sum of the four quarterly earnings
per share amounts.

     The acquisition has been accounted for by the purchase method of
accounting.  Had Pulse been acquired on January 1, 1994, unaudited
consolidated pro forma results of operations would have been (in thousands,
except for earnings per share):

          Sales                      $252,104            $177,913
          Net earnings                $16,825                  $8
          Earnings per share            $2.10               $0.00

     This unaudited information is provided for comparative purposes only.
It does not purport to be indicative of the results that actually would
have occurred if the acquisition had been consummated on the date indicated
or which may be obtained in the future.  The pro forma earnings per share
amounts include the effect of shares issued and stock options assumed in
connection with the merger.

     On January 17, 1994, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Technitrol International, Inc., a Delaware corporation, acquired from FEE
Technology, S.A. all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of FEE
Fil-Mag Taiwan Corporation ("FFT"), FEE Fil-Mag Singapore Pte. Corporation
("FFS") and Fil-Mag, Inc. ("FMI").  FFT, FFS and FMI are referred to below
as the "Fil-Mag Group".  The Fil-Mag Group is a supplier of magnetic
components to domestic and international manufacturers of PCs, network
interface cards, network controllers and other devices that are connected
to data communications networks such as Token Ring and Ethernet.  The Fil-
Mag Group conducted manufacturing operations in its plants in Taiwan and
the Philippines; engineering activities at its San Diego, California
location; and sales operations through offices in France, Singapore and San
Diego.

     The purchase price of the Fil-Mag Group was $9,082,000 (net of
expenses).  In addition, the Company caused FMI to repay to FEE Technology,
S.A. approximately $1 million of indebtedness.  FFT was indebted to local
banks in the amount of approximately $3.3 million, all of which has been
retired since the acquisition.  The assets acquired and liabilities assumed
approximated $15.5 million and $8.6 million, respectively.  The excess of
cost over net assets acquired approximated $2.5 million.  The purchase
price and the $1 million debt repayment were financed by borrowing $10
million under a temporary acquisition line of credit and cash on-hand of
approximately $400,000.

(2)  Acquisitions, continued
     ------------
     Subsequent to the acquisition, eight key employees of the Fil-Mag
Group entered into a covenant against competition with the Company in
exchange for which the Fil-Mag Group paid them, in the aggregate, $1
million during the twelve months subsequent to the acquisition.  The $1
million was financed by cash on-hand and is being amortized on a straight-
line basis over the life of the agreement.

     The purchase price for Pulse and the purchase price for the Fil-Mag
Group were arrived at pursuant to arms-length negotiations, taking into
account all pertinent factors including, but not limited to, the nature,
monetary and strategic value of the assets being acquired, business
prospects of Pulse and each member of the Fil-Mag Group and the synergies
of the businesses with the current operations of the Company.

(5)  Research and Development Expense
     --------------------------------
     Research and development expense is included in selling general and
administrative expenses and has not exceeded 11% of such expenses in 1995, 1994
and 1993.

(6)  Income Taxes
     ------------
     During 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("FAS
109").  FAS 109 required a change from the deferred method of accounting for
income taxes of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 11 to the asset and
liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under the asset and liability
method of FAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases.  The change in these deferred tax assets or liabilities,
including the effect of a change in tax rates, if any, from the beginning to
the end of the period generally is recognized as deferred tax expense or
benefit.  Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted FAS 109 and has
reported the cumulative effect of that change in the method of accounting for
income taxes in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended
December 31, 1993.

     Earnings before income taxes were as follows (in thousands):

sufficient taxable income will be generated in the foreseeable future to
realize the deferred tax assets.

Environment

     The Company is involved in several legal actions relating to waste
disposal sites.  The Company's involvement in these matters has generally
arisen from the alleged disposal by licensed waste haulers of small amounts of
waste material many years ago.  The Company has established reserves which it
believes are adequate for its expected future liability in these matters.

     On August 3, 1994, the Company's Board of Directors approved a three-
for-one split of the Company's common stock in the form of a 200% common
stock dividend for shareholders of record as of August 18, 1994.  A total
of 5,962,640 shares were issued in connection with the split.  The stated
par value of each share was not changed from $.125.  A total of $745,000

(9)  Employee Benefit Plans, continued
     -----------------------
     Benefits are based on years of service and average final compensation.
For U.S. plans, the Company funds, annually, at least the minimum amount
required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  Plan
assets consist principally of short-term investments and listed bonds and
stocks.  Assumptions used to develop data for 1995 and 1994 were as
follows:

        Discount rates                                         7.25 to 7.5%
        Annual compensation increases                          4.75 to 7.0%
        Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets      7.50 to 9.0%

     The Company maintains defined contribution 401(k) plans covering
substantially all U.S. employees not affected by certain collective
bargaining agreements.  Under the primary 401(k) plan, the Company
contributes a matching amount equal to $.50 for each $1.00 of the
participant's contribution not in excess of 3% of the participant's annual
wages.  The total contribution expense under the 401(k) plans was $319,000,
$165,000 and $177,000 in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

     The Company does not provide any significant post-retirement benefits
other than the pension plans and 401(k) plans described above.

principal office shall, at all times, be within the limits of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

     Section 2.  The corporation may also have offices at such other
places, both within and without the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; as the
board of directors may, from time to time, determine or the business of the
corporation may require.


                                ARTICLE II

                         MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS

     Section 1.  All meetings of the shareholders shall be held in the City
of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or at such other places within or without
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as the board of directors may designate.

     Section 2.  The annual meeting of the shareholders shall be held in
either the months of May or June of each year on such date as may be
determined by the board of directors at least sixty days in advance of such
meeting and, in the event the board of directors fails to determine a
meeting date, the meeting shall be held on the third Wednesday of May at
4:30 P.M., if not a legal holiday and if a legal holiday then on the fourth
Wednesday of May, when they shall elect, by a plurality vote, by ballot,
such number of directors for such terms as provided in Article III, Section
1, of these by-laws, to serve until their successors are elected or chosen
and qualify, and transact such other business as may properly be brought
before the meeting.

     Section 3.  Special meetings of the shareholders, for any purpose or
purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the articles of
incorporation, may be called at any time by the president, or a majority of
the board of directors, or the holders of at least twenty percent of all
the shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the particular
meeting, upon written request delivered to the secretary of the
corporation.  Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the
proposed meeting.  Upon receipt of any such request, it shall be the duty
of the secretary to call a special meeting of the shareholders to be held
at such time, not less than ten or more than sixty days thereafter, as the
secretary may fix.  If the secretary shall neglect to issue such call, the
person or persons making the request may issue the call.

     Section 4.  Written notice of every meeting of the shareholders,
specifying the place, date and hour and the general nature of the business
of the meeting, shall be served upon or mailed, postage prepaid, at least
ten days prior to the meeting, unless a greater period of notice is
required by statute, to each shareholder.

     Section 5.  The officer having charge of the transfer books for shares
of the corporation shall prepare and make at least ten days before each
meeting of shareholders, a complete list of the shareholders entitled to
notice of the meeting and a complete list of the shareholders entitled to
vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address and
the number of shares held by each which lists shall be kept on file at the
principal office of the corporation and shall be subject to inspection by
any shareholder at any time during usual business hours.  Such lists shall
also be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and
shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder during the whole time
of the meeting.

     Section 6.  Business transacted at all special meetings of
shareholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice.

     Section 7.  The holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall
be requisite and shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the
shareholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided
by statute or by the articles of incorporation or by these by-laws.  The
shareholders present in person or by proxy at a duly convened meeting can
continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal
of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum.  If, however, any
meeting of shareholders cannot be organized because a quorum has not
attended, the shareholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or
by proxy, shall have power, except as otherwise provided by statute, to
adjourn the meeting to such time and place as they may determine, but in
the case of any meeting called for the election of directors such meeting
may be adjourned from day to day or for such longer periods not exceeding
fifteen days each as the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to
vote present in person or by proxy shall direct, and those who attend the
second of such adjourned meetings, although less than a quorum, shall
nevertheless constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing directors.  At
any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting
as originally notified.

     Section 8.  When a quorum is present or represented at any meeting,
the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares having voting powers,
present in person or represented by proxy, shall decide any question
brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by
express provision of the statutes or of the articles of incorporation or of
these by-laws, a different vote is required in which case such express
provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.

     Section 9.  Each shareholder shall at every meeting of the
shareholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share
having voting power held by such shareholder, but no proxy shall be voted
on or after three years from its date, unless coupled with an interest,
and, except where the transfer books of the corporation have been closed or
a date has been fixed as a record date for the determination of its
shareholders entitled to vote, transferees of shares which are transferred
on the books of the corporation within ten days next preceding the date of
such meeting shall not be entitled to vote at such meeting.  In each
election for directors, every shareholder entitled to vote shall have the
right, in person or by proxy, to multiply the number of votes to which he
may be entitled by the total number of directors to be elected in the same
election, and he may cast the whole number of such votes for one candidate
or he may distribute them among any two or more candidates.  The candidates
receiving the highest number of votes up to the number of directors to be
elected shall be elected.

     Section 10.  In advance of any meeting of shareholders, the board of
directors may appoint judges of election, who need not be shareholders, to
act at such meeting or any adjournment thereof.  If judges of election be
not so appointed, the chairman of any such meeting may and, on the request
of any shareholder entitled to vote or his proxy, shall make such
appointment at the meeting.  The number of judges shall be one or three.
If appointed at a meeting on the request of one or more shareholders
entitled to vote or proxies, the majority of shares present and entitled to
vote shall determine whether one or three judges are to be appointed.  No
person who is a candidate for office shall act as a judge.  The judges of
election shall do all such acts as may be proper to conduct the election or
vote with fairness to all shareholders, and shall make a written report of
any matter determined by them and execute a certificate of any fact found
by them, if requested by the chairman of the meeting or any shareholder
entitled to vote or his proxy.  If there be three judges of election the
decision, act or certificate of a majority, shall be effective in all
respects as the decision, act or certificate of all.


                                ARTICLE III

serve until the expiration of the term of the class to which he is elected
and until his successor is elected by the shareholders.

     Section 3.  The business of the corporation shall be managed by its
board of directors which may exercise all such powers of the corporation
and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the
articles of incorporation or by these by-laws directed or required to be
exercised and done by the shareholders.
     Section 4.  No person shall be eligible to be nominated or elected as
a director if at the time of such nomination or election such person has
attained the age of Seventy (70) years.  Any director who attains the age
of Seventy (70) years during the terms of his directorship shall be
permitted to continue to serve In such capacity for the remainder of his

     Section 9.  At all meetings of the board a majority of the directors
in office shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of

articles of incorporation.. One or more directors may participate in a
meeting of the board of directors by means of a conference telephone or
similar communications equipment by means of which all persons
participating in the meeting can hear each other.  If a quorum shall not be

party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,

the corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or
officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including
attorneys, fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe his conduct was unlawful.  The termination of any action, suit or
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of

corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

     Section 2.  The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or
officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including
attorneys, fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with
the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith
and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interest of the corporation.  No such indemnification against expenses
shall be made, however, in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to
which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or
misconduct in the performance of his duty to the corporation unless and
only to the extent that the Court of Common Pleas of the county in which
the registered office of the corporation is located or the court in which
such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that,
despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances
of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for
such expenses which the Court of Common Pleas or such other court shall
deem proper.

     Section 3.  Indemnification under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article
shall be made by the corporation when ordered by a court or upon a
determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in
the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in those Sections.  Such determination shall be made (1) by the board
of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who
were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a
quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested
directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or
(3) by the stockholders.

     Section 4.  In addition to and notwithstanding the limited
indemnification provided in Sections 1, 2 and 3 of this Article, the
corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless its present and future
officers and directors of, from and against any and all liability, expenses
(including attorneys' fees), claims, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement, actually incurred by such person in connection with any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (including but not limited to any
action by or in the right of the corporation), to which such person is, was
or at any time becomes, a party, or is threatened to be made a party, by
reason of the fact that such person is, was or at any time becomes, a
director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving or at any time
serves at the request of the corporation, as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
person of any nature whatsoever.  Nothing contained in this Section 4 shall
authorize the corporation to provide, or entitle any officer or director to
receive, indemnification for any action taken, or failure to act, which
action or failure to act is determined by a court to have constituted
willful misconduct or recklessness.

     Section 5.  Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action,
suit or proceeding of the kind described in Sections 1, 2 and 4 of this
Article shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of the person who may be entitled to
indemnification under those Sections, to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the
corporation.

     Section 6.  The indemnification, advancement of expenses and
limitation of liability provided in this Article shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the corporation and
shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
such a person.

     Section 7.  Nothing herein contained shall be construed as limiting
the power or obligation of the corporation to indemnify any person in
accordance with the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law as amended from
time to time or in accordance with any similar law adopted in lieu thereof.
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided under this Article
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking
indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any
agreement, vote of shareholders or directors, or otherwise, both as to
action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding that office.

     Section 8.  The corporation shall also indemnify any person against
expenses, including attorneys, fees, actually and reasonably incurred by
him in enforcing any right to indemnification under this Article, under the
Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law as amended from time to time or under
any similar law adopted in lieu thereof.

     Section 9.  Any person who shall serve as director, officer, employee
or agent of the corporation or who shall serve, at the request of the
corporation, as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall
be deemed to do so with,knowledge of and in reliance upon the rights of
indemnification provided in this Article, in the Pennsylvania Business
Corporation Law as amended from time to time and in any similar law adopted
in lieu thereof.


                                 INSURANCE

     Section 10.  The corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request
of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against
any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such
capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the
corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability.


                    LIMITATION OF DIRECTORS' LIABILITY

     Section 11.  No director of this corporation shall be personally
liable for monetary damages as such for any action taken, or failure to
take any action, on or after January 27, 1987, unless (a) the director has
breached or failed to perform the duties of his office under Section 8363
of Title 42 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes Annotated (relating
to the standard of care and justifiable reliance of directors); and (b) the
breach or failure to perform constitutes self dealing, willful misconduct
or recklessness; provided, however that the provisions of this Section 11
shall not apply to the responsibility or liability of a director pursuant
to any criminal statute, or the liability of a director for the payment of
taxes pursuant to local, state or federal law.
