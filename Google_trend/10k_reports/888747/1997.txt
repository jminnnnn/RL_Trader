         ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

         GENERAL

                   Tommy Hilfiger Corporation (the "Company"), through
         its subsidiaries, designs, sources and markets designer men's
         sportswear and boyswear, including woven shirts, knit shirts,
         pants, swimwear, sweaters, outerwear and athletic wear.  These
         offerings are complemented by collections of men's tailored
         clothing, dress shirts, denim products, neckwear, socks,
         underwear, belts, small leather goods, sleepwear, robes,
         golfwear, footwear, sunglasses, prescription eyewear, women's
         casualwear and men's and women's fragrances, among others,
         bearing the TOMMY HILFIGER [R] trademark, which are
         produced and sold pursuant to certain licensing arrangements.
         Tommy Hilfiger is the Company's principal designer and provides
         leadership and direction for all aspects of the design process.
         The Company's sportswear is designed to combine classic
         American styling with unique details and fit to give time-
         honored basics a fresh and updated look for customers who
         desire high quality, designer clothes at competitive prices.
         The Company was organized under the laws of the British Virgin
         Islands in June 1992.

                   The Company's principal growth strategy has been to
         expand its in-store shop program, whereby participating
         retailers set aside floor space highlighted by distinctive
         fixtures dedicated for the exclusive sale of the Company's
         products by the retailer.  The Company expects to continue to
         pursue this strategy by increasing the number and size of its
         in-store shops in the United States and internationally.  In
         the United States, the men's in-store shop program totaled
         1,046 shops at March 31, 1997 compared with 866 shops at the
         end of fiscal 1996.  In addition, as of March 31, 1997 the
         Company had established 1,069 fixtured areas in department
         stores where its boyswear is sold compared with 872 at the end
         of fiscal 1996.  In addition, the Company continues its program
         to expand certain existing shops.

                   In addition to continuing to expand the in-store shop
         program, the Company plans to grow by broadening its range of
         product offerings, both in-house and through licensing
         arrangements, and by expanding its channels of distribution.
         Through the expansion of its product lines, the Company
         believes it will serve a wider variety of customer needs.
         Since 1992, the Company has introduced several in-house
         products, including boyswear, swimwear, athletic wear, caps and
         bags.  Additionally, the Company has introduced new products
         through licensing agreements including, in fiscal 1997, a
         women's fragrance pursuant to its license with Aramis, Inc., a
         division of Estee Lauder Companies, prescription eyewear with
         Liberty Optical, footwear with the Stride Rite Corporation and
         women's casual wear marketed under a license with Pepe Jeans
         London Corporation.  See "Merchandising Strategies - Licensing
         and Distributorships."

                   The Company is also pursuing several strategies to
         expand its channels of distribution in the retail arena.  As of
         March 31, 1997, the Company operated 47 outlet stores and eight
         specialty retail stores and currently plans to open
         approximately eight additional outlet stores, as well as one
         additional specialty retail store in London, England, by March
         31, 1998.  The Company also plans to open flagship stores in
         Beverly Hills, California and London, England, by March 31,
         1998 and March 31, 1999, respectively.  See "Merchandising
         Strategies - Retailing."

                   The Company is engaged in principally one industry
         segment, the design, importation and distribution of men's
         sportswear and childrenswear.  Accordingly, no information is
         being furnished herein or in the accompanying financial
         statements relating to industry segments of the Company.


                                        3<PAGE>


         MERCHANDISING STRATEGIES

         WHOLESALE

                   The Company's products, the majority of which are
         manufactured of cotton and other natural fibers, are generally
         pre-washed and generously sized to emphasize comfort and are
         designed to allow consumers to blend items across its product
         lines.  The Company organizes its menswear and boyswear
         collections into three primary product lines:  Core, Core Plus
         and Fashion.  The boyswear line is available in boys' and young
         men's sizes 4 through 20 and is being sold by the Company to
         many of the same department and specialty store customers as
         its menswear lines.  In fiscal 1998, the Company plans to
         introduce an infant and toddler line.  This line is expected to
         be available at retail for Holiday 1997.

         Core

                   The Core line is comprised of the Company's
         seasonless products or "basics", such as the pleated chino pant
         and short, the solid knit polo shirt, the button-down oxford,
         T-shirts and jackets, all in classic solid colors.  Core items
         are made available for sale by the Company throughout the year
         and, therefore, generally are kept in stock by the Company.
         Since Core items are seasonless, they do not have fixed selling
         periods and, therefore, retailers' inventories of Core products
         tend to be maintained throughout the year and reordered as
         necessary.  The Company receives orders from most of its larger
         customers for Core products on an electronic data interchange
         ("EDI") system, which expedites reorders.  See "Management
         Information Systems."

         Core Plus

                   The Core Plus line is comprised of a broad selection
         of seasonal "basics" which are derived from Core but offer a
         greater variety of fabrics, colors and patterns, such as
         stripes and plaids.  The Core Plus line also incorporates
         certain Fashion products that had previously been successful at
         retail.  The Company sells four different seasonal groups of
         Core Plus products each year.  As compared to Fashion items,
         Core Plus items provide the retailer with longer selling
         periods at regular prices.  Because Core Plus is a broader
         product category than Fashion, with a longer regular-price
         selling period, the Company's shipping deadlines are more
         flexible and the Company may be able to place reorders when
         demand is high.

         Fashion

                   The Fashion line represents the most updated
         component of the Company's product line.  Fashion items consist
         of a group of product classifications coordinated around a
         seasonal theme selected by Tommy Hilfiger.  The Company offers
         Fashion products under at least three themes per season,
         thereby creating a continual flow of new merchandise in the
         marketplace.

         LICENSING AND DISTRIBUTORSHIPS

                   In connection with the Company's business strategy of
         expanding its market penetration through product line and
         geographic expansion, the Company considers entering into
         licensing and distribution agreements with respect to certain
         products if the Company believes such arrangements provide more
         effective manufacturing, distribution and marketing of such
         products than could be achieved in-house.  The  Company
         continually pursues new opportunities in product categories
         which are believed to be complementary to its existing product
         lines.


                                        4<PAGE>


         Product Licenses

                   Since Fall 1992, the Company has introduced several
         product lines through license arrangements with companies which
         are among industry leaders in their respective categories.  In
         addition to the women's fragrance, prescription eyewear,
         footwear and women's casual wear, during 1997 the Company
         signed a licensing agreement with Lantis Eyewear Corporation to
         produce a complete line of men's sunglasses, which will be
         introduced at retail during fiscal 1998.


                   The following table summarizes the Company's
         significant product licensing and distributorship arrangements
         in the United States as of March 31, 1997:

         licensing agreement with Revman Industries, Inc. to produce and
         market a line of linens, bedding, bath products and related
         accessories.

                   Each of the license arrangements described above is
         an exclusive license, except for two such licenses which permit
         the Company and/or certain of the Company's licensees and
         certain distributors of the Company's products to continue
         distributing certain products that overlap with products
         covered by the licenses.  The Company does not believe that
         termination of any individual license arrangement would be
         material to the Company.


                                        5<PAGE>

         Geographic Licenses and Distributorships

                   In July 1991, the Company granted an exclusive
         license to an affiliate of a director of the Company and the
         Chief Executive Officer of Tommy Hilfiger (HK) Limited
         ("THHK"), a subsidiary of the Company, to sell the Company's
         products in Canada.  The term of the agreement is 10 years and
         is renewable at the option of the licensee subject to specified
         volume limitations and other conditions.  In addition, the
         Company has granted an exclusive distributorship to an
         unaffiliated Panamanian company to distribute the Company's
         products in Central America, Venezuela, Columbia, Chile,
         Ecuador and most of the nations of the Caribbean basin.  The
         Company also granted to an unaffiliated third party the right
         to designate a licensee to sell the Company's products in
         India.

                   In May 1995, the Company granted an exclusive
         distributorship to an unaffiliated Mexican company to
         distribute the Company's products in Mexico.  The term of the
         agreement is three years and is renewable at the option of the
         licensee subject to certain limitations. 

                   Effective July 1, 1996, the Company entered into an
         exclusive license agreement for Japan with Novel-ITC Licensing
         Limited, a related party.  The term of this agreement is 4.5
         years and is renewable at the option of the licensee subject to
         certain conditions.

                   Effective February 1, 1997, the Company entered into
         a licensing agreement with Pepe Jeans London Corporation to
         distribute the Company's men's and boys' sportswear (excluding
         jeanswear and jeans related apparel) throughout the European
         market.  The term of this agreement is five years and is
         renewable at the option of the licensee subject to certain
         conditions.

                   All of the Company's licensees and distributors are
         required to contribute to the advertisement and promotion of
         TOMMY HILFIGER [R] products a percentage of their net sales 
         of TOMMY HILFIGER [R] products or a percentage of their net 
         purchases of TOMMY HILFIGER [R] products (depending on the 
         terms of the license or distributorship agreement), subject to 
         minimum amounts.

         RETAILING

                   The Company is pursuing several strategies to expand
         its channels of distribution in the retail arena.

                   The Company believes its outlet strategy has
         positioned it to take advantage of an expanding segment of the
         retail apparel industry that appeals to customers' increasing
         value orientation and provides the Company with an additional
         channel of distribution and better control over the sale of its
         inventory.  The Company stocks its outlet stores with a mixture
         of out-of-season products as well as first-quality products
         manufactured specifically for its outlet stores' customers.  As
         of March 31, 1997 the Company operated 47 outlet stores and
         currently plans to open approximately eight additional outlet
         stores by March 31, 1998.  The Company's outlet stores are
         located primarily in major outlet centers in the United States.

                   The TOMMY HILFIGER [R] specialty retail stores
         enable the Company to reach consumers who prefer the
         environment of a specialty store.  The Company believes that
         these stores, which serve as a showcase for both the sportswear
         and certain licensed product lines, will complement its
         wholesale business by increasing brand awareness.  As of March
         31, 1997, the Company operated eight specialty retail stores.
         In fiscal 1997, the Company signed a lease agreement for a
         specialty store in London, England.  This store is expected to
         open in fiscal 1998.  As a result of the shop expansion
         program, the Company has refined its specialty retail strategy.
         These shops are the Company's vision for specialty retailing in
         malls, therefore, the Company does not plan to expand its
         existing base of specialty retail stores.  See "Properties".


                                        6<PAGE>
                  
                   During fiscal 1996, the Company signed a lease for
         the first TOMMY HILFIGER [R] Flagship store, located on
         Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California.  During fiscal 1997,
         the Company signed an agreement for the lease of a TOMMY
         HILFIGER [R] Flagship store in London, England.  These
         stores, which are expected to open in fiscal 1998 and fiscal
         1999, respectively, will serve as showcases for all of the
         Company's products as it seeks to propel the brand into the
         elite circle of designers with international recognition.  This
         investment underlines the Company's strong belief in the role
         of flagships as image builders.  These stores are planned to be
         followed by flagships in key markets such as New York City.

         DESIGN

                   Tommy Hilfiger is the Company's principal designer
         and provides leadership and direction for all aspects of the
         design process.  Tommy Hilfiger selects designers on the basis
         of their understanding of the retail industry and their ability
         to understand what consumers desire and which designs are most
         likely to be commercially viable.  Design teams, which are
         typically comprised of a designer and assistant designer, are
         responsible for separate product classifications.  In addition,
         the Company has a senior designer, whose responsibility is to
         coordinate the design teams.  Design teams utilize computer
         aided designs, which provide timely translation of designs into
         sample depictions varying in color, cut and style, the speed of
         production and breadth of the resulting output assist the
         Company in selecting desirable designs for the sourcing and
         research and development staffs to assess.

         RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

                   The Company employs a senior production executive who
         oversees a staff whose primary functions are to identify ways
         to develop new designs and products more efficiently, and to
         identify new and more cost-effective sourcing methods.  This
         group receives new product direction from Tommy Hilfiger and
         then researches and develops the potential product.  This
         process is designed to avoid costly attempts to develop
         products that require designs or production methods that are
         not efficient.  In addition, the staff researches and
         identifies new sources for both fabrics and manufacturing
         worldwide in order to control or reduce manufacturing costs
         while maintaining the Company's quality standards.

         SALES AND MARKETING

                   TOMMY HILFIGER [R] products are sold in over
         2,000 department and specialty retail store locations.  The
         Company's department store customers include major United
         States retailers such as Dillard Department Stores, Federated
         Department Stores (including Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and
         Burdines), The May Department Stores Company (including Lord &
         Taylor and Foley's), Belk Stores and Dayton Hudson.  The
         Company believes that its relationships with major retailers,
         including the active sales involvement of the Company's senior
         management, are important elements of its marketing strategy.
         The Company's strategy is to continue to grow by broadening its
         United States in-store shop program, expanding its product
         lines and marketing to new customers both in the United States
         and internationally.

                   A significant aspect of the Company's ability to
         increase the commitment of its existing customers and to
         attract new customers is its in-store shop program, whereby
         participating retailers set aside floor space highlighted by
         distinctive fixtures dedicated for exclusive sale of the
         Company's products by the retailer.  This program enables the
         retailer to create an environment consistent with the Company's
         image and to display and stock a greater volume of the
         Company's products per square foot of retail space. Such shops
         encourage longer term commitment by the retailer to the
         Company's products, including the retailer's provision of
         upgraded staffing.  These shops also increase consumer product
         recognition and loyalty because of the retail customer's
         familiarity with the location of the Company's products in the
         store.  A program of installing distinctive fixtures in certain
         department stores which carry the boyswear line was implemented
         in fiscal 1994.  The continued expansion of the Company's in-
         store shop 


                                        7<PAGE>
                  
         and fixturing programs is dependent on market conditions,
         including continued demand for the Company's products.

                   The Company's sales and marketing departments have
         individuals located in the Company's New York headquarters,
         Atlanta and Dallas showrooms and Los Angeles, Chicago,
         Philadelphia, San Francisco and Cincinnati regional sales
         territories.  The sales force sells only the TOMMY HILFIGER
         [R] collection.

                   The Company employs a staff of approximately 120
         merchandise coordinators located throughout the United States.
         These merchandisers educate the retailers' salespeople about
         the Company's current products, provide the Company with first-
         hand consumer feedback concerning consumer reaction to the
         Company's products and coordinate the in-store displays with
         the department stores.  In addition to the coordinator program,
         the Company also conducts a training program for the department
         stores' TOMMY HILFIGER [R] selling specialists.  The program is 
         designed to educate specialists on the Company's image and 
         merchandising standards and to promote the development and 
         servicing of clientele.  The program educates specialists in 
         customer assistance and advice, including merchandise selection 
         and the coordination of complete outfits of TOMMY HILFIGER [R] 
         products.  Over 1,000 specialists have completed the program.

                   The Company sells substantially all its out-of-season
         products, which are principally from the Fashion and Core Plus
         product lines, to certain discount retailers and through its
         Company owned outlet stores.  The net revenues from such sales
         represented less than 15% of the Company's net revenue for each
         of the last three fiscal years.

         ADVERTISING, PUBLIC RELATIONS AND PROMOTION

                   The Company believes that advertising to promote and
         enhance the TOMMY HILFIGER [R] brand and the image of TOMMY 
         HILFIGER [R] products is important to its long- term growth 
         strategy.  All of the Company's licensees and distributors are 
         required to contribute to the advertisement and promotion of 
         TOMMY HILFIGER [R] products a percentage of their net sales of 
         TOMMY HILFIGER [R] products or a percentage of their net 
         purchases of TOMMY HILFIGER [R] products (depending on the 
         terms of the license or distributorship agreement), subject to 
         minimum amounts.  Advertising by the Company, its licensees 
         and most of its distributors is coordinated by the Company and 
         principally appears in magazines, newspapers, and outdoor 
         advertising media.  In addition, selected personal appearances 
         by Tommy Hilfiger, corporate sponsorships and charitable 
         programs are utilized to further enhance awareness of the 
         Company's image and promote the Company's products.  The 
         Company employs an advertising and public relations staff to 
         implement these efforts.

         SOURCING

                   The Company's sourcing strategy is to contract for
         the manufacture of its products.  Outsourcing allows the
         Company to maximize production flexibility while avoiding
         significant capital expenditures, work-in-process inventory
         buildups and the costs of managing a large production work
         force.  The Company inspects products manufactured by
         contractors to determine whether they meet the Company's
         standards.  See "Quality Control."

                   The Company imports most of its finished goods
         because it believes it can import higher quality products at
         lower costs.  Management maintains extensive and long-term
         relationships with leading manufacturers in the Far East,
         including manufacturers located in Indonesia, Thailand and
         Taiwan, among other countries.  The Company monitors duty,
         tariff and quota-related developments and continually seeks to
         minimize its potential exposure to duty, tariff and quota-
         related risks through, among other measures, geographical
         diversification of its manufacturing sources, the maintenance
         of its buying offices in Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and India,
         allocation of production to 


                                        8<PAGE>
                  
         merchandise categories where more quota is available and shifts
         of production among countries and manufacturers.

                   The Company's production and sourcing staff oversees
         all aspects of apparel manufacturing and production, the
         negotiation for raw materials and research and development of
         new products and sources.  The Company operates buying offices
         based in Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and India, as well as the
         United States which perform product development, sourcing,
         production scheduling and quality control.  In addition, the
         Company contracts with various buying subagents and perform
         similar services for the Company's licensees and distributors
         in Canada, Mexico, Japan and Panama, which services Central and
         South America, for specified commissions.

                   The Company has its products manufactured according
         to plans prepared each year which reflect prior years'
         experience, current fashion trends, economic conditions and
         management estimates of a line's performance.  The Company
         separately negotiates with suppliers for the sale of required
         raw materials which are then purchased by its contractors in
         accordance with the Company's specifications.  The Company
         limits its exposure to holding excess inventory by committing
         to purchase a portion of total projected demand and the
         Company, in its experience, has been able to satisfy its excess
         demand through reorders.  The Company believes that its policy
         of limiting its commitments for purchases early in the season
         reduces its exposure to excess inventory and obsolescence.

                   The Company does not have long-term formal
         arrangements with any of its suppliers; however, the Company
         has experienced only limited difficulty in satisfying its raw
         material and finished goods requirements.  Although the loss of
         such suppliers could have a significant effect on the Company's
         immediate operating results, the Company believes it could
         replace such suppliers without a material adverse effect on the
         Company.

                   The Company has its executive offices in Hong Kong
         and its principal buying offices in Hong Kong and Macau.  Hong
         Kong is presently a British Crown Colony, but sovereignty over
         Hong Kong will be transferred effective July 1, 1997 from the
         United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China ("China").
         Macau is presently a Portuguese colony, but sovereignty over
         Macau will be transferred effective January 1, 1999 from the
         Republic of Portugal to China.  If Hong Kong or Macau were to
         impose income or withholding taxes on the Company or in the
         event of an adverse change in their business climate, the
         Company believes it could relocate its executive and principal
         buying offices without a material adverse effect on the
         Company.

         QUALITY CONTROL

                   The Company's quality control program is designed to
         ensure that purchased goods meet the Company's standards.  The
         Company inspects prototypes of each product prior to cutting by
         the contractors and performs two in-line inspections and a
         final inspection prior to shipment.  All finished goods are
         shipped to the Company's New Jersey facilities for re-
         inspection and distribution.  While the Company's return policy
         permits customers to return defective products for credit, less
         than 1% of the Company's shipments in fiscal 1997 were returned
         as defective under this policy.

         MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

                   The Company believes that high levels of automation
         and technology are essential to maintain its competitive
         position and the Company continues to invest in computer
         hardware, systems applications and networks to enhance and to
         speed the apparel design process, to support the sale and
         distribution of products to its customers and to improve the
         integration and efficiency of its United States and Far East
         operations.  The Company utilizes computer-aided design
         stations for use by Tommy Hilfiger and his design teams, which
         provide timely translations of designs into sample depiction's
         varying in color, cut and style.  The Company also uses an EDI
         system to receive on-line orders from its customers and to
         accumulate sales information on its 


                                        9<PAGE>
                  
         products.  The EDI technology enables the Company to provide
         valuable sales information and inventory maintenance
         information services to its customers who have adopted such
         technology.  Nine of the Company's 10 largest customers
         communicate with the Company through EDI technology.

         DISTRIBUTION

                   Wholesale distribution is centralized in a 360,000
         square foot New Jersey facility to which all products are
         shipped.  The facility is operated and principally staffed by
         an independent contractor who charges the Company on the basis
         of the number of items processed, subject to a minimum annual
         fee.  The Company has the right, at any time during the
         contract period, to terminate the distribution agreement by
         making a specified payment.  In addition, the Company leases a
         200,000 square foot facility in New Jersey for retail
         distribution.  The Company maintains its distribution
         management group and certain administrative functions at its
         New Jersey facilities.  The Company believes that these
         distribution facilities are adequate for the Company's current
         level of sales, and provide the Company with enough space and
         flexibility to support the continued growth of the Company's
         business.


         CREDIT AND COLLECTION

                   The Company collects substantially all of its
         receivables through a credit company pursuant to an agreement
         whereby the credit company pays the Company after the credit
         company receives payment from the Company's customer.  If the
         customer becomes bankrupt or insolvent or the receivable
         becomes 120 days past due, the credit company pays the Company
         50% of the outstanding receivable.  The credit company
         establishes maximum credit limits for each customer account.
         Substantially all accounts receivable are pledged as collateral
         under a bank financing agreement.

                   Despite the bankruptcy of several large retailers in
         recent years, the Company has not experienced any increase in
         its bad debts.  Bad debts as a percentage of net sales were
         less than 0.1% in fiscal 1997.

                   On April 8, 1997, the Company amended and extended
         the terms of the agreement with the credit company.  Under the
         new terms, in exchange for a reduction of the fees charged by
         the credit company, the term of the agreement was extended to
         March 2001.

         TRADEMARKS

                   The Company utilizes four principal registered
         trademarks which it owns:  the name TOMMY HILFIGER [R],
         the Company's distinctive flag logo, the crest and the green
         eyelet the Company uses on certain of its products.  Tommy
         Hilfiger Licensing, Inc. ("THLI"), a subsidiary of Tommy
         Hilfiger U.S.A. Inc. ("TH USA") which is a subsidiary of the
         Company, has registered these trademarks for use in the United
         States and has registered or applied for registration of these
         trademarks in numerous countries in North America, Europe,
         Asia, South America and elsewhere.  The Company regards its
         trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets in
         the marketing of its products. THLI is a party to an agreement
         with Mr. Hilfiger that restricts the sale, lease, license or
         other conveyance of THLI's trademarks, the amendment of the
         license agreement between THLI and TH USA or the creation of
         any lien on THLI trademarks without Mr. Hilfiger's consent
         until Mr. Hilfiger's death or his termination of employment
         with TH USA without the consent of TH USA.


         BACKLOG

                   The Company generally receives orders approximately
         three to five months prior to the time the products are
         delivered to stores.  Thus, the Company's backlog of orders,
         which the Company believes, based on industry practice and past
         experience, will result 


                                        10<PAGE>

         
         in sales, at March 31, 1997 represents a significant portion of
         the Company's expected sales through September 30, 1997.  At
         March 31, 1997, the Company's backlog of orders was
         approximately $283 million, compared to approximately $216
         million at March 31, 1996.  The Company's backlog depends upon
         a number of factors, including the timing of "market weeks"
         during which a significant percentage of the Company's orders
         are received and the timing of shipments.  Accordingly, a
         comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily
         meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual
         shipments.

         SEASONALITY; UNCERTAINTIES IN APPAREL RETAILING

                   The Company's business is impacted by the general
         seasonal trends that are characteristic of many companies in
         the apparel industry in which sales and profits are highest in
         the fourth calendar quarter.  However, due primarily to the
         significant growth that the Company has experienced, quarterly
         sales and profit trends and working capital requirements did
         not reflect the normal apparel industry seasonality.  In future
         years, the Company expects its seasonal sales and profits will
         more closely reflect typical apparel and retail industry trends
         than they have in the past.

                   The apparel industry historically has been subject to
         substantial cyclical variations.  Although the Company's recent
         results have not been substantially impacted by such
         variations, a recession in the general economy or uncertainties
         regarding future economic prospects that effect consumer
         spending habits could have a material effect on the Company's
         results of operations.

         COMPETITION

                   The men's sportswear segment of the apparel industry
         is highly competitive.  Specifically, the Company encounters
         substantial competition in the designer men's sportswear
         business, including competition from Polo/Ralph Lauren,
         Nautica, Perry Ellis, Calvin Klein and Claiborne, as well as
         from certain non-designer lines.  Some of the Company's
         competitors are significantly larger and more diversified, and
         have substantially greater resources, than the Company.  The
         Company competes primarily on the basis of fashion, price,
         quality and service.  The Company believes its competitive
         position depends upon its ability to anticipate and respond
         effectively to changing consumer demands and to offer fashion
         conscious customers a wide variety of high quality apparel at
         competitive prices.

                   The boyswear segment of the apparel industry is also
         highly competitive.  The Company's competition in this market
         is primarily Polo/Ralph Lauren and certain non-designer lines.
         Consistent with its menswear product lines, the Company
         competes in the boyswear segment primarily on the basis of
         fashion, price, quality and service and believes that its
         competitive position depends upon its ability to anticipate and
         respond effectively to changing consumer demands.

         DEPENDENCE ON CUSTOMERS UNDER COMMON CONTROL

                   The Company's department store customers include
         major United States retailers, certain of which are under
         common ownership.  When considered together as a group under
         common ownership, sales to the department store customers which
         were owned by Federated Department Stores, Dillard Department
         Stores, and The May Department Stores Company accounted for
         approximately 23%, 21%, and 16%, respectively, of fiscal 1997
         net wholesale product sales.  A decision by the controlling
         owner of a group of department stores to decrease the amount
         purchased from the Company or to cease carrying the Company's
         products could adversely affect the Company.

                   In the past two fiscal years, the Company has not
         paid any dividends.  The Company anticipates that all of its
         earnings in the foreseeable future will be retained for the
         development and expansion of its business and, therefore, has
         no current plans to pay cash dividends.  Future dividend policy
         will depend on the Company's earnings, capital requirements,
         financial condition, restrictions imposed by the Company's
         credit agreement, availability of dividends, receipt of funds
         in connection with repayment of loans to subsidiaries or
         advances from operating subsidiaries and other factors
         considered relevant by the Board of Directors of the Company.
         For certain restrictions on the Company's ability to pay
         dividends, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
         Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and
         Capital Resources" in Item 7.

         Year Ended March 31, 1997 Compared to Year Ended March 31, 1996

                   The Company's net income increased to $86,382,000, or
         $2.28 per share, in 1997 from $61,500,000, or $1.65 per share,
         in 1996.  This represents an improvement of $24,882,000 or
         40.5%.  As a percentage of net revenue, net income increased to
         13.1% in 1997 from 12.9% in 1996.

                   Net revenue increased 38.4% to $661,688,000 in 1997
         from $478,131,000 in 1996.  This increase is a result of
         improvements in each of the Company's wholesale, retail, and
         licensing and buying agency divisions, as outlined below.

                   Wholesale net revenue increased to $479,307,000 in
         1997 from $381,239,000 in 1996, an improvement of 25.7%.  This
         improvement includes a 23.9% increase in menswear wholesale
         sales, to $405,319,000 in 1997 from $327,189,000 in 1996, and a
         36.9% increase in boyswear wholesale sales, to $73,988,000 in
         1997 from $54,050,000 in 1996.  These increases were primarily
         due to volume increases as a result of increased sales to
         existing customers, opening new in-store shops and fixtured
         areas, and the expansion of certain existing shops.  The number
         of men's in-store shops increased to 1,046 at March 31, 1997
         from 866 at March 31, 1996 while the number of boyswear
         fixtured areas increased to 1,069 at March 31, 1997 from 872 at
         March 31, 1996.  In addition to the volume increase, the change
         in product mix of the Company's wholesale sales resulted in a
         higher average unit selling price.  Of the total wholesale
         sales increase, approximately 67% was due to volume and
         approximately 33% was due to the increased average unit selling
         price.

                   Net revenue in the Company's retail division
         increased 81.6% to $149,312,000 in 1997 from $82,212,000 in
         1996.  This improvement was due to an increase in the number of
         stores open as well as increased sales at existing stores.  Of
         the total increase of $67,100,000, $31,503,000 was attributable
         to new retail stores opened during 1997.  The total number of
         retail stores open as of March 31, 1997 and 1996 was 55 and 44,
         respectively.


                                        15<PAGE>
                                        
                   Net revenue from licensing royalties and buying
         agency commissions increased 125.3% to $33,069,000 in 1997 from
         $14,680,000 in 1996.  This increase reflects the incremental
         revenue associated with newly licensed products and a general
         increase in sales from existing licensees and buying agency
         services.  Of this increase, approximately 35% was due to
         products introduced under new licenses in 1997 while the
         balance was due to licenses existing as of March 31, 1996.

                   Gross profit improved to 47.9% of net revenue in 1997
         from 46.0% of net revenue in 1996.  This increase was
         attributable to the increases in retail operations and
         royalties and buying agency commissions, each of which had
         higher percentage revenue increases, and which produce higher
         margins, than wholesale operations.  In addition, wholesale
         margins have increased due primarily to the change in mix of
         products sold.

                   Selling, general and administrative expenses
         increased as a percentage of net revenue to 28.9% in 1997 from
         27.7% in 1996.  The increased percentage was due to an increase
         in marketing and advertising expense to promote and enhance the
         brand name and the image of the Company's products.  Selling,
         general and administrative expenses increased to $190,976,000
         in 1997 from $132,270,000 in 1996.  This increase was
         principally due to increased volume-related expenses to support
         the higher revenue and the increased marketing and advertising
         expenses mentioned above.

                   The provision for taxes increased to 34.2% of income
         before taxes in 1997 from 33.4% in 1996.  This increase was
         primarily attributable to the relative level of earnings in the
         various taxing jurisdictions to which the Company's earnings
         are subject.

         Year Ended March 31, 1996 Compared to Year Ended March 31, 1995

                   Net income for 1996 improved to $61,500,000, or $1.65
         per share, from $40,715,000, or $1.12 per share, in 1995.  This
         represented an increase of $20,785,000 or 51.0%.  In addition,
         net income as a percentage of net revenue increased to 12.9% in
         1996 from 12.7% in 1995.

                   The Company's net revenue for 1996 increased to
         $478,131,000, compared to $320,985,000 in 1995.  This
         improvement of 49.0% reflects the increased demand for the
         Company's products.  Substantially all of the wholesale sales
         increase was due to volume increases, which in turn were
         primarily the result of the continuing expansion of the in-
         store shop program.  The number of men's in-store shops
         increased to 866 at March 31, 1996 from 658 at March 31, 1995
         and the number of boyswear fixtured areas increased to 872 at
         March 31, 1996 from 486 at March 31, 1995.  Increased sales to
         existing and new customers and new store locations also
         contributed to the wholesale sales increase.  Menswear
         wholesale sales improved $72,312,000 or 28.4% from $254,877,000
         in 1995 to $327,189,000 in 1996 while boyswear wholesale sales
         improved $21,815,000 or 67.7% from $32,235,000 in 1995 to
         $54,050,000 in 1996.

                   The Company's retail division also contributed to the
         increased revenue level.  Retail revenue increased $54,666,000
         or 198.5% from $27,546,000 in 1995 to $82,212,000 in 1996.
         This increase was due to the addition of 18 new stores during
         1996 as well as increased revenue in existing stores.  Of the
         total increase, $22,645,000 was attributable to new retail
         stores opened in 1996.  At March 31, 1996, a total of 44 stores
         were open.

                   Net revenue from licensing royalties and buying
         agency commissions increased 132.0% from $6,327,000 in 1995 to
         $14,680,000 in 1996.  This improvement principally resulted
         from an increase in sales of existing licensed products as well
         as the introduction of several new licensed products, including
         a men's fragrance, robes and sleepwear, and golfwear.  Of this
         increase, approximately 37% was due to products introduced
         under new licenses in 1996 while the balance was due to
         licenses existing as of March 31, 1995.

                   Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased
         from 45.6% in 1995 to 46.0% in 1996.  This increase was
         primarily attributable to the relative increase in retail
         operations and royalties and buying agency commissions, all of
         which produce higher margins than wholesale operations.
         Offsetting this increase was a decrease in wholesale margins
         which was principally the 


                                        16<PAGE>
                                        
         result of an increase in the relative level of boyswear
         products which generally produce lower margins than menswear,
         the mix of products and an overall increase in product costs.

                   Selling, general and administrative expenses
         increased to $132,270,000 in 1996 from $85,954,000 in 1995.
         This increase was primarily attributable to increased volume
         related expenses necessary to support the increase in revenue
         of the Company's wholesale and retail operations.  In addition,
         depreciation and amortization increased due to the greater
         number of in-store shops.  As a percentage of net revenue,
         selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 27.7%
         from 26.8% due to the continued expansion of the Company's
         retail division, which operates at a higher cost structure than
         its wholesale operations, and a one time charge of $2,350,000
         taken by the Company to reflect the current cost of a
         consulting agreement with a former executive.

                   The provision for income taxes decreased to 33.4% of
         income before taxes in 1996 from 35.8% in 1995.  The decrease
         was primarily attributable to the relative level of earnings in
         various taxing jurisdictions to which the Company's earnings
         are subject.


         LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

                   The Company's primary funding requirements are to
         finance working capital and the continued growth of the
         business.  This includes primarily the purchase of inventory in
         anticipation of increased sales of the wholesale and retail
         divisions as well as capital expenditures related to the
         expansion of the menswear in-store shop and boyswear fixtured
         area programs and additional retail stores.  The Company's
         sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash from operations and
         the Company's available credit.

                   The Company's cash and cash equivalents balance has
         decreased from $127,743,000 at March 31, 1996 to $109,908,000
         at March 31, 1997.  The principal reason for this decrease is
         capital expenditures, including the Company's purchase of the
         property which houses its executive offices along with its
         primary sales, marketing and licensing offices and its main
         sales and licensees' showrooms for approximately $25,875,000,
         offset in part, by cash provided by operations.

                   Net cash provided by operating activities in 1997 was
         $64,435,000, an increase of $24,776,000 over the 1996 amount of
         $39,659,000.  The primary factor that contributed to this
         increase was the increase in net income before depreciation and
         amortization offset, in part, by an increase in working
         capital.  The increase in working capital was principally due
         to a higher inventory level which is the result of a planned
         build-up in anticipation of the summer and fall seasons of
         fiscal 1998 and the increased retail division inventory due to
         the greater number of stores, as well as an increase in Core
         inventory to meet the demands of the Company's replenishment
         business.  Inventory increased from $81,428,000 at March 31,
         1996 to $123,847,000 at March 31, 1997, an increase of
         $42,419,000 or 52.1%.

                   Capital expenditures were $83,960,000 in 1997,
         compared with $28,694,000 in 1996.  The increase in capital
         expenditures was primarily related to the purchase of the
         property mentioned above as well as the expansion of the
         Company's in-store shop and fixtured area programs.  The
         Company has continued to install new in-store shops and
         fixtured areas, as well as expand several shops which were
         previously open.  The Company installed 377 menswear in-store
         shops and boyswear fixtured areas during 1997 and 594 menswear
         in-store shops and boyswear fixtured areas during 1996.
         Additionally, the Company opened 11 outlet stores in 1997.

                   In July 1996, the Company entered into an amended and
         restated revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement")
         effective April 1, 1996.  The Credit Agreement, which expires
         in June 1999, provides for direct borrowings, bankers
         acceptances and letters of credit of amounts ranging from
         $100,000,000 in fiscal 1997 to $150,000,000 in fiscal 1999.
         Available borrowings are subject to the timed increase of
         availability under the Credit Agreement and are based upon
         eligible accounts receivable, inventory and open letters of
         credit.  As of March 31, 1997, $100,000,000 was available for
         utilization under the Credit Agreement, of which 


                                        17<PAGE>
                                        
         $66,822,000 had been used to open letters of credit.
         Obligations under the Credit Agreement are collateralized by
         substantially all the assets of the Company's U.S. operations.
         Direct borrowings under the Credit Agreement, which are limited
         to $60,000,000, accrue interest at varying interest rates.

                   At March 31, 1997, total short-term borrowings of
         $5,980,000 consisted of open letters of credit for inventory
         purchased of $5,705,000 and the current portion of mortgage
         debt payable of $275,000.  Additionally, at March 31, 1997, TH
         USA was contingently liable for unexpired bank letters of
         credit of $61,117,000 related to commitments of TH USA to
         suppliers for the purchase of inventories and leases.

                   The Credit Agreement contains various covenants.
         Among other matters, the Credit Agreement includes certain
         restrictions upon capital expenditures, investments,
         indebtedness, loans and advances and transactions with related
         parties.  In addition, the Credit Agreement prohibits certain
         of the Company's operating subsidiaries, which are borrowers or
         guarantors under the Credit Agreement, from paying dividends.
         Because THC is a holding company, dividends or other advances
         from its subsidiaries will be required to fund any cash
         dividends to holders of Ordinary Shares.  The Credit Agreement
         also requires the maintenance of minimum tangible net worth and
         interest coverage ratios.  The Company was in compliance with
         all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of, and for the
         year ended, March 31, 1997.

                   Cash requirements in 1998 will primarily include
         capital expenditures relating to the in-store shop and fixtured
         area programs and the opening of approximately eight additional
         outlet stores and one additional specialty retail store, as
         well as the flagship stores in Beverly Hills, California and
         London, England.  The amount of total committed capital
         expenditures at March 31, 1997, including expenditures relating
         to these projects, was approximately $14,000,000.  The Company
         believes the amount of capital expenditures for 1998 will be
         consistent with 1997 and intends to fund cash requirements in
         1998 and future years from available cash balances, internally
         generated funds and available credit.  The Company believes
         that these resources will be sufficient to fund its cash
         requirements for such periods.

         INFLATION

                   The Company does not believe that the relatively
         moderate rates of inflation experienced over the last few years
         in the United States, where it primarily competes, have had a
         significant effect on its net revenue or profitability.  Higher
         rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign
         countries in which the Company's products are manufactured but
         have not had a material effect on the Company's net revenue or
         profitability.  The Company has been able to partially offset
         its cost increases by increasing prices or changing suppliers.

         EXCHANGE RATES

                   The Company receives United States dollars for
         substantially all of its product sales and its licensing
         revenues.  Inventory purchases from contract manufacturers
         throughout the world are denominated in United States dollars;
         however, purchase prices for the Company's products may be
         impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the
         United States dollar and the local currencies of the contract
         manufacturers, which may have the effect of increasing the
         Company's cost of goods in the future.  During the last three
         fiscal years, exchange rate fluctuations have not had a
         material impact on the Company's inventory costs; however, due
         to the number of currencies involved and the fact that not all
         foreign currencies react in the same manner against the United
         States dollar, the Company cannot quantify in any meaningful
         way the potential effect of such fluctuations on future income.
         The Company does not engage in hedging activities with respect
         to such exchange rate risk.

         RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

         Earnings Per Share.  In February 1997, the Financial Accounting
         Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement No. 128, Earnings per
         Share, which specifies the computation, presentation and
         disclosure requirements for earnings per share.  Management of
         the Company believes that adoption of Statement No. 128, which
         is required for fiscal year 1998, will not have a material
         impact on the Company's earnings per share calculation.

         Disclosure of Information about Capital Structure.  In February
         1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 129, Disclosure of
         Information about Capital Structure, which requires an entity
         to explain the pertinent rights and privileges of its various
         securities outstanding.  Management of the Company believes
         that adoption of Statement No. 129 will not have a significant
         impact on the Company's present disclosure.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS



         To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
         Tommy Hilfiger Corporation

         In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
         the index appearing under Item 14(a)(1) and (2) of this Annual
         Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects,
         the financial position of Tommy Hilfiger Corporation and its
         subsidiaries at March 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of
         their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
         years in the period ended March 31, 1997, in conformity with
         generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial
         statements are the responsibility of the Company's management;
         our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
         statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of
         these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
         standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to
         obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
         statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
         includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
         amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
         the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
         by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
         presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
         basis for the opinion expressed above.

                            TOMMY HILFIGER CORPORATION
                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


         NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         (a)  Basis of Presentation

                   The consolidated financial statements include the
         accounts of Tommy Hilfiger Corporation ("THC") and all
         majority-owned subsidiaries, including Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A.,
         Inc. ("TH USA"), Tommy Hilfiger Licensing, Inc. ("THLI"), Tommy
         Hilfiger Retail, Inc. ("THR"), Tommy Hilfiger Flagship Stores,
         Inc., Tommy Hilfiger (Eastern Hemisphere) Limited ("THEH"),
         Tommy Hilfiger (HK) Limited ("THHK") and, through June 30,
         1996, Tommy Hilfiger Nippon Co., Ltd. ("THN"), as well as THN's
         49% interest in Tommy Hilfiger Japan Co., Ltd. ("TH Japan")
         (collectively "the Company").

         (b)  Organization and Business

                   THC was incorporated as a British Virgin Islands
         company in June 1992 and acts as a holding company for each of
         the following operating subsidiaries.

                   TH USA designs and imports men's sportswear and
         boyswear for wholesale distribution under the trademark license
         agreement with THLI described below.

                   THLI licenses the use of the TOMMY HILFIGER
         [R] trademarks to TH USA, THR and other affiliates and non 
         affiliates. These agreements grant the licensee exclusive rights 
         for use of the trademarks for specified products in specified 
         geographical areas.

                   THR commenced operations in April 1993 and as of
         March 31, 1997 operated 55 retail stores.

                   THEH and THHK act as commissioned buying agents for
         TH USA, THR and certain other of THLI's licensees.

                   THN was a 90% owned subsidiary and acted as a holding
         company for the Company's interest in TH Japan, a joint venture
         with Itochu, Ltd.  TH Japan had licensed the rights to
         manufacture and distribute the majority of the Company's
         products in Japan from THLI and, in turn, sublicensed these
         rights to various Japanese companies.  The joint venture
         terminated on June 30, 1996 and THN was dissolved in November
         1996.

         (c)  Basis of Consolidation

                   All significant intercompany balances and
         transactions have been eliminated.  The Company accounted for
         its interest in TH Japan on the equity basis.

         (d)  Cash, and Cash Equivalents and Investments

                   The Company considers all financial instruments
         purchased with original maturities of three months or less to
         be cash equivalents.

                   Short-term investments include investments with an
         original maturity of greater than three months and a remaining
         maturity of less than one year.  These investments are carried
         at market value and are classified as trading securities.

                   In determining realized gains and losses, the cost of
         securities sold is based upon specific identification.


                                       F-7<PAGE>
          
         (e)  Inventories

                   Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (weighted
         average method) or market.

         (f)  Property and Equipment

                   Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
         method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging
         from three to twenty-five years.  Leasehold improvements are
         amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the
         terms of the leases or the estimated useful lives of the
         assets.  The Company's share of the cost of constructing in-
         store shop displays is capitalized and amortized using the
         straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. These
         costs are included in "Furniture and fixtures".  Major
         additions and betterments are capitalized and repairs and
         maintenance are charged to operations in the period incurred.

         (g)  Income Taxes

                   The Company has recorded its provision for income
         taxes under the liability method.  Under this method, deferred
         tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences
         between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
         liabilities using presently enacted tax rates.

         (h)  Earnings Per Share and Share Equivalents

                   During fiscal 1995, the Company announced that its
         Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split, effected
         in the form of a 100% stock dividend, payable to shareholders
         of record at the close of business on December 27, 1994.
         Earnings per share and share equivalents for all periods
         presented reflect the stock split.

         (i)  Revenues

                   Net revenues from wholesale product sales are
         recognized upon shipment of products to customers.  Allowances
         for estimated returns and discounts are provided when sales are
         recorded.  Retail store revenues are recognized at the time of
         sale.  Licensing royalties and buying agency fees are
         recognized as earned. 

                   Net wholesale sales to major customers, based upon
         their ownership at March 31, 1997, as a percentage of total net
         wholesale sales for the three-year period ended March 31, 1997
         were as follows:
                                         
                                         Fiscal Year Ended March 31,

         (j)  Foreign Currency Translation

                   The consolidated financial statements of the Company
         are prepared in United States dollars as this is the currency
         of the primary economic environment in which the Company
         operates, and substantially all of its revenues are received
         and expenses are disbursed in United States dollars.  The
         financial statements of non-United States entities are
         translated into United States dollars in accordance with
         Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 52.
         Under this translation method, adjustments resulting from
         translating the financial statements of the non-United States
         entities are recorded in shareholders' equity.

         (k)  Segment Information

                   The Company is engaged in principally one industry
         segment, the design, importation and distribution of men's
         sportswear and childrenswear.

                   Substantially all of the Company's net revenue and
         income from operations are derived from, and identifiable
         assets (other than the collateralized time deposits mentioned
         in Note 4 which are located in Hong Kong) are located in, the
         United States and, therefore, constitute foreign operations in
         that the Company is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands.

         (l)  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

                   The fair values of short-term borrowings and long-
         term debt approximate their carrying values as these financial
         instruments bear interest at variable market rates.  The fair
         value of the Company's other monetary assets and liabilities
         approximate carrying value due to the relatively short-term
         nature of these items.

         (m)  Advertising Costs

                   Advertising costs are charged to operations when
         incurred and totaled $19,651,000, $7,929,000 and $7,358,000
         during the years ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,
         respectively.

         (n)  Use of Estimates

                   The preparation of financial statements in conformity
         with generally accepted accounting principles requires
         management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
         reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
         contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
         statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
         during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from
         those estimates.


         NOTE 2 - ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

                   TH USA collects substantially all of its receivables
         through a credit company pursuant to an agreement whereby the
         credit company pays TH USA after the credit company receives
         payment from the Company's customer.  If the customer becomes
         bankrupt or insolvent or the receivable becomes 120 days past
         due, the credit company pays TH USA 50% of the outstanding
         receivable.  The credit company establishes maximum credit
         limits for each customer account.  Substantially all accounts
         receivable are pledged as collateral under a bank financing
         agreement.

         NOTE 6 - SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

                   In July 1996, the Company entered into an amended and
         restated credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") effective
         April 1, 1996.  The Credit Agreement, which expires in June
         1999, provides for direct borrowings, bankers acceptances and
         letters of credit of amounts ranging from $100,000,000 in
         fiscal 1997 to $150,000,000 in fiscal 1999.  Available
         borrowings under the Credit Agreement are subject to the timed
         increase of availability under the Credit Agreement and are
         based upon eligible accounts receivable, inventory and open
         letters of credit.  As of March 31, 1997, $100,000,000 was
         available for utilization under the Credit Agreement, of which
         $66,822,000 had been used to open letters of credit.
         Obligations under the Credit Agreement are

         collateralized by substantially all the assets of the Company's
         U.S. operations.  Direct borrowings under the Credit Agreement,
         which are limited to $60,000,000, accrue interest at varying
         interest rates.

                   At March 31, 1997, total short-term borrowings of
         $5,980,000 consisted of open letters of credit for inventory
         purchased of $5,705,000 and the current portion of mortgage
         debt payable of $275,000.

                   The Credit Agreement contains various covenants.
         Among other matters, the Credit Agreement includes certain
         restrictions upon capital expenditures, investments,
         indebtedness, loans and advances and transactions with related
         parties.  In addition, the Credit Agreement prohibits certain
         of the Company's operating subsidiaries, which are borrowers or
         guarantors under the Credit Agreement, from paying dividends.
         Because THC is a holding company, dividends or other advances
         from its subsidiaries will be required to fund any cash
         dividends to holders of Ordinary Shares.  The Credit Agreement
         also requires the maintenance of minimum tangible net worth and
         interest coverage ratios.

                   The Company was in compliance with all covenants
         under the Credit Agreement as of, and for the year ended, March
         31, 1997.

                   THC is not taxed on income in the British Virgin
         Islands ("BVI") where it is incorporated. THC's subsidiaries
         are subject to taxation in the jurisdictions in which they
         operate.

                   Provision has not been made for taxes on
         undistributed non-BVI, non-U.S. earnings of $121,642,000 at
         March 31, 1997, as those earnings will continue to be
         reinvested.  As a result of various tax planning strategies
         available to the Company, it is not practical to estimate the
         amount of tax, if any, that might be payable on the eventual
         remittance of such earnings.

         NOTE 11 - RELATED PARTIES

                   Effective February 1, 1997, the Company entered into
         a licensing agreement with Pepe Jeans London Corporation
         ("Pepe") to distribute the Company's men's and boys sportswear
         (excluding jeanswear and jeans related apparel) throughout the
         European market.  Under this agreement, the licensee pays THLI
         a royalty based on a percentage of the value of licensed
         products sold by Pepe.  Except with the approval of THLI, all
         products sold by or through Pepe must be purchased through THEH
         or TH USA pursuant to buying agency agreements.  Under these
         agreements, THEH and TH USA are paid a buying agency commission
         based on a percentage of the cost of products sourced through
         them.  The distribution of products under this arrangement is
         expected to begin in Fall 1997.

              Effective June 30, 1996, the Company's joint venture
         arrangement with TH Japan covering the Company's Japanese
         operations expired.  Effective July 1, 1996, the Company
         entered into an exclusive license agreement for Japan with
         Novel-ITC Licensing Limited ("NIL"), a related party.  Under
         the license agreement, NIL pays THLI a royalty based on a
         percentage of the value of licensed products sold by NIL's
         sublicensee.  Except with the approval of THLI, all products
         sold by or through NIL or its sublicensee must be purchased
         through THEH or TH USA pursuant to buying agency agreements.
         Under these agreements, THEH and TH USA are paid a buying
         agency commission based on a percentage of the cost of products
         sourced through them.

         Pursuant to this new arrangement, royalties and commissions
         totaled $2,745,000 during fiscal 1997.  Pursuant to the prior
         arrangement, royalties and commissions totaled $488,000 in
         fiscal 1997, $1,939,000 in fiscal 1996 and $1,222,000 in fiscal
         1995.

                   Effective October 1, 1995, the Company entered into a
         license agreement with a related party, AIHL Investment Group
         Limited (formerly SEL International Investments Corp.)
         ("AIHL"), the parent of Pepe, for the manufacture, sale and
         distribution of men's, women's and girls' jeanswear and jeans
         related apparel (which includes women's and girls' casualwear)
         bearing the TOMMY HILFIGER [R] registered trademarks.  Other 
         assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet include a non-interest 
         bearing note receivable from AIHL in connection with this 
         transaction.  The note, which has a face value of $5,000,000, 
         and is due on September 30, 2000, is recorded at its present 
         value of $3,735,000 at March 31, 1997 and $2,874,000 at March 31, 
         1996.  Under this license agreement, the Company receives 
         royalties from subsidiaries of Pepe based upon a percentage of 
         net sales of licensed products.  The fiscal 1997 and 1996 results 
         of operations include $9,963,000 and $1,915,000 of such 
         royalties.  Net sales included in the Consolidated Statements of 
         Operations for these licensed products prior to this agreement 
         were $12,370,000 in fiscal 1996 and $9,104,000 in fiscal 1995.  
         In addition, in connection with this license, a subsidiary of 
         Pepe leases certain space at the Company's U.S. headquarters, 
         for which rent of $214,000 was received by the Company in fiscal 
         1997.

                   In June 1994, the Company granted a director of the
         Company an option to purchase a 10% equity interest in THR in
         connection with entering into an employment agreement with THR.
         In July 1994, this option was exercised at $193,000, an
         exercise price equal to 10% of the fair market value of THR as
         determined by an independent appraisal.  As a result of this
         transaction, the value of the Company's proportionate interest
         in THR increased by $190,000.  During March 1996, in connection
         with the termination of the director's employment, the Company
         repurchased this equity interest for its fair value of
         $1,800,000.

                   TH USA purchases finished goods in the ordinary
         course of business from affiliated companies.  Such purchases
         amounted to $9,852,000, $10,970,000 and $12,092,000 during the
         fiscal years ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
         In addition, contractors of the Company purchased raw materials
         in the ordinary course of business from affiliates of the
         Company.  Such purchases amounted to $5,811,000, $7,910,000 and
         $2,977,000 during the fiscal years ended March 31, 1997, 1996
         and 1995, respectively.

                   THEH has entered into a buying agency agreement with
         a Canadian licensee, in which one of the Company's directors
         has an indirect beneficial ownership interest.  Under this
         agreement, THEH receives commissions based on a percentage of
         the cost of goods sourced on behalf of the licensee.  THLI
         receives a royalty from the licensee based upon a percentage of
         net sales of licensed products.  Results of operations include
         $2,378,000, $1,667,000 and $861,000 for the years ended March
         31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively, for commissions and
         royalties received from this licensee.

                   TH USA sells merchandise in the ordinary course of
         business to a retail store that is owned by a relative of a
         director of the Company.  Sales to this customer amounted to
         approximately $435,000, $397,000 and $405,000 during the years
         ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

                   THEH has two consulting agreements with affiliates.
         THEH paid fees of $875,000 in fiscal 1997 and $375,000 in each
         of fiscal 1996 and 1995 to such affiliates.

                   TH USA had a consulting agreement with an affiliate.
         The fees and related expenses under this consulting agreement
         totaled $619,000 and $637,000 during the years ended March 31,
         1996 and 1995, respectively.

                   During the year ended March 31, 1995, TH USA incurred
         expenses of $1,000,000 for the sponsorship of an auto racing
         team, in which an affiliate of a director owned an indirect
         minority interest.  The Company did not renew this sponsorship
         subsequent to fiscal 1995.

                   Under the terms of an agreement with an affiliate,
         THHK reimburses the affiliate for certain general and
         administrative expenses incurred by the affiliate on behalf of
         THHK.  Payments made to the affiliate for the years ended March
         31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 were $58,000, $114,000 and $87,000,
         respectively.


         NOTE 12 - PROFIT SHARING PLAN

                   TH USA maintains employee savings plans for eligible
         U.S. employees.  TH USA's contributions to the plans are
         discretionary with matching contributions of up to 50% of
         employee contributions of up to 5% of employee compensation.
         For the years ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company
         made plan contributions of $345,000, $271,000 and $181,000,
         respectively. 


         NOTE 13 - UNEARNED STOCK COMPENSATION

                   Unearned stock compensation associated with a former
         key employee of TH USA was eliminated in 1996 in connection
         with the termination of such employment.  The balance of the
         unearned stock compensation was recorded as a reduction of
         Capital In Excess of Par Value.


         NOTE 14 - STOCK OPTION PLANS

                   In September 1992, the Company and its subsidiaries
         adopted stock option plans (the "Plans") authorizing the
         issuance of an aggregate of up to 1,450,000 Ordinary Shares to
         directors, officers and employees of the Company, as well as
         1,520,000 Ordinary Shares reserved for issuance in connection
         with an option granted to a former officer of the Company
         pursuant to his employment agreement.  The remaining
         unexercised options granted under the terms of the officer's
         employment agreement were exercised during fiscal 1996.  In
         December 1993, July 1995 and November 1996, a total of
         2,500,000 Ordinary Shares of THC were authorized and reserved
         for issuance to directors, officers and employees of the
         Company, under the Plans.  In August 1994, the Board of
         Directors and shareholders of the Company approved the Non-
         Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (the "Directors Option
         Plan").  Under the Directors Option Plan, directors who are not
         officers or employees of the Company are eligible to receive
         stock option grants.  The total number of Ordinary Shares for
         which options may be granted under the Directors Option Plan
         may not exceed 200,000 Ordinary Shares in the aggregate,
         subject to certain adjustments.

                   The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting
         for Stock Issued to Employees", and related interpretations in
         accounting for its stock awards.  Accordingly, no compensation
         expense has been recognized for stock options.  Had
         compensation cost been recorded based upon the fair value at
         the grant dates as an alternative provided by SFAS No. 123,
         "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", the Company's net
         income and earnings per share would have been reduced by
         approximately $2,998,000 and $.08, respectively, in 1997 and
         $2,131,000 and $.06, respectively, in 1996.  These amounts are
         for disclosure purposes only and may not be representative of
         future calculations since the estimated fair value of stock
         options is amortized to expense over the vesting period, and
         additional options may be granted in future years.  The fair
         values of options granted was estimated at $22.33 in 1997 and
         $13.72 in 1996 on the dates of grant using the Black-Scholes
         option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
         assumptions for 1997 and 1996, respectively:  volatility of 40%
         and 42%; risk free interest rate of 6.1% and 6.3%; expected
         life of 5.7 years and 5.6 years; and no future dividends.

         CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

                   Subsidiaries of the Company had employment and
         consulting agreements with Messrs. Hilfiger and Horowitz during
         fiscal 1997.

              The employment agreement with Tommy Hilfiger, the
         Company's Honorary Chairman of the Board and Principal
         Designer, provides for his employment as the designer of all
         products carrying the TOMMY HILFIGER [R] trademark until his 
         death, disability or incompetence.  Mr.


                                        25<PAGE>
          
         Hilfiger receives an annual base salary of $900,000, subject to
         adjustments. If net sales of TH USA and its subsidiaries are
         less than $48,333,333 in any year, Mr. Hilfiger's base salary
         for such year is reduced by 1.5% of such shortfall, to not less
         than $500,000. If net sales are greater than $48,333,333 in any
         fiscal year, Mr. Hilfiger receives an additional payment equal
         to 1.5% of such excess.  If Mr. Hilfiger terminates his
         employment without the consent of TH USA other than by reason
         of his death, disability or incompetence, TH USA will have no
         further obligations under the agreement.  The employment
         agreement provides that TH USA and its subsidiaries cannot
         enter into any line of business without the consent of Mr.
         Hilfiger if he shall reasonably determine that such line of
         business would be detrimental to the TOMMY HILFIGER [R]
         trademark. 

                   The amended employment agreement with Mr. Horowitz
         provides for his employment as Chief Executive Officer of the
         Company and TH USA until March 14, 1999.  The agreement
         provided for an annual base salary in fiscal year 1997 of
         $473,000.  The base salary is subject to increase each year
         thereafter by the average percentage increase for all employees
         of TH USA.  In addition, Mr. Horowitz is entitled to receive an
         amount equal to 5 percent of the Company's earnings before
         depreciation, interest on financing of fixed assets, non-
         operating expenses and taxes ("operating earnings"), subject to
         a minimum of $200,000 per year and a maximum of $777,000 per
         year, which maximum has been reduced each year (from an
         original level of $900,000) by the increase in his base salary;
         provided, that if the Company's operating earnings are below $2
         million in any year, TH USA is entitled to offset 10% of any
         shortfall (up to $75,000) against such payments in future years
         to the extent they would otherwise exceed $200,000. 

                   Beginning in fiscal 1995, the Company became subject
         to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
         amended (the "Code"), under which public companies are not
         permitted to deduct annual compensation paid to certain
         executive officers in excess of $1,000,000 per executive,
         unless such excess is paid pursuant to an arrangement based
         upon performance and approved by shareholders and provided that
         the other requirements set forth in Section 162(m) and related
         regulations are met.  Payments required to be made pursuant to
         the Company's aforementioned employment agreements with Messrs.
         Hilfiger and Horowitz, which were entered into prior to the
         effective date of Section 162(m), are not subject to such
         restrictions.

                   On May 22, 1995, the Compensation Committee approved
         and the Board of Directors adopted, and on July 28, 1995, the
         shareholders approved, the Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A., Inc.
         Supplemental Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the "SEIC
         Plan"), effective as of April 1, 1995 for each of the four
         fiscal years ending March 31, 1999.  The purpose of the SEIC
         Plan is to provide a significant and flexible economic
         opportunity to Mr. Horowitz, Chief Executive Officer and
         President of the Company and Chief Executive Officer of TH USA,
         in an effort to reward his contribution to the Company and its
         subsidiaries.  The SEIC Plan replaced the performance-based
         compensation arrangement for Mr. Horowitz that was in effect
         for fiscal year 1995.  The SEIC Plan is administered by the
         Compensation Committee and provides for a cash award to Mr.
         Horowitz equal to 5 percent of the operating earnings (as
         defined above) of the Company.  Awards under the plan are
         calculated and paid quarterly based on 3.75 percent of
         operating earnings for the first three fiscal quarters, with
         the remaining amount of the bonus (based on the 5 percent rate)
         payable at the end of the fiscal year.  The amount of the award
         is reduced by the amount of any other bonuses based on the
         operating earnings of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
         granted to Mr. Horowitz.  The 5 percent operating earnings
         bonus payable under Mr. Horowitz's employment agreement is
         credited against bonuses payable under the SEIC Plan.  The SEIC
         Plan does not contain any cap on the maximum amount of the
         bonus payable thereunder.  The SEIC Plan bonus payable to Mr.
         Horowitz in respect of fiscal year 1997, net of the $777,000


                                        26<PAGE>
          
         bonus payable under his employment agreement, was $6,397,000.
         While the Company believes that compensation payable pursuant
         to the SEIC Plan will be deductible for federal income tax
         purposes pursuant to Section 162(m), there can be no assurance
         in this regard.

                   The employment agreements with Messrs. Hilfiger and
         Horowitz also provide that such executives are eligible to
         receive additional annual bonuses at the discretion of TH USA's
         Compensation Committee if the TH USA Compensation Committee
         determines that certain performance levels established by the
         Company's Compensation Committee have been satisfied. If,
         however, compensation is awarded based on an arrangement that
         has not been approved by the shareholders, the Company would
         not be allowed to deduct for tax purposes any payments in
         excess of the $1,000,000 limitation.  The Compensation
         Committee approved discretionary bonuses of $4,500,000, of
         which $3,500,000 was granted by the Company on a deferred basis
         as described below (the "Deferred Bonus"), and $800,000 for Mr.
         Hilfiger in fiscal years 1997 and 1996, respectively.

                   The Deferred Bonus (and any interest accrued thereon)
         will be paid in annual installments on the last day of each
         fiscal year of the Company (commencing with the fiscal year
         ending March 31, 1998) in the largest possible amounts that can
         be paid, after taking into account any base salary and other
         compensation in that fiscal year which would be counted for
         purposes of  Section 162(m), and still be fully deductible
         under such regulations.  The unpaid portion of the Deferred
         Bonus will accrue interest at a rate equal to TH USA's bank
         borrowing rate.  While the Company believes that such Deferred
         Bonus payments will be deductible for federal income tax
         purposes pursuant to Section 162(m), there can be no assurance
         in this regard.


         STOCK OPTION PLANS

         Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A., Inc. and Tommy Hilfiger (Eastern
         Hemisphere) Limited 1992 Stock Incentive Plans 

                   In September 1992, the Company and its subsidiaries
         adopted stock option plans (collectively, the "Plans")
         authorizing the issuance of an aggregate of up to 1,450,000
         Ordinary Shares to directors, officers and employees of the
         Company and its subsidiaries, as well as 1,520,000 Ordinary
         Shares that were reserved for issuance in connection with an
         option granted to a former director and executive officer of
         the Company pursuant to his employment agreement. Messrs.
         Hilfiger, Horowitz, Chou, Chao and Stroll are not eligible for
         grants under the Plans.  In December 1993, July 1995 and
         November 1996, the Company's shareholders approved amendments
         to the Plans to increase by 1,000,000, 1,000,000 and 500,000,
         respectively, the number of Ordinary Shares reserved for
         issuance under the Plans. 

                   The Plan for employees of TH USA has been
         administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
         Directors of TH USA and the Plan for employees of the Company's
         non-United States subsidiaries have been administered by the
         Company's Compensation Committee (collectively, the
         "Compensation Committees").  The Compensation Committees
         determine the employees to whom awards are granted, the number
         of awards granted and the specific terms and conditions of each
         grant, subject to the provisions of the Plans. 

                   Under the Plans, awards may include stock options,
         stock appreciation rights and restricted stock. An option or
         right granted under the Plans must have an exercise price of
         not less than market value at the date of grant, provided that
         options granted prior to the offering must


                                        27<PAGE>
          
         have an exercise price of not less than the initial public
         offering price. Options may be exercisable at such times, in
         such amounts, in accordance with such terms and conditions, and
         subject to such restrictions as are set forth in the option
         agreement evidencing the grant of such options. 

                   Adjustments in the number and kind of shares subject
         to options granted under the Plans are made by the Compensation
         Committees in the event of a merger, consolidation,
         recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, warrants or
         rights issuance, stock dividend or combination of shares. In
         addition, the grants may provide for acceleration or immediate
         vesting in the event of a change of control of the Company or
         its subsidiaries. 


         Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan

                   In August 1994, the Board of Directors and
         shareholders of the Company approved the Non-Employee Directors
         Stock Option Plan (the "Directors Option Plan").  Under the
         Directors Option Plan, directors who are not officers or
         employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company
         ("Non-Employee Directors") are eligible to receive stock
         options. 

                   The Directors Option Plan is administered by the
         Company's Compensation Committee consisting of not less than
         two members of the Board, each of whom is a "disinterested
         person" as that term is used in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
         the Exchange Act ("Rule 16b-3").  Subject to certain specific
         limitations and restrictions set forth in the Directors Option
         Plan, the Company Compensation Committee has full and final
         authority to interpret the Directors Option Plan, to prescribe,
         amend and rescind rules and regulations, if any, relating to
         the Directors Option Plan and to make all determinations
         necessary or advisable for the administration of the Directors
         Option Plan.  However, grants of stock options to participants
         under the Plan and the amount, nature and timing of the grants
         are not subject to the determination of the Committee. 

                   The total number of Ordinary Shares for which options
         may be granted under the Directors Option Plan may not exceed
         200,000 shares while the Directors Option Plan is in effect,
         subject to certain adjustments described in the Directors
         Option Plan.  Each Non-Employee Director receives an initial
         stock option to purchase 10,000 Ordinary Shares at a price
         equal to the fair market value at the time of the grant of the
         Ordinary Shares subject to such stock option.

                   Prior to termination of the Directors Option Plan, on
         the first to occur of either the April 1 or October 1 following
         the first anniversary of each Non-Employee Director's date of
         initial grant (the "First Annual Grant Date"), and on each
         anniversary of such Non-Employee Director's First Annual Grant
         Date, such Non-Employee Director will receive an additional
         stock option to purchase 1,000 Ordinary Shares at a price equal
         to the fair market value of the Ordinary Shares at the time of
         the grant, provided such individual continues to be a Non-
         Employee Director.

                   The term of each stock option will be 10 years unless
         earlier terminated by termination of the director status of a
         Non-Employee Director.  The stock options will be exercisable
         in equal installments over five years from the date of grant.
         The stock options granted under the Directors Option Plan may
         not be assigned or transferred except by will, applicable laws
         of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic
         relations order. 

                   The Board may amend, alter or discontinue the
         Directors Option Plan, but no amendment, alteration or
         discontinuation will be made which would (i) impair the rights
         of an optionee under a stock option without the optionee's
         consent, except such an amendment as would cause the Directors
         Option Plan to qualify for the exemption provided by Rule 16b-3
         or (ii) disqualify the


                                        28<PAGE>
          
         Directors Option Plan from the exemption provided by Rule
         16b-3.  In addition, (i) no amendment will be made without the
         approval of the Company's shareholders to the extent such
         approval is required by law or agreement, and (ii) the
         Directors Option Plan will not be amended more often than once
         every six months, other than to comport with changes in the
         Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
         amended, or the rules thereunder. 

                   All stock options granted by the Company are non-
         qualified stock options for purposes of the Code.  The grant of
         non-qualified stock options does not result in any taxable
         income to the participant.  Upon the exercise of a non-
         qualified stock option, the excess of the market value of the
         shares acquired over their cost to the participant is taxable
         to the participant as ordinary income.  TH USA will generally
         be entitled to a corresponding deduction at the time such
         amounts are included in income by a TH USA Plan participant.
         The participant's tax basis for the shares is their fair market
         value at the time of exercise.  Income realized on the exercise
         of a non-qualified stock option is subject to federal and
         (where applicable) state and local withholding taxes. 


         COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

                   From August 1994 through the end of the Company's
         last fiscal year, the Compensation Committee consisted of Mr.
         Adamko, who is the Chairman, and Mr. Silver.  In April 1997,
         Mr. Murray was appointed as an additional member of the
         Compensation Committee.

                   During the Company's last fiscal year, Sportswear
         Holdings was 50% owned by Novel Enterprises, a Hong Kong
         corporation privately owned by members of the Chao family
         (including Messrs. Silas K.F. Chou and Ronald K.Y. Chao), and
         50% owned by Gadwal Limited, a Hong Kong corporation in which
         Mr. Stroll has a indirect beneficial ownership interest
         ("Gadwal").  In January 1997, Novel Enterprises transferred its
         ownership interest in Sportswear Holdings to a Hong Kong
         corporation under common control with Novel Enterprises .  AIHL
         is owned by Sportswear Holdings, Mr. Hilfiger and Mr. Horowitz.
         AIHL owns, indirectly through a subsidiary, substantially all
         of the outstanding shares of Pepe.  Novel Enterprises and its
         affiliates also hold other interests in the apparel industry.

                   Mr. Chou, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of
         the Company, is Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pepe.
         Mr. Stroll, a Director of the Company and Chief Executive
         Officer of THHK, is Group Chief Executive Officer and a

         the Company, is also a director of Pepe.  Mr. Ma, an executive
         officer and Director of the Company, and Mr. Chao, a Director
         of the Company, are directors of certain subsidiaries of Pepe.

                   Messrs. Chou, Hilfiger, Stroll and Horowitz,
         executive officers and Directors of the Company, are executive
         officers and directors of AIHL.  Mr. Ng, an executive officer
         and Director of the Company, is an executive officer, and until
         May 1997 was a Director, of AIHL.

                   Messrs. Chou and Stroll, executive officers and
         Directors of the Company, are executive officers and directors
         of Sportswear Holdings.  Mr. Chao, a Director of the Company,
         is a director of Sportswear Holdings.

                   Messrs. Chou and Ma, executive officers and Directors
         of the Company, and Mr. Chao, a Director of the Company, are
         executive officers and directors of both Novel Enterprises and
         the transferee of Novel Enterprises' ownership interest in

         DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

                   Directors who are employees of the Company or its
         subsidiaries receive no additional compensation for their

         of the Company receive a retainer of $25,000 per annum.  Each
         member of a Committee of the Board of Directors receives a
         retainer of $5,000 per annum, and each Chairman of a Committee
         of the Board of Directors receives an additional retainer of
         $3,000 per annum. These Directors also receive $2,000 for

         ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

                   Certain relationships and transactions between the
         Company and certain directors and officers of the Company and
         certain of their affiliates are described below.

                   Effective February 1, 1997, the Company entered into
         a licensing agreement with Pepe to distribute the Company's
         men's and boys' sportswear (excluding jeanswear and jeans
         related apparel) throughout the European market.  Under this
         agreement, the licensee pays THLI a royalty based on a
         percentage of the value of licensed products sold by Pepe.
         Except with the approval of THLI, all products sold by or
         through Pepe must be  purchased through THEH or TH USA pursuant
         to buying agency agreements.  Under these agreements, THEH and
         TH USA are paid a buying agency commission based on a
         percentage of the cost of products sourced through them.  The
         distribution of products under this arrangement is expected to
         begin in Fall 1997.

                   Effective June 30, 1996, the Company's joint venture
         arrangement with Tommy Hilfiger Japan Co., Ltd. ("TH Japan")
         covering the Company's Japanese operations expired.  Effective
         July 1, 1996, the Company entered into an exclusive license
         agreement for Japan with Novel-ITC Licensing Limited ("NIL"), a
         company jointly controlled by Itochu Corporation, which was the
         51% owner of TH Japan, and Novel Enterprises.  Mr. Stroll
         indirectly owns a 3.5% equity interest in NIL.  Under the
         license agreement, NIL pays THLI a royalty based on a
         percentage of the value of licensed products sold by NIL's
         sublicensee.  Novel Enterprises and Messrs. Stroll, Hilfiger
         and Horowitz indirectly own equity interests of 12.4%, 12.4%,
         8.0% and 2.7%, respectively, in such sublicensee.  Except with
         the approval of THLI, all products sold by or through NIL or
         its sublicensee must be purchased through THEH or TH USA
         pursuant to buying agency agreements.  Under these agreements,
         THEH and TH USA are paid a buying agency commission based on a
         percentage of the cost of products sourced through them.
         Pursuant to this new arrangement, royalties and commissions
         totaled $2,745,000 during fiscal year 1997.  Pursuant to the
         prior arrangement, royalties and commissions totaled $488,000
         during fiscal year 1997, $1,939,000 during fiscal year 1996 and
         $1,222,000 during fiscal year 1995. 

                   Effective October 1, 1995, the Company entered into a
         license agreement with a related party, AIHL (formerly SEL
         International Investments Corp.), the parent of Pepe, for the
         manufacture, sale and distribution of men's, women's and girl's
         jeanswear and jeans related apparel (which includes women's and
         girls' casual wear) bearing the TOMMY HILFIGER [R] registered 
         trademarks.  The Company received a non-interest bearing note 
         receivable from AIHL in connection with this transaction.  The 
         note which has a face value of $5,000,000, and is due on 
         September 30, 2000, is recorded at its present value of 
         $3,735,000.  Under this license agreement, the Company receives 
         royalties from subsidiaries of Pepe based upon a percentage of 
         net sales of licensed products.  The fiscal 1997 results of 
         operations include $9,963,000 of such royalties.  Net sales 
         included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for these 
         licensed products prior to this agreement were $12,370,000 in 
         fiscal 1996 and $9,104,000 in fiscal 1995.  In addition, in


                                        31<PAGE>
            
         connection with this license, a subsidiary of Pepe leases
         certain space at the Company's U.S. headquarters, for which
         rent of $214,000 was received by the Company in fiscal 1997.

                   TH USA purchases finished goods in the ordinary
         course of business from affiliates of Novel Enterprises.  Such
         purchases amounted to $9,852,000 during the fiscal year ended
         March 31, 1997.  In addition, contractors of the Company
         purchase raw materials in the ordinary course of business from
         affiliates of Novel Enterprises pursuant to the Company's
         designation of such sources as acceptable suppliers.  Such
         purchases amounted to $5,811,000 during the fiscal year ended
         March 31, 1997.

                   THEH has entered into a buying agency agreement with
         Tommy Hilfiger Canada, Inc., a Canadian licensee, in which Mr.
         Stroll, a Director of the Company and Chief Executive Officer
         of THHK, has an indirect beneficial ownership interest.  Under
         this agreement, THEH receives commissions based on a percentage
         of the cost of goods sourced on behalf of the licensee.  THLI
         receives a royalty from the licensee based upon a percentage of
         net sales of licensed products.  Results of operations include
         $2,378,000 for the year ended March 31, 1997 for commissions
         and royalties received from this licensee. 

                   The Company sells merchandise in the ordinary course
         of business to a retail store that is owned by Mr. Hilfiger's
         sister.  Sales to this customer amounted to approximately
         $435,000 during the year ended March 31, 1997.

                   THEH has a consulting agreement with an affiliate,
         Fasco International, pursuant to which THEH pays Fasco
         International $500,000 per year, plus reimbursement of
         expenses.  The agreement has renewable one year terms.  The
         fees and related expenses under this consulting agreement
         totaled $500,000 during the year ended March 31, 1997.

                   THEH has a consulting agreement with an affiliate of
         Mr. Stroll.  THEH paid fees of $375,000 in fiscal 1997 to such
         affiliate.

                   Under the terms of an agreement with Novel
         Enterprises, THHK reimburses Novel Enterprises for certain
         general and administrative expenses incurred by it on behalf of
         THHK.  Payments made to Novel Enterprises for the year ended
         March 31, 1997 were $58,000.

                   The law firm of Gursky & Associates, P.C., of which
         Steven Gursky, Secretary of TH USA and Assistant Secretary of
         the Company, is a member, provides legal services to the
         Company and its subsidiaries.  Payments to Gursky & Associates,
         P.C., excluding reimbursement of expenses, were approximately
         $1,301,000 in fiscal year 1997.  Mr. Gursky is a cousin of Mr.
         Horowitz, an executive officer and Director of the Company.

                   The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
         monitors and approves transactions between the Company and its
         affiliates to seek to provide that such transactions are on
         terms which are no less favorable as a whole to the Company
         than could be obtained from unaffiliated parties.  The Audit
         Committee is composed of non-employee directors who are not
         affiliated with Novel Enterprises, Gadwal, Sportswear Holdings,
         AIHL or Pepe.

         capitalized terms defined in the Credit Agreement and used herein
         without definition shall have the respective meanings assigned to
         them in the Credit Agreement.

              2. Amendment to Subsection 6.3 of the Credit Agreement.
         Subsection 6.3 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by
         deleting the portion of such Subsection beginning with the word

              deposit or collection in the ordinary course of business,
              (b) guarantees by THUSA of the obligations of Retail under

              further, that such guarantees by THC shall not exceed in the
              aggregate at any one time outstanding the principal amount
              of $20,000,000 provided that, with respect to any lease
              obligation, the principal amount of such obligation shall be
              deemed to be the then current annual rent payment and (e)
              guarantees of the Obligations."

              3.  Conditions of Effectiveness.  This First Amendment shall
         become effective, as of the date hereof, when the Agent shall
         have received counterparts of this First Amendment executed each
         Borrower, each Guarantor and the Majority Lenders.<PAGE>







              4.  Representations and Warranties. To induce the Lenders to
         enter into this First Amendment, each Borrower and each Guarantor
         hereby represents and warrants that:

                   (a) It has the power, authority and legal right to make
              and deliver this First Amendment and to perform its
              obligations under the Credit Agreement, as amended by this
              First Amendment, without any notice, consent, approval or
              authorization not already obtained, and it has taken all
              necessary action to authorize the same.

                   (b) The making and delivery of this First Amendment,
              and the performance of the Credit Agreement, as amended by
              this First Amendment, do not violate any provision of law or
              any regulation applicable to it, or its charter or by-laws,
              or result in the breach of or constitute a default under or
              require any consent under any indenture or other agreement
              or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any
              of its property may be bound or affected. The Credit
              Agreement, as amended by this First Amendment, constitutes
              its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against
              it in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability
              thereof may be limited by any applicable bankruptcy,
              reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws
              affecting creditors' rights generally.

                   (c) The representations and warranties made by it in
              the Credit Agreement are true and correct on and as of the
              date on which this First Amendment becomes effective after
              giving effect hereto.

                   (d) No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
              continuing under the Credit Agreement on and as of the date
              on which this First Amendment becomes effective.

              5.  Reference to and Effect on the Credit Agreement and
         other Loan Documents. (a)  On and after the effective date of
         this First Amendment each reference in the Credit Agreement to
         "this Agreement", "hereunder", "hereof" or words of like import,
         and each reference in any Note or any other Loan Document to the
         "Credit Agreement", "thereunder", "thereof" or words of like
         import referring to the Credit Agreement, shall mean and be a
         reference to the Credit Agreement as amended hereby. 

              (b)  Except as specifically amended hereby, the Credit
         Agreement and each other Loan Document are and shall continue to
         be in full force and effect and are hereby in all respects
         ratified and confirmed. 

              (c)  The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this First
         Amendment shall not, except as expressly provided herein, operate
         as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of any Lender under the
         Credit Agreement, nor constitute a waiver of any provision of the
         Credit Agreement.

              6. Execution in Counterparts.  This First Amendment may be
         executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties
         hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed
         and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which
         taken together shall constitute but one and the same agreement.


                                         2<PAGE>

              7. Governing Law.  This First Amendment shall be governed by
         and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
         York.

              IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
         First Amendment to be executed by their respective officers
         thereunto duly authorized, as of the date first above written.

         other Loan Documents. (a)  On and after the effective date of
         this Second Amendment each reference in the Credit Agreement to
         "this Agreement", "hereunder", "hereof" or words of like
         import, and each reference in any Note or any other Loan
         Document to the "Credit Agreement", "thereunder", "thereof" or
         words of like import referring to the Credit Agreement, shall
         mean and be a reference to the Credit Agreement as amended

     (c) Physical Inventories
     (d) All space costs

     5.  Ridge Personnel.  Ridge shall employ sufficient

described below in the performance of the Services:

         JOB DESCRIPTION                NO. OF HOURS PER DAY
         Managers                                 8

of merchandise receipts and shipping.  Ridge shall employ
adequate staffing from 8:00 A.M. - 8:00 P.M. on weekdays and on

     6.  Quality Assurance.  THUSA shall have the right to issue
and periodically update quality assurance, performance standards
and rules and regulations for Ridge's performance of this
Agreement so as to ensure customer satisfaction and efficient and
appropriate operation of the Warehouse.

     7.  Independent Contractor.  Nothing in this Agreement is
intended nor shall be construed to create any relationship
between THUSA and Ridge other than that of independent
contractors and this Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute
THUSA and Ridge as partners, joint venturers or joint employers.

     8.  Employees.  Neither Ridge nor the individuals it engages
to perform the services required 

                                -2-

shall for all purposes be Ridge's employees, and Ridge shall have 
the sole authority to hire, fire, direct, control, discipline, 
reward, evaluate, schedule, supervise, promote, suspend and/or 
terminate Ridge's employees.  In addition, Ridge shall be solely 
responsible for the acts of its employees, whether of commission 
or omission, and for payment of all salaries, withholding tax 
deductions, benefits, unemployment compensation, workers compensation 
and all other charges and liabilities arising out of the 
employer-employee relationship, including, without limitation, 
liabilities under any civil rights laws, wage and hour laws, equal 
employment opportunity acts, any union, welfare and pension 
contributions and the expense of prosecuting, defending or complying 
with the award in any labor arbitration proceeding.

     9.  Labor Disturbance.  If during the term of this Agreement
there shall occur any labor disturbance involving Ridge's
employees, whether or not such disturbance is within Ridge's
control, which involves picketing of or handbilling at any THUSA
facility or a strike or boycott against THUSA or any of its
facilities, THUSA may give Ridge written notice of objection to
the labor disturbance, and if such disturbance is not wholly
discontinued within forty-eight (48) hours after Ridge's receipt
of such notice, then, at THUSA's sole option, this Agreement and
Ridge's rights hereunder shall terminate immediately upon the
giving of such notice of termination, but THUSA shall remain
liable for any amounts due to Ridge with respect to work
performed prior to such termination.

     10.  Notice of Loss.  Ridge shall give THUSA immediate
notice of any loss or shortage of THUSA merchandise.  Ridge
agrees to cooperate with all respects with any investigation
conducted by THUSA, its agents or insurance company arising from
any losses.

     11.  Insurance.  Ridge shall, at its cost, keep in force the
following insurance:

     (a) public liability insurance for the mutual benefit of
Ridge and THUSA against claims for bodily injury, death or
property damage occurring in connection with the performance of
Ridge's obligations hereunder with limits of not less than
$10,000,000/$10,000,000/$1,000,000.

     (b) such employment and other insurance in such reasonable
amounts against other insurable hazards which at the time are
reasonably available and commonly insured against in connection
with the performance of Ridge's obligations hereunder.

     (c) all insurance shall name THUSA or its affiliate as the
case may be, as an additional insured.

     12.  Indemnification.

placed in receivership, or should proceedings be instituted by or
against Ridge for bankruptcy, insolvency, or receivership,

creditors, or if this Agreement should pass to another by virtue
of any court proceedings, writ of execution, levy, sale or by
operation of law, THUSA may, if it so elects, at any time
thereafter, terminate this Agreement upon giving Ridge thirty
(30) days notice in writing of its intention to terminate.

     (b) In the event of a default hereunder by Ridge, THUSA may
terminate this Agreement on fifteen (15) days written notice to
Ridge.  During said fifteen (15) days, Ridge shall be permitted
to cure the default.

     14.  Benefit.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of

     15.  Entire Agreement; Amendment.  This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and this Agreement may not
be amended or modified, except in a writing signed by both
parties hereto.

     16.  Non-Waiver.  The failure of either party to enforce at
any time any term, provision or condition of this Agreement, or
to exercise any right or option herein, shall in no way operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
preclude any other right or option herein; and no waiver
whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing, signed by the
waiving party, and only to the extent herein set forth.

     17.  Assignment.

     (a) This Agreement is personal in nature, and Ridge may not
and shall not sell, transfer, lease, sublicense or assign this
Agreement or its rights and interest hereunder, or any part
hereof, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior
written consent of THUSA, which consent may be withheld by THUSA
in its sole and absolute discretion, except that Ridge shall have
the right, upon written notice to THUSA, to assign this Agreement
to a corporation, subsidiary or affiliate under the same
direction and control as Ridge; provided, however, that in such
event Ridge agrees to guarantee the performance and obligations
of such corporation, subsidiary or affiliate under this
Agreement.

     (b)  A sale or other transfer of all or substantially all of
the assets of Ridge or a change in the control of Ridge shall be
deemed an assignment of Ridge's rights and interests under this
Agreement to which the terms and conditions of Paragraph 16(a)
above shall apply.

     (c)  Any transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, of
Ridge's interest in this Agreement (in whole or in part) or an
interest in Ridge (whether stock, partnership, interest or
otherwise) shall be deemed an assignment of Ridge's rights and
interest under this Agreement to which the terms and 

                                -4-
<PAGE>
conditions of Paragraph 17(a) above shall apply.  The issuance of 
shares of stock to other than the existing shareholders is deemed 
to be a transfer of that stock for the purposes of this paragraph.

     18.  Severability.  If any provision or any portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be construed to be illegal,
invalid, or unenforceable, such shall be deemed stricken and
deleted from this Agreement to the same extent and effect as if
never incorporated herein, but all other provisions of this
Agreement and any remaining portion of any provision which is
illegal, invalid or unenforceable in part shall continue in full
force and effect.

     19.  Notices.  All reports, approvals and notices required
or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall, unless

notices at any time upon notice to the other party.

     20.  Headings.  The headings of the Paragraphs of this
Agreement are for convenience only and in no way limit or affect
the terms or conditions of this Agreement.

     21.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in two
(2) or more counterparts, each of which  shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

                            AGREEMENT



     AGREEMENT made as of the 1st day of April, 1997, by and

RETAIL, INC. (hereinafter "THR"), whose address is 112 Truman
Drive, Edison, New Jersey 08818.

     WHEREAS, Ridge is in the business of providing all attendant
"Pick & Pack" services incidental to the movement of goods within
and without its storage facilities, and

     WHEREAS, THR desires to have Ridge provide "Pick & Pack"
services at THR's warehouse facility at 112 Truman Drive, Edison,
New Jersey 08818 (the "Warehouse").

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants
herein contained, THR and Ridge agree as follows:

     1.  Term.  This Agreement shall commence as of April 1, 1997
and shall continue for a period of six (6) months to September
30, 1997 (the "Term").  The Term shall be automatically renewed
from month to month thereafter unless terminated by either party
on sixty (60) days written notice to the other.

     2.  Charges.  For an annual throughput of up to 9,000,000

Paragraph 3 below shall be as follows:

     (a) $0.13 per unit - Inbound
     (b) $0.13 per unit - Outbound
     (c) $12.75 labor rate per hour for Excluded Services
     (d) $0.06 per unit for transfers

     Overtime may only be charged to THR if the same has been
specifically authorized by THR in writing in each instance.  THR
will not pay for any overtime occasioned as a result of Ridge's
inefficiencies.  THR will pay for the excess cost only of
overtime above Ridge's regular rate (currently $6.38/hour).

     3.  Scope of Services.  In consideration for the Charges
paid by THR to Ridge, Ridge agrees to promptly provide the
following services (the "Services"):

     (a) All inbound and outbound handling (including scanning)
     (b) Receiving, sorting, and shelving merchandise into stock
         area
     (c) Selection by order format
     (d) 100% verification process
     (e) UPS processing

<PAGE>     
     (g) Providing cartons and tape
     (h) Outbound trucking to consolidators
     (I) Adhering to cleanliness standards maintained by THR,
         including proper and timely disposal of waste and
         restacking and resorting of merchandise.

     4.  Excluded Services.  The following shall specifically not
be included in the Services:

     (a) Cycle Counting
     (b) Affixing Bar Codes
     (c) Physical Inventories
     (d) All space costs
     (e) Outside storage (if required)
     (f) Providing pallets

     5.  Ridge Personnel.  Ridge shall employ sufficient
personnel in order to provide a monthly average of the man-hours
described below in the performance of the Services:

         JOB DESCRIPTION                NO. OF HOURS PER DAY
         Laborers                                  592
         Supervisors                                16
         Clericals                                   8

     The hours described above shall be organized by Ridge to
provide the Services to THR in light of the varied ebb and flow
of merchandise receipts and shipping.  Ridge shall employ
adequate staffing from 8:00 A.M. - 8:00 P.M. on weekdays and on
Saturdays as needed.  Staffing in satisfaction of the
requirements of this paragraph shall not require the payment of
any overtime charges by THR.  Ridge shall provide THR with a
monthly report of man-hours to be provided hereunder.  Such
report shall be delivered to THR within ten (10) days of the end
of each month.  THR shall have the right to audit Ridge's records
of such man-hours.

     6.  Quality Assurance.  THR shall have the right to issue
and periodically update quality assurance, performance standards
and rules and regulations for Ridge's performance of this
Agreement so as to ensure customer satisfaction and efficient and
appropriate operation of the Warehouse.

     7.  Independent Contractor.  Nothing in this Agreement is
intended nor shall be construed to create any relationship
between THR and Ridge other than that of independent contractors
and this Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute THR and
Ridge as partners, joint venturers or joint employers.

     8.  Employees.  Neither Ridge nor the individuals it engages
to perform the services required of Ridge hereunder are employees
of THR; all such individuals shall for all purposes be Ridge's
employees, and Ridge shall have the sole authority to hire, fire,
direct, control, discipline, reward, 

                                  -2-
<PAGE>
evaluate, schedule, supervise, promote, suspend and/or terminate 
Ridge's employees.  In addition, Ridge shall be solely responsible 
for the acts of its employees, whether of commission or omission, 
and for payment of all salaries, withholding tax deductions, benefits,
unemployment compensation, workers compensation and all other
charges and liabilities arising out of the employer-employee
relationship, including, without limitation, liabilities under
any civil rights laws, wage and hour laws, equal employment
opportunity acts, any union, welfare and pension contributions
and the expense of prosecuting, defending or complying with the
award in any labor arbitration proceeding.

     9.  Labor Disturbance.  If during the term of this Agreement
there shall occur any labor disturbance involving Ridge's
employees, whether or not such disturbance is within Ridge's
control, which involves picketing of or handbilling at any THR
facility or a strike or boycott against THR or any of its
facilities, THR may give Ridge written notice of objection to the
labor disturbance, and if such disturbance is not wholly
discontinued within forty-eight (48) hours after Ridge's receipt
of such notice, then, at THR's sole option, this Agreement and
Ridge's rights hereunder shall terminate immediately upon the
giving of such notice of termination, but THR shall remain liable
for any amounts due to Ridge with respect to work performed prior
to such termination.

     10.  Notice of Loss.  Ridge shall give THR immediate notice
of any loss or shortage of THR merchandise.  Ridge agrees to
cooperate with all respects with any investigation conducted by
THR, its agents or insurance company arising from any losses.

     11.  Insurance.  Ridge shall, at its cost, keep in force the
following insurance:

     (a) public liability insurance for the mutual benefit of
Ridge and THR against claims for bodily injury, death or property
damage occurring in connection with the performance of Ridge's
obligations hereunder with limits of not less than
$10,000,000/$10,000,000/$1,000,000.

     (b) such employment and other insurance in such reasonable
amounts against other insurable hazards which at the time are
reasonably available and commonly insured against in connection
with the performance of Ridge's obligations hereunder.

     (c) all insurance shall name THR or its affiliate as the
case may be, as an additional insured.

     12.  Indemnification.

     (a)   Ridge will indemnify THR and/or its affiliate for any
losses incurred in connection with the performance of Ridge's
obligations.

     (b) Ridge shall be liable to THR for merchandise shortages
and damage to the Warehouse resulting from the acts or negligence

     13.  Termination.

     (a) Should Ridge be adjudicated bankrupt, insolvent or
placed in receivership, or should proceedings be instituted by or
against Ridge for bankruptcy, insolvency, or receivership,
agreement of composition or assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or if this Agreement should pass to another by virtue
of any court proceedings, writ of execution, levy, sale or by
operation of law, THR may, if it so elects, at any time
thereafter, terminate this Agreement upon giving Ridge thirty
(30) days notice in writing of its intention to terminate.

     (b) In the event of a default hereunder by Ridge, THR may
terminate this Agreement on fifteen (15) days written notice to
Ridge.  During said fifteen (15) days, Ridge shall be permitted
to cure the default.

     14.  Benefit.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the parties hereto, and their successors and
assigns.

     15.  Entire Agreement; Amendment.  This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and this Agreement may not
be amended or modified, except in a writing signed by both
parties hereto.

     16.  Non-Waiver.  The failure of either party to enforce at
any time any term, provision or condition of this Agreement, or
to exercise any right or option herein, shall in no way operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
preclude any other right or option herein; and no waiver
whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing, signed by the
waiving party, and only to the extent herein set forth.

     17.  Assignment.

     (a) This Agreement is personal in nature, and Ridge may not
and shall not sell, transfer, lease, sublicense or assign this
Agreement or its rights and interest hereunder, or any part
hereof, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior
written consent of THR, which consent may be withheld by THR in
its sole and absolute discretion, except that Ridge shall have
the right, upon written notice to THR, to assign this Agreement
to a corporation, subsidiary or affiliate under the same
direction and control as Ridge; provided, however, that in such
event Ridge agrees to guarantee the performance and obligations
of such corporation, subsidiary or affiliate under this
Agreement.

     (b)  A sale or other transfer of all or substantially all of
the assets of Ridge or a change in the control of Ridge shall be
deemed an assignment of Ridge's rights and interests under this
Agreement to which the terms and conditions of Paragraph 16(a)
above shall apply.

     (c)  Any transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, of
Ridge's interest in this Agreement (in whole or in part) or an
interest in Ridge (whether stock, partnership, interest or
otherwise) shall be deemed an assignment of Ridge's rights and
interest under this Agreement to which the terms and 

                              -4-
<PAGE>
conditions of Paragraph 17(a) above shall apply.  The issuance of 
shares of stock to other than the existing shareholders is deemed 
to be a transfer of that stock for the purposes of this paragraph.

     18.  Severability.  If any provision or any portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be construed to be illegal,
invalid, or unenforceable, such shall be deemed stricken and
deleted from this Agreement to the same extent and effect as if
never incorporated herein, but all other provisions of this
Agreement and any remaining portion of any provision which is
illegal, invalid or unenforceable in part shall continue in full
force and effect.

     19.  Notices.  All reports, approvals and notices required

         products; and

                   WHEREAS, Licensor has the right to enter into this
         Agreement; and

                   WHEREAS, Licensee recognizes the great value and

         Affiliates, royalties shall be calculated on the basis of such

         which may be hereafter approved by Licensor for use by Licensee
         in connection with the Licensed Products subject to any
         conditions set forth in any written approval.

                                ARTICLE 2.  GRANT

                   2.1  LICENSE.  Licensor hereby grants to Licensee an
         exclusive license during the Term of the Agreement, subject to
         all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement to
         use the Trademark in connection with the manufacture, distribu-
         tion and sale of the Licensed Products in the Territory.  Li-
         censor further grants to Licensee the right to use the Trade-
         mark, subject to Article 11.4 hereof, in connection with estab-
         lishing a subsidiary or division to be named "Tommy Hilfiger
         Europe BV" or such other name as may be approved by Licensor.
         Licensor and any subsidiaries or affiliated companies specifi-
         cally reserve the right to establish and offer for sale
         Licensed Products through up to * flagship retail locations
         throughout the Territory, with a maximum of * flagship loca-
         tions per city.

                   2.2  RESERVATIONS.  The license granted in this
         Article 2 does not grant any right to Licensee to use the name
         "TOMMY" or "HILFIGER" individually or derivatives of the
         Trademark.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
         construed as an assignment or grant to Licensee of any right,
         title or interest in or to the Trademark, it being understood
         and acknowledged by Licensee that all rights relating thereto
         are reserved by Licensor except for the rights specifically
         granted to Licensee in this Agreement.  Licensee understands
         and agrees that Licensor, and its other licensees and
         sublicensees, may manufacture or authorize third parties to
         manufacture Licensed Products in the Territory for ultimate
         sale outside of the Territory, or to manufacture and sell or
         authorize third parties to manufacture and sell products of any
         and all types and descriptions other than the Licensed Products
         in or outside the Territory.  In addition, to the extent it is
         legally permissible to do so, no license is granted hereunder
         for the manufacture, sale or distribution of the Licensed
         Products to be used for publicity purposes, other than
         publicity of the Licensed Products, in combination sales,
         premiums or giveaways, or to be disposed of under or in
         connection with similar methods of merchandising, such license
         being specifically reserved for Licensor.

                   2.3  TERRITORY.  Licensee agrees that it will neither
         export Licensed Products from the Territory nor sell same to
         any entity which it knows or has any reason to believe intend
         to export Licensed Products from the Territory.  Licensee will
         use its best efforts to prohibit its customers from shipping
         Licensed Products outside of the Territory.

                   2.4  FIRST REFUSAL.  Licensor agrees that before
         granting a license to any third party to use any of the
         Trademarks or any other Trademark similar therein for any
         products other than Licensed Products in the Territory,
         Licensor shall give written notice to Licensee of its intent to
         grant such license, and Licensee shall have the right of first
         refusal, to be asserted within thirty (30) days in writing, to
         obtain such license upon terms no less favorable than those to
         be offered to the third party.  In the event that Licensor and
         Licensee fail to reach an agreement with respect to the
         proposed license, then Licensor may enter into a license with
         the third party; provided, however, that the terms and
         conditions of such license with the third party shall not be
         more favorable that those offered to Licensee.


         *    This information has been omitted pursuant to a request
              for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and
              Exchange Commission.


                                       -5-<PAGE>







                   2.5  EXCLUSIVITY.  Licensor shall not authorize third
         parties to use the Trademark in connection with the sale and/or
         importation of the Licensed Products in the Territory during
         the Term hereof without Licensee's prior written approval, but
         Licensee acknowledges and consents to Licensor's use of the
         Trademarks in connection with the sale and/or importation of
         Licensed Products in the Territory.  Licensor hereby agrees
         that Licensee shall have the exclusive right to import into and
         resell the Licensed Products in the Territory.

                   2.6  DEFINITIONAL DISPUTES.  Licensee acknowledges
         that due to the nature of the marketplace, the definition of
         Licensed Products may change or may not be amenable to precise
         delineation.  Licensee agrees that if there is a dispute over
         the definition of Licensed Products, Licensor shall render a
         reasonable written determination which shall be conclusive and
         binding on Licensee without legal recourse.

                   2.7  BEST EFFORTS.  At all times while this Agreement
         is in effect, Licensee shall use its best efforts to exploit
         the License granted hereunder throughout the Territory,
         including but not limited to, selling a sufficiently
         representative quantity of the Licensed Products of all styles,
         fabrications and colors; offering for sale the Licensed
         Products so that they may be sold to the consumer on a timely
         basis; maintaining a sales force sufficient to provide
         effective distribution throughout all areas of the Territory;
         and cooperating with Licensor's and any of its licensees'
         marketing, merchandising, sales and anti-counterfeiting
         programs.

                   2.8  SHOWROOMS AND IN-STORE SHOPS.

                        (a)  Licensee shall display the Licensed
         Products for sale in a separate showroom, designed and
         displayed in accordance with Licensor's specifications, apart
         from any showroom(s) in which Licensee or another business may
         offer other than Licensed Products for sale.  Subject to prior
         approval by Licensor, Licensee may display the Trademark on
         showroom doors and office directories;

                        (b)  Licensor reserves the right to approve the
         location of Licensee's primary showroom required by Article
         2.8(a) above; and

                        (c)  Not later than by the end of the third
         Annual Period, Licensee shall establish and display the
         Licensed Products in showrooms designed and displayed in
         accordance with Licensor's specifications, apart from any
         showroom(s) in which Licensee or another business may offer
         other than Licensed Products for sale, to be located in
         Dusseldorf, Germany; Paris, France; Madrid, Spain; London,
         England; and Amsterdam, Holland.

                        (d)  Licensee will, at Licensor's option,
         participate in any in-store shop or main floor fixturing
         program with any of Licensee's customers.  To that end, to the

                        (e)  Not later than the end of the Initial Term,
         Licensee shall be offering for sale the Licensed Products in at
         least * retail locations (in-store shops or specialty stores)
         throughout the Territory.

                   2.9  SALES AND DELIVERIES.  Licensee acknowledges
         that the availability and selection of styles, fabrications,
         colors and sizes are an integral part of the high reputation
         and value which the trade and consumers have come to associate
         with the Trademark.  Therefore, to protect that reputation and
         value, Licensee agrees that its policy of sale, distribution,
         and exploitation shall be of a high standard and to the best
         advantage, and that the same shall in no way adversely reflect
         upon the good name, trademarks and trade names of Licensor or
         any of its programs.  Licensee further agrees that it will use
         due diligence to make certain that at all times no less than *
         of the Licensed Products ordered and approved by Licensee for
         shipment are shipped timely in compliance with the shipping
         schedule recited in each order.  Licensee shall at all times
         maintain a sales force for the sale of the Licensed Products
         which shall be sufficient to provide effective distribution of
         the Licensed Products throughout the entire Territory.

                   2.10  ORGANIZATION.  Licensee shall, within thirty
         (30) days of the date hereof, establish a separate division of
         its company dedicated exclusively to the sale of Licensed
         Products throughout the Territory.  In lieu of such separate
         division, Licensee may form a subsidiary company provided that
         such company shall agree in writing to be bound by all of the
         terms hereof.  Licensee shall, at its sole cost and expense,
         employ a head of sales, a production manager and a production
         assistant who shall work exclusively with Licensor's
         representatives on the Licensee's business arising under this
         Agreement and shall report directly to the President of
         Licensee or his designee.  Licensee shall also employ a
         "stylist" to work with Licensor's representatives in the design
         of the Licensed Products and to assist in product development.
         These individuals will be hired with the prior approval of
         Licensor and will be relieved of their duties under this
         Agreement at the request of Licensor.  In addition, Licensee
         shall maintain a separate sales force for the sale of the
         Licensed Products.  The members of such sales force may not
         sell or represent any products other than the Licensed
         Products.

                   2.11  USE OF LICENSED LEGEND.  Licensee shall, with
         the prior written approval of Licensor, have the right to place
         the legend "Licensed by Tommy Hilfiger Licensing, Inc.", or
         such other legend which indicates that the Licensed Products
         were manufactured, sold and distributed under the license from
         the Licensor, on the Licensed Products and on all wrapping or
         packaging used in connection therewith, within the Territory.

                   2.12  PURCHASE OF LICENSED PRODUCTS.

                        (a)  Licensee hereby agrees that all Purchased
         Products shall be exclusively purchased by Licensee through
         Licensor or its designees, or any other sources approved by
         Licensor, and shall be purchased from no other source.
         Licensee shall enter into an exclusive buying office agreement
         with THEH and THUSA, for the purchases of Purchased Products.
         Pursuant to such buying office agreements,  Licensee shall pay
         to THEH or THUSA a buying office commission of *

         of the F.O.B. price of all Purchased Products.

                        (b)  In the event Licensee purchases Purchased
         Products (other than mens and boys sportswear) from a source
         other than Licensor or its designee, which shall in all events
         be a source approved by Licensor, Licensee shall pay to
         Licensor an administrative fee in the amount equal to * of the
         invoice price of all such Purchased Products.

                        (c)  Licensee may only source Licensed Products
         directly, without THEH or THUSA, if the type of approved
         Licensed Product is not then being sourced by THEH or THUSA.
         For example, if THEH and THUSA are, at the applicable time, not
         in the business of sourcing tailored clothing through their
         sources approved by Licensor, then Licensee may source the
         tailored clothing through its sources approved by Licensor.  In
         such event, such Licensed Products shall be defined as the
         Manufactured Products and purchases of such products shall be
         excluded from any administrative fee.  In no event shall
         Licensee be permitted to source Licensed Products through
         sources, or even through its own factories, which have not been
         approved by Licensor.


                        ARTICLE 3.  TERM OF THE AGREEMENT

                   3.1  INITIAL TERM.  The initial term of this
         Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and shall end on
         March 31, 2002 (the "Initial Term").

                   3.2  EXTENSION.  Providing that Licensee is not then
         in default and is not in default for the balance of the initial
         Term, Licensee shall have the right to extend this Agreement
         for successive five (5) year terms on six (6) months prior
         written notice to Licensor.  Licensee acknowledges that the six
         (6) month period for notice is necessary in order to maintain
         the continuity of Licensor's Licensing and Marketing programs
         and the goodwill associated with the Trademark.  Licensee
         agrees that "time is of the essence" and that Licensee's
         failure to exercise its option to renew timely shall be
         construed as a decision by Licensee that it has elected not to
         renew and shall permit Licensor to immediately replace Licensee
         by executing a new License Agreement with third parties, to
         commence after this Agreement has concluded, without any
         liability to Licensee.  Expiration or termination of this
         Agreement shall not effect any obligation of Licensee to make
         payments hereunder accruing prior to such expiration or
         termination.

         that is agreeable to both parties.

         records and all other documents and materials in the possession
         of and under the control of Licensee with respect to the
         subject matter and terms of this Agreement.  In the event a
         sublicense is approved by Licensor as provided hereunder,
         Licensee shall  also obtain for Licensor the right in any and
         all of such sublicenses for Licensor to similarly inspect the
         books and records of the sublicensees.  The exercise by
         Licensor of any right to audit at any time or times or the
         acceptance by Licensor of any statement, or payment shall be

         payable by Licensee to Licensor.  Licensor shall pay any income
         tax whether imposed by the laws of the United States or a
         United States state.  Licensee shall obtain, at its own cost
         and expense, all licenses, Reserve Bank, Commercial Bank or
         other bank approvals, and any other documentation necessary for
         the transmission of royalties and all other payments relevant
         to Licensee's performance under this Agreement.  If any tax or
         withholding is imposed on royalties, Licensee shall obtain
         certified proof of the tax payment or withholding and
         immediately transmit it to Licensor.

         be calculated using the rate of foreign exchange in effect at
         the Midland Bank PLC  at the close of business on the date of
         payment.  In the event that Licensee is required to withhold
         certain amounts for payment to the appropriate governmental
         authorities, Licensee will supply to Licensor the official
         receipts evidencing payment therefor.

                   5.9  INTEREST ON LATE PAYMENTS.  In addition to any
         other remedy available to Licensor, if any payment due under
         this Agreement is delayed for any reason, interest shall accrue
         and be payable, to the extent legally enforceable, on such

                             ARTICLE 7.  ADVERTISING

                   7.1  ADVERTISING.  All advertising and promotion in
         connection with Licensed Products, including cooperative
         advertising whereby Licensee provide their customers with a
         contribution be it in the form of actual monetary contribution,
         credit or otherwise, shall be placed with an agency approved by
         Licensor.  Licensee will pay, advertising invoices directly as
         they become due.  Licensee agrees to use its best efforts to
         advertise and promote the Licensed Products during each Annual
         Period in order to make the Trademark a well known name within
         the Territory and to maintain the high standards of the
         Trademark.

                   7.2  ADVERTISING EXPENDITURE.  Licensee agrees that,
         during each of the First and Second Annual Periods, it shall
         spend the greater of * dollars or * of the actual Net Sales,
         and for each such Annual Period thereafter, shall spend the
         greater of * of the Minimum Sales Level or * of the actual Net
         Sales for each such Annual Period, for direct media advertising
         of the Licensed Products not including any cooperative
         advertising, trade shows, sampling, or any other promotional or
         sales material normally produced for the sale of the Licensed
         Products (the "Advertising Expenditure").  If in any Annual
         Period the Advertising Expenditure has not been made, then
         Licensee shall spend such amount for advertising within the
         first ninety (90) days of the subsequent Annual Period.  If the
         Advertising Expenditure has not been expended by the end of
         said ninety (90) day period, then the amount which should have
         been expended and which was not expended shall be paid over to
         Licensor to be used by Licensor for advertising the Trademark
         provided, however, that if Advertising Expenditure has not been
         made prior to the termination of this Agreement, the unexpended
         Advertising Expenditure shall, within twenty (20) days, be paid
         over to Licensor absolutely.  Proof of expenditure shall be
         submitted each quarter using the Advertising Expenditure Form
         (Exhibit E).

                   7.3  APPROVAL OF PACKAGING, LABELING AND ADVERTISING.
         No packaging, labeling or advertising, including cooperative
         advertising may be used without the prior written approval of
         Licensor.  Before publication of any advertisement or
         promotion, Licensee shall submit every element of the
         advertisement or promotion  to Licensor for approval using an
         "Advertising Approval Form", as provided by Licensor.  Any
         approval granted hereunder shall be limited to use during the
         Seasonal Collection of the Licensed Products to which such
         advertising relates and shall be further limited to use (e.g.
         television or print) for which approval by Licensor was
         granted.  Samples of initial packaging, labeling and
         advertising, and samples of any revisions, changes,
         modifications or substitutions thereof, shall be submitted to
         Licensor sufficiently far in advance to permit Licensee  time
         to make such changes as Licensor shall deem necessary.  All
         requests for the approval of packaging, labeling or advertising
         pursuant to this Article 7.3 shall be accompanied by at least
         two (2) samples of the object for which approval is sought.
         Licensee shall use its best efforts to ensure that all
         advertising and promotional plans used by Licensee in
         connection with the Trademark, in any 


         *    This information has been omitted pursuant to a request
              for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and
              Exchange Commission.


                                       -14-<PAGE>







         form and in any medium, shall be consistent with the prestige
         of the Trademark and the quality of the Licensed Products.  All
         packaging, labeling and advertising of Licensed Products shall
         use the Trademark, but no other trademark or trade name shall
         be used except as may be required by applicable law or
         permitted by Licensor.  Licensee shall not be permitted to use
         their names on the Licensed Products, packaging and other
         materials displaying the Trademark other than as specifically
         approved by Licensor.  Any advertising materials provided by
         Licensor to Licensee shall be so provided at Licensee's cost
         and the price therefor shall be Licensor's cost of producing
         and providing the same.

                   7.4  USE OF TRADEMARK ON INVOICES, ETC.  The use of
         the Trademark by Licensee on invoices, order forms, stationery
         and related matter and in advertising in telephone or other
         directory listings is permitted only upon Licensor's prior
         written approval of the format in which the Trademark is to be
         so used, the juxtaposition of the Trademark with other words
         and phrases, and the content of the copy prior to the initial
         such use of the Trademark and prior to any material change
         therein; provided, however, that each such use of the Trademark
         is only in conjunction with the manufacture, sale, distribution
         or advertisement of Licensed Products pursuant to this
         Agreement.

                   7.5  LAUNCH.  In addition to the Advertising Payments
         required under Articles 7.1 and 7.2, Licensee agrees to host,
         at Licensee's expense, a launch event or distribute a gift
         package to the fashion and financial press and to major retail
         accounts during the initial selling season for the first
         Seasonal Collection to be sold under this Agreement.  Such
         event shall be comparable to similar launch events hosted by
         Licensor's other licensees of the Trademark and shall
         reasonably reflect the prestige of the Trademark and the
         relative significance of Licensed Products to Licensor.  In no
         event shall Licensee be required to spend more than * dollars
         on such launch event or gift package.


                        ARTICLE 8.  QUALITY AND STANDARDS

                   8.1  DISTINCTIVENESS AND QUALITY OF THE TRADEMARK.
         Licensee shall maintain the distinctiveness of the Trademark
         and the image and high quality of the goods and merchandise
         bearing the mark presently manufactured and sold by Licensor
         and its other licensees, and the prestigious marketing of same
         as hitherto and presently maintained by Licensor and its other
         licensees.  Licensee agrees that, with respect to all Licensed
         Products manufactured or sold by it, the same will be of high
         quality as to workmanship, fit, design and materials used
         therein, and shall be at least equal in quality, workmanship,
         fit, design and material to the samples of Licensed Products
         submitted by Licensee and approved by Licensor pursuant to
         Article 8.3 hereof.  All manufacturing and production shall be
         of a quality in keeping with the prestige of the Trademark.  In
         addition, Licensee acknowledges that in order to preserve the
         goodwill attached to the Trademark, the Licensed Products
         should be sold at prices and terms reflecting the prestigious
         nature of the Trademark, and the reputation of the Trademark as
         appearing on goods of high quality and reasonable price, it
         being understood, however, that Licensor is not empowered to
         fix or regulate the prices for which the Licensed Products are
         to be sold, either at the wholesale or retail level.



         *    This information has been omitted pursuant to a request
              for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and
              Exchange Commission.


                                       -15-<PAGE>







                   8.2  SHOPS, STORES, RETAIL OUTLETS.  The Licensed
         Products sold by Licensee may be sold only to those specialty
         shops, department stores and retail outlets which carry high
         quality and prestige merchandise and whose operations are
         consistent with Licensor's reputation and its sales policies
         and with the prestige of the Trademark and only to those
         customers expressly approved by Licensor.  Prior to the opening
         of each selling season (and whenever Licensee shall wish to
         sell Licensed Products to customers not previously approved by
         Licensor), Licensee shall submit a written list of the proposed
         customers to Licensor for Licensor's prior written approval,
         which approval may be given or withheld at Licensor's sole
         discretion, based upon whether it deems that the proposed
         customer shall enhance the quality and prestige of the
         Trademark.  Licensor shall have the right to withdraw any such
         approval on written notice to Licensee.  Licensee shall not (a)
         market or promote or seek customers for the Licensed Products
         outside of the Territory; (b) establish a branch, wholly owned
         by subsidiary, distribution or warehouse with inventories of
         Licensed Products outside of the Territory; (c) sell or
         distribute any Licensed Products to wholesalers, jobbers,
         diverters, catalog vendors or any other entity which does not
         operate retail stores exclusively; (d) sell the Licensed
         Products directly to the public in retail stores; (e) use the
         Licensed Products as giveaways, prizes or premiums, except for
         promotional programs which have received the prior written
         approval of Licensor; or (f) sell the Licensed Products to any
         third party or Affiliate of Licensee or any of its directors,
         officers, employees or any person having an equity
         participation in or any other affiliation to Licensee, without
         the prior written approval of Licensor.  Licensee shall include
         and shall enforce the following as a term and condition of sale
         to all of its customers:

                   "Resale Restrictions.  Buyer shall not directly
                   or indirectly distribute, market or sell the
                   Products to any party other than consumers or
                   end users without obtaining the prior written
                   consent of Seller."

                   8.3  SAMPLES OF MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS.  Before
         Licensee shall sell or distribute any Manufactured Products in
         any Seasonal Collection, Licensee shall submit samples of each
         of such Manufactured Products to Licensor for its prior written
         approval, which approval may be withheld by Licensor in its
         sole and absolute discretion.  Any such request for approval
         shall be submitted to Licensor on the form annexed hereto as
         Exhibit C.  Such samples shall be submitted sufficiently far in
         advance to permit Licensee time to make such changes as
         Licensor deems necessary.  Any approval given hereunder shall
         apply only to that Seasonal Collection for which it is
         submitted to Licensor.  Once samples have been approved,
         Licensee will manufacture only in accordance with such approved
         samples and will not make any changes for manufacture without
         Licensor's prior written approval.  All samples of Manufactured
         Products submitted to Licensor pursuant to this Article 8.3
         shall be provided at Licensee's sole cost and expense.
         Licensee shall submit to Licensor a reasonable number of
         additional samples of Manufactured Products upon Licensor's
         reasonable request.  No Manufactured  Products (including
         samples) shall be distributed and/or sold by Licensee pursuant
         to this Agreement unless such Manufactured Products are in
         substantial conformity with and at least equal in quality to
         the samples previously approved by Licensor in accordance with
         this Article 8.3.

                   8.4  NON-CONFORMING PRODUCTS.  In the event that any
         Licensed Product is, in the judgment of Licensor, not being
         manufactured, distributed or sold with first quality
         workmanship or 


                                       -16-<PAGE>







         in strict adherence to all details and characteristics
         furnished by Licensor, Licensor shall notify Licensee of the
         specific nature of the problem in writing and Licensee shall
         promptly repair or change such Licensed Product to conform
         thereto.  If a Licensed Product as repaired or changed does not
         strictly conform after Licensor's request and such strict
         conformity cannot be obtained after Licensee is given a
         reasonable opportunity to do so, Licensor may direct that the
         Trademark shall be promptly removed from the item.  In such
         event, the item may be sold by Licensee, provided such miscut
         or damaged item does not contain any labels or other
         identification bearing the Trademark without Licensor's prior
         approval.  Notwithstanding anything in this Article 8.4 to the
         contrary, sales of all products of Licensor's design whether or
         not bearing the Trademark, shall nonetheless be subject to
         royalty payments pursuant to Article 5 hereof.  Licensor may
         purchase at Licensee's expense any Licensed Products found in
         the marketplace which, in Licensor's judgment, are inconsistent
         with approved quality standards and bill such costs to
         Licensee.  Licensee must pay all royalties due on sales of
         nonconforming goods.  Licensor may require Licensee to recall
         any Licensed Products not consistent with approved quality
         standards.  Licensee shall use its best efforts to comply.

                   8.5  APPROVALS.  All approvals required or permitted
         by this Agreement must be in writing from Licensor to Licensee.
         All matters requiring approval of Licensor or the exercise of
         its discretion shall be at the sole subjective discretion of
         Licensor.  A submission for approval shall be deemed
         disapproved unless Licensor delivers a notice of approval
         within twenty (20) days.  Licensor shall provide an explanation
         for disapprovals.  Licensor has no obligation to approve,
         review or consider any item which does not strictly comply with
         the required submission procedures provided that Licensor
         designates the procedure which was not followed.  Approval by
         Licensor shall not be construed as a determination that the
         approved matter complies with all applicable regulations and
         laws.  No disapproved item shall be manufactured, sold, used,
         distributed or advertised.  Licensee may revise any disapproved
         item and resubmit it.  Licensee must strictly comply with all
         of Licensor's decisions.  The parties will adjust the approval
         forms as appropriate.  Upon reasonable notice, Licensor may
         withdraw approval of any previously approved item.  In the
         event that it is reasonably necessary for Licensor to do on-
         site approvals, Licensee will pay any and all expenses and air-
         fare incurred by Licensor with respect to such on-site
         approvals.

                   8.6  APPROVAL WITHDRAWAL.  If the style, appearance
         or quality of any Licensed Product ceases to be acceptable to
         Licensor, Licensor shall have the right in the exercise of its
         sole discretion to withdraw its approval of such Licensed
         Product.  Upon receipt of written notice from Licensor of its
         election to withdraw such approval, Licensee shall immediately
         cease the use of the Trademark in connection with the
         promotion, advertising, sale, manufacture, distribution or use
         of such Licensed Product(s).  Notice of such election by
         Licensor to withdraw approval shall not relieve Licensee from
         its obligation to pay royalties on sales of such Licensed
         Product(s) made by Licensee to the date of disapproval or
         thereafter as permitted.  Licensee may, however, complete work
         in process and utilize materials on hand provided that it
         submits proof of such work in progress and fabric inventory to
         Licensor.

                   8.7  SAMPLES, ARTWORK AND KNOW-HOW.  Licensor shall,
         at least four (4) times during each Annual Period, make
         available to Licensee certain samples, designs, colors, fabric


                                       -17-<PAGE>







         samples, tags, labels, packaging and artwork available to
         Licensor, and the cost of providing such materials shall be
         borne by Licensee.  All right, title and interest in and to
         samples, sketches, designs, and other materials furnished to
         Licensee by Licensor, whether created by Licensor or Licensee,
         including any modifications or improvements thereof which may
         be created by Licensor, Licensee are hereby assigned to and
         shall be the sole property of Licensor as between Licensee and
         Licensor and are licensed hereunder solely and exclusively for
         use in connection with the manufacture and sale of Licensed
         Products in the Territory.  Licensor may use and permit others
         to use said designs and other materials in any manner it
         desires, provided that such use does not conflict with any
         rights granted Licensee hereunder.  Licensee specifically
         acknowledges that such designs and other materials may be used
         by Licensor and other licensees on Licensed Products in
         jurisdictions outside the Territory and on products other than
         Licensed Products anywhere in the world.  In addition to the
         foregoing, for marketing purposes, Licensor shall, upon
         reasonable request, make available to Licensee, such of the
         following which are available to Licensor:  (a) reports on
         marketing policy of Licensor; (b) reports on color, style and
         fabric trends; (c) samples of advertising materials; (d)
         display ideas; and (e) labels, hangtags and packaging.

                   8.8  CONFIDENTIALITY.  Licensee acknowledges that it
         will receive from Licensor prints, designs, ideas, sketches,
         and other materials or Trade Secrets which Licensor intends to
         use on or in connection with lines of merchandise other than
         the Licensed Products and which have not as yet found their way
         into the channels of distribution.  The parties recognize that
         these materials are valuable property of Licensor.  Licensee
         acknowledges the need to preserve the confidentiality and
         secrecy of these materials and agrees to take all necessary
         steps to ensure that use by it, or by its contractors will in
         all respects preserve such confidentiality and secrecy.
         Licensee shall take all reasonable precautions to protect the
         secrecy of the materials, samples, and designs described in
         this Article 8.8 prior to their commercial distribution or the
         showing of samples for sale, and shall not sell any merchandise
         employing or adapted from any of said designs except under the
         Trademark.  Licensor shall take all reasonable precautions to
         protect the secrecy of the original designs created by Licensee
         for Licensed Products prior to their advertisement, commercial
         distribution or the showing of samples for sale.  Neither
         Licensor nor Licensee shall, at any time during the term of
         this Agreement, disclose or use for any purpose, other than as
         contemplated by this Agreement, any revealed or otherwise
         acquired confidential information and data relating to the
         business of the other.

                   8.9  MANUFACTURE OF LICENSED PRODUCTS BY THIRD
         PARTIES.

                        (a)  Licensee shall execute the  attached
         Exhibit G, within thirty (30) days from execution of this
         Agreement evidencing that all Licensed Products manufactured

         will be manufactured in compliance with the wage and hour laws
         of the country of manufacture and without the use of child
         (under the age of 14), prison or slave labor;

                        (b)  Licensee shall not utilize any factory

         facility) in the manufacture of Licensed Products (including
         all components thereof) unless (a) it has been inspected and
         approved, in writing, by an authorized employee or agent of
         Licensee; (b) Exhibit G is executed by each such third party
         manufacturer or a third party manufacturer's contract sewing
         shop or other designated contract facility; and (c) Licensee
         shall obtain the signature of an authorized representative from
         each third party manufacturer used by Licensee on a brief
         agreement designated to protect Licensor's rights in the
         Trademark (see Exhibit D).  Licensee acknowledges that it shall
         remain primarily liable and completely obligated under all of
         the provisions of this Agreement in respect of such
         subcontracting arrangements. 

                        (c)  Licensee shall provide access to Licensor's
         representative, upon reasonable notice, to (i) Licensee's
         manufacturing facility and any manufacturing facility operated
         by any third party manufacturer or such third party

                        (d)  Licensee acknowledges that it has in effect
         (or will promptly develop) a program of monitoring
         manufacturing facilities either operated by third party
         manufacturers or any such third party manufacturers' contract
         sewing shops or other designated contract facilities for
         compliance with the requirements of Article 8.9(a) above; and

                        (e)  Licensee shall exercise best efforts to
         ensure that all shipping documents which accompany all Licensed
         Products include the following language (either pre-printed or
         "stamped"):

              "We hereby certify that the merchandise covered by this
              shipment was manufactured in compliance with all
              applicable requirements of the wage and hour laws of the
              country of manufacture and without the use of child (under
              the age of 14), prison or slave labor.  We further certify
              that we have in effect a program of monitoring any
              suppliers, contract sewing shops and other designated
              contract facilities which manufactured Tommy Hilfiger
              (Registered) brand  merchandise for compliance with the
              requirements set forth above.  We also certify that this
              shipment is in compliance with all laws applicable to the

              states the country of origin on all products; the marking
              of shipments with proper country of origin and shall be
              shipped under legally issued and valid export licenses or
              visas."

                   8.10  MARKING, LABELING AND PACKAGING IN ACCORDANCE
         WITH APPLICABLE LAWS.  All Licensed Products manufactured,
         distributed or sold by Licensee shall be marked, labeled,
         packaged, advertised, distributed and sold in accordance with
         this Agreement, in accordance with all applicable laws, rules
         and regulations in the Territory, and in such a manner as will
         not tend to mislead or deceive the public.  At the request of
         Licensor, Licensee shall cause to be placed on all Licensed
         Products appropriate notice designating Licensor as the
         copyright or design patent owner thereof, 


                                       -19-<PAGE>







         as the case may be.

                   8.11  DISPOSAL OF SECONDS AND CLOSE-OUTS.

                        (a)  Seconds.  Licensee shall only sell Licensed
         Products which are Seconds in a way which shall not reduce the
         value of the Trademark or detract from its reputation and shall
         obtain the express prior written consent of Licensor with
         respect to the terms and method of such disposal.  All Seconds
         approved for sale by Licensor shall be clearly marked "Seconds"
         or "Irregular".  The percentage of Seconds of any of the
         Licensed Products which may be disposed of pursuant to this
         Article 8.11(a) shall not, in any event, exceed * of the total
         number of units of Licensed Products distributed or sold by
         Licensee.

                        (b)  Close-Outs.  All Close-Outs shall be sold
         only with Licensor's prior written approval, which Licensor may
         withhold in its sole discretion, through retail outlets and
         traditional and accepted dealers in such merchandise and upon
         such terms and conditions as Licensee, in its reasonable
         discretion, determines appropriate and shall not be sold to any
         person which Licensee know, or have reason to know, will export
         such Close-Outs from the Territory.  The percentage of Close-
         Outs of any of the Licensed Products which may be disposed of
         pursuant to this Article 8.11(b) shall not, in any event,
         exceed * of the total number of units of such Licensed Products
         distributed or sold by Licensee in each Annual Period.

                   8.12  ASSISTANCE BY LICENSOR.  Licensee shall have
         the right to cause its personnel to reasonably visit Licensor's
         offices, factories, showroom, and other places of business, and
         also to attend Licensor's sales meetings in order to obtain
         additional know-how and assistance.  The scheduling of such
         visits shall be at times mutually convenient to the parties
         hereto.  In connection with such visits, Licensee shall bear
         all air-fare to and from, and subsistence expenses of
         Licensee's representatives.  In the event Licensee requests Mr.
         Tommy Hilfiger or any other member(s) of Licensor's staff to
         make a personal appearance, to attend any function, to visit
         Licensee's manufacturing plants or facilities or to attend any
         design meetings, Licensee shall pay all of the reasonable
         expenses in connection therewith, including air travel and
         hotel accommodations, and other reasonable services of
         Licensor's choosing.  Licensee shall reimburse Licensor for all
         reasonable expenses so incurred by Licensor at Licensee's
         request.

                   8.13  MEETINGS.  Licensor may from time to time but
         no more than twice a year hold a meeting of Licensor's
         licensees/distributors.  Licensee agrees upon receipt of
         reasonable notice to attend any such meeting(s) at its own
         expense.

                   8.14  DESIGN RIGHTS.  Licensee acknowledges and
         agrees that Licensor owns or shall own all design rights
         relating to the Licensed Products, regardless of whether such
         designs were created by Licensor or by or on behalf of
         Licensee.  Licensee agrees to make, procure and execute all
         assignments necessary to vest ownership of design rights in
         Licensor.  Licensee shall place appropriate notices, reflecting
         ownership of design rights by Licensor, on all the Licensed
         Products, packaging, tags, labels and advertising and
         promotional materials.  Licensee shall not do or allow to 



         *    This information has been omitted pursuant to a request

              Exchange Commission.


                                       -20-<PAGE>







         be done anything which may adversely affect any of Licensor's
         design rights.  All designs used by Licensee for the Licensed
         Products shall be used exclusively for the Licensed Products
         and may not be used under any other trademark or private label
         without the prior written consent of Licensor.  Licensee shall
         disclose and freely make available to Licensor any and all
         developments or improvements it may make relating to the
         Licensed Products and to their manufacture, promotion and
         sales, including, without limitation, developments and
         improvements in any machine, process or product design, that
         may be disclosed or suggested by Licensor or regarding any
         patent or trademark which Licensee is entitled to utilize.

                   8.15  PRICING.  Licensee acknowledges that in order
         to preserve the goodwill attached to the Trademark, the
         Licensed Products should be sold at prices and terms reflecting
         the prestigious nature of the Trademark, it being understood,
         however, that Licensor is not empowered to fix or regulate the
         prices for which the Licensed Products are to be sold, either
         at the wholesale or retail level.


                            ARTICLE 9.  THE TRADEMARK

                   9.1  RIGHTS TO THE TRADEMARK.  Licensee acknowledges
         the great value of the goodwill associated with the Trademark.
         Licensee will not, at any time, do, or otherwise suffer to be
         done any act or thing which may, in any way, adversely affect
         any rights of Licensor in and to the Trademark or any
         registrations thereof or which, directly or indirectly, may
         reduce the value of the Trademark or detract from its
         reputation.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
         construed as an assignment or grant to Licensee of any right,
         title or interest in or to the Trademark, or any of Licensor's
         other trademarks, it being understood that all rights relating
         thereto are reserved by Licensor, except for the License
         hereunder to Licensee of the right to use and utilize the
         Trademark only as specifically and expressly provided herein.
         Licensee shall not file or prosecute a trademark or service
         mark application or applications to register the Trademark in
         respect of the Licensed Products or any other goods or
         services.  Licensee shall not, during the term of this
         Agreement or thereafter, (a) attack Licensor's title or right
         in and to the Trademark in any jurisdiction or attack the
         validity of this License or the Trademark or (b) contest the
         fact that Licensee's rights under this Agreement (i) are solely
         those of a manufacturer and distributor and, (ii) subject to
         the provisions of Article 11 hereof, cease upon termination of
         this Agreement.  The provisions of this Article 9.1 shall
         survive the termination of this Agreement.

                   9.2  PROTECTING THE TRADEMARK.  Licensee shall
         cooperate fully and in good faith with Licensor for the purpose
         of securing, preserving and protecting Licensor's rights in and
         to the Trademark.  At the request of Licensor, Licensee shall
         execute and deliver to Licensor any and all documents and do
         all other acts and things which Licensor deems necessary or
         appropriate to make fully effective or to implement the
         provisions of this Agreement relating to the ownership or
         registration of the Trademark.

                   9.3  COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.  Licensee
         will use the Trademark in the Territory strictly in compliance
         with the legal requirements therein.  Whenever any Trademark is
         used 


                                       -21-<PAGE>







         on any item of packaging or labeling or in any advertisement,
         it must be followed, in the case of a registered trademark by
         the registration symbol, i.e., (Registered), and in the case of
         all other trademarks by the symbol TM, or other appropriate
         symbols of similar import acceptable to Licensor.  Licensee
         shall duly display all other notices with respect to the
         Trademark, on the Licensed Products and otherwise, as are or
         may be required by the trademark laws and regulations
         applicable within the Territory.  Upon expiration or
         termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever,
         Licensee will execute and deliver to Licensor any and all
         documents required by Licensor terminating any and all
         trademark registrations, Registered User agreements and other
         documents regarding this Trademark.

                   9.4  OWNERSHIP OF COPYRIGHT.  Any copyright which may
         be created under this Agreement in any sketch, design, print,
         package, label, tag or the like designed or approved or used
         with the Trademark by Licensor will be the property of
         Licensor.  Licensee will not, at any time, do, or otherwise
         suffer to be done, any act or thing which may adversely affect
         any rights of Licensor in such sketches, designs, prints,
         packages, labels, tags and the like and will, at Licensor's
         request, do all things reasonably required by Licensor to
         preserve and protect said rights.

                   9.5  NOTICE OF INFRINGEMENT.  Licensee shall notify
         Licensor in writing of any infringement or imitation of the
         Trademark or the use by any person of any trademarks or
         tradenames confusingly similar to the Trademark promptly as
         same may come to the attention of Licensee.  Licensor will
         thereupon take such action as it deems advisable for the
         protection of the Trademark and its rights therein, and
         Licensee shall assist Licensor in the prosecution of any such
         suit, as Licensor may reasonably request, at Licensor's
         expense.  In no event, however, will Licensor be required to
         take any action if it deems it inadvisable to do so and
         Licensee will have no right to take any action with respect to
         the Trademark without the prior written consent of Licensor.
         In the event a third party infringes the use of the Trademark
         in the Territory on items similar to the Licensed Products,
         Licensor shall take all advisable and necessary measures to
         protect the Trademark and Licensee agrees that, at Licensor's
         request, it will pay * of the costs incurred therefor,
         including judicial expenses and legal fees.

                   9.6  COUNTERFEIT PROTECTION.  Licensee shall use its
         best efforts to prevent counterfeiting of the Licensed
         Products.  All Licensed Products shall bear and use any
         reasonable counterfeit preventive system, devices or labels
         designated by Licensor.  At its option, Licensor may supply the
         system, devices or labels (provided that they are supplied on a
         timely basis), which Licensee must use and for which Licensee
         shall pay all reasonable costs in advance.  

                   9.7  USE OF OTHER TRADEMARKS.  At all times while
         this Agreement is in effect, neither Licensee, nor any company
         affiliated with Licensee, owned or controlled by Licensee,
         under common ownership with or having common stockholders as
         Licensee, in which the owner of Licensee is a partner, or in
         which Licensee is a partner, shall act as a licensee or
         distributor in the Territory of any products included in
         Article 1.12 under any name directly competitive with Licensor,
         other than "Pepe Jeans" and its derivatives and related
         trademarks, without the prior written approval of Licensor.
         Nothing herein is to be construed so as to prohibit Licensee
         from acting as a manufacturer only of such products under a
         name competitive with Licensor, providing that Licensee shall
         not be 



         *    This information has been omitted pursuant to a request
              for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and

                                       -22-<PAGE>







         the licensee or distributor thereof.  The design and style of
         any such products or any of Licensee's private label products
         must be clearly distinguished from the Licensed Products (the
         foregoing shall be exclusive of any products previously
         designed by Licensee or any of its Affiliates pursuant to other
         license agreements in effect between Licensor and Licensee or
         any of its Affiliates).  If such consent is given, unless
         prohibited by other agreements, Licensee shall provide Licensor
         with samples of any clothing products, lines or collections
         Licensee manufactures or has manufactured for it or distributed
         for it which do not bear the Trademarks.  A breach of this
         clause shall constitute a violation of Licensee's obligation to
         use its best efforts to exploit this license.  The design,
         merchandising, packaging, sales and display of all of
         Licensee's non-licensed products shall be separate and distinct
         from the Licensed Products.  Licensee shall maintain a separate
         area for exhibition of the Licensed Products wherever the
         Licensed Products are sold.

                   9.8  USE OF TRADEMARK ON INVOICES, ETC.  The use of
         the Trademark by Licensee on invoices, order forms, stationery
         and related materials in advertising in telephone or other
         directory listings is permitted only upon Licensor's prior
         written approval of the format in which the Trademark is to be
         so used, the juxtaposition of the Trademark with other words
         and phrases, and the content of the copy prior to the initial
         such use of the Trademark and prior to any material change
         therein; provided, however, that each such use of the Trademark
         is only in conjunction with the manufacture, sale, distribution
         or advertisement of Licensed Products pursuant to this
         Agreement.

                   9.9  MONITORING.  Licensee shall actively monitor use
         of the Trademark by Licensee and its customers and shall use
         its best efforts to see that such use does not impair the image
         or reputation heretofore or hereafter established by Licensor
         for products bearing the Trademark; provided, however, that the
         Licensee shall have no obligation to place any unlawful
         restriction on its customers.


                             ARTICLE 10.  INSOLVENCY

                   10.1  EFFECT OF PROCEEDING IN BANKRUPTCY, ETC.  If
         either party institutes for its protection or is made a
         defendant in any proceeding under bankruptcy, insolvency,
         reorganization or receivership law, or if either party is
         placed in receivership or makes an assignment for benefit of
         creditors or is unable to meet its debts in the regular course
         of business, the other party may elect to terminate this
         Agreement immediately by written notice to the other party
         without prejudice to any right or remedy the terminating party
         may have, including, but not limited to, damages for breach to
         the extent that the same may be recoverable.

                   10.2  RIGHTS, PERSONAL.  The license and rights
         granted hereunder are personal to Licensee.  No assignee for
         the benefit of creditors, receiver, trustee in bankruptcy,
         sheriff or any other officer or court charged with taking over
         custody of Licensee's assets or business, shall have any right
         to continue performance of this Agreement or to exploit or in
         any way use the Trademark if this Agreement is terminated
         pursuant to Articles 11.1 and 11.2, except as may be required
         by law.

                   10.3  TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY.  Notwithstanding the
         provisions of Article 10.2 above, 


                                       -23-<PAGE>







         in the event that, pursuant to the applicable bankruptcy law
         (the "Code"), a trustee in bankruptcy, receiver or other
         comparable person, of Licensee, or Licensee, as debtor, is
         permitted to assume this Agreement and does so and, thereafter,
         desires to assign this Agreement to a third party, which
         assignment satisfies the requirements of the Code, the trustee
         or Licensee, as the case may be, shall notify Licensor of same
         in writing.  Said notice shall set forth the name and address
         of the proposed assignee, the proposed consideration for the
         assignment and all other relevant details thereof.  The giving
         of such notice shall be deemed to constitute an offer to
         Licensor to have this Agreement assigned to Licensor or its
         designee for such consideration, or its equivalent in money,
         and upon such terms as are specified in the notice.  The
         aforesaid offer may be accepted by Licensor only by written
         notice given to the trustee or Licensee, as the case may be,
         within fifteen (15) days after Licensor's receipt of the notice
         to such party.  If Licensor fails to deliver such notice within
         the said fifteen (15) days, such party may complete the
         assignment referred to in its notice, but only if such
         assignment is to the entity named in said notice and for the
         consideration and upon the terms specified therein.  Nothing
         contained herein shall be deemed to preclude or impair any
         rights which Licensor may have as a creditor in any bankruptcy
         proceeding.


                             ARTICLE 11.  TERMINATION

                   11.1  OTHER RIGHTS UNAFFECTED.  It is understood and
         agreed that termination by either party on any ground shall be
         without prejudice to any other remedies which the terminating
         party may have.

                   11.2  TERMINATION WITHOUT NOTICE.  If any of the
         following grounds for termination shall occur, this Agreement
         shall thereupon forthwith terminate and come to an end without
         any need for notice from Licensor:

                        (a)  If Licensee shall make an unauthorized
         disclosure of confidential information, Trade Secrets, or
         materials given or loaned to Licensee by Licensor; 

                        (b)  If Licensee institutes proceedings seeking
         relief under a bankruptcy act or any similar law, or otherwise
         violates the provisions of Article 10.1 thereof;

                        (c)  If Licensee transfers or agrees to transfer
         substantially all of its property, its shares of stock or, this
         Agreement in violation of Article 17 thereof;

                        (d)  If Licensee shall sell unapproved
         merchandise in violation of Article 8.3 hereof;

                        (e)  If Licensee shall, without the prior
         written consent of Licensor, use the Trademark in an
         unauthorized or improper manner;


                                       -24-<PAGE>







                        (f)  If Licensee shall use the Trademark in
         connection with another trademark or name; and/or

                        (g)  If Licensee shall place or participate in
         any advertising prohibited by Article 7.

                   11.3  TERMINATION WITH NOTICE.  If Licensee breaches
         any of its obligations under this Agreement, other than those
         specified in Article 11.2 above, Licensor may terminate this
         Agreement by giving Notice of Termination to Licensee.
         Termination will become effective automatically unless Licensee
         completely cures the breach within fifteen (15) days of the
         giving of such Notice.  Termination based upon Licensee's
         failure to comply with the Minimum Sales Levels set forth in
         Article 4.2 shall become effective thirty (30) days after the
         giving of the Notice.  If the notice relates to royalties or to
         product quality, pending cure Licensee shall ship no Licensed
         Products; if Licensee does ship, it shall automatically forfeit
         its right to cure and the License shall be terminated.  Upon
         the giving of a Notice of Termination for the second time, for
         any reason, Licensee shall no longer have the right to cure any
         violation, and termination shall be effective upon the giving
         of the Notice.

                   11.4  EFFECT OF TERMINATION.  On the termination of
         this Agreement for any reason whatsoever:  all of the rights of
         Licensee under this Agreement shall forthwith terminate and
         immediately revert to Licensor; all royalties on sales
         theretofore made shall become immediately due and payable;
         Licensee shall forthwith discontinue all use of the Trademark,
         except that Licensee may have a period of ninety (90) days
         after such termination to consummate all sales of Licensed
         Products which were firm upon the delivery of the Inventory
         Schedule in accordance with Article 11.5 hereof and to sell the
         balance of the Inventory not purchased by Licensor, and
         royalties with respect thereto shall be due on such ninetieth
         day.  Licensor shall have the right to conduct a physical
         inventory of the Licensed Products in Licensee's possession or
         control.  Licensee will completely remove the Trademark from
         Licensed Products and destroy all hangtags and labeling
         attached to such Licensed Products.  Licensee shall, at
         Licensee's expense, either return to Licensor all remaining
         Inventory after such ninetieth (90th) day or destroy all
         remaining Inventory under the supervision of Licensor.
         Licensee shall no longer use the Trademark, any variation,
         imitation or simulation thereof, or any Trademark similar
         thereto; Licensee shall immediately take all necessary steps to
         change its or any Affiliate's corporate name to omit any
         reference to or use of the Trademarks; Licensee will promptly
         transfer to Licensor, free of charge, all registrations,
         filings and rights with regard to the Trademark which it may
         have possessed at any time; and Licensee shall thereupon
         deliver to Licensor, free of charge, all sketches, designs,
         colors and the like in its possession or control, designed or
         approved by Licensor, and all Labels supplied by Licensor in
         Licensee's possession or control.  Licensor shall have the
         option, exercisable upon notice to Licensee within thirty (30)
         days of termination, to negotiate the purchase of the Labels
         which have not been supplied by Licensor.  If such negotiations
         do not result in the purchase of the Labels not supplied by
         Licensor, Licensee shall destroy the Labels under the
         supervision of Licensor, and Licensee, shall supply to Licensor
         a certificate of destruction thereof signed by a duly
         authorized officer of Licensee.  

                   11.5  INVENTORY UPON TERMINATION.  Upon the
         termination of this Agreement for any 


                                       -25-<PAGE>







         reason whatsoever, Licensee shall immediately deliver to
         Licensor an Inventory Schedule.  The Inventory Schedule shall
         be prepared as of the close of business on the date of such
         termination and shall reflect direct cost of each such item
         (not including overhead or any general or administrative
         expenses).  Licensor thereupon shall have the option,
         exercisable by notice in writing delivered to Licensee within
         thirty (30) days after its receipt of the complete Inventory
         Schedule, to purchase any or all of the Inventory for an amount
         equal to the price as determined as follows:  (i) as to
         Manufactured Products, the price shall be Licensee's standard
         cost (the actual manufacturing cost); and (ii) as to Purchased
         Products, the price shall be Licensee's landed costs, which
         shall, for the purposes hereof, mean the F.O.B. price together
         with customs, duties, brokerage, freight and insurance.  In the
         event such notice is sent by Licensor, Licensor may collect the
         Inventory referred to therein within ninety (90) days after
         Licensor's said notice.  Licensor will pay such Licensee for
         such Inventory upon such collection.  In the event such notice
         is not sent, Licensee may dispose of the Licensed Products
         within ninety (90) days of the date of termination; provided,
         however, that any advertising used during such period shall be
         subject to Licensor's prior written approval and such
         disposition of the Licensed Products shall be subject to
         Licensee's obligations hereunder, including, but not limited to
         payments to be made to Licensor.  At the end of such ninety
         (90) day period, any Licensed Products remaining in Licensee's
         possession shall, at the request of Licensor, be destroyed.

                   11.6  CONTRIBUTION FROM SEL.  SEL International
         Investments Corp. ("SEL"), hereby agrees to make (or cause a
         subsidiary to make) capital contributions to Licensee in an
         amount equal to at least * in the aggregate, over the first
         three (3) Annual Periods.  Licensee shall dedicate and,
         promptly after the receipt of any portion of such
         contributions, notify Licensor of the amount received and
         utilize the total amount of such funds received for the support
         and development of the business contemplated hereunder. 

                   11.7  FREEDOM TO LICENSE.  In the event of
         termination of this Agreement or the receipt by Licensor of a
         notice of termination from Licensee, Licensor shall be free to
         license to others the use of the Trademark in connection with
         the manufacture and sale of Licensed Products in the Territory,
         but only if the sale of such Licensed Products in the Territory
         produced pursuant to such third party agreement is prohibited
         until after the termination of this Agreement.

                   11.8  EQUITABLE RELIEF.  Licensor and Licensee shall
         be entitled to equitable relief by way of temporary and
         permanent injunction and such other and further relief as any
         court with jurisdiction may deem just and proper.

                   11.9  TERMINATION WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  Termination of
         this Agreement pursuant to and conditions hereof shall be
         without prejudice to the terminating party's other rights and
         remedies at law or in equity

                   11.10  WAIVER.  It is expressly understood that under
         no circumstances shall Licensee be entitled, directly or
         indirectly, to any form of compensation or indemnity from
         Licensor as a consequence to the termination of this Agreement,
         whether as a result of the passage of time, or as the result of
         any other cause of termination referred to in this Agreement.

         generality of the foregoing, by its execution of the present
         Agreement, Licensee hereby waives any claim which it has or
         which it may have in the future against Licensor arising from
         any alleged goodwill created by the Licensee for the benefit of
         the said parties or from the alleged creation or increase of a
         market for Licensed Products.  


                  ARTICLE 12.  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES

                   12.1  NO AGENCY.  Licensee shall not represent itself
         as the agent or legal representative of Licensor, Licensor's
         affiliates or Tommy Hilfiger for any purpose whatsoever and
         shall have no right to create or assume any obligation of any
         kind, express or implied, for or on behalf of them in any way
         whatsoever.  Licensor shall similarly not represent itself as
         the agent or legal representative of Licensee.

                               ARTICLE 14.  BENEFIT

         parties hereto.


                             ARTICLE 16.  NON-WAIVER

                   16.1  NON-WAIVER.  The failure of either party to
         enforce at any time any term, provision or condition of this
         Agreement, or to exercise any right or option herein, shall in
         no way operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
         partial exercise preclude any other right or option herein; and
         no waiver whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing, signed
         by the waiving party, and only to the extent herein set forth.


                             ARTICLE 17.  ASSIGNMENT

                   17.1  NO ASSIGNMENT WITHOUT CONSENT.  The license and
         rights granted to Licensee hereunder are personal in nature,
         and Licensee may not and shall not sell, transfer, lease,
         sublicense 


                                       -27-<PAGE>







         or assign this Agreement or its rights and interest hereunder,
         or any part hereof, by operation of law or otherwise, without
         the prior written consent of Licensor, which consent may be
         withheld by Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion,
         except that Licensee shall have the right, upon written notice
         to Licensor, to assign or sublicense this Agreement to
         Affiliates of Licensee; provided, however, that in such event
         Licensee agrees to guarantee the performance and obligations of
         such corporation, subsidiary or Affiliate under this Agreement.

                   17.2  SALE OF ASSETS.  A sale or other transfer of
         all or substantially all of the assets of Licensee or a change
         in the control of Licensee other than as permitted under
         Article 17.1 shall be deemed an assignment of Licensee's rights
         and interests under this Agreement to which the terms and
         conditions of Article 17.1 of this Agreement shall apply.

                   17.3  SALE OF STOCK/INTEREST.  Any transfer, by
         operation of law or otherwise, of Licensee's interest in this
         Agreement (in whole or in part), a fifty (50%) percent or

         Licensee (whether stock, partnership, interest or otherwise) or
         any interest directly or indirectly to a competitor of Licensor
         shall be deemed an assignment of Licensee's rights and interest
         under this Agreement to which the terms and conditions of
         Article 17.1 of this Agreement shall apply.  The issuance of
         shares of stock to other than the existing shareholders or
         their affiliates is deemed to be a transfer of that stock for
         purposes of this Article.  If after the date hereof, there is a
         transfer of less than a fifty (50%) percent interest in
         Licensee to a non Affiliate of Licensee, then any other
         transfer of an interest in Licensee to a non Affiliate of
         Licensee which when added to the total percentage previously
         transferred totals a transfer of greater than fifty (50%)
         percent interest of Licensee, shall be deemed an assignment of
         Licensee's interest in this Agreement within the meaning of
         this Article to which the terms and conditions of Article 20.1
         shall apply.

                   17.4  ASSIGNMENT BY LICENSOR.  Licensor shall have a
         complete and unrestricted right to sell, transfer, lease or
         assign its rights and interests in this Agreement to any
         domestic or foreign corporation or other business entity,
         providing that such transferee agrees to be bound by all of the
         terms hereof and is the holder of the Trademark in the
         Territory.  When Licensor wishes to sell, transfer, lease or
         assign its rights and interests in this Agreement, Licensor
         shall do so on notice to Licensee.

         hereby indemnify and hold harmless Licensor, Tommy Hilfiger,
         and their directors, officers, employees, agents, officials and
         related companies from and against any and all losses,
         liability, damages and expenses (including reasonable
         attorneys' fees and expenses) which they or any of them may
         incur or be obligated to pay in any action, claim or proceeding
         against them or any of them, for or by reason of any acts,
         whether of omission or commission, that may be committed or
         suffered by Licensee or any of their servants, agents or
         employees in connection with Licensee's performance of this
         Agreement, including but not limited to:



                                       -28-<PAGE>








                        18.1.1.   any alleged defect in any Licensed
         Product, regardless of whether the action is based upon
         negligence or strict liability, and regardless of whether the
         alleged negligence of Licensor is characterized as "passive" or
         "active";

                        18.1.2.   the manufacture, labeling, sale,
         distribution or advertisement of any Licensed Product by
         Licensee;

                        18.1.3.   any violation of any warranty,
         representation or agreement made by Licensee pertaining to a
         Licensed Product;

                        18.1.4.   the claim of any broker, finder or
         agent in connection with the making of this Agreement or any
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         The provisions of this Article and Licensee's obligations
         hereunder shall survive any termination or rescission of this
         Agreement.

                   18.2  NOTICE OF SUIT OR CLAIM.  Licensee shall
         promptly inform Licensor by written notice of any suit or claim
         against Licensee relating to Licensee's performance under this
         Agreement, whether such suit or claim is for personal injury,
         involves alleged defects in the Licensed Products manufactured,
         sold or distributed hereunder, or otherwise.

                   18.3  INDEMNIFICATION BY LICENSOR.  Licensor does
         indemnify and hold harmless Licensee, against any and all
         liabilities, damages and expense (including reasonable
         attorneys' fees, costs and expenses) which Licensee may incur
         or be obligated to pay in any action or claim against Licensee
         for infringement of any other person's claimed right to use a
         trademark in the Territory, but only where such action or claim
         results from Licensee's use of the Trademark in the Territory
         in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and where
         Licensee is not at fault.  Licensee shall give Licensor prompt
         written notice of any such claim or action, and thereupon
         Licensor shall undertake and conduct the defense of any suit so
         brought.  It is understood, however, that if there is a dispute
         between Licensor and Licensee as to whether the suit was
         brought as a result of Licensee's failure to use the mark in
         accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Licensee may be
         required to conduct such defense unless and until it is
         determined that no such misuse of the Trademark occurred and
         that Licensee are not at fault.  In the event appropriate
         action is not taken by Licensor within thirty (30) days of its
         receipt of notice from Licensee, Licensee shall have the right
         to defend such claim or action in its own name, but no
         settlement or compromise of any such claim or action may be
         made without the prior written approval of Licensor.  In either
         case, Licensor and Licensee shall keep each other fully advised
         of all developments and shall cooperate fully with each other
         and in all respects in connection with any such defense is
         made.  Such indemnification shall be deemed to apply solely to
         the amount of the judgment, if any, against Licensee, and sums
         paid by Licensee in connection with its defense.  Such
         indemnification shall not apply to any damages sustained by
         Licensee by reason of such claimed infringement other than
         those specified above.  The provisions of this Article and
         Licensor's obligations hereunder shall survive any termination
         or rescission of this Agreement.

         Agreement, Licensee shall maintain commercial general liability
         insurance in the amount of at least * (combined single limit
         per occurrence) with a broad form property damage liability
         coverage.  This insurance shall include broad form blanket
         contractual liability, personal injury liability, advertising
         liability, products and completed operations liability.  Each

         shall purchase insurance against theft and destruction of the
         Licensed Products which shall (1) be written on an "all risk"
         basis; (2) provide that Licensee shall be reimbursed for loss
         in an amount equal to the manufacturer's selling price for the
         products (this may be accomplished by either a selling price
         endorsement or business interruption insurance); (3) provide
         that Licensor is added as a loss payee in respect to losses to
         Licensed Products as their interests may appear; (4) be in
         effect while goods are on premises owned, rented or controlled
         by Licensee and while in transit or storage; and (5) include a
         brand and label clause stating, among other things, that the
         insurer will pay the cost of removing Licensor's name from
         damaged merchandise and relabeling goods.

                        (c)  General Provisions.  The insurance

         thirty (30) days written notice prior to cancellation or non-
         renewal of coverage; (2) an endorsement naming Licensor as an
         additional insured; and (3) a mutual waiver of subrogation for
         insured property losses.

                        (d)  Approved Carrier/Policy Changes.  All
         insurance shall be obtained from an insurance company approved
         by Licensor which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
         Licensee shall give at least thirty (30) days prior written
         notice to Licensor of the cancellation of, or any modification
         in, such insurance policy that would affect Licensor's status
         or benefits thereunder.  This insurance may be obtained for

                   21.1  SUSPENSION OF OBLIGATIONS.  If Licensee shall
         be prevented from performing any of its obligations because of
         governmental regulation or order, or by strike, civil unrest or
         war, declared or undeclared, or other calamities such as fire,
         flood, hurricane, tornado, earthquake, or similar acts of God,
         or because of other similar or dissimilar cause beyond the

         such conditions.  If such condition continues for a period of
         more than sixty (60) days, Licensor shall have the right to
         terminate this Agreement.  If the act of force majeure consists
         of a fire, flood, hurricane, tornado, earthquake or nuclear war
         and if the act prevents Licensee from manufacturing and/or
         timely delivering the Licensed Products, whether due to an
         inability to obtain fabric or other materials, destruction of
         manufacturing facilities, inability to deliver finished
         product, or otherwise, Licensee shall have a period of not to
         exceed ninety (90) days to find alternate sources and Licensee
         shall advise Licensor on a weekly basis of the progress it has
         made in that regard.  If, in Licensor's reasonable opinion,
         Licensee shall fail to diligently proceed to obtain alternate
         sources, or if the condition shall continue to exist for a
         period of ninety (90) days, Licensor shall have the right to
         terminate this Agreement.

                   23.5  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.  Licensee shall comply
         with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any
         governmental body which may be applicable to the operations of
         Licensee contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, as

                   WHEREAS, the Company has been licensed by Tommy
         Hilfiger Licensing, Inc. ("THLI"), a Delaware corporation, to
         use the Marks.  THLI is the owner of all rights, title and
         interests in and to the Trademarks.

                   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual
         covenants herein contained, the parties hereby agree as
         follows:

                   1.  THE PRODUCTS.  Company and THLI have created
         certain designs and patterns from which the Manufacturer will
         create three dimensional samples.  The Company shall advise the
         Manufacturer if the samples meet the Company's quality
         requirement within twenty-one (21) days of receipt.  The
         Manufacturer shall make any modifications to the samples as
         required by the Company.  Samples accepted by the Company shall
         be designated as prototypes for the purposes of this Agreement.

                   2.  TERM.

                   (a)  The term of this Agreement shall be for ____
         (__) year(s) commencing on the ____ day of __________, 1996 and

                                    EXHIBIT D<PAGE>







                   (b)  In the event that the Manufacturer shall have
         faithfully performed each and every obligation of this
         Agreement during the Term referred to in Article 2(a) above,
         then this Agreement shall automatically renew from month to
         month commencing immediately upon expiration of the term,
         unless either party has given the other thirty (30) days
         written notice of its intention to terminate the Agreement.

                   3.  MANUFACTURE.

                   (a)  Manufacturer shall only produce the specific
         number of products as requested by the Company and at no time
         shall produce excess goods or overruns.  Manufacturer shall not
         sell any products bearing the Trademarks to any third parties
         without the express written consent of the Company.

                   (b)  Manufacturer shall manufacture the Products and
         Packaging to conform in quality and specifications to the
         prototypes as defined in Article 1 above and as outlined in the
         Quality Assurance Manual developed by the Company.

                   (c) All Products and Packaging manufactured by
         Manufacturer shall be delivered to locations specified by the
         Company or directly to the Company, whichever the Company may
         direct.

                   (d)  Manufacturer shall not enter into any agreement
         with any third party for the manufacture of the Products
         without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent
         may be withheld in the Company's sole discretion.  In order to
         maintain the Company's high standard of quality control and to
         insure that appropriate  measures are taken against
         counterfeiting, the Manufacturer will advise the Company of the
         following information prior to obtaining the Company's written
         consent:  (i) name and address of each proposed manufacturer;
         (ii) type and style of the Products to be manufactured; (iii)
         quantity of the Products to be manufactured; and (iv) any other
         relevant information.  The Manufacturer will also obtain the
         signature of an authorized representative from each  third
         party manufacturer approved by the Company on an agreement, in
         a form substantially similar to this Agreement, designated to
         protect the THLI's rights in the Trademarks.  The Manufacturer
         acknowledges that it shall remain primarily liable and
         completely obligated under all of the provisions of this
         Agreement in respect of such subcontracting arrangement.

                   (e)  Manufacturer shall adhere to all federal, state
         and local laws which pertain to the manufacture of clothing and
         apparel, including the Flammable Fabrics Act, as amended, and
         regulations thereunder and Manufacturer guarantees, that with
         regard to all products, fabrics or related materials used for
         the manufacture of the Products, which are to be sold by the
         Company for which flammability standards have been issued,
         amended or continued in effect under the Flammable Fabrics Act,
         as amended, reasonable and representative tests, as prescribed
         by the Consumer Product Safety Commission have been performed
         which show that the Products at the time of their shipment or
         delivery conform to the above-referenced flammability standards
         as are applicable.

                   4.  INSPECTION.

                   (a)  Company shall have the right to send any
         representative or agent to inspect Manufacturer's premises or
         its subcontractors' premises to the extent the Manufacturer may
         have subcontractors as provided in 3(c) above.

                   (b)  Such rights of inspection shall include the
         right to inspect, test, and take samples of the Products,
         whether finished or semi-finished, at any time during the
         manufacturing process.

                   (c)  Company shall have the right to reject any
         Products or Packaging as not meeting the standards described in
         Article 1 above.

                   (d)  Manufacturer shall not have the right to sell or
         otherwise distribute any rejected Products or Packaging.  All
         such products shall be destroyed according to methods and
         procedures provided by the Company.

                   5.  NOTICES.

                   (a)  Manufacturer warrants and represents that the
         Trademarks will appear on all of the Products in the manner set
         forth in the attached Exhibit A.  The Trademarks shall appear
         on the Packaging in the form shown in Exhibit A.

                   (b)  No other trademarks or notices shall appear on
         Products or Packaging without the Company's prior written
         consent in each instance.

                   6.  USE OF TRADEMARKS.

                   (a)  Manufacturer shall not at any time use, promote,
         advertise, display or otherwise commercialize the Trademarks or
         any material utilizing or reproducing the Trademarks in a
         manner that will adversely affect any rights of ownership of
         the Company therein or in a manner that would derogate or
         detract from its repute.  Manufacturer shall not use the
         Trademarks, in any manner whatsoever (including, without
         limitation, for advertising, promotion and publicity purposes),
         without obtaining the prior written approval of the Company.

                   (b)  The Trademarks shall be used in the form as
         shown in attached Exhibit A.

                   (c)  The Company assumes no liability to Manufacturer
         or third parties with respect to Manufacturer's use of the
         Trademarks other than in strict conformity with the
         specifications set forth in this Agreement.

                   (d)  Manufacturer's use of the Trademarks on the
         Products and/or Packaging shall 


                                    EXHIBIT D<PAGE>







         inure to the benefit of the Company. Manufacturer shall take
         any and all steps required by the Company and the law to
         perfect the Company's rights therein.

                   7.  PROPERTY OF OWNER.

                   (a)  Manufacturer recognizes the great value of the
         goodwill associated with the Trademarks and the identification
         of the Products with the Trademarks and acknowledges that the
         Trademarks and all rights therein and goodwill pertaining
         thereto belong exclusively to the Company.  Manufacturer
         further recognizes and acknowledges that a breach by
         Manufacturer of any of its covenants, agreements or other
         undertakings hereunder will cause the Company irreparable
         damage, which cannot be adequately remedied in damages in an
         action at law, and may, in addition thereto, constitute an
         infringement of the Company's rights in the Trademarks, thereby
         entitling the Company to equitable remedies, costs and
         reasonable attorney's fees.

                   (b)  To the extent any rights in and to the
         Trademarks are deemed to accrue to Manufacturer, Manufacturer
         hereby assigns any and all such rights, at such time as they
         may be deemed to accrue, including the related goodwill, to the
         Company.

                   (c)  Manufacturer shall (i) never challenge the
         validity or the Company's ownership of the Trademarks or any
         application for registration thereof, or any trademark
         registration thereof and (ii) never contest the fact that
         Manufacturer's rights under this Agreement are solely those of
         a manufacturer and terminate upon expiration or termination of
         this Agreement.  Manufacturer shall, at any time, whether
         during or after the term of the Agreement, execute any
         documents reasonably requested by the Company to confirm the
         Company's ownership rights.  All rights in the Trademarks other
         than those specifically granted herein are reserved by the
         Company for its own use and benefit.

                   (d)  Without limiting the generality of any other
         provision of this Agreement, Manufacturer shall not (i) use the
         Trademarks, in whole or in part, as a corporate or trade name
         or (ii) join any name or names with the Trademarks so as to
         form a new trademark.  Manufacturer agrees not to register, or
         attempt to register, the Trademarks in its own name or any
         other name, anywhere in the world.

                   (e)  All provisions of this Article shall survive the
         expiration or termination of this Agreement.

                   8.  TRADEMARK PROTECTION.

                   (a)  In the event that Manufacturer learns of any
         infringement or imitation of the Trademarks or of any use by
         any person or entity of a trademark similar to the Trademarks,
         it shall promptly notify the Company.  The Company thereupon
         shall take such action as it deems advisable for the protection
         of its rights in and to the Trademark and, if requested to do
         so by the Company, Manufacturer shall cooperate with the
         Company in all respects.  In no event, however, shall the
         Company be required to take any action if it deems it
         inadvisable to do so.


                                    EXHIBIT D<PAGE>







                   (b)  Company shall have the right to defend, at its
         cost and expense, and with counsel of its own choice, any
         action or proceeding brought against Manufacturer for alleged
         trademark infringement arising out of Manufacturer's use of the
         Trademarks in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

                   (c)  Manufacturer shall cooperate with the Company in
         the execution, filing and prosecution of any trademark,
         copyright or design patent applications that the Company may
         desire to file and for that purpose Manufacturer shall supply
         to the Company from time to time such samples as may be
         reasonably required.

                   (d)  All provisions of this Article shall survive the
         expiration or termination of this Agreement.

                   9.  TRANSSHIPMENT.  Manufacturer hereby acknowledges
         the Company's strict policy against transshipment of the
         Products.  Transshipment includes any products sewn or
         otherwise manufactured in one country and then shipped to the
         United States with a second company's "country of origin"
         labels and export licenses to avoid adverse trade restrictions
         and import quotas.  Transshipment can involve both the raw
         materials used to manufacture the Products and the finished
         Products.  The Manufacturer further acknowledges that
         transshipment in any form violates U.S. federal law and the
         Company reserves the right to immediately terminate this
         agreement according to the terms contained herein, upon receipt
         of proof of transshipment of the Products by the Manufacturer.  

                   10.  SECONDS, THIRDS OR EXCESS GOODS.  Manufacturer
         shall not have the right to sell any Products or Packaging
         which are determined to be seconds, thirds or are in excess of
         the amount of the products requested by the Company.  All
         seconds or excess products, including trims, shall be purchased
         by the Company at the reasonable fair market price.
         Manufacturer shall not have the right to sell any thirds, which
         shall be destroyed by Manufacturer, who shall supply a
         Certificate of Destruction to the Company.  The Company shall
         have the right to inspect any seconds or excess products to
         ensure that they comply with the terms of this Agreement.

                   11.  STOLEN GOODS OR DAMAGED GOODS.  Manufacturer
         will provide the Company with immediate notice of any stolen
         Products or damaged Products including Products that are in
         production.  With regard to damaged Products (i.e., Thirds),
         Manufacturer shall not have the right to sell any damaged
         Products and all damaged Products (i.e., Thirds) will be
         destroyed by the Manufacturer.  With regard to stolen Products,
         Manufacturer shall cooperate with the Company with respect to
         any action regarding the stolen Products.

                   12.  DESIGN OWNERSHIP.  All rights, including without
         limitation, copyright, trade secret and design patent, to
         designs for the Products including, without limitation,
         artwork, prints patterns, package designs, labels advertising
         or promotional materials or any other designs using or used on
         or affixed thereto, and to any package design, bearing the
         Trademarks shall be the property of the Company.  All Products
         manufactured from designs submitted by Manufacturer and
         approved by the 


                                    EXHIBIT D<PAGE>







         Company, shall bear the Trademarks.

                   13.  CONFIDENTIALITY.  During the term of this
         Agreement and thereafter, each party shall keep strictly secret
         and confidential any and all information acquired from the
         other party hereto or its designee and shall take all necessary
         precautions to prevent unauthorized disclosure of such
         information.  The Manufacturer acknowledges that it will
         receive from the Company prints, designs, ideas, sketches, and
         other materials which the Company intends to use on or in
         connection with lines of merchandise which have not yet been
         put into the channels of distribution.  The parties recognize
         that these materials are valuable property of the Company.  The
         Manufacturer acknowledges the need to preserve the
         confidentiality and secrecy of these materials and agrees to
         take all necessary steps to ensure that use by it or by its
         employees and/or agents will in all respects preserve such
         confidentiality and secrecy.  The Manufacturer shall take all
         reasonable precautions to protect the secrecy of the materials,
         samples, and designs prior to their commercial distribution or
         the showing of samples for sale, and shall not manufacture any
         merchandise employing or adapted from any of said designs
         except for the Company or its affiliates or designees.

              14.  FORCE MAJEURE.

                   (a)  No failure or omission by either of the parties
         to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement shall be
         deemed a breach of this Agreement if such failure or omission
         is the result of acts of God, war, riot, accidents, compliance
         with any action or restriction of any government or agency
         thereof, strikes or labor disputes, inability to obtain
         suitable raw materials, fuel, power or transportation, or any
         other factor or circumstance beyond the control of the party,
         which is not attributable to the negligence of such party.

                   (b)  Any suspension of performance by reason of this
         Article shall be limited to the period during which such cause
         of failure exists, but such suspension shall not affect the
         running of the term of this Agreement.  However, if the
         suspension of performance by reason of this Article exceeds six
         months, either party may give written notice of termination of
         this Agreement.

                   15.  MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS.

                   Manufacturer warrants and represents that:

                   (a)  It has and will have throughout the Term of this

         and deliver, and to perform fully and in accordance with all of
         the terms of, this Agreement.

                   (b)  The entering of this Agreement by Manufacturer
         does not violate any agreements, rights or obligations existing
         between Manufacturer and any other person, entity, or
         corporation.

                   (c)  It is not engaged in and will not engage in any
         activities which are in violation of 


                                    EXHIBIT D<PAGE>







         any applicable Domestic, Foreign or International Laws, Rules
         or Regulations, including without limitation Laws, Rules or
         Regulations governing labor, the environment, the sale of
         goods, U.S. Customs Laws or illegal transshipment.  The Company
         maintains a policy against engaging in any illegal activities
         and will not buy or sell products provided throughout the use
         of any unlawful or unethical practices.

                   16.  THE COMPANY'S WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS.

                   Company warrants and represents that:

                   (a)  It has, and will have throughout the Term of

                   (b)  The entering of this Agreement by the Company
         does not violate any agreements, rights or obligations existing
         between the Company and any other person, entity, or
         corporation.

                   17.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.

                   (a)  Company hereby indemnifies Manufacturer and
         shall hold it harmless from any loss, liability, damage, cost
         or expense (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of
         any claims or suits which may be brought against Manufacturer
         by reason of the breach by the Company of the warranties or
         representations as set forth in Article 16, provided that
         Manufacturer gives prompt written notice, and full cooperation
         and assistance to the Company relative to any such claim or
         suit, and that the Company shall have the option to undertake
         and conduct the defense of any suit so brought.  The
         Manufacturer shall cooperate fully in all respects with the
         Company in the conduct and defense of said suit and/or
         proceedings.

                   (b)  Manufacturer indemnifies and agrees to hold the
         Company harmless from any loss, liability, damage, cost or
         expense (including reasonable attorneys fees), arising out of
         (i) any claims or suits by reason of any unauthorized use by
         Manufacturer in connection with the Products or the Trademarks
         covered by this Agreement; (ii) Manufacturer's non-compliance
         with any applicable federal, state, or local law or with any
         other applicable governmental regulations; and (iii) any
         alleged defects and or inherent dangers in Products or use
         thereof.

                   18.  TERMINATION.

                   (a)  Company shall have the right to terminate this
         Agreement, if Manufacturer breaches any of its obligations
         under this Agreement or such other occurrences as outlined
         below.

                   (i)    If any governmental agency or other body or
                   office or official vested with 


                                         EXHIBIT D<PAGE>







                   appropriate authority finds that the Products are 
                   harmful or defective in any way, manner or form,
                   or are being sold or distributed in contravention of
                   applicable laws and regulations or in a manner likely
                   to cause harm; or

                   (ii)   If Manufacturer manufactures the Products
                   without the prior written approval of the Company as
                   provided herein or in direct contradiction to the
                   Purchase Order; or

                   (iii)  If Manufacturer is unable to pay its debts
                   when due, or makes any assignment for the benefit of
                   creditors, or files any petition under the bankruptcy
                   or insolvency laws of any jurisdiction, country or
                   place, or has or suffers a receiver or trustee to be
                   appointed for its business or property, or is
                   adjudicated a bankrupt or an insolvent; or

                   (iv)   If Manufacturer fails to make timely delivery
                   of the Products.

                   (b)  In the event any of these defaults occur, the
         Company shall give notice of termination in writing to
         Manufacturer by certified mail.  The Manufacturer shall have
         ten (10) days from the date of giving notice in which to
         correct any of these defaults or at the Owner's sole
         discretion, Manufacturer may be given additional time to
         correct such defaults and failing such, this Agreement shall
         thereupon immediately terminate.

                   19.  ACTS UPON EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION AT THIS
         AGREEMENT.

                   (a)  Upon and after the expiration or termination of
         this Agreement, Manufacturer agrees not to make reference in
         its advertising or its business materials as having been
         formerly associated with the Company or the Trademarks.

                   (b)  Upon and after the expiration or termination of
         this Agreement, all rights granted to Manufacturer hereunder
         shall forthwith revert to the Company, who shall be free to
         transfer any and all rights to others to use the Trademarks in
         connection with the manufacture of the Products.

                   (c)  Upon and after the expiration or termination of
         this Agreement, Manufacturer and its Affiliates will refrain
         from further use of the Trademarks or any further reference to
         it, directly or indirectly, or of anything confusingly similar
         thereto, in connection with the manufacture or sale of any
         products.  Additionally, all sketches, patterns, prototypes,
         samples or other materials relating to the Products shall be
         returned by Manufacturer to the Company.

                   (d)  In the event of expiration or termination of
         this Agreement, as herein provided, with the exception of the
         Products which Manufacturer must ship to satisfy any unfilled,
         confirmed orders for the current season it had received prior
         to said expiration or termination, the Company shall have the
         prior right and option to purchase any or all of the Products
         and Packaging Materials, as then in Manufacturer's possession
         or carried on its books of account.  Upon such termination or 


                                    EXHIBIT D<PAGE>







         expiration Manufacturer shall immediately cause physical
         inventories to be taken of (i) Products on hand; (ii) Products
         in the process of manufacture; and (iii) all Packaging
         Materials, which inventories shall be reduced to writing and a
         copy thereof shall be delivered to Company not later than
         fifteen (15) days from such termination or expiration.  Written
         notice of the taking of each inventory shall be given the
         Company at least forty-eight (48) hours prior thereto.  The
         Company shall have the right to be present at such physical
         inventory or to take its own inventory, and to exercise all
         rights it has available with respect to the examination of
         Manufacturer's books and records.  If Manufacturer does not
         allow the Company to take such inventory it shall have no right
         to sell the remaining Products as provided in Article 19(f)
         below.

                   (e)  Manufacturer recognizes that any sale of the
         Products upon termination or expiration, would cause
         irreparable damage to the prestige of the Company and to the
         Trademark, and to the goodwill pertaining thereto.

                   (f)  Upon expiration or termination of this
         Agreement, Manufacturer shall cease the manufacture of
         Products.  All the Products set forth on the inventories
         referred to in subdivision (i) and (ii) of Article 19(f) which
         are not purchased by the Company pursuant to such Article may
         be sold subject to the Company's prior right to approve the
         customers and the terms and conditions of each sale.  Such sale
         shall otherwise be strictly in accordance with the terms,
         covenants and conditions of this Agreement as though the
         Agreement had not expired or terminated.

                   20.  NOTICES.  All notices which either party hereto
         is required or may desire to give shall be given by addressing
         the same to the address hereinafter in this Article, or at such

         ATTENTION:                         ATTENTION:

                   21.  NO PARTNERSHIP, ETC.  This Agreement does not
         constitute and shall not be construed to create a partnership
         or joint venture between the Company and Manufacturer.  Neither
         party shall have any right to obligate or bind the other party
         in any manner whatsoever, and nothing herein contained shall
         give, or is intended to give, any rights of any kind to any
         third persons.

                   22.  NON-ASSIGNABILITY, ETC.  This Agreement shall
         bind and inure to the benefit of the Company and its successors
         and assigns.  This Agreement is personal to Manufacturer, and
         Manufacturer shall not franchise its rights hereunder and
         neither this Agreement nor any of the rights 


                                    EXHIBIT D<PAGE>







         of Manufacturer hereunder shall be sold, transferred or
         assigned by Manufacturer and no rights hereunder shall devolve
         by operation of law or otherwise upon any receiver, liquidator,
         trustee or other party.

                   23.  SEVERABILITY.  If any provision or any portion
         of any provision of this Agreement shall be construed to be
         illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, such shall be deemed
         stricken and deleted from this Agreement to the same extent and
         effect as if never incorporated herein, but all other
         provisions of this Agreement and remaining portion of any
         provision which is not found to be illegal, invalid or
         unenforceable in part shall continue in full force and effect.

                   24.  HEADINGS.  The headings of the Articles of this
         Agreement are for convenience only and shall in no way limit or
         affect the term or conditions of this Agreement.

                   25.  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in
         two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
         original, but all of which together shall constitute one and
         the same instrument.

                   26.  CONSTRUCTION.  This Agreement shall be construed
         in accordance with the laws of the State of New York of the
         United States of America.

                   27.  WAIVER, MODIFICATION, ETC.  No waiver,
         modification or cancellation of any term or condition of this
         Agreement shall be effective unless executed in writing by the
         party charged therewith.  No written waiver shall excuse the
         performance of any acts other than those specifically referred
         to herein.  The fact that the Company has not previously
         insisted upon Manufacturer expressly complying with any
         provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver
         of the Company's future right to require compliance in respect
         thereof and Manufacturer specifically acknowledges and agrees
         that the prior forbearance in respect of any act, term or
         condition shall not prevent the Company from subsequently
         requiring full and complete compliance thereafter.





                                    Continued...





                                    EXHIBIT D<PAGE>

         becomes necessary the Company and Manufacturer consent to the
         jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, including
         all New York Courts and all Federal Courts of the State of New
         York.


                   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have signed
         this Agreement as of the date first written above.
